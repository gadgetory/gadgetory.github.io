you
you
you
you
everybody and good morning welcome to
CNET live brought to you live Italy on
this Tuesday morning from the CNET
studios in San Francisco
my name is Lexi savita's it's so great
to have your company we are gonna be
talking all things Apple for the next I
guess couple of hours we don't really
know how long this event is gonna be but
you're gonna stick with us hopefully and
and get to know everything about the new
iPads the new back books at least that's
what we're expecting anyway but there's
so much to talk about so many rumors to
jump into before we get started I want
to introduce the wonderful panel I have
the CNET live crew coming to you live
here from San Francisco are we awake
Patrick Holland yeah and awake oh good
oh well that was a very dramatic tent I
love it I did that's not coffee in that
turn I can't act okay now next up we
have Vanessa hand
Oriana
it's very early it is well it was 6 a.m.
it's 6:30 a.m. on the west coast it is
9:30 on the East Coast and that is where
the event is happening but also Stephen
btrim the man with a magic present and
coming to us live from LA ashley is
together
I know not enough coffee in the world
that's what I say uh well we're gonna be
coming to you very shortly Ashley and if
you have questions about what we're
gonna see today at the Apple event you
can tweet us on the hashtag
CNET live and we will also have a little
bit of a fun game that we can play along
too I'll tell you about that in a little
bit but first up let's cross live to the
exterior of the Brooklyn Academy of
Music this is a live shot this is coming
to you from Brooklyn so the event is
about 30 minutes from now it is
happening and like a different event
from Apple's usual West Coast Fair this
is the Brooklyn Academy of Music the
Howard Gilman Opera House sounds very
fun little bit of the of the Apple
events in San Francisco that were held
that the kids called the Brooklyn
Academy music BAM whatever is actually
the second event that Apple has held
outside of the I guess the West Coast
this year Chicago was the first one the
ipad event earlier in March
Midwest Lexie Midwest Midwest and well
is not Chicago's okay I mean I'm like
I'm not American but I think my
geography says that it's not you would
be totally right there oh yeah well
there we go so that is the live shot of
xt
area and we have our scenic crew inside
the Brooklyn Academy of Music the event
is kicking off as I said 30 minutes from
now or just under 26 minutes to be exact
and we will be talking all throughout
the livestream just a little bit of
housekeeping though we are not allowed
to restream the livestream from Apple so
no one is actually allowed to so anyone
saying they can is not doing the right
thing so we're gonna be talking all the
way through it we are gonna have the
live blog which is traditionally a
couple minutes faster if not you know at
least a minute or so faster than the
actual live stream itself don't send
them away no but we're gonna be talking
through it and I want to suggest that if
you're watching it alongside with us
keep us open in one window open the
official apple stream in the other and
in will keep you company because I'm
sure there's gonna be bits of it it's
just gonna be like I'm gonna swap back
and see what we're talking about cuz
we're gonna be so much more fun ladies
that sounds like a great protip hashtag
also you we can even narrate as they go
along
in the Australian accent can you like
pretend to be Donnie I for us and just
give us that gist is English the spike
of traffic this year I think it was only
a month ago I guess it was September
wasn't it I don't know where this year
is going it's going pretty fast so
anyway like that event earlier this year
we know a lot about what to expect today
there are a lot of rumors flying around
and we know iPads MacBooks but there
might be some other surprises in store
so I had a little bit of a game that I
wanted to play and you can definitely
play along with us so if you go to the
you are
that is I don't know if we can pull it
up on screen Beit Shean but it's a tiny
dot c c /c net scorecard so that is
where you can download this very
sophisticated image that i made very
sophisticated
indeed i think i should have been a
graphic designer in another life don't
you think yes no so you can download
this image from from tiny dot c c /c net
school card and then we are gonna go
through well vanessa is actually gonna
go through seeing as she is our apple
expert from the apple core she's gonna
run through some of the top rumors and
we're all gonna fill in the scorecard
before the event starts and then we're
not allowed to touch it and then when
the keynote ends we're gonna come back
and we're gonna see how many we actually
got right and how many we we didn't get
so right so if you want to fill it in
with us please have a long to that URL
print it off or you can be old school
and well not really old school new
school actually and write it in a Word
document whatever you want to do Oh
anyway sorry I have a question could I
just use a piece of paper that is not
downloaded I think that's a good or
early morning I don't want to download
and hook up my printer miss Lexi I'm
sorry about that anyway so this is the
school cut anyway so we're gonna all
fill it out and we're all going to get
Vanessa to run through the top rumors
Ashley in LA have you got a score card
are you ready to play along because I
want it I want to see your predictions
here too so I have a few predictions
obviously I did not print out a score
card because what our printers touche
crying right now actually it made LexA
cry like I actually feel the same way as
one of our first tweets if we want to
pull that up because I'm like pretty
excited about it's from Sahil
and he says when's the event and are we
finally talking bezel-less ipads and for
me that's not in the name of the game
right like well I want my
I want my edge-to-edge iPhone 10s esque
iPad so that's that's what I want is it
gonna be the iPad 10 are they just gonna
go with the X I don't know but I really
want that nice OLED iPad that's that's
what I'm looking forward to oh I love it
okay well let's let's keep tabs on that
so Ashley is thinking the iPad X or
variant because she wants the bezel the
screen it's coming in on the tweets too
but Vanessa let's go through some of the
top rumors and um we're gonna write down
exactly what we want
I mean I know exactly what I want number
one on my list because I say it every
single year it is a MacBook Air with
Retina but I could have to decide what
size screen it's gonna be anyway run
through the rumors ladies and gentlemen
here are your options number one I'm
actually gonna go through the rumors
from probably most likely to least
likely so I'm kind of giving you a hint
over here not that I know what's gonna
be announced today but the number one
rumor and Ashley already mentioned this
is the iPad there have been multiple
leaks including a couple in the actual
code of iOS 12.1 that show that little
icon with no bezels that bezel is iPad
as Ashley mentioned no home button the
downside of this is that it could
potentially be an liquid LCD Retina like
what we saw on the iPhone 10 R so that's
kind of TBD I'm hoping it's an OLED like
Alice really said could there be like a
deal with the iPhone where there's like
the O LED one imeem maybe they'll save
the the OLED for the twelve point nine
inch because there's two versions coming
according to the rumours a twelve point
nine and an eleven inch now these will
probably have similar footprints to the
existing ones except for the twelve
point nine and will actually be smaller
than the existing twelve point nine
because of that bezel is screen
obviously so the other rumor about this
which could a lot of fans know headphone
jack guys I don't kill the messenger T's
you know everything well I don't know
everything
well I had I do
so those are those are the rumors for
the iPad I'm so thinking that's gonna
happen so OLED screens are expensive I'm
doing yeah sure a 12 inch like that I
think that on its own is gonna kill that
I think it it can't be yeah OLED
production like go down in terms of cost
significantly unless we're talking about
a two thousand dollar iPad well I mean
in that case it would be iPad pro
brought to you by Samsung OLED screen
you know because you know Apple doesn't
make that OLED screen so that's that's
TBD but the other thing that might be a
redeeming quality I don't know it
depends on how you look at this no not
no not then how is the face ID and
module gonna work in the true depth
camera because I'm magic I'm kidding no
it would cut before it would probably
cut you know at the not so it would have
a slightly thicker bezel and just
wouldn't cut around the not you know
what I'm saying interesting like thicker
than like a knife I can draw it to you
now that I have a pen and paper they
have like a little more real estate
inside yeah that's true I mean I'm
thinking it'll still have a little bit
of a thicker bezel to make room for that
camera and they just avoided the knotch
because if I mean if you're looking at
media which you're probably are on an
iPad it's probably a little bit more
intrusive on an iPad then on an iPhone
well I would think to like the bezels
even if you're going for bezel is want
to have a little something because
otherwise you're gonna be like just
touching the screen all the time hardly
different form factor in an entirely
different use case to how we use our
phones so if there isn't a bezel I mean
there's gonna be so much how do we grab
launching when you don't want I have a K
something together mass hysteria I've
like this monster case on my iPad never
actually touched the screen you know
it's like these big rounded edges it's
like is there gonna be another case or
another keyboard because it seems like
they've always reiterate another version
of the keyboard and that's another rumor
the the keyboard connector might be in a
different spot this time Oh
the keyboard might be like when
vertically be right above the lightning
lightning connector which could also be
a USBC that'd be like yeah like a
old-school like callback because the
original iPad had that crazy keyboard
stand and it would dock vertically yeah
I didn't know that I wasn't alive back
then Patrick we have the iPad what do
you think about lightning cable versus
USB see though just before my home I
really quickly like well this is a tough
one I think I know Patrick is bursting
one second if they go you if Apple goes
USB see then that's kind of a sign that
the Lightning is dead and going low and
right okay there's a whole thing called
an iPhone no I think what it means is
this maybe for an iPad to have us PC is
now just pushing it more towards it
being considered like on the level the
laptop you know and have that
connectivity so I think that's it I
think it's less about killing the
lightning permanently and more that's
about it on the iPad allowing more
functionality like you what a computer
like you would have microservice like so
many times that people have been going
oh maybe maybe iOS and Mac OS are gonna
come closer together that's not gonna
happen I think yes we've seen yet well
yet yeah they have hinted at it it's
just not like I don't know oh no no but
I mean that you'd be laying the
foundation for that and
you know you started on the iPad and
think about how technology that comes
from the iPad works the iPhone and the
iPhone works the iPad so I think that's
there it's not to say the Lightning will
always be on the phone but I think right
now you're not gonna see that lightning
going anywhere on the phone but on the
iPad and every year we we get into this
discussion does the I can the iPad
replace a laptop computer and the answer
so far has been no and maybe as you
mentioned the the USB CD plus dung-geul
dung-geul dung-geul dung-geul dung-geul
sorry I'm in this tablet an actual laser
I will just close publicly and I'm not
embarrassed but I've been living off an
iPad for about three knife years as my
main Drive I know mental music for a lot
of people there it is there's still that
gap between it being something that can
be your main computer your main your
main use whether for consuming things
for typing for all that and I think
having that connectivity is great and
who is one of the companies behind the
USB C standard I don't know tell us a
lot to explore here on the iPad let's
move on to the next yeah we next product
let's go through quickly because I also
wanted all right fine back to the C net
live hashtag for the questions so
Ashley's gonna fill us in on that in a
minute so I'll just give a brief rundown
note that the next as you mentioned Lexi
this is gonna be hopefully the year
where you finally get your MacBook Air
and whether or not it's called
a MacBook Air sequel we're not sure
about that it is gonna be it is rumored
to be a cheaper MacBook with a 13 inch
or 12 inch display we're not sure about
that and pretty much gonna look like the
new form factor of all the different all
the new MacBooks
so just slimmer bezels potentially that
touch ID support and Retina screen time
the downside is it may cost
not 999 dollars but but also that might
be like maybe 900 is the base level in
the 1200 is the higher level of which
case you jump up to that MacBook I have
the feeling just because it's been so
many years since the original iPad I
sorry ah MacBook Air launch that I have
the feeling that it's gonna be very hard
for them to put the price point at the
same level as four years ago so or
however many years ago I mean I'm too
young to remember
no MacBook Air when it launched it was
like and then it came down significantly
but also the design never really changed
substantially so the cost of production
came down to and the other thing is ok
if there is this MacBook Air which I am
so hopeful for because that is the you
know the unicorn right the MacBook Air
with a ret Retina screen do you think
it's just one USB see on it or do you
think they'll put two you're like
begging for they play with like the
iPhone 10 hour color stuff - right do
you think we'd do something like that
yeah I'm here guys boring color like I
went exciting and predictable Android
gold no because did you see the gold the
original gold MacBook in a form factor
when that came out a couple years ago
didn't really do it for me drop color
Lexie Lexi's holding out for the coral I
hear she's a real fan of the coral
anyway I decided my list of - so Mac
Mini is also rumored to make it to show
up at this event upgraded storage
upgraded processor more expensive also
the rumor
so that's another bummer so that those
three are the ones that are most heavily
rumored at this point now I'm gonna keep
going but as I go down the list just
know that these are less and less likely
so the next one that's really cool it's
been so long and it's the original ass
we have a monitor you have a keyboard
plug it in so even if it is slightly
more expensive but had like say like the
15-inch MacBook Pro internals the
MacBook Pro internals I think that would
be so sweet even if it was like 1213 or
dollars whoa whoa Pat hey I'm just
saying because I'm getting in and I can
plug it into my monitor I can plug into
my keyboard or use bluetooth and I'm off
and that would have them that would be
sweet I mean maybe like $8.99 oh of
course
okay I'm gonna go yeah I mean the
current Mac Mini is what $4.99 is not
being upgraded II know why many many
many many many many many years okay so
all right those are that I want to cross
quickly to Ashley in LA cuz she's gonna
own the seen it live on the Twitter's
and there are a couple questions I'm
sure that have come through Ashley what
is uh what else is happening on seeing
it live where's her audio there's Tommy
from from Twitter says sweet an Apple
event today plus C net live show what's
even more awesome is the amazing vane
had absolutely fantastic Lex Ian great
trick Holland are hosting today what a
beautiful team the show later today
really excited so thanks that was just
really nice and I felt like we needed it
to you know really just love it need a
nice compliment to start kick off the
day and then as you guys were talking
about iPads we had a tweet from Hamza
and Hamza says I have an iPad third gen
so I might upgrade if the new iPads are
good and I think a lot of people are in
that position right like there are a lot
of folks out there with kind of older
iPads or you know because you don't
upgrade your iPad the way you would an
iPhone so I think a lot of people are
really kind of eyeballing those new
iPads and hoping that they are good
that's a great point because I think a
lot of people with iPads it's like a
device that you don't necessarily need
to upgrade constant up great constantly
like you have enough iOS 12 updates
coming through to keep it fresh
or at least the interface and some of
the functionality but when it comes to
the actual hardware it's like unless you
are mr. Patrick Olin who's using it as
your main grunt machine you don't need
that much extra I guess hardware
capacity in terms of like the processor
at least that's what I'm thinking
because most people tablets are a
Leanback experience and something that
they can use to complement you know
their main daily driver which is the
phone or even the laptop it's not the
primary machine so the incentive to
upgrade is a lot lower so I think a lot
of people are coming from like those
third generations even the first
generation iPad I'm pretty sure mines
four years old it's like the first no I
think I have this maybe the first or
second gen though but it stopped
upgrading that's the only problem
oh yeah yeah while I upgrades but
definitely definitely a good year to
upgrade this would this would be the
year should we keep going now so we can
finish our little list but so we
mentioned Mac Mini and then there's
another potential for new iMacs as well
this is a potential iMacs the other
product that were maybe gonna see this
event but I don't think it's gonna that
likely is a cheaper home pod that's been
a rumored as well to compete with the
with the Google home Mini and the Amazon
echo dot would it be called like the
home pod mate or company and they might
a-10s the instead of - the sorry instead
of Mac's it could be the home pod - I
know I definitely yeah we all do let's
cross live we have Scott Stein live on
the phone he is in the Brooklyn Music
Center I forgot the official name of it
i man damn right Brooklyn Academy of
Music oh it's dark and moody what's
what's going on in the dock and Mooney
BAM I consider next to me very nice
the the venue looks very very formal it
is like a concert hall inside but you
haven't been living around here maybe
you didn't but I hope they've this like
show a Robert Wilson play as opposed to
an Apple event so Scott just quickly
we've been running down a lot of the
we've been running down a lot of the
rumors but on your wish list what's the
top what's the top thing that you're
looking for today for the iPad to figure
out what it's going to be and maybe
that's something that I don't want it to
be but maybe something other people do
the iPad pro debuting alongside new Macs
is it something that's going to feel a
little more surface like a little more
Chromebook like where are they gonna
keep leaning towards it as a super art
tool and and all that stuff are they
gonna have a new type of keep it's gonna
run software that subtitles more it's
gonna feel more like an accessory we're
in a dips a little option to the Mac I
mean also a short retina MacBook Air I
would argue that maybe that already
exists but maybe we're gonna see it in a
different variation different price you
know I think I think to me sure there
are a lot of Mac's I'm speaking like
that size right here
but I would say that it's the difference
between the Mac and iPads
that's the part that I want to see
resolved or discussed
sounds good and just quickly one of the
what is the over end on the air pods to
because I want to see that photo of you
done with the second version of the
airport's I want to see that photo again
I mean new ear pods that this event
would seem pretty random to me
there's a story between Max and iPads
and creation and stuff and err poxy more
of a mobile story but you never know I
would still feel like that would come
out obv alongside a phone or a watch but
you just never know there's a wild card
but I'll tell you rather see a bunch of
interesting and useful iPad accessories
than air pods - all right it sounds good
I think there's about four minutes to go
before the events starts in this so I'll
leave you to it thank you so much for
calling in Scott I hope you enjoy the
event and you get that wild card that
you're hoping for I'm crossing my
fingers for you all right that is Scott
Steiner nning us live from the Brooklyn
Academy of Music signing off
that's Apple event around this time a
tweet went up by a certain CEO do you
think we're seeing shenanigans all
scrambling because Tim Cook guest pool
to the wool over our eyes and tweeted
what was something like no I don't have
it or something get here it was a prank
to do with the opening keynote I didn't
think something like that's gonna happen
again is it probably nothing I can do
the same thing with anyway so Scott
mentioned a couple of the other rumors
which was there were and you mentioned
Alexa the air pod a sequel so I don't
think we were getting a sequel but there
could be that Airport wireless charging
case that we were teased about a year
and a half ago so I'm personally hoping
for that Airport wireless charging case
but of course alongside that would only
make sense if they launch that
mysterious air power mat that has since
disappeared I and I left it at the very
end because again I'm not very hopeful
it's so sad because I think a lot of
people were hoping to get rid of so many
cables and be able to charge 3d devices
at the same time so the air pod charging
case and that power mat I think are the
last two - and
and sorry and I forgot the Apple pencil
that's probably like he said like Scott
said it's very likely that they launched
a new Apple pencil alongside the new
iPads so that's your room what if they
okay so if they have these iPads you're
good to want to have a smart case and
what if they just built the wireless
charging pad into the smart case it's
really dark for Patrick I think it's
also really interesting to me that if
they do an update to that what that
would be like or if there would be in a
different model the Apple pencil we have
a lot to talk about I think we do want
to talk about it in a second but this is
my school card so far and you can say
that applets too is there it's not gonna
happen I know yeah I know it's not gonna
happen
so I'm talking about hopefully I know
I'm going MacBook Air written a 12 news
13
you should have added the price right
there just because you're feeling lucky
the reason why I say 12 inches because
of the existing MacBook form factor with
this slimmer MacBook is already the 12
inch I believe so I think that having a
13-inch is probably something they're
gonna keep for the MacBook Pro range
because that's kind of like a form
factor that it's being used there so I'm
going 12 inch I don't know I think I'm
gonna be totally wrong but that's that's
half the fun
iPad with an eye the iPhone se design
because that was one of their rumors as
well that it was gonna have those
bezels and like a little bit more of a
rather than that smoother sleek look
it's gonna go back to the iPhone se and
the iPhone 5 or the original iPad oh the
original iPad well the original iPad
wasn't it wasn't the same kind of like
flat edge so I like that I think that
would be good the Mac Mini in the
airport's - what about you guys what's
on your list right I have the MacBook
Air Rudy
I don't know like what it'll be but I
hopefully it will be a new screen or
something like that okay Mac Mini I'm
just hopeful because like that's a great
computer it's been so long
an iPad slim like whether that means
like slim bezels they're not gonna
announce this but if they mention it I
will be happy this dimension of where
that MacPro is that because i think
again we're at an event that we're
talking about lots of creativity is
going on there with the music and
theatre and film and stuff like that so
it's it seemed natural that product your
toward creative something like a Mac Pro
mic might gonna mention especially
through the Mac Mini well that's the
thing in because the Mac Pro I mean we
know from Apple that it's something is
coming in 2019 and it would lovely it
would be lovely to see I guess because
Apple is being criticized for a long
time for not catering to its kind of
core market of like creatives and people
that empower users and so it's sad like
time and time again yes the Mac Pro it's
coming in evolution so maybe I think
you're right a sneak peek of what's to
come however that being said it is 7
a.m. Pacific which is 10 a.m. Eastern
and the event is starting now the Apple
livestream is commenced we are gonna be
talking throughout the livestream we are
not allowed to rebroadcast the stream as
it's happening no one is so I suggest
you keep us open in one tab open up the
Apple livestream in another and we'll be
talking all the way through it will be
going off our live blog which is being
filled in on the ground by Shara Scott
and Dan Ackerman they are all there at
the Brooklyn Academy of Music and pretty
much the live blog is generally like
maybe 30 seconds to a minute faster than
the actual live stream so I highly
recommend you follow along with us there
and keep the Apple official stream open
in another window and you can swap back
and forth as things get you know it's
something that maybe that you're not to
be interested in you come back to us and
you know turn up the volume and listen
to us and then you can dive back in as
you need but we'll keep you updated as
it happens so there's a lot of cheering
now on the stage as Tim Cook is taken to
the stage they've had a little bit of I
guess a attributes to New York in the
opening keynote video and the cheering
is still going on as a lot of what is it
what has been happening over the past I
guess couple a couple of months apart
from iPhone that Tim Cook's actually
come out and being quite vocal in a lot
of the issues at least on Twitter has
come out and being very vocal about many
of the world events and and things like
that so I guess there's a lot of
cheering there in the crowd but that
also just there there are just worth
noting a lot of Apple employees at these
events
technically they are being celery I mean
as someone who used to work for that
company yes it is like your hands hurt
by the indicator we didn't I also think
like recently had those comments about
again as Apple always leads on privacy
and that and that's always seemed for
some of us it seems like of course we
want that but if that's going to hold
innovation like Siri and other things
back then is there is there a middle
road the Apple takes but it's need to
see Tim Cook especially speaking out on
privacy and maybe in lieu in light of
Facebook yes and companies that have had
privacy snafus this year I'm sorry he's
starting off by it the Mac the Mac is
the first first cab off the rank as they
say the Mac was the first computer
design for creativity and it's become
one of the world's most essential tools
sorry that is been happening right now
on the stage and we're gonna see new
Macs obviously but is it gonna be in the
air is it gonna be or an iMac or a
meteor or my knee all right all right
guys Lexie what are we gonna see right
now we're gonna see a MacBook Air
MacBook Air I don't think it's gonna be
called a MacBook Air I don't um are
though it's such that's than that name
itself means so much better if they
would just throw that no they can't but
on the flip side I also think I mean
we're hopeful that there's some Mac Mini
news so maybe I don't know do you lead
off with the thing people want or do you
kind of tease them with something like I
like little impersonations here I'm not
sure who you're trying to impress that
says meet tired I grew up in the South
Bay beat up my southern accent when it
comes back when I'm tired
can you breathe it I love it I love it
so there's a there's a video playing
about all of people using Mac's so you
know the here's the thing about the
Mac's that I hope that they address is
that the keyboard because obviously
there's been a lot of issues with the
butterfly keyboard yeah and the MacBook
Air doesn't have the butterfly keyboard
it has that classic
traditional keyboard design and keyboard
mechanism so I'm interested to see if if
Apple's gonna address this in any way
they've obviously done a couple of
replacements for faulty butterfly
keyboards that was a couple of months
ago that was announced so are they gonna
stick with the traditional design are
they gonna mention that it's a new and
improved butterfly maybe maybe it's
called a math keyboard wave or the meme
the the the new MacBooks that were not
the MacBook Pros that were notes this
year addressed the problem without
actually addressing the problem because
it's very rare that Apple actually comes
out and says that they that they made a
mistake and so the pneuma they never
addressed the the faulty butterfly
keyboards per se but they did come out
with the new MacBook Pros which had kind
of like a thin lining below the keyboard
I fix it kind of did the teardown and
they discovered this little silicon
lining that would actually prevent the
prob what of the biggest problems which
was that debris was falling between the
keys and making them stick so have you
have either of you experienced anything
with that with a newer Mac I so I've
been using the MacBook Pro with the
touch ba which not all of them good in
fact pretty much we're gonna do a whole
yeah that touch pop but I haven't
experienced any issues yet with a
butterfly keyboard that being said it is
incredibly loud and last Apple of it
when I was in Chicago I was sitting next
to Shara and she was telling me you know
keyboard is so loud you could have been
the only shame all the events to be seen
it was a very valid point
because I mean I'm a lab type but the
butterfly keyboard just exacerbated
that's so much it was so incredibly loud
and I was like I'm sorry but she was
very very nice
about it because she was using an air
and I was like oh I remember that
keyboard it's not as loud memories
we're seeing something yes so there's a
lot of stuff happening now Mac OS is the
soul of the Mac with its beautiful and
easy-to-use interface there are a
hundred million active installed base I
built that must be of Mac OS and over
half of Mac buyers worldwide are new to
Mac so that's 51% globally and 76% in
China and China we know is a huge market
for Apple making big pushers and trying
to make big inroads there Mac OS Mojave
is obviously the latest edition of Mac
OS which was released or at least there
the beta was at WWDC and it's now in
full the full version we have dark mode
I think that's kind of like the
highlight of me to me it's like docks
are the highlight new it was a matter of
time before Patrick went dark and out of
the envelope it was clear things would
never be the same and they haven't and
there it is well I mean this is the
previous I mean I got too excited
because I thought it was the actual I
think it is because you don't see the
little Apple light up and I have a
MacBook Air I'm rocking the old school
macbook air right now and it has a light
up it has a light up Apple so I think
he's still doing or that I remember like
Timbuktu made cases that would be a
manila envelope cases to format the
first MacBook Air yeah yeah we are
seeing that on the screen well I think
that is a manila folder that was the
iconic moment when Steve Jobs pulled it
out I remember that that was that was
pretty class yeah that's like the big
deal in that so there was you know 10
years you'll remember that like see
[Laughter]
okay so the current version is different
but not that different this is from Dan
in the live blog
the basic concept remains the same so I
guess the slim form factor come on show
us it show it show it yeah we still
we're still looking at those large
bezels on the screen that's the old
event right leave the bezels and put a
red in there I think there's still would
be people like oh but I mean people
still buy the the for a five year old
MacBook Air that I'm rocking I mean
there's part there's sounds like the air
might stasis Dan Ackerman so oh I was
wrong and chief from the crowd for the
it's a time for a new MacBook Air
announcement it's back there
XR macbook air max there's a video being
played now so I guess we oh yes yes
I'm incredibly black we have a Retina
display that's all we know right now
he's so much that's only I've been
asking for it Lexi I sold Alexia where's
the Apple slow down somebody can
somebody check to tell me I'm seeing it
live please all the time Betina Betina
colors colors colors colors well cue the
video
I don't know Dan Ackerman saying colors
but oh yes there's colors on the screen
it's kind of wait I'm looking at the
video right now and there's like a silk
fabric over the iPad Air's MacBook Air
that looks blue so I'm wondering if it's
gonna be blue but it looks silver okay
all right so the Shara is saying it
looks like there are two USB sea ports
oh thank you and it has a gold option
for Lexi cuz I know that's your favorite
we can see one of the first official
shots now there are two USB C slots on
this side and there's gonna be anything
else it looks very familiar I will put
it that way because there's nothing I
mean it's kind of what we expected from
the redesigned MacBooks this is a try
this is a tried and tested design
obviously it's it's being you know
widely right very widely received with
critical acclaim for 10 years
it's definitely needs an update and a
refresh it doesn't look as huge of a
refresh as I was expecting but that
being said you know people love the full
package but will they hit that price
point that we talked about earlier we'll
be good at $900 13-inch there's a gold
Lexy loves I think from that render it
looks very similar so same 13-point
13-inch screen size which I'm happy
about and the resolution is sharper for
over 4 million pixels yes yes because I
was gonna go I went to reduce but now
the price point I put $12.99 like you
Lexi so Steven says more I say more I'm
going for less I think it's good $10.99
actually Ashley I want to get you a
point here what what do you think the
price point is we're gonna play a
guessing game of MacBook Air retina 13.3
inch price point Oh
ashle disappeared colors back on the
line
we'll still student still doing our a
betting game if you want to jump on this
CNET live hashtag let us know what you
think the price point is gonna be touch
ID without a touch bars I mean I don't
want to bash the computer likes he's
rocking right now but I think that's
kind of a good move
it's my work computer let's be honest I
the only reason why I liked the touch
bar is the touch ID so advantage of it
and that being said I'm glad hutch ID
doesn't work I'd say it doesn't work so
you're saying the glass is 60% full said
though we do have a work system an
authentication system that might take a
little while to boot up I don't know if
has anything to do with it because I've
only ever used it with my work computer
so maybe in isolation if you just have
you know none of that extra corporate
stuff on it maybe it's totally fine so
we are actually looking at the security
of this MacBook right now and they're
talking about that t2 chip which store
has the secure Enclave they're calling
secure call it and make your own
definitely spending a lot of time
explaining the security for this MacBook
so I think they're definitely playing on
the their edge with the security
features going to Lexi's favorite point
it looks like it's still butterfly yes
well there's always that's an always-on
processor that enables hey Siri no
because I'm telling you the Siri button
on the touch bar is the stupidest
position and it's like are you always
press it and I don't want my MacBook
listening for hey Siri because all of
the other devices that I have that our
Apple related I say hey Siri and they
all respond to one response or the wrong
one responsible none of them
spun I don't want that on the MacBook
take that away that's I mean really I
can I can disable that we moved it like
a different key like this move one end
we have they're not talking about the
trackpad which is larger kind of like
the new MacBooks that's Arion so we
already kind of knew that touch touch ID
or a sorry force touch trackpad that's
20% larger than the existing one so
actually what this is kind of nice lexi
we have that my MacBook Air and your
MacBook Pro to compare before and after
exactly so the big trackpad the 20%
larger area as you said butterfly
mechanism still four times more stable
so there is a reference point that
stable is a nice way of saying it won't
break
well is it is it still loud for Lexi
though new speakers 25% louder the old
air was notorious for not being loud
enough that is true yes so I agree to
that and there are wait how many have
they mentioned how many I think there's
two three names me there's two
Thunderbolt three ports better and the
USB c-shaped
okay so what about the other side I'm
hoping we'll see I mean if there is no
headphone jack it will be very
disappointing for creators and people
that obviously like video editing
anything like yeah that's just it that
would be a big loss just and then you
like to listen to music on headphones
but then that would shuffle a lot of
people to the MacBook Pro range which I
would not be surprised if that what if
they put lightning on there I know they
didn't know okay so here we go we have
the power we have USB all through that
there is Thunderbolt ports and in the
USBC shape and is using eighth
generation Intel processors which was
not a surprise would be I mean I don't
know that's that's just to be expected
at this stage up to 1.5 terabyte SSD
yeah good I like that but imagine the
price on that one it would be $3,000
retina which will be $15.99 Blackmagic
epu we got launched earlier this year
that was amazing that this little
MacBook Air can use that too as Vantage
so if I am a graphics person or a video
person I could plug it in at home get
that done and then take it on the road
and people type which is the dream the
other thing they're mentioning is the
battery life it still has an all-day
battery life but it doesn't seem like it
it's gotten that much better than the
existing iPad I mean max right because
the MacBook Air is still like kind of
like the gold standard for battery life
yeah yeah I did I did want to see a
little bit of more of an improvement on
in this regard just just because but we
always want to eke out a little bit I
think that realistically that is it's a
high priority for consumers it's a lower
priority for the manufacturers just
because they want to try and cram in as
many features and of course that's going
to negate the battery life if you have
that Retina screen right there you're
right you guys because you were seeing
the other side and we do have a point 75
pounds 17 percent less volume than the
existing air so that's I mean my air
already feels really light which I like
compared to other and like to other yeah
MacBooks windows man
sorry Windows laptops it actually is it
but to the fact that it is 17% smaller
or less volume now we're getting closer
to the weight of that MacBook the which
makes it curious to see what if anything
what's gonna happen to that does this
replace that or what's going I would
hard sorry yeah you know that the
MacBook that was supposed to be that
kind of interim between the air and the
MacBook Pro and that what does that drop
in price let's see we don't know what
else is gonna come up next but well the
the and then Dan Ackerman is mentioning
the same thing with the fact that
Windows laptops like the Acer Swift
are already in that range so they're not
definitely not first to get in there
with a smaller footprint but if you are
upgrading from an existing MacBook Air
it will seem like a huge difference now
showing pouring glass pouring the glass
I mean this is - I feel like this is
well I think that's what Ashley back on
the line Entertainment Tonight had to
shoot something in our studio so they
kick them out early and she'll be back
it's like their most random fact and now
they work for on Mac and also sorry guys
the mag said as Dan Ackerman pointed out
the MagSafe
is no more officially away no more no
there ain't that part yeah this this is
this is a kind of a sad moment because
that would you rather MagSafe stay or
headphone jacks
oh no headphone jack yes my pc does MX
if and everything's fine on connects it
knocked everybody trip over it yeah I
mean I'm very glad that they did keep
the name the legacy of that and the
goodwill I think associated with air is
huge and I think if they just got rid of
that by saying the new MacBook I don't
think people would be as excited because
the legacy is that people go oh I know
the MacBook Air I had one of those or I
still have I still my MacBook Air is 11
years old
all right all right
these are all oh my goodness there's
like 13 members Dan Akram in the crowd
he says what the crowd went silent when
when they announced the price yeah
that's because we've become to know that
memory and and you're probably gonna
want to upgrade that yeah I mean that's
not even gonna be with that 1.5 terabyte
yeah and the other thing is then we have
ok so then is that's the price of the
MacBook right now it's the same price
right it's 11 yeah right let's take a
look let me thank check but yes the
point I'm pretty good too it's close
enough that now you're gonna drop that
price for it to because you still don't
have that you don't right now we don't
have that option that's but under $1,000
haven't had that option for a couple
that's the Mac meaning like the MacBook
Air right Mac Mini was what like the old
MacBook Air the 11 inch one was 750
that's right that was a tiny tiny I
always saw people using that no that was
on this way out but it was like you had
two options that were under thousand
well this is a big selling point for me
is it's 100% recycled aluminum I mean
that's a pretty plastic but that is
pretty cool I mean there me and that is
computers out of 100% recycled aluminum
that's that's a big one I mean I'll be
honest I have an option from pro and I
keep coming back to the air because of
the form factor so I would probably be
upgrading if if I could do the one
terabyte how about you I think I could I
would do the air but I did get
Blackmagic EPU so that way I can still
video edit and do that stuff what am i
pad for that's new Mac it's happening
it's happening
and it looks the same it says well it's
a box it was a joke I think no I know I
know but I mean like people hate the
macro design I don't like it either but
at least it's different and at least it
looks like a trash can I'm boobie nice
if this was a little out of the box but
it's not it's it's a box it's literally
box the and I'm the one thing I am a
little bit disappointed in is that we're
not seeing that light up Apple anymore
whether it's on the MacBook Pro sorry
MacBook Air or any of the app other
Apple devices I I kind of liked the
light up Apple and now we're not seeing
anymore it was like except if you're in
a dark room and it was throwback we just
did it how to how to get rid of all
those blinking LED lights you could
sleep all these images to everything's
in the dark there's one light on this
desk
everything's dark Mojave desert things
dark a lot of that does not come from
the original one it was the actually
glow of the LCA the screen would you
have to Apple ID up and now it's just
they have liked behind it so no seemed
like it's an it was nice while it lasted
yeah that's so for core processor sorry
for core six Corp and four core quad
core processor eighth-generation 60%
faster graphics so this is well I mean
faster than the last generation which
was five years ago I mean so everything
that we kind of have predicted which
were it was better processor and more
memory exactly this one goes up to 64
gigabytes of memory which is pretty nice
upgrade 32 to 63 gigabytes of RAM good
for video and audio production Patrick
which has yes my friend she would use it
for pro tools really yes
so all them stack and I think the this
is a product that definitely needed the
refresh and we're getting all the
upgrades that people wanted now same can
be said from the app from the MacBook
Air they're not necessarily super
innovative well I think this is the you
know the Apple I guess murder supper and
it sounds really crazy that I would say
you know it's early in the morning it is
still before 7:30 a.m. Pacific time so
I'm allowed to say
so samehada's i whatever I want in
whatever language I want but I think
this is Apple's like I guess that their
way of going you know we have we have
the products we have the legacy and we
don't necessarily need to go crazy with
these things because you know maybe this
is not quite what consumers are wanting
yet I would beg to differ
so as we were talking leave all storage
is flashed on this
so two terabyte to the last storage up
to Wow pretty amazing I love I love HDMI
and USB a survive sorry guys we went
quiet because we're now taking a look at
the back of this device to see what kind
of ports it's rockin and it's still
rocking a decent amount of ports
Ethernet ports let's see
rid of all the mini that would have been
well they took the ports away from all
the other computers and just put them in
yeah exactly that's true so this is the
one that everybody's gonna get in turn
because nobody wanted to get rid of all
the ports and used on others cheesing do
you think we can get the space great
keyboard and mouse with this cuz that
would be pretty I doubt I don't think so
Patrick but that's nice of you I like
going back to Beechum's whole like dark
mode I think that would be you'd have to
have that they're gonna have to I mean
even look at the servers their servers
are even dark same color oh yeah 8000
Mac minis that was the company hasn't it
has 8000 of them to make apps like candy
crush Wow I think there was a more cost
efficient way to do so what is our
guesses on the price here oh I'm
thinking $8.99 yeah I feel like they can
make like an $8.99 and then you're gonna
jump in yeah maybe even up to 1600 or
something for that we're seeing a $200
price increase for both the MacBook Pro
air and the Mac Mini so I guess with
inflation and things consider it's nice
for the MacBook yes Mac Mini Mac you're
getting a huge upgrade I mean this is
definitely plus we're like higher in
iMac which is amazing for the price I
obviously that $7.99 is gone for the
core i3 it's not the six core one well
ehm you'll be pleased to know that sixty
percent post-consumer recycled
plastic and 100% recycled aluminium
inclusion reduces your carbon footprint
by nearly 50% fantastic remember seven
you can order it today there we go you
can order it today or do today so
pre-order today arriving November 7th in
let's see is the Apple Store down oh it
has been done for a while so what's next
guys are we thinking iPads I think you
gotta go iPad yeah I guess yeah I mean
there can't be an Apple pencil with no
new iPad that would just make no sense
well essentially it's we don't see these
krauser events where it's easily either
Mac or Z the iOS stuff so it's kind of
you know we're gonna jump back to the
iPad after coin about the Mac Mini
when's the last time that happened at
least not for years
yeah I think 2014 I don't even know if
that was in the keynote yeah that was
updated this happened yeah I mean to be
honest I was probably asleep in that
Keeney you weren't born yet okay Oh
updates today at Apple is coming up next
with Angela rents who is ahead of all
the Apple stores and so we can pretty
much mute it for the next five minutes
I'm kidding if you want to but I mean I
guess now maybe this is a good time to
kind of dive back in to take a pee break
guys this is the time as by footer like
the most successful stores retail stores
out there right now which is amazing
yeah well I mean it's not like an Amazon
go store obviously which you can too
what if you could just well people are
already doing that at the Apple stores
no there's been a just a massive amount
of Apple Store thefts in the last in the
last couple it's not funny it's really
serious but but it is just have so many
products on display and it's really
tempting for for thieves to just go in
there and swipe up a bunch of product
because they're all like tracked
products and stuff they're all like
formatted for like in stores stuff so
it's not like you're gonna be able to do
anything with those iPhones you still
are those they sound parts though they
should have a China and stuff that's on
the floor there have been a couple of
heists of actual devices that have been
delivered to the store overnight and
people have kind of got to know where
the trucks are being delivering goods to
and then just taken like a whole payload
like 6000 devices at one time so hashtag
pro tip I'd say there are a couple of
new Apple stores actually I think there
was one in Milan I think Tim Cook was
there last either last week or earlier
in this way yeah you're never gonna go
but we had something in Venice actually
today at Apple yes that's Angeles still
on stage talking about pretty much all
of the classes that are at the Apple
stores Lexy I took one the other day was
pretty cool and we it was really cute I
met this lady this older lady who goes
to the classes every day and takes a new
Apple class and it was really sweet to
see I mean maybe she was paid by Apple
honestly if she knew I was working for
seen it at the time but it was just
because they're free and she would just
show up and then here's somebody a
little bit older who was interested in
learning about the new technology for
Apple and so I think it's a really cool
thing that they do
with these stores opportunity for people
to just come learn watch for free yeah I
say like that was one of my guys I was
like a workshop person so I do you like
these things like how to use your iPhone
something you'd have that your best my
newbies to like people who can you give
me your best like Patrick at Apple
impersonation well not an impersonation
you actually did it so I want to
actually get like just pretend you're
taking you know you're helping out the
Genius Bar oh you're taking you know an
introduction to a class give me your
best kind of I'm Patrick moment I'm
Patrick the dulcet tones of mr. Patrick
Holland introducing the latest product
or way to do something or how to fix iOS
I don't give me something okay here's
the here's the fix to all the problems
if you ever have a broken Apple device
the fix is and when you find a device
and find the power on and off button and
we're gonna turn it off the fob would be
like how many people can't do that okay
half the table great a lot of these
classes too besides basic stuff are also
more geared toward like creative stuff
like photography music one of my
favorite things I can do was like video
editing
I'd say that's where I learned a lot of
it was through Apple and yes stole and
the store because you get trained up and
learned like Final Cut and all that
stuff I was I was like an iMovie baby
iMovie baby yeah who graduated but yeah
I think all that's neat and I love that
aspect of Apple and I hope they still do
it because I think that's a big
differentiator for a lot of companies
you can't go to like the Samsung store
and take Samsung workshops you know yeah
take our GarageBand class if they have
it I mean I think you just need you just
check out the lineup on the store
closest to you and
[Laughter]
maybe there's no iPad how they are they
lowering our expectations actually just
making us more and more interesting
people are gonna drop off this live show
if they don't get to the iPad so I'm
thinking that maybe it's not what as
good as what we're expecting so that
people just kind of drop off as far as I
can tell our news comes up like she not
only her role that Apple but her former
being like the CEO Burberry it's like
you have someone who she's not the CEO
of Apple but all right probably could be
one day you know so it's nice it this is
kind of just like introducing you to an
- I guess a number of the high profile
Apple execs and be like you know Tim
Cook isn't gonna be the CEO forever so
they've got to lay the groundwork for
someone yes it would be lovely if it was
a woman so nice I did it was just
Patrick's way of name dropping over here
so we have I was too specific and I
failed so number one I kind of got that
kind of didn't get seen that live is the
hashtag on Twitter so please join us
tweet along with things that you're
expecting how your scorecards going and
Patrick what have you got on yours well
I'm doing first - I did pretty good on a
third and we're gonna find out and the
fourth one they did not mention I don't
think they mentioned the Mac Pro and
like and we know it's not gonna be a
product and new that just that hey this
is still coming in 2019 so what I wanted
to hear but I don't think that's gonna
happen but maybe iPad slim whatever that
is you know what's great about your list
is that you actually got the order right
so far Steven here's one for you music
lab called advanced beat making with
logic for hope
not like not quite GarageBand but yeah
yeah and I love how Americans say garage
because I just said Garage Band no I can
talk about my recent Apple Store
situation I had to go to meetings I know
it was actually a good a good one I have
an iPhone 6s and as you know the
batteries were having an issue now the
cracked screen has yeah yeah now it's a
cracked screen no but um they were
offering the battery replacement for $29
and I did it I went online I made my
appointment went down there had to wait
for maybe like two or three minutes took
me aside asked me what was wrong
took my phone said come back in an hour
I laughed came back in an hour had my
phone he's that fast 29 bucks boom new
battery you go did you go get a Cinnabon
while you were no I actually I came back
to the office of work yeah I mean the
Apple they have it they have it worked
out the only thing that was accepting
we're actually slowing down your batter
like it slow but it was kind of weird
because the line was cueing down the
stair so we're all standing on the
stairs I was kind of weird we're gonna
make your foot we're gonna slow down
your phone's but we are gonna fix it and
be really nice about it it's time for
the iPad
there we go new jingle brought to you by
remember the first two when the iPad
launched and everybody was in Texas they
launched in a South by Southwest or
something maybe I'm wrong no buzz like
the following yeah yeah and that's when
they went on sale that's what it was I
remember Mollywood buying one but I
think there was that mad TV sketch worth
they had a different name and it was
referring to it maybe a cemetery promise
that was the appropriate terminology oh
maybe they'll be the maxi-pad this year
because they are rockin the max name for
the for the iPhone iPad Mac so that you
can rearrange it to be maxi pad they
sold more iPads in the last year than
the entire notebook lineup from the
biggest notebook manufacturers laptops
more iPads were sold and Windows laptops
where is that I don't know I see more
Chromebooks in schools like elementary
schools and I see iPads because you
haven't gone to Marin I mean I don't
know how many schools have iPads but
anecdotally not enough I think would be
I haven't been to any schools lately
it's been I mean I did just graduate
they are showing a chart has forty four
point two million iPad sales HP oh well
okay so here's the thing so yes they
sold more than but not they sold more
than HP which is according to this chart
that the biggest but it's not more than
all of them combined no HP
Novoa soos acer Samsung etc bundle them
all and that's in like probably close to
like the hundred one hundred and fifty
million whereas iPad was about forty
four point two million my my mathematics
is not great at this time of the morning
but I that's not all I was just reading
with shara/road so no no no I I was just
trying to try to verify this statistic
here yeah let's let's go at all these up
two real quick let's do math that will
keep people guys here it is it's the new
oh you were right about the about the
about the design with a design yes the
se designs for the map and no home
button guys no home button he designed
for the for the sides and yeah no not no
not so face id support no not CH and in
space grey and silver screen silver and
the new Apple pencil or actually they're
showing sorry a new Apple pencil but
we're not sure if it's actually new this
is kind of a knock off the surface
before the old Apple pencil you would
plug into the Lightning port and it
would stole my god like it's the most
ridiculous weapon yes very bad way of
charging so now we're gonna see if it
actually does have a battery in it like
this surface pencil or if it's Hodgins
on your iPad as many times that video
did I yeah you you were right about the
about the throwback to I think I think
the best design in terms of the at least
the iPhone mm-hmm I know a lot of people
agree with me from the 4 to the 5 to the
sae that that edge display and that edge
referred a nice yes exactly that's sort
of that flat edge flat but then they had
the champagne around this for kinda yeah
I kind of want to disagree I'm gonna be
the devil's advocate here and I kind of
don't like it the the fact that they're
reverting back to older designs and I
know that you're you're a fan Lexi but a
nostalgic hey Sam
it just makes it seem old to me it's in
my the only one I don't know like I
think if it was the bigger puzzle having
more to grab on with less screen space
to grab on to do we try exactly the feel
in the hand of those older phones it is
less likely to slip out of your hand
than the new design because I'm clumsy I
know that a heavy tablet is gonna be the
first thing that I'm gonna drop drop
test I'm thinking two drops right here
Apple sorry MacBook Air and iPad what do
you think it's a liquid retina liquid
right now I called it I called it test
you like the commercial oh wait 10.5
could stow it and drop it like so we um
we have an 11 inch iPad with the same
footprint as the previous ten point five
inch iPad so it's going to it's not
gonna feel a lot bigger but the screen
since obviously it goes edge to edge no
not no not so that's that's pretty nice
I so we use it for for sheet music which
oh that's kind of nerdy but no but it's
but that's fantastic for sheet music
because then you can have a huge but at
the same time like you spend so much
money on books and books of sheet music
an you can't yeah look if you're a
keyboard player in 2018 you have an iPad
mounted next year yeah keyboard now
that's how everyone doesn't know so you
you've got a twelve point nine inch and
an eleven inch display for the iPad pro
so and it's actually thinner even though
the the like we were mentioning the edge
is now not rounded but they like flat
it's 25% less ID
so these are these are
similar in size but smaller footprint
now I didn't see the sighted anybody
catch this side-by-side of the twelve
point nine oh here it is is this it
right here yep how much smaller it is
that's actually yeah that's larger than
a sheet of paper like smaller thank you
paper over it you can't because it's
papers that love it yeah that's small
but this one because I know like a lot
of musicians had the twelve point nine
inch just because it was almost the size
of the sheet of paper and you could see
the notes better but this one this one
is actually nice because it's smaller I
mean the footprint is smaller or the
screen it's the same size so that'll be
like the ultimate oh there it is with
the sheet of paper yep
so gestures are obviously gonna be
coming to the iPad that's what kind of
iOS I think here's the thing I think the
gesture based system I mean compare it
to Android PI and Android still is still
incredibly confusing the implementation
of the gestures I think that iOS 12 gets
it a little better and the iPad 10 and
you know 10 s 10 are get it a little
better
I still think though that the biggest
screen is kind of where the gestures are
coming in most handy and I'm really
interested to see if it actually does
translate from what I think should be a
better use case and a better I guess a
better experience and to see if that
actually is the case with the gestures
um so we did say like there's an image
that has kind of like s showing you how
the bezel and the face idea is working
so the 7 megapixel camera please don't
take photos
it doesn't have a camera in the back as
please don't take photos if if you're my
mom and you're Latin you're probably are
continue taking photos with the iPad
like it's honestly say there's a two
things my mom she loves taking pictures
with her iPad it's like more satisfying
to her than taking pictures with her
phone for some reason because she
probably could see it better
so the other thing I wanted to point out
is the other thing that was kind of up
in the air was whether or not
was gonna have a vertical they said the
unlock we're seeing ambient light
sensors on either side of the dot
projector so that makes me think that
its face ID horizontal face ID unlock is
going to be supported I think that was
supported in that wasn't a 12x Bionic X
or 10
is it a 1210 no well now they've messed
it up for us but then they're they're
like totally messing up their marketing
too because then they made a safe ten
sorry the iPhone 10 and then eight core
CPU for performance cores and for
efficiency cores apple-designed fusion
architecture 35 percent faster CPU it's
making me regret buying the 10 billion
transistors like the average consumer
really billion transistors it's funny
like testing phones have been doing like
these gaming phones which are some of
the fastest Androids and even with all
like the extra RAM and all that like one
even has a fan so it can cool itself
down to overclock yep even with all that
is still slower than like an iPhone in
are like it's that prop that 812 chip is
this crazy Bionic a child by owning
Bionic acts performance metrics of the a
12 against on the iPhone versus the
pixel 3 even just smoked it yeah well
and this one's the the 12x yes so that's
so it's gonna even more even even more
faster yeah that was even more fast I'm
just I have to specify my correctly as a
joke or incorrectly a told because
they're saying it's not faster than 92%
of all portable PC so I you know that's
that's a big everybody all other
companies at this point are now
challenge accepted
and taking notes I'll do some speed
tests yeah exactly that's the chest drop
test we're doing all kinds of tests in
the what happened I don't there was a
snacks box there was a picture of an
xbox Xbox Xbox it says Xbox class
performance and they said the competitor
names that's finally I said I've been
asking for this for long folks I'm not a
game xbox Xbox 360 Xbox one they did not
define it as a picture what's definitely
in it enables up to one terabyte in
store one terabyte storage capacity if
you're using are you gonna be if you're
gonna be taking videos on your iPad just
know really a lot of photographers edit
on the iPad help so that I mean we're
finally hopefully getting to that point
where it could potentially replace
running my ass even be from tumblr fan
page Photoshop it on the iPad was the
big thing right yeah that was a couple
weeks ago that was a big thing and
obviously you know you're gonna need
that terabyte yeah yes I did call it
okay you're so excited well I didn't I I
was a little bit regretting my decision
to put the USB C in there because I
didn't think the Apple was gonna have
the courage but if they did so they're
showing they're showing device device
connections so another rumor was that
iPhone and charge your other devices
transfer data between them maybe I'm
just looking at the image but but they
also said that you were going to be able
to hook it up and transmit 4k video so
that image alone you could probably
probably
and so we're that's a five key monitor I
think it's what I saw this may be the
year that we get close to replacing that
the laptop I remember I know every year
Scott Stein that when he reviews the
iPad he says that it's not ready yet to
replace his laptop this might be the
year it is Apple pencil I mean if it's
gonna replace that the computer that
means thing that cost nine million if
we're hitting a MacBook Air at $1,200
yeah then you want to be able to hit
that four hundred to like twelve hundred
other iPad the regular iPad is 399 maybe
this is the I think the cheapest merton
version right now but maybe this is
remember you said that there was no sub
thousand dollar MacBook at this point
maybe this is going to be there sorry
the the iPad 2018 iPad is $329 so
spectrum between nine and twelve twelve
bucks and we have to do is the mini
gonna survive as well it's not gonna be
totally written out I mean that's
another interesting thing the mini
hasn't been updated smart Keyboard my
iPad 2nd generation 32 gigs with $700
Wow what's that how many years have you
had it now since 2012 and if you divide
that every year the big deal no more no
more weird attachment and we attachment
no more while replacing the battery if
you have a surface and soul because like
a tad smaller it does look a tad smaller
Oh William Patrick
that looks so sweet with that the iPad
with such tiny bezels on that folio yeah
it looks like it looks like a laptop
right there but the I don't see the
connector on the the smart connector on
the back do you did any of you guys see
where it's located or looking but it is
still horizontal so that makes a lot
more sense to me maybe it's it's sort of
in a similar position is where the Apple
pencil would be no actually maybe that
doesn't that doesn't make sense because
then you couldn't charge yeah and have
the keyboard connected I didn't he would
hate the way that the keyboard is
oriented would assume that it is on that
axis right on the horizontal that might
be the one rumor that was off maybe the
the positioning of that smart well
there's like looks like there's two
different positions like this is kind of
more to straight up yeah and then this
is more laid back 12 megapixel camera
around the back true tone flash and 4k
at 60 frames a second no portrait though
as far as I can tell which is good
because I don't want people to well
that's interesting that they didn't do
that
you told that you tried telling that to
my mom so all of the things that we've
seen on the earlier Apple on the iPhone
such as smart HDR which is Apple's new
way of making HDR images and group
FaceTime which is an iOS 12 update which
is actually 12.1 which is coming out
today and emoji and me emoji the
advanced face idea yep and gigabit class
LTE but East there so there isn't a sim
inside there so oh I would be interested
to know if you could also that's yeah
yeah and the other thing is a hundred
and twenty frames per second which is
great the only other device we know that
does that is the razor phone to the
gaming phone and going back they
announced that Assassin's Creed will be
on the iPad
and what's cool about that and maybe the
reference to Xbox was just that you're
able to get kind of consoled yeah you're
getting close to having this ain't not
the same console and the catalog
selection and if I can plug that into a
monitor and now I'm playing this I'm you
can yeah well I can't apparently but as
I play wait but what I have to use the
Apple pencil is like no I bet third
parties will sell controllers that just
connect via bluetooth or well they
already have but I'm not sure how they
interface with the iPad specifically I
mean down there with that I don't think
that's an Apple thing right right now
we're seeing lots of like AR up
numbersync now assassins Brotherhood
here we go so I'm honestly like I mean I
know the market out there it's huge but
gaming like the console experience on it
yeah I don't think need me know I think
I think there are a lot of people that
are incredibly interested in this and
this is going to be yes something they
will definitely pick up on right
specifically but I think like the core
experience the console experience is
very much a Leanback on a big screen a
big TV so either it's an external
monitor or it's like on your living room
couch on a really big screen because the
whole immersive experience of gaming is
not necess I'm in kind of is but I mean
those I mean even older iPads have
really nice displays right so you have
this newer display you have the hundred
twenty frames per second refresh rate
it's gonna look insane it's gonna look
so cool it's gonna be a really expensive
gaming device we're riding out the iPad
to till it's dead that's the dilemma the
iPad it's there's such a good device I
think now it's laughs don't trade them
in until you it needs to need to there
we go okay games 2k games
yeah well NBA 2k
that mean that's the thing I I and there
now they're pandering with the Brooklyn
Nets or oh I didn't even know play
three-time all-time three-pointers this
is I'm ready to see pricing actually
this does look this is the last night's
game I work I would not have a clue so
I'm full disclosure that's what I
thought was going on here cuz I don't
watch I don't watch the basketball very
much it captured the whole game in real
time creating
clearly us number one sports fans right
here Lexi and myself
ladies beard yeah I wouldn't know but
obviously respiration and I highly
optimized mr however could be the guy
having to play that onstage in front of
it I mean just like perform it's like
I'm I'm sure that brings a lot and if
all else fails they have that cut to
pre-recorded tape they keep coming back
to that shot literally one frame like
that's not ya know it's 120 frames per
second though is probably what 30 frames
per second no shop air pod - oh yes that
was Scott Steiner right now and that was
a long slow close-up of sweat okay I do
now it's starting to look a little bit
more gamey game II as their as their
like huddling in to cheer that yeah that
came it away from me give away the
audience is the yeah give away I think
the action I mean if you just took a
passing glance so that you could be like
oh is a game on and then you look we
don't have any food or drinks it's clear
the audience they have nothing in their
hands not all taking photos looking down
to their phones don't be on I'll get it
we can play it Adobe on because I suck
at gaming Toby this is this I will can
definitely jump on Adobe on the I'm
gonna get premiere on your iPad
or is it okay Wow okay Wow do you think
the issue with the obviously the Adobe
ecosystem is moving towards the Creative
Cloud and some people love it and some
people like me like not having to
activate your software yeah I'm the
subscription model every month and I I
don't know I haven't used I have to be
honest I haven't used any of the Adobe
products on the iPad I'm not even
Photoshop yet so I want to know if this
is going to be moving towards that kind
of subscription-based model or if it's
just literally buying an app I think you
can do I think it's which is neat
because that way if you just want that
you can buy it and it I think maybe 30
bucks 29 bucks there are 20 bucks or if
you already have if you already are a
member just there okay well I believe
that's how that's what they do know it's
a couple extra go that's good I missed
that because I wasn't okay so she's
demoing but looking at the iPad still
that rough edges look so bad actually
and and and look at look at her editing
to the Apple pencil is a looks like a
fantastic editing tool I've actually
never used it as it's so much more
intuitive than having to use your mouse
it's kind of reverting back to using a
pro and she's using the Apple pencil to
edit photos I'm so good I'm I wanted I
want this I need to use it because I'm
so accustomed to Photoshop on the
desktop but but then I think the big
learning curve for me is gonna be
learning and because I love the reason
why I love Photoshop on the desktop is
because I have so much customization I
can put windows wherever I want I can
open up like the history in one side and
then have that right alongside and if
there's a lot of going back and forth
between those things on the iPad then
it's probably not the tool for me but
imagine the precision for that from the
from editing from a pencil versus having
because we had like you had to learn to
edit like precision wise on a mouse oh
and to and to tout like moving it with a
pencil is kind of like I'm really into
art and so that just I'm dexterous with
my
much more than I am with a mouth to your
point though I believe this new version
addresses like that keeping a lot of
controls and shortcuts as similar as
they could but obviously changing them
to make them more sensible on right and
together I have not used it either so
far it looks so much different than the
light versions on it and it does look
like I could find the tools and
shortcuts pretty easily but to be fair
designers are already using graphics
tablets and pencils alright we're using
on the desktop so transitioning to a
pencil on the iPad is not that tricky
but the thing is those tools are already
there on the desktop it's nice to have
them on the iPad but maybe this is not
going to be something that is going to
appeal to the people that already are
using graphics tablets they actually
it's gonna appeal to people that are
more hobbyist like ourselves right yeah
and who are not doing this is there you
know there is I mean out but I feel like
the other aspect of this is its reliance
on Adobe cloud for always backing up so
if you and I like that I don't want it
in the Derby cloud I also use like other
services like Dropbox and stuff like
that I don't want it in the cloud at all
I still want on my device I'm a
traditional look I want to go back to
save things on the device but you could
also have them so if you're working on a
illustration or graphic and then you're
done with it I can pick up right where
you left off instantaneous you saying
mine wasn't good enough so you have to
think exactly I'm very very very very
very very very very excited about this
but also I come from a drawing
background not from necessarily a like
room editing background so that the fact
that I can go back to being seeing
what's on paper and using a pencil on
this actual screen instead of using it
on a like on the surface where you have
to look down to see and then see it see
your changes up on the screen yeah that
that to me it would be amazing so not
having to it's kind of reverse
engineering to how you would use a pen
and paper so I don't know so this PSD
file I worked on has one
and 57 layers like that
that's hot cool this is three gigabyte
file all right that would that would
make my air crash first er oh yeah that
would purge my first humble because even
even for me air is like yeah so that's
in a technical error
yeah she's making a oh wow this insane
so is this this is like crying reminds
me of the Minecraft dem I remember from
the M company and I cannot name
apparently thang so creating some sort
of a our demo i holding the tablet up
and having butterflies and forest
journey obviously the things that we
were would be using it for we not coming
till 2019 the AR application that would
be my go-to tool now more than photoshop
is and so i I think but the thing is
with Lightroom is catalog management is
the huge one in Lightroom and if they
can streamline that between the iPad
desktop and not necessarily I mean
solution is obviously they say use but I
have so many different libraries and so
many Dixie has issues with the clutter
be closed I don't want it to get locked
in so if I decide not to have a Creative
Cloud subscription I like lose access to
my files like to like drop I'm still
very much at least when it comes to my
editing and like photos and videos I'm
still like a local on device kind of go
I'm not
a fan of the cloud I know a lot of
people are but I still love things being
on device and the program is nice to
have so many different no you have one
terabyte is that USB does that support
like I don't know hard drives they can
open an external hard drive and that USB
C port on the side yeah because that's
like I'm able to move around and I'm
able to take an old PSD file like that
was for desk OB and put have it on an
external SD and then plug it into I'm
not using any cloud services so I'm
looking at a promotional video of the
iPad right now and it looks like the
pencil can only be put on the top so
there's only one position it's not like
magnetic all throughout the device so
that's interesting I'm not seeing a
smart connector though I see it's on the
left side was where it's like the cyber
the volume rocker Oh interesting that's
the no look it's on the bottom I guess
it's on it's right on the edge I think
no it doesn't the rumor had it a but
like on the back side above the
lightning connector or the USBC
connector on so it's actually put in
right and the edge if I'm looking at it
correctly which is interesting yeah so
yes it's a I'm curious to see how thin
it actually is even real looks pretty
thin yeah it does because because the
the shape of the edges make it appear a
little bit thicker but it's actually a
lot slimmer it looks like so lashes of
paint on that screen and they have a
nice little laundry a laundry video up
and down up and down lots of spinning of
the iPad again and editing on I maybe
come on
nor no I think that's just no I I'm
sorry I sound like Nancy negative
anything but so lightning connector
Apple pens so sorry USBC not lightning
connector Apple pencil what actually
wait no no I'm not sure I'm not sure
whether you ROG bond
I don't know if that was GarageBand I
think it's like some beat thing but
maybe I think yeah Garage Benny to me
garage Garage Band
oh yeah you can that's interesting you
can put you can transfer media from
device to device with a connector so you
showed hooking it up to a camera oh yeah
well that's so people know to do so from
camera to iPad or iPhone you have been
able to transfer photos for a while
using the special USB connector from
usv/h
lightning so you have been able to do
that you must be agent yeah lightning
yes you have been able to do that for a
while now
at least transfer I'm not sure I think
it's USB ADA lightning at least so
you've been able to transfer like RAW
images if you had a compatible version
of iOS and you've been able to transfer
JPEGs at least for quite a while a
couple years now I did a how-to one at
ages ago so yeah it's a lightning to USB
a and so that's been a seventy seven
hundred ninety nine dollars for the 11
inch Wow yeah much more that I had but
that's for 64 gigs what do you I mean it
was mine was 32 you know 700 bucks
really so that's that's pretty good so
and then the 12-inch starts at 64 goes
up to a terabyte nine hundred and
ninety-nine dollars this is the new
basically option for the MacBook Air
price range so nine hundred ninety nine
dollars oh that's that's a that's it's
plus if you're gonna spend on the twelve
point nine inch here probably not gonna
get the 64 gigabyte right right yeah
that's so you wouldn't does anyone
remember what the original twelve point
nine inch pro cost I feel like it was I
don't want to say it but I think this is
the most expensive iPad to date yeah it
definitely it definitely sounds like it
I don't remember the twelve point nine
into regional price the the luncheon
story maybe it was more than that you
know there's a tool that we
it's called the Z Google one one to nine
11:29 said that was one yeah that was
definitely yeah so that was definitely I
do remember being very shocked at that
price when it did coming
so this is our which is a really top
under it still 464 but yeah 64 gigs but
I got an external hard drive parents
though a terabyte costs every every
every price point sorry every storage
model goes up a hundred dollars is that
would that be that sounds so you could
spend you could spend $1400 on a iPad
plus plus the keyboard plus the pencil
I'm assuming the pencils gonna be about
$99 an keyboard attached to maybe like
129 or maybe ninety minutes um so that
those I mean I'm guessing those gonna be
the prices that's kind of around what
the surface pricing is I'd be surprised
if it was cheaper and they've got to cut
the surface pricing if they did that
would be pretty amazing I doubt it
though because he'll have to go on the
Apple store once it's not down sort out
the pricing here but I guess kind of the
pricing we expected right $7.99 and
$9.99 although there's only um well I
guess that's that's pretty in line with
yeah so here we go that looks like
they're wrapping up now and I'm pricing
the pricing they 10.5 649 I pad per the
11 inch in $7.99 and the twelve point
nine inch from nine hundred and ninety
nine dollars yes so I'm what I want to
know the high has configuration of that
twelve point nine inch iPad pro and this
is the confuse a lot of iPads now and
this is confusing
again Apple is segmenting the market so
much I think that it is very confusing
if you are a consumer going into the
Apple store you've decided yes I want an
iPad I perhaps want to use it as my I
guess a complement to my laptop or
potentially a laptop replacement I'm at
that stage where I don't need like the
full grunt power of having the laptop in
terms of like that full-size keyboard
and that kind of flexibility there but
going in and you're like well what size
do I choose what configuring
choose to be their first question me
like I want to pet Pro there can be like
switch sides laptop so I mean you have
the pro line and you have the non pro
line or the air line I guess now but you
kind of go one of those two and then
you're gonna pick the you want like the
big screen the small screen in between
screen but then there's so much in
between them the and they need a store
where people could like advise you I'm
interested to see if the Apple pencil is
backwards compatible - older - older yes
that would be interested because I how
would you charge it exactly exactly
where that little keyboard is because I
think it's on the edge it is on the its
it appears to be on the edge from what I
could gather but you're the your
question about the Apple pencil how does
it charge if you don't have a I pad a
new iPad because this one doesn't have
that little like tap on the back so the
store is back up right now but there are
no their products don't seem to be
updated as from what I can see it still
looks like the old products and so I'm
that's at least when I went to store it
on apple.com times like they're wrapping
up this they are wrapping it up now so
it looks like yeah it looks like this a
which is out now then you up update to
12.1 is out apple music oh it's Lana Del
Rey is now performing at the Brooklyn
Academy of Music and also worth to say
that the Apple store is now in dark mode
I've never seen it black yeah I think so
but then it gets back to brightly at the
top row down yeah yeah nothing has been
updated yet the story is back up which
is interesting so we don't know yet the
exact specs and where the location of
that connector is what all the people
want to do it's still the old one where
is the connected they still the pencil I
still want to know how much that pencil
is if it is more than $99
it's more than 90 or do you think do you
think they go less do you think we'd be
like oh it's 79 or some like that no
it's gonna be the same it's got more oh
actually okay so nari I thought it was
new 11 inch and 12 inch narrate the
stories don't lie updated that's a shame
that's a real shame
well maybe they're let's go to their
news their news site yes maybe maybe
maybe that's a good just to see if they
have any announcements anyway sorry Lana
Del Rey is performing live on stage now
there's a little new tab now it now it
changed well you know maybe I didn't
know now it changed back to white and
here we go it is something so if you go
through to the Apple Store and you tap
on by uh-huh I'll be able to see the
designs by I don't know if it's gonna
take so that all right now put your
credit card in see that one no I'm so
you have to go to the iPad Pro winner
takes it all okay
yeah is that our back to iPad and then
tap on iPad pro in the low yes check out
the pencil is it oh no first first look
up the twelve point nine inch for one
terabyte I'm just curious
exactly what I was gonna do twelve point
nine one terabyte one terabyte yes yes
yes 14:18 Space Gray one terabyte what
about without wife sorry just find it on
the story it's on go go to the search
Esther are accessories accessories and
then guess what 999.9 no I mean why why
would they undercut the previous
generation they want people to use the
Apple pencil
yeah well that's a good point I mean how
many pencil in the new yes but you
wouldn't get the wireless charging and
all of my phone yeah watching miss live
obviously we're going off the blog was
there any mention about the pressure
sensitivity or kind of any new I bet the
last time so it was a little bit was but
I mean you I would have thought that
would have been like the top teeing that
they would have mentioned probably it
does say industry-leading low latency
doesn't give you a number they were they
were but yeah well there we go 129
dollars magnetically attaches and pays
so how would you does it mention
anything how you would charge it if you
don't you have to have the iPad I would
assume I mean I don't I don't see any
any other documentation at least on here
let's see what it's like another kind of
Matt put it on so can we address this
please dead there are no mention of this
we have not heard any mention of the air
power Matt it is not at this in the
store anymore there is no reference of
it in the store it has been wiped clean
of its existence they want us to forget
that they ever mentioned the air power
Matt rest in peace rest in comes back in
time now what we have now the new Apple
pencil put it on the app how Matt c4
charges nope that's a shame that is a
shame shame so it's just not ready then
no it's not gonna happen it's gonna
happen no I don't think so I mean yeah
just point it would just be embarrassing
that like two years later because we're
yeah this was announced in Sept this was
teased last September so this has been
over a year in the making that says I'm
not sure when this happened when
something like this has happened with
Apple maybe it was they did announce the
the Apple watch with a pretty big lead
time but not
time but it was I think the home was
September last year and it was got
released what mm-hmm I think it was
January maybe this year the home part
the home got Ashley back so maybe she
could I'm so glad you're back
we missed you during the live broadcast
but you're back in there the live
broadcast sorry what did you kick those
people out and tell them they were more
important et
we actually all just record at the same
time so no air power which I think we
kind of knew rest in pieces
power poor went after air power so my
best friend and I had a running bet on
this because he thought maybe it would
show up today and I said if it doesn't
show up today they have gone back to
square one and I think we can maybe a
little confidently say that like
something something's going on there is
a real big problem so are there some
major hurdle that they just can't quite
crack which you know like that's that
happen sometimes and that's okay and I'd
rather them get it done right as opposed
to you know rushing it out and then
having it have a bunch of problems I
don't know note 7 note 7 is another good
one remember like we yeah they're
holding it wrong like that was a big
deal because they bond with antenna gate
I don't know anyway
I was interested so obviously I we we
went what should we were watching a
little bit of the keynote but we are
obviously talking through it and so
there were a lot of things in there that
I think were potentially mean worthy or
something that maybe people were might
have been talking about on Twitter in
particular we noticed there was during
that M NBA 2k demo there was like that
very slow steady shot of one of the
players from the Brooklyn team with the
sweat I don't know if anyone else picked
up on that on I don't know that was just
like screaming for a meme to be made of
it did you see what I mean I sweating me
did you see what was the kind of like
the general consensus on on Twitter on
on the invent itself like maybe not on
the sweaty meme anything so one of the
my favorite things about any tech event
is being on social and seeing sort of
generally how people react to different
things and obviously if you follow me on
me on Twitter you've seen me kind of
like live snarking Apple events because
it's fun and exciting and honestly this
is like really quiet and I think part of
it is because half of the country was
not awake as a slate to start their day
so I think it was actually pretty like
quieter than normal on social media and
also this was a little bit more of a a
less hyped event so I feel like we I
feel like we kind of knew about it and
then was like okay like we have some
ideas about what to expect like you know
with there's always with an iPhone event
like there's this sort of extra that we
get and I don't think we had that here
today but I wasn't underwhelmed in fact
like I really love the new iPad but it
definitely was like a more muted
response unsocial like I was sleeping
because usually yeah so sleepy won over
snarky yeah I didn't even get out of bed
to start their day right it's like
nobody's even in their offices yet to
watch the event like and pretend they're
working and and then typing furiously
about it on Twitter like we kind of
missed out on that which is a little bit
of a bummer but I did see some like
really I saw one question in particular
which I thought was really good our very
own Lindsey Turrentine
tweeted about the pencil she was like I
think this is actually one of the more
exciting things like this is really cool
she's like this is weird but I really
think the new Apple pencil is the
hottest news of this hashtag Apple event
and then there was a question from Colin
so he a response so Colin says it's
impressive but what happens if you use a
case as most people do does the wireless
charging still work I think that's a
really good question
questions we're gonna see that work also
will it being like Apple exclusive to
the to their folio case well and I have
another question to add to your question
- Lindsay's question Ashley which is I'm
actually also really interested in the
Apple pencil and it's supposed to have a
much better lag time but what if you you
bought a knife an iPad last year or
authority two years ago and you don't
want to upgrade the app pad but you'd
want the pencil does how do you charge
it I mean is it a regular would you have
to get a regular turning mat that's an
excellent question and I would imagine
that Apple probably thought air power
would solve that problem they were like
let's do a wireless pencil we're making
this air power mat it's gonna be great
and now they're like I almost wonder if
they back themselves into a corner on
that because yes of course you would
want I bought an iPad last year and I'm
like gosh I guess I've had Pro like
because I were a pencil and I my Apple
pencil has always did and so this yes
problem with it so being able to
wirelessly charge it by snapping it to
the iPad it's exactly what I always
wanted for the original one yes if you
can't make that happen then right I
didn't think that it was I really do
think they were like air power we'll fix
this yes and to your point like the we
were looking at the different price
points for for the different iPads and
you can spend up to $1,900 on an iPad
pro let's 12.9 inch with one terabyte oh
and with the Wi-Fi and the and the LTE
and then you add an Apple pencil to that
and then maybe the the keyboard and what
are you doing with your life well you
know he's spending a lot of
that's what you do yeah one why aren't
you buying like two microsoft surfaces
and then right like it just because it's
not even a fully fledged computer like I
if you're gonna spend that kind of money
obviously you want the new MacBook Air
and you could probably spend you know
it's 1199 and then you got another $600
in dongles or whatever so it feels like
that's like about the same price but
yeah it does seem really odd right like
it's it's a little bit yeah it's very
strange to me like I get kind of dongles
are you buying okay so go go into the
question about the case the smart
Keyboard folio that they announced it
looks like there's not sides on it so
that would allow the pencil to set up
their case to work but my question is
much like we saw you know the the
battery cases go away with the iPhone 10
last year we haven't really seen those
battery cases that were so popular um
because it became more proprietary if
I'm not mistaken I'm correct please
correct me if I'm wrong but we saw a lot
of battery cases the third-party battery
cases go away so I'm wondering if this
is also gonna be the same where it's
like really if you want that full iPad
pro experience you have to buy Apple's
case yeah and then I would run achieve
this with some phones that are not Apple
phones that you can have a thin case on
it and still wirelessly charge the phone
I don't know if that would allow
obviously for magnetically connecting a
pencil but at least charging it
I don't know so there's a lot of
questions with that and what kind of
cases are so right I'm sure you could
attach it to the case or maybe people
will start creating cases with an actual
cutout where you place the pencil on the
iPad which would make season and so I'm
just taking a page from the fashion
industry and thinking that could be the
way they go bigger though isn't that the
whole point that you have this nice slim
iPad and then you're putting a massive
case with a thing that
Polk's out you know or like like if you
have a really slim case with just a cut
out that exposes that side of the iPad
so that you know I see where you say
yeah yeah yeah like a shoulder cut out
on a sweater they were very got it
robots make it more exposed because
you're exposing the whole side of the
iPad but I guess it is a thicker it
wouldn't the use case for that it
wouldn't really matter because you know
you're using it in that configuration
you've probably stuck on the desk anyway
you're not really gonna be toting it
around necessarily using that charging
and I mean maybe you would while it's in
the folio if you're out and about I
would assume that you would charge it
well it the because I'm wondering if it
charges while the iPad is locked that's
what I would be interested in as in like
if it was just stationary yeah I would
have to yeah you know when it hits 100%
it stops right so I just got back from
vacation and while I was on the plane I
spent some time using the pencil to like
you know doodle and and hang around and
procreate and all that stuff but then I
wanted to watch haunting on Hill house
so I just you know put my pencil back in
my backpack or whatever everything up to
watch but I would imagine that sort of
the use case right where it's like
you're out and about you just want to
like know if it really quickly and be
have access to it really quickly and
that I think is the other thing that
might mean little cutouts for the pencil
like for third party case makers because
then it's very easily accessible you're
not having to and it also is still
getting charged like that to me is the
most logical listen case designers I got
some ideas look I threw it I throw a
question at us also would you rather the
new MacBook Air or would you rather the
iPad with like sorry I'm still not
enough of it I don't have enough of a
use case for two separate devices a
tablet and a laptop and that's why I
would always err on the side of the
laptop that being said I did do the math
on how much it would cost to buy the
fully expect out I pad pro the twelve
point nine inch one terabyte with Wi-Fi
and cellular add the folio and pencil
two thousand two hundred and twenty
seven dollars sounds like a deal sounds
like a deal guys that seems that's your
only device your only device you are an
artist who needs the iPad and doesn't
want any other like Wacom or other
tablet and like the use case is so
specific to have that top-end I said
yeah I can't possibly imagine and I
agree with you guys I think if you had
to choose between one or the other I
think for me I would ninety-nine point
eight percent of the time go with the
air and a price point as well like I
just did a quick on the Apple store
because it's all up now I also did like
say if you wanted to spec out a MacBook
Air one point six key an eight gig of
memory and one point five terabytes the
storage is not exactly the same as the
one terabyte on the iPad but you're
paying two thousand three hundred and
ninety nine dollars so only about a
hundred and you know sixty dollars more
so and you get a your Mojave tax I have
a lot of people in the chatroom saying I
don't want to pay an Apple tax they're
all seeing this as an apple yeah yeah
higher priced products Apple it's
extracting money from us Mayor Judith
says freaking out of exactly are they
freaking out about the the macbook air
price hike or the iPad or all these holy
above $2,000 even though even though
you're right the Apple pencil got Maru
this this by the way I'd like to point
out this is probably the longest we've
ever talked about an Apple pencil but
that is true it's a metaphor for the
whole thing right now I mean like I'm
hanging 130 dollars for a stylist it was
this yeah
was this the most exciting product to
come out I think we're leaving behind
probably the best product to come out of
here is the Mac Mini for the price if
we're talking about what you get for the
price I would probably put the Mac Mini
out there for the best these a lot of
people that 11 inch it's 64 gigabytes
for $7.99 it's gonna be a compelling
iPad I think I'll they're gonna sell a
lot of them at that price point actually
what are you saying again like I know a
lot of people have Mac minis who are
either maybe they work from home or they
have a business where they run a you
know a little server on a Mac many
things like that but I I don't know
anybody I or if I do I I know very few
people would choose a Mac Mini over the
MacBook Air the new MacBook Air
yeah like Apple was almost marketing in
it like like it was an Apple TV almost
like just the way it looked on the table
it looked like it was an Apple TV yeah
yeah totally
definitely that little Mac Mini would be
a perfect little computer for like kids
like in school who are like 10 like that
seems like a good like home computer for
kid going back to apples roots and
homebrew computing you know the Mac
thing I don't know I think that Mac mean
II didn't get enough love I think at
least from the social reception that
I've seen I think it's finally it's I'm
so glad that it has got to refresh even
though the design is completely the same
essentially and I'm disappointingly I
didn't we didn't see any kind of hints
towards the promarker yeah because we do
not obviously there's a Mac Pro coming
in 2019 no hints nothing dropped about
that at all I think that was a bit of a
disappointment especially to the Apple
crowd that is been asking Apple time and
time again please look after the pro
market the creatives but I think I've
driven Apple in the past but Tim Cook
has addressed that and I think he's made
it pretty clear that it's coming don't
worry guys so I don't I don't think that
that giving them a tease would like
unless other side people there because I
you know these products yes these
products are you know a totally fine and
used by these creatives but you know
what happened last time it's used a
product product is I mean they tease the
original trash can back pro well before
is on sale and that was I just hope that
Apple market you have to update
literally every six months i people and
make it updated more video editors if
they are editors or yeah make it very
upgradeable because the thing is is
almost every video editor i know in this
town hates mac right now because there's
like I want to edit on it but I can't
upgrade it like I cannot upgrade it and
so now I've got a you know I've got a
switch or you know I can't if you want
to market to the pro you know to the pro
group of people who are using these for
you know power users who are using this
for work like you've got to start
upgrading this stuff every six months
you can't you can't even have it an
annual upgrade cycle like it's just that
is a wild thing to me like to be like oh
yeah well we're gonna get to it it's
like I hate to break this to you but
you're literally losing Pro users as the
years go by that you don't know anything
well and is something that was really
neat to me was seeing that new MacBook
Air plugged into the the Blackmagic
camera what's called the epu or whatever
is called that right yeah II PU yeah
because I think that's the nice thick in
between for someone who is not maybe a
dedicated full time video editor for
someone who might video it once in a
while or make music once in a while so
you could plug that and get to go
because I think that combination would
still cost less than that iPads fully
SPECT an Apple pencil I feel like made a
lot of a lot of computing power and
accessories and dongles and still comer
though
iPad priced yeah absolutely really quick
I want to show I want to show you guys
something that I saw when I was out in I
went to I was on vacation I went out to
to London and we went to the Tower of
London and there's a I found a stylus
from the 12th is a 12th century yeah
the original Apple pencil it definitely
doesn't cost $129 though it wasn't 129
like they had wax writing tablets but
this stylus was like it was it was so
small it was so little I've Johnny I
figured back there's like this year's
wax has been upgraded to the new less
waxy but more glossy I've lost the
journey I've indeed I need some more
coffee what else on unsocial and on CNET
life has been kind of gaining some
traction what other questions or
comments concerns that people have been
having I gotta be honest most people are
just like rich for my blood
I'm out yeah everybody comment I see no
no um no no thanks
actually I got a crazy I don't if you
saw they had a picture of an Xbox next
to the new iPad pro obviously hinting at
how powerful the processing is in the
new iPad enough to play gaming what do
you think of that I think that's really
interesting I think that we so on stream
economy we talked about project stream
which is Google's efforts to sort of
allow people to play really high-quality
games and you know 60 frames per second
on their computer through streaming and
I think this I think this iPad is really
to me very compelling in the way of
gaming wise like I get that you're I
mean I get that your graphic your GPU
keeps getting upgraded and good for you
and that's cool but I think if you're
gonna go the gaming route like you're
gonna have to show me more than what
amounts to fallout shelter for
Assassin's Creed which looked really
cute and the graphics look really
awesome and you know NBA stuff was
amazing looking but the thing is is I
think most people who are playing more
sort of like non casual games like
you're playing an assassin actual
Assassin's Creed game or NBA 2k like
you're playing that on a console like
you're not playing that on an iPad so I
don't know I mean it does feel like
maybe it's Apple trying to be like hey
look we can be like switch you can take
it with you
definitely feels yeah it feels like
Nintendo definitely disrupted that space
a lot and I I think that we're gonna
start seeing a little bit more a little
bit more in the way of you know all
console manufacturers and I guess you
could consider the iPad a console I if
you wanted to really stretch but but I
think we're gonna start seeing I mean we
see it on every every single keynote
about iPad I mean they're really into
games on iPad I mean Infinity Blade was
such a big deal when the first iPad came
out you know it was like such a
everybody freaked out and so I think now
like we're starting to see them sort of
get into that base and I almost wonder
if it's
indicative of some kind of deal or
something that they might be working on
to get other games manufacturers or you
know production houses and developers to
come on board and maybe maybe offer a
streaming service something similar to
project stream or to you know work I
don't think they're ever gonna work with
Google but they'll work with all those
game developers so to do something
really cool so it I'm very curious like
kind of where they're going there but
obviously this iPad is really
well-suited to games and is the price of
it I can buy an Xbox and a Nintendo
consoles yeah you could buy all three
across the phones and and VR you could
buy oculus $300 one you could literally
have so many games so many consoles like
again like it's just such a weird thing
to me to have Apple be like pouting
their game stuff I would have rather
seen augmented reality again like show
me the updates show me how you are
pushing the envelope there as opposed to
just showing me another high-res game
like okay good for you 120 frames a
second well that's a good that's a good
kind of segue into what we didn't get
you mentioned we mentioned the air power
mat obviously we didn't get or nor will
we ever get at this point who knows the
air power mat but some of the yeah what
are they gonna call whatever comes out
they got air power it's super powered
air power so we didn't get that which
was i I mean disappointing but probably
expected at this point we didn't get the
charging case for the air pods which is
also expected because they didn't they
didn't they didn't put the pad just the
iPad but the the other thing we didn't
get was the smaller home pod which could
come early next year and you mentioned
you know no VR headset we Apple has been
working supposedly on a VR headset for a
while and still no mention no tease I
was more surprised there there was no
tease of that or I think it would be
highly I think it means to be in such
early stages but but in ours really
they've had a long leeway time it
exactly given that magically you know
obviously has had such a contentious I
guess amount of press around it and you
know a lot of people that didn't feel
like it quite lived up to the hype and
especially things like the red phone as
well maybe you know they're waiting for
the these kind of companies to go out
and kind of you know trailblaze and sort
of get that negativity out of the way
and then when they are ready to reveal
something you know maybe it won't be at
the same level but at least people will
be more used to it and the reception
might be a little bit more warm for them
because right now I don't think people
are already they're really not so maybe
maybe WWDC would that still be too soon
you guys yeah I mean I I feel like you
know it it's taken a while for you know
Apple to start talking about AR as
particularly and showing some demos that
are good but I mean when it comes to the
you know real life use cases the most I
think the most useful thing for me is
that measure app with in iOS 12 and
that's just such a good stepping stone
to be able to show like how AR can be
used you know info for things that
people are actually gonna want to use
not necessarily oh I can put you know
ferries and forests in in my living room
I mean that's cool but I think that you
have to start small and the Google Maps
where you have like you follow the Fox
to you directly stuff like that is like
yeah it's such a smart simple thing but
those are gonna be the things that kind
of bring it to like actual people I
think it's a slow and steady race and
Apple knows that and they know that
going too hard too soon is gonna scare
off people and it's not gonna be
something that's going to be to their
advantage in the longer and no one's
gonna have money after buying all these
items like $4,000 which is Apple
traditionally and I mean we see this
every year they are very conservative
with new technology and you know how
long did it take them to get away from
the 30 pin connector like I mean it yes
this is classic Apple like this is it
takes them a really long time they come
in late to the lakes of the game a lot
of times in terms of technology but they
do it really
well and so you know some Android fans
out there I'm sure you're like yelling
at me right now right now they don't but
but generally speaking they do things
very well like I'm looking at you Siri
you're the exception but like is very
much like a company that will look at
okay like now that this technology has
been out for a while how can we put our
spin on it how can we make it very
patently Apple and and then they do it
and people generally really like it so I
mean you know we've had face filters and
AR stuff for a while with you know with
snapchat and Instagram stories and all
that stuff but then finally you know
with MIMO G like that was Apple's way of
doing it and so this is not a new thing
like for Apple and I think they're gonna
wait a really long time for AR I think
this is why I like it's gonna take them
so long to develop something like these
glasses um but but let's see I got a
magic a magic 8-ball so Vanessa let's
just ask a couple questions
your powers ever come out no not likely
8-ball is sadly sadly optimistic but
okay so before we before we end I think
there's four products that I'm very very
curious about including that VR headset
and the air power my mat which is funny
because the air power match should be a
lot easier to deliver than the VR
headset but at this point in order of
most recent to to most far off in the
future
we have the VR headset from apple the
Apple branded car whether that's just
we're dreaming we're dreaming big so
Apple car VR headset or air power mat
and eyeglasses I've been hearing but I
got which is funny because we're putting
the air power mad at this point on the
same like turf as the Erica Apple car
and the VR headset that's her what do
you think is most likely of these three
dreams
like the answer was there why not
let's just go crazy come on oh wait I
forgot a foldable phone oh well what's
the most likely not foldable fine not
not really
well not for it next you get VR headset
it's gonna come before absolutely really
yeah I think I think I think well we are
it weren't that wasn't it an AR headset
yeah it is that gives me more like man
sorry ar AR that's gonna I think well
okay so faking if they can get it
together it's gonna be air power because
they you know this is something they
probably wanted for a long time but no
but yeah I think barring that I think
it's gonna be the the AR headset but it
won't be next year I don't I don't think
so not at all
I think apples moves too slowly for that
I'm gonna go with err sorry I'm gonna go
with a folded phone and then a our
headset and then air power mat sorry and
then and then car and then we'll be here
doing a show will be ten years old I
[Laughter]
look forward to that day me too I think
you're Bionic I yeah I think that's a
great place to wrap it up for today
Ashley thank you so much for joining us
