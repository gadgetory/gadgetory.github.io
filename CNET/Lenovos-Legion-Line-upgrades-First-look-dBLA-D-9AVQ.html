a big update which line of gaming pcs
not always the first name you think of
when it comes to PC gaming
lenovo has actually been making some
pretty good systems at pretty good
prices for years what they lacked was
maybe a certain aesthetic sizzle
fortunately a few of these new laptops
and desktops are getting a serious
design makeover the l√©gion wise 730
looks much less like a gaming laptop and
much more like a slick professional
crossover machine it's got a dark grey
all aluminum body with thin bezels
around the screen a must-have for a
high-end laptop these days it looks a
lot less like a gaming rig and more like
something you'd see hanging out a
hipster coffee shop all day
the only real nod to the gaming
aesthetic is a light-up redesigned logo
on the back you get Dolby Atmos support
2 which is becoming more popular in
high-end audio systems the close cousin
the Lenovo y50 similar makeover but with
a more gamer revived it's also a little
cheaper with a plastic body and without
the multicolored backlit keyboard if
you're still an old fashioned okay let's
say traditional desktop gamer there's a
new legion tower and legion cube both
have big handles for carrying around to
a you know land party and you can
configure them with transparent side
panels cool lights and even liquid
cooling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
