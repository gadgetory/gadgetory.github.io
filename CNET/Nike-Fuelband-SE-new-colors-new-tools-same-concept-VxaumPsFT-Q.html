Nike FuelBand se to try to get a little
more fit this is one of a variety of
intelligent fitness trackers that are
suddenly all over the place on the
market you've got Fitbit you've got a
jawbone up so what's the advantage of
the FuelBand se versus others
well Nike came out with the fuel band a
year ago and it had this innovative
design that has LED lights here doubles
as a watch and has a really slick
futuristic readout that lets you tell
how many steps you take and how much
fuel you've earned now if you haven't
used the Nike system before fuel is a
point system that accumulates daily and
over time to calculate what it considers
kind of a a gamer score for your health
and it calculates how fast you're
walking how many steps you've taken
using its three axis accelerometer
that's in here and it does some
additional magic sauce math to come up
with that number the whole Nike+ system
is about earning achievements and badges
and how does it feel as a motivating
tool well I found that being able to
glance with the press of the button here
as I'm working or walking encourages you
to say well I've only gotten to this
point maybe I can do a little more and
it's not just the digital readout here
it actually has this really cool
multicolored LED progress bar that tells
you like a little gauge how close you
are to the goal that you've set now
FuelBand se the main hardware
differences are that it uses Bluetooth
4.0 now that's a big trend across all
wearable devices and what it means is
that it can connect and disconnect
wirelessly and sync even when you're not
setting it to in a more seamless way it
only is available for the iPhone still
no Android support and it works with the
iPhone 4s and later which have Bluetooth
4.0 in it it will also sink to a
computer in fact one of the coolest
things about this fuel band
besides its comfortable feel is the fact
that when you disconnect it it actually
is its own USB stick and the durability
on this has been amped up a bit so that
it's now shower resistant and far better
than before and so you can wear this in
the shower you can wash your hands with
a
you can't go swimming with it there's
also a session tracking feature now if
you play basketball if you ski if you're
sleeping which is an activity if you
press and hold this button it will begin
to log an activity and what it does is
it actually shows you like a speedometer
how many fuel points are earning per
minute and you can share that with your
friends in fact there's a social system
here that if friends want to join in
become your fuel buddies and you can see
how they're doing over the course of the
week and a nice thing about the Nike
system is that it's kind of getting a
little more open because you don't have
to just use the wristband although the
fuel band is is the way that Nike
intends for you to experience this
there's actually a Nike Move app on the
iPhone 5s that uses the m7 accelerometer
tracking technology in there that also
records your steps it doesn't give you
the same amount of points over time
because it's in your pocket but it's a
good little starter kit to experience
the eco system but in this day and age
the fuel band is a little simplistic it
does tell you to move every hour with a
little notifier but it doesn't buzz
there's no vibrate in this I need a
cattle prod I need this thing to tell me
to move it's a nice step up but it's
expensive compared to the competition
but for a stylish and comfortable sports
tracking band it's hard to beat the feel
of the fuel band and it is fun to use
especially if you wanted as a watch just
don't expect too much beyond that fuel
score gamification I'm Scott Stein and
that's a look at the Nike FuelBand se
which did get me to go to the gym and
enjoy walking and running a little bit
faster</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
