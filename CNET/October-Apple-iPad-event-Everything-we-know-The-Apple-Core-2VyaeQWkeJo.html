we're expecting from the 2019 iPhones
let's get right to the core of Apple
news and rumors Apple has just sent out
invitations for its next launch event on
October 30th the day before Halloween
now there are a few things different
about the invitation this time around
that I'd like to point out starting with
the artwork it seems that people got
personalized versions of the Apple logo
you can see here it has a cartoon or
this smoke effect or this one with the
water drops just do a quick Google
search if you want to see all of them
now the other thing different is the
location it's going to be held at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music
Howard Gilman Opera House not Cupertino
earlier this year Apple held an event in
Chicago so it seems that Apple is
branching out to other cities now the
catch phrase this time around is there's
more in the making so obviously more
products and some of those products that
we're expecting are to new iPad pros
with slimmer bezels face ID and no home
button a sequel to the MacBook Air with
a 13 inch Retina screen also slimmer
bezels at around the same price point
and potentially an upgrade to the Mac
Mini now some of the other products that
are still up in the air are a cheaper
home pod a sequel to the Apple pencil
maybe an upgrade to the air pods with
that wireless charging case and the air
power mat chances are if we don't see
that air power mat at this event we're
never gonna see it and the long-awaited
iPhone 10 R goes on presale at midnight
on Friday and I'm personally curious to
see how well or poorly it does compared
to its higher-end siblings now if you
already forgot what this phone has the
main difference is that it comes in six
different colors we have a white one a
black one blue yellow coral and red it
also has a 6.1 inch LCD screen compared
to the five point eight and the six
point five inch OLED screens it's got an
aluminum frame versus the stainless
steel frame on the other phones no 3d
touch a lower IP rating meaning you
can't take it down to the three meters
but only one meter and a single
rear-facing camera
with no optical zoom just digital that
can apparently still take portrait mode
photos but in this case it's not using
this second telephoto lens but it's
using software to create the blurred
background effect kind of like the
Google pixel now it also has glass on
either side so you do get that wireless
charging option it has face ID and it
has the dual SIM capability all with
that powerful a 12 Bionic processor so
all in all this is a pretty good deal
for two hundred and fifty dollars less
than the cheapest iPhone 10s now if
you're keeping track of tasks rumors
this one was the one that analysts had
originally predicted to be the best
seller of the bunch but that was back
before the launch and at this point the
10s and the 10s max have had a
month-long Head Start so that may impact
the excitement that users are feeling
about this phone now right now there
appeared to be contradicting rumors
about this on the one hand you have a
digitized report saying that the iPhone
10 our suppliers are expected to post
week sales for the fourth quarter of
2018 this because Apple is supposed to
be slowing down its orders and this may
be a result not of an iPhone slowdown
but a general smartphone of slowdown now
on the other end of the spectrum you
have longtime apple analyst makes you
Clos saying the complete opposite that
the 10r is gonna have even better than
expected sales beating out the demand
for last year's eights in the holiday
quarter this according to a report in 95
Mac either way we won't have to wait too
long because pre-orders start on Friday
and we'll kind of get a sense of what
the demand is for this phone and 2018 is
not even over yet and we're already
hearing rumors about next year's iPhone
lineup now cool also mentioned in a
separate note also published a 9 to 5
Mac that Apple will likely continue with
the three iPhone lineup for next year
meaning to higher-end models one with a
5.8 inch OLED screen and the other Mac's
version with a 6.5 inch OLED screen
alongside the cheaper LCD model with a
6.1 inch screen all of them this time
with an IP 68 reading in a previous post
Kuo had also mentioned that Apple will
not be adding a finger
and scanner into the display like other
phone manufacturers have started to do
in their phones instead the company will
be sticking to its guns with face ID as
the primary unlock feature on this phone
and this week Apple itself has also
given us a little clue of what's in the
works for the future with a recent
patent seen in this patently Apple
report now this is by no means the first
foldable patent for the company but it
may be one of the better renders the
first one pictured here looks kind of
like an ancient scribe and I for one
don't think I would use it what's not a
rumor is that the foldable space is
heating up as other major phone
manufacturers like Samsung are said to
be getting ready to launch their own
foldable designs and at this rate it's
an arms race to see who gets to the
foldable phone first but also who gets
it right but now let's get to more
serious news and I'm not talking about
the stolen Apple IDs that were used in a
string of digital payments thefts in
China this one has to do with the bagel
emoji users on Twitter were outraged by
the insulting representation of this
iconic New York staple in Apple's new
emoji lineup for iOS 12.1 and seriously
they call this a bagel it looks like you
could chip your tooth on this thing now
luckily this story has a happy ending as
Apple devoted all of its resources into
changing this icon and making it better
and now you can see that it resembles
something edible that New Yorkers could
be proud of now in all seriousness guys
I am considering making a designated
emoji section in this show because it
seems like every week there's some kind
of emoji drama I wish I could say that
this was the first time something like
this has happened but last year it was
Google that was in the hot seat for its
Android hamburger emoji
apparently they made the terrible
mistake of putting the cheese on the
bottom of the hamburger bun now Google
had himself sundar Pichai apologized on
Twitter and restored order in the
Android Universe by changing the emoji
and making it all right iPhone tennis
tennis Mac's 10r or none of the above
which phone will be
your wish list this year leave your
answer in the comment section below or
hit me up on Twitter and remember to
come back next week for more apple core</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
