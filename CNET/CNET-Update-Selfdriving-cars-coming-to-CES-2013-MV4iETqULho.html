I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update the Consumer Electronics Show is
almost here but before we pack away the
gear and head to Las Vegas for the
monster of all tech shows we have some
early reports coming out on what will be
there get ready to hear more about
self-driving cars toyota and audie will
be showing off cars without drivers
behind the wheel that's according to The
Wall Street Journal there's a five
second preview video Toyota posted
online showing Alexis equipped with lots
of sensors with the caption that Lexus
is leading the industry into a new
automated era and Adi plans to
demonstrate a car that can locate a
parking spot and self park without a
human behind the wheel google has been
testing its own self driving car since
2009 and if you do decide to drive in
your high-tech car of the future perhaps
it'll look like this concept called the
eb by Visteon it could recognize you
when you get in and adjust the seat
mirrors to your preferences also you'll
get a calendar on a screen it will
program your destination based on your
next appointment screens replace all the
instrument clusters even the rearview
mirror it also has no engine running
entirely on electricity will also get a
closer look at this at CES when it comes
to computers touch screens will be the
norm every model will have a touch
screen option and that's even the
mid-range laptops you can also count on
laptops that twist flipfold attached at
the joints and we could see all-in-one
desktops that are battery-powered so you
can take the screen anywhere televisions
are always big at the show and this year
I do mean big to show off the ultra high
definition technology of 4k will see TVs
that are 80 inches in larger and there
will be more talk of tvs with OLED
screens just don't plan on being able to
afford them anytime soon apps will also
be everywhere and on everything expect
every gadget to come with some app to
help you monitor your habits and make it
easier to interact with appliances and
it will be harder to scratch and break
your gadgets with a stronger version of
gorilla glass the glass maker will debut
Gorilla Glass 3 said to be less brittle
and less prone to scratch
there's so much more in store when CES
finally begins cnet will be streaming
live all week from our stage tune in to
