time Verizon did not have an unlimited
plan but after increased competition the
largest wireless carrier in the u.s.
brought back an unlimited plan in
February of this year $80 per month
gave a Verizon subscriber unlimited data
talk time and texts yeah well things are
about to get more complicated Verizon
has new plans that go into effect on
August 23rd its new go unlimited plan
runs from 75 to 175 dollars then there's
the new beyond unlimited plan which
ranges from $85 to $185 the go unlimited
plan gives Verizon customers unlimited
LTE data however if the network
experiences congestion Verizon can
throttle your speed at any time video
streams are limited to DVD quality
otherwise known as 480p if you want to
use your Verizon device as a hotspot
guess what you're limited to 600
kilobits per second which is really slow
the beyond a limited plan gives you LTE
data without being slowed down until you
hit 22 gigabytes in a month after those
22 gigabytes the data connection may be
slowed down further in times of network
congestion with the beyond a limited
plan you also get HD video streams but
that is limited to 720p resolution on
phones hotspot data is at LTE speed
until you hit 15 gigabytes this plan
also includes free calls texts and data
in Mexico and Canada there is also a
prepaid unlimited plan one line is $80
and you get unlimited LTE speed unless
there is network congestion like in the
go unlimited plan video quality is
capped at 480p as well in the case you
have Verizon's old unlimited plan you
will be allowed to keep it for more
coverage check out cnet.com Amaya's act
hard i'll see you online but at what
resolution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
