the Samsung achieved huge now the teeth
view on the surface of things looks it's
like a normal if somewhat large tablet
however this 13.3 inch device folds out
if I lift up the screen here and you can
see it's concealing a physical keyboard
now you can move this screen if the
loads of different orientations to give
you different positions to work in you
can have it hovering above the keyboard
so you're looking down on it or you can
fold it back over like this so that the
keyboard actually makes a stand for the
display kinda nifty but that's not the
atif use only trick no tap this button
down here and the Windows 8 interface
changes in an instant to Android that's
right this tablet is running to
operating systems at the same time
skipping between them is really quick
and what else is cool is that you can
run the different operating system side
by side so here you can see I've got
Android jellybean running on the left
and over on the right I've got
Microsoft's in maps out this briefly
mentioned the screen as well because it
has a very high resolution
3200 by 1800 pixels here and that means
that the screen is looking ever so sharp
if I look at these icons the level of
detail I can see is really impressive so
having the bulky keyboard obviously
makes them compromise on portability
this tablet is pretty chunky and it
feels quite hefty as well definitely
heavier than a normal tablet for example
so it's definitely working then and it's
absolutely not for everyone but I think
there's some people out there this
really could be a dream device let me
know what you think I'm requesting a
casino and this is the Samsung a TV</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
