comic-con look what we found
it's the hoverboard from Back to the
Future 2 we're here with Trisha she's
talking to us about this piece of iconic
geekery from that film so this is like a
real prototype of the actual prop in the
movie so this is actually a works like
model of the item that we'll have out in
November so it's coming out this
November even though it's not 2015 yet
and we know that hoverboard technology
has not been perfected yeah that'll be
2015 but in the meantime we've taken
every ounce of technology we have and
put it into this board right here so we
like to have lots of a motion sensor
technology in here and electronics in
here so basically just like Marty does
in the movie to turn it on bring it
horizontal you'll start to hear I don't
know if you guys can hear it you'll
start to hear powering up noises as well
as like small vibrations when it turns
on it glides pretty well on most
surfaces the smoother the better and it
gives you hovering noises that we've
taken and taken from the movie so they
come from that and then when you want to
power it down you simply put it under
your arm just like Marty does when he's
holding the board and you'll hear it
power down so there's a lot of fun stuff
in here no on/off switch no buttons
nothing that's gonna make it seem like
it's from today it's all very futuristic
and high-tech you can see we've got this
circle in here just for the handlebars
in case we decide to make those and
sorry gentlemen the ladies version comes
out first since that's the one that we
see in Back to the Future 2 so you don't
have to steal this from some innocent
child on the street that a little work
and if you mean me by some innocent girl
no you don't have to steal my hoverboard
you can get your own on Mattie collector
calm this November do you recommend that
people actually stand on it or is it
more of like a prop it's definitely a
prop replica I now of course we can't
tell you what to do with yours once you
buy it and get it
but for marketing purposes and so forth
is definitely a prop replica I'm seeing
a lot of larger back to the future DT
I'm wondering if there's a weight limit
for it if you stand of it well we
haven't tested for a weight limit but we
don't recommend that okay I know correct
me if I'm wrong I heard I heard a rumor
that they really perfected the
technology for the movie maybe this is
the twelve-year-old in me coming out but
I heard they perfected the technology
for the movie but had to abandon it
because people were getting injured with
real hoverboards can you speak to any
sort of validity with that or no I have
to say the secrets that go into the
Mattel engineering lab I'm not privy to
so there was something like that going
on it would be pretty awesome I don't
doubt it they're pretty smart over there
at Mattel will there be a pitbull model
at all that I can strap on and just sort
of a leech off of my friends
I can't definitely say no to that I know
there's a lot of us that are hoping for
it the pitbull doesn't say Mattel
anywhere on it so that's still a
question but we'll see and finally the
question on everyone's mind I think does
it work on water you know it doesn't
work on water you have to have the power
unless you have power is this a bozo or
beau Joe I think it's Bo Joe yeah Bo
joke I think we all confirm it's Bo jar
you heard it here first at the Mattel
booth before four guys we're gonna see
if we can maybe pry this out of her arms
