the choir wait Ascend p7 soirees latest
flagship phone packing a full HD display
quad-core processor and the latest
Android KitKat into an extremely skinny
body aside from the screen stretching 25
inches a p7 is very reminiscent of last
year's p6 it's around 6.5 milf ich sie
you'll barely notice it sliding into
your jeans and the metal back panel has
been replaced with Gorilla Glass 3 the
metal edges remain the same but the
headphone jack has been removed from its
awkward position on the side to a much
more sensible position on the top of the
phone the 5-inch display has a full HD
resolution and looks every bit as bright
and bold as you'd expect a flagship
phone to be inside is a 1.8 gigahertz
quad-core processor with 2 gigabytes of
RAM and it comes running the latest
Android 4.4 KitKat why has slapped its
emotion UI interface over the top which
I find to be a little awkward to use at
times mostly because there's no
dedicated app tray so all your apps and
widgets are scattered across the
numerous home screens for a various fun
themes to choose from though if you like
to customize your phone and there's a
simplified interface if you're not very
experienced with Android on the back is
a 13 megapixel camera but much more
impressive is the 8 megapixel
front-facing camera Huawei really wants
you to take a lot of selfies with this
thing and that is fine by me Huawei is
keeping tight-lipped about prices for
now but says but it will be competitive
when it launches in asia and europe in
june I'm Andrew hall of cnet and this is
the huawei ascend p7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
