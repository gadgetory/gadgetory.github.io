at Aladdin on Broadway I manage
everything up stage of the proscenium
there are 35 cast members that are on
stage but there are also another 60 crew
members backstage operating the show
those technicians do everything from
manage the set pieces and the props to
manage the lighting and the sound the
technology in this show is quite
extensive there's quite a few things
that are operated from a wireless
standpoint there's lots of moving pieces
both in the air on the stage and from
beneath the stage as a stage manager
it's our job to make sure that all of
those things operate in concert together
with the show and with the music so that
we have hopefully a technically superior
show to most anything that you've seen
we have a very sexy magic carpet that I
can't tell you anything about but it's
really cool
there's one point in friend like me
where we have four lifts operating at
the same time some of them are going up
some of they're going down these are our
quick lifts there are two of them in the
show these lifts travel at a rate that
we have calibrated to about 12 feet per
second pretty sure these were belt
driven lifts the lifts themselves are
clear plexiglass downstairs so the
technicians and the stage managers below
the deck have full eyes on the cast
member while they're in the lift both
when we load them up and in their rate
of travel and their cast members on
stage dancing around when we open these
holes up so they're our stage managers
on both sides of the stage as well as
technicians watching just to make sure
everybody's safe that nobody falls in
the hole while we load the cast member
up and then we give them lights to give
them all ready to go ready</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
