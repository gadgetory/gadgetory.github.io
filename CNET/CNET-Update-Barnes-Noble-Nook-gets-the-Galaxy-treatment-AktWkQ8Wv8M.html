strategy for the Nook I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your cnet update Barnes &amp;amp;
Noble is no longer making its own nook
tablets instead it's using samsung to
put an oak spin on a galaxy tablet the
bookstore is now selling the galaxy tab
for nook and when it comes to hardware
this 7-inch tablet is identical to
Samsung's existing galaxy tab for the
word nook isn't even printed anywhere on
the device but there are two differences
for starters the nuke version is 20
bucks less priced at a hundred and
eighty dollars and the second difference
it's preloaded with a special nuke
interface this is not just the nook app
it's more like a skin on the home screen
that shows book recommendations deals in
a shortcut to your library to sweeten
the deal Barnes &amp;amp; Noble is giving owners
five dollars in credit to spend along
with access to two hundred dollars worth
of best-selling content for free like
ebooks and TV episodes unlike Amazons
fire tablets the galaxy nooks give you
full access to all Google apps including
Google Maps because this tablet includes
GPS and Bluetooth if you're going to get
the galaxy nook you'll want to spend
that twenty dollars you saved on a 32
gig micro SD card because it only comes
with five gigs of free storage now
elsewhere in the world of gadgets sharp
has created quite the eye catching
smartphone I know sharp isn't a brand
you think of when it comes to
smartphones in fact it's been three
years since sharp came out with a
smartphone in the US but that all
changes with the aquos crystal it's a
unique design that has a 5-inch screen
that spans almost the entire front of
the phone there's barely any border
frame showing it has a lower screen
resolution than other phones but it is
priced lower to sprint is selling it for
just twenty dollars if you get a
two-year contract or you can pay 150
dollars on a prepaid plan and the uber
app is making news again this time it
wants to take on amazon google and ebay
as an instant delivery service instead
of just using the app to get a car to
pick you up on demand
you can ask uber to pick you up some
basic household goods from the store the
corner store service is only for
Washington DC residents right now but
even if you don't have over in your
neighborhood it's worth paying attention
to this quickly expanding service for
two reasons one ubers car pickup service
is now being integrated into other apps
and Starbucks signed on to be a partner
that increases exposure maybe we'll be
ordering a car with our coffee second
reason uber hired President Obama's 2008
campaign manager to help the app fight
opposition from the taxi industry and
create a positive public image for the
service that you're seen at tech news
update from our studios in New York I'm
