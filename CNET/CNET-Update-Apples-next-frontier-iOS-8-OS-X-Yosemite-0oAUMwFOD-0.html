tech universe I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your CNET update Apple revealed new
features in its operating systems that
create this seamless experience where
your family's Mac computer the iPad and
the iPhone they'll all sense each other
and work in harmony together Apple also
wants to be the control hub for other
smart gadgets in your home and on your
wrist the changes will come out in the
fall with the new iOS 8 and OS 10
Yosemite Apple showed off its new
operating systems at its Worldwide
Developers Conference known as WWDC but
here's a quick summary of the highlights
from the to our keynote presentation
let's start with the connectivity
between devices the new software can
tell when your iPhone or iPad is near
your Mac computer and vice versa so you
could start an email or document from
one device and hand it off to a nearby
device to finish you could take a phone
call from your desktop computer when
your iPhone is nearby and all your text
messages from your iPhone will show up
on your Mac computer the design and
controls of the new Yosemite is also
consistent with the features that you
find on your iPad or iPhone everything
has this cohesive look families with
multiple devices can also share files
downloaded from the App Store just as
long as all the accounts use the same
credit card iOS 8 has several new ways
to message your friends you could insert
voice recorded clips and videos within
your text messages and you can also
share your location inside of a text
that sounds a whole lot like whatsapp
and other trendy chat apps you gotta
wonder if people will just send voice
clips instead of calling the keyboard
also got jazzed up it's just words it
thinks you will say next but you also
will finally be able to download special
keyboard apps like Swift key which is
popular on Android Siri can be activated
without touching any buttons just say
hey Siri it's similar to Android when
you can just say ok Google to trigger
the voice assistant that's helpful if
you're driving there's a health kit that
can tie in all the data from multiple
fitness and health apps the home kit
wants to be a control center for all the
smart devices
made by other companies so one voice
command to Siri can make sure the house
is locked up and the lights are off in
OS 10 Yosemite Apple is taking on
Dropbox with a new feature called iCloud
drive so your files in the cloud are in
a folder right in your finder just like
before the new OS 10 will be a free
download in the fall probably when new
Macs and the new iPhone is announced app
developers did get pretty excited about
a new programming language that Apple
created it's called Swift and we'll have
to see if Swift will be helpful or
heartbreaker that your tech news update
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
