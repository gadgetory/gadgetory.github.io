watch whatever now that we've seen it
we've all been dazzled by an obscene
amount of beautiful slow-motion close-up
shots it's impossible not to have
lustful gadget cravings for this thing
that's where I come in
old Donald Bell here it's gonna be the
cold shower you need to clean that Apple
watch from your brain let's count down
five reasons you shouldn't buy it
starting off at number five it's
expensive starts at $349 and you know
that's the model you don't want once you
start decking it out with a leather
watch band and a bigger screen you've
probably got a $500 watch on your arm
I'm dropping that kind of cash this
thing better shoot lasers the deadly
kind at number four its iPhone only not
only will it not work properly without a
phone but it won't work with any phone
aside from iPhone 5 or above so now
you're paying $350 for a watch that
essentially prevents you from switching
to Android it's brilliant coming in at
number three the battery unlike those
dumb old watches that have been refined
for centuries your Smart Watch requires
daily charging from a funky proprietary
cable and just like your phone daily
charging means that battery will
inevitably wear out your overpriced
SmartWatch probably has a lifespan of
about 5 to 10 years while a $50 dumb
watch could probably outlive your
grandchildren progress I'm number 2 your
phone you know that thing you've been
using to figure out what time it is for
the past 10 years did you know that it
also takes and receives calls text
messages emails gives you directions and
tracks your health plays music it does
it all and it fits conveniently in your
pocket if you're feeling retro go buy
yourself a Casio now before we get to
the number one reason not to buy an
Apple watch how about we get to one
great reason why you should buy it
learn fashion you'll be the king of the
early adopting nerds and unlike a cool
new phone that spends most of its time
hidden away in your pocket the watch is
designed
to be a flashy emblem of your nerd pride
that you could admire all day long and
don't worry there's no way you'll be
ridiculed like those Google glass people
it's not like this obviously calls
attention to your sense of superiority
your disposable income or a lack of
common sense it's a totally different
thing all right and now the number one
reason you should just say no to the
Apple watch the Apple watch to remember
how the iPhone went from a toy to a 3G
phone with real GPS remember how the
iPad 2 is about half the thickness of
the original history has shown us over
and over the Apple is exceedingly great
at making second-generation products so
just wait so there you go five reasons
to save your money and skip the Apple
watch more information on smart watches
and all manner of wearables head over to
the wearable tech section of CNET and
more top fives from me
top 5 cnet.com I'm Donnell Bell thanks
