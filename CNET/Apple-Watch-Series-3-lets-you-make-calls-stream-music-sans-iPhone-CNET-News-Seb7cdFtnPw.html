it has cellular built-in now you can go
for a run with just your watch and still
be connected you can leave your phone
when you go to the beach or just run a
quick errand and it's really nice to
know you can be reached if needed while
staying in the moment you can receive an
important call with just your watch and
and the number is the same number as
your iPhone you don't have to manage a
separate number the apps you rely on
like messages just work in series at
your beck and call anytime anywhere you
can use maps and get directions and the
location for find my friend
automatically switches to your watch
when you're away from your phone and
third-party apps like WeChat work over
cellular as well and coming next month
cellular is going to change the way we
listen to music because with Apple watch
series 3 and Apple music you can stream
40 million songs on your wrist this
watch is connected over the AT&amp;amp;T
