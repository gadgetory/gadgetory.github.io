very beginning in 2007 with the NSA and
FISA and prism has been skeptical of and
has been scrutinizing those requests in
2007 yahoo filed a lawsuit against the
the new of the Patriot Act parts of a
prism and FISA we fought that we were
the the key plaintiff a lot of people
have wondered about that case and who
and who it was it was asked you
lobbyists we lost and then we can't not
you you weren't there but right but the
thing is like when you when you when you
lose so we leave fought we lost yeah you
if you don't comply it's treason yeah
trees oh and rich of pubs you know well
you didn't think now you're going
through the process of suing the dough
so now what we do is on each request we
review it we scrutinize it we push back
on a lot we push back on a lot of who
cuts from local government and we push
back on requests in you know in terms of
the NSA we can't talk about wanting
because they're classified you were up
the apple event yesterday and you seem
to like the fingerprint NSA scanner
thing on the phone and so why why would
you be in favor of anything like that
that they can gather more information
and artists so it's fine while know it's
funny because I didn't realize there was
a reporter it was a somebody at the end
of the man who just said like what did
you like and I step in your bow so I
didn't really know that it gotten picked
up with the uh um but I mean I think I
liked about it and sort of funny because
you mocked me once backstage at
TechCrunch so maybe it was on the web
because Mike was making fun of me
because I don't have a passcode on my
phone oh yeah I'm like my girls like are
you crazy and I was like look I just
can't do this past of a thing like yeah
15 times a day and then like but I saw
the fingerprint thing I was like and now
I don't have to yeah so yeah I was
excited about that and I just think that
like building in some of these smart
sensors into the small into
phone is really exciting when I look at
the state of what we're doing inside the
company i have said it's going to take
multiple years and by that i mean
probably three or more to really get the
company going in the direction that we
wanted to and having the growth really
be at the rate that we want it to be but
for for me it's really a chain reaction
of four things hiring the right people
having them build the right products
getting that too that turned into
traffic because traffic ultimately leads
to revenue online and we're doing really
well and support things products people
products traffic and revenue back to the
logo so what the happened here
right
well i mean i should say that i like the
way the logo turned out and i like the
way that we did it I mean we really
pride ourselves at Yahoo at being the
world's largest startup yep yeah we're a
big an established company we need to be
really entrepreneurial and our attitude
is to be really scrappy and the way that
we did the logo we kept it in house we
didn't have someone you know as an
external firm or consulting for him we
didn't spend millions of dollars doing
it we did in a way that came from a very
authentic place</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
