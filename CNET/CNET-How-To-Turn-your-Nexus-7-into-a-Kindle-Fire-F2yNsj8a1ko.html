getting ready to make the move to a
nexus 7 you probably want to take all of
your Amazon apps and media with you
today is how to I'm going to show you
how to turn your Nexus 7 into a super
Kindle the first step is easy use the
Google Play App Store to download
Amazon's Kindle app and amazon's mp3 app
these will give you access to your
kindle book library and also your amazon
mp3 collection once you have them
installed and setup you can even take
the extra step of kicking the google
books and google music apps out of the
launcher and then just put these in
their place now Google's not big on the
idea of letting you install apps from
stores they don't own so getting your
amazon purchase android apps on here
takes a little bit effort to do it
you'll first need to dive into the
tablet settings the quick way to get
there is to swipe down from the top and
tap the control panel icon under
security check the box for installing
apps from untrusted sources next you
want to install Amazon's App Store which
you have to get directly from amazon
launched the web browser on your tablet
or any computer you have nearby and head
over to amazon.com / app store look for
the get started link on the right click
it and enter your email address amazon
will email you a link that you can use
to download their app now to download it
to your Nexus 7 you'll need to open the
email on your tablet and click on the
link to start your installation when
you're done locate the app open it and
log in with your Amazon account under
settings you should see an option for my
apps where you can download any apps or
games that you purchase from amazon so
now you've got your amazon apps your
kindle books and your amazon mp3
collection what's missing well you can't
download amazon video content on the
Nexus 7 the same way you count the
kindle fire at least not at the moment
you can't even stream amazon video
directly from their site since adobe
flash isn't supported on the Nexus 7 you
just got to cozy up to the Google video
store which is actually pretty
comparable to what you get from Amazon
so there you go that's how to get most
of your Amazon content loaded up on the
Nexus 7 if you have any other how to
request you can find me on twitter
let me know if Facebook's warrior thing
you can subscribe to my updates there
