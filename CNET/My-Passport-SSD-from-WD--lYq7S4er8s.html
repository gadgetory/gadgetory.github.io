now this one's a huge deal because well
is really tiny I take a look at the
previous model here this is the Oh My
Passport this is a new my passport SSD
let me put this way this is me and this
is how most Asian are wrongfully
perceived and by the way the DRI is very
light in fact it seemed lighter than the
included cable right here yet
is rugged you can throw it around
without damaging not that you should do
that now definitely manage to swing the
dry so significantly because this is the
first one that houses a solid state
drive on the inside and that meat is
also the fastest my passport to date in
testing it has to sustain copy of speed
up some 300 megabyte per second that's
really fast and the DRI support the US
PC 3.1 gen2 with a type C port right
here and that means it works with all
the new computer with your PC and
Thunderbolt 3 port you can also use it
with existing computer with the regular
use VA port though with this adapter
right here which is also included now
the my passport SSD is pre formatted in
exFAT file system and that means it
could work with both Mac OS and Windows
right out the box without reformatting
at the drive feature encryption to
protect data against loss and theft
remember though if you turn on that
feature and you forget the password you
lose the data to you know this is the
agent drive for the who knew something
fast rugged yet tidy but it's not cheap
though unfortunately this one terabyte
drive here curtly goes for some three
hundred and sixty dollars and there are
two thing I don't like about first it
capped at just one terabyte and secondly
is a fingerprint magnet touch it and you
immediately add that to the long list of
reasons why we can't have nice things
but we do have a nice video about that
now and that's because I'm don't know
and this is the my passport SSD from EE</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
