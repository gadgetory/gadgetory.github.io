a first look at the HP Photosmart 7520
II all-in-one so this was a slight
upgrade to last year's model that's the
75 10 and it has almost all the same
features for 50 bucks more so if you
could find the 75 10 at a big discount
say like under 100 bucks and don't plan
to use the fax machine very much then
I'd say go with that one but that 75 20
does have a lot going forward that makes
it worth 200 bucks but let's take a
closer look this one is a multifunction
output device which is basically a fancy
way of saying that it has a built-in fax
machine copier and scanner in addition
to the printer of course
HP's recently stuck to a trend of
putting touch screens on all their
printers in lieu of hard buttons which
may take some getting used to but at
least they don't do it just for tech
sake and you can link the printer to
your computer using a USB cable in the
back but the best way to do it is
through a wireless network because then
you can take advantage of all the cloud
printing features so what is cloud
printing well it's a way to print
remotely using any web-connected device
now when you set up the wireless
connection you have the option of
creating an ePrint account and it gives
you the printers email address and you
can then use to send print jobs over the
air so for example if you gave this
printer to a student to use in a dorm
room you could use the email address to
send and automatically print out family
photos to keep them updated on what's
going on at home there's also other
useful features from the touchscreen and
wireless connection the home screen lets
you download various apps just like you
would on a smartphone and hp's
eprintcenter is the online hub for more
apps you can download more apps and
those include entertainment printouts
like crossword puzzles and coloring
pages for the kids but there's also
various apps for news updates weather
tickets and much more the big difference
in a 7520 over the 7510 is the addition
of the dedicated fax machine now the
7510 cut cost by including eFax instead
of a phone line that eFax is a software
utility that brings fax functionality to
low-end models by sending documents over
the Internet
now the 7520 on the other hand does have
a separate phone line but again if
you're not going to use the fax machine
anyway I suggest doing a search for that
HP photosmart 7510 is the same model as
the 7520 and
probably get it for less you can check
out more details in my for review on
cnn.com but that's gonna do it for me
I'm Justin you you just took a first
look at the HP Photosmart 7520 EE
all-in-one printer
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
