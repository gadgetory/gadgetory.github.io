speaker could come with a large
touchscreen at least that's according to
Bloomberg with two sources saying that
Amazon wants to expand the echo speaker
line-up with a high-end model that comes
with a 7-inch touchscreen and Amazon may
debut this new product sometime in the
first quarter of 2017 the echo and it's
voice assistant Alexa have been a huge
success for Amazon it's estimated that
amazon sold more than 5 million echo
speaker since it came out in november of
2014 and 2 million were just from this
year that's according to a report from
the consumer intelligence research
partners if you're unfamiliar with the
echo products they are more than just
something that can play music and tell
you the weather voice commands can also
control numerous other smart home
products such as smart lights or
thermostat so if Amazon wants to expand
on the success of the voice controlled
speaker playing a touch screen on it
could be a way to create a high-end
product in the lineup that people may
want to keep in their kitchen for a
quick glance at the weather calendar
appointments news and maybe as a control
screen hub for all the smart devices in
your home Bloomberg sources say this new
echo would be designed differently with
a larger high-end speaker and a screen
that tilts upward so you could see it
easily when it's sitting on a countertop
Google is hoping to ride the wave of
echo success with its own new smart
speaker called Google home but if
there's a premium echo with a screen it
could make the Google home look like
it's one step behind now before I sign
off there's one more bit of news to
report after five years these little
cnet update news reports are coming to
an end yeah our last cnet update will be
wednesday but i'm not going away and
we're still giving you the news we're
just switching things up a bit on you to
keep things fresh I'll have more details
in our final episode so stay tuned I'm
