studios its episode 2 38 of the 359
podcast and in the house today we've got
Alfred Inge and Ben Fox Reuben and today
we are talking about the xbox 1 X X 1x X
1x Xbox one Xbox if you say it enough
times in a dark room in the bathroom
Candyman shows up I am I am sticking
with Xbox Xbox
I'm dubbing it here everybody out there
to hang on to that
it's the Xbox Xbox there's a lot to talk
about with it
you can't spell there's no box one X
without xxx starring Vin Diesel right so
we'll get out with with v3 it's going to
be pretty gamer heavy today we'll talk
about the Xbox one X that's the big
thing that came out of v3 we'll also
talk about some mini consoles that are
coming out from Atari and Sega we'll
also throw in something on the iPad pro
yeah the reviews are in we got our hands
on it and you know we'll be sharing my
thoughts on it but we'll talk about it
let's make this podcast happen podcast
oh right
sending your questions and comments of
course Brian we'll get to as many as you
can at the end of the show
and now let's podcast all right here we
go in three two
welcome to the 359 I'm Alfred hang I'm
Ben Fox Rubin at e3 on Sunday Microsoft
unveiled the Xbox one X where they're
calling it their most powerful console
yet it's a biggest update as a big you
know graphics boost and speed jump and
will be available on November 7th for
499 dollars it was originally named as
project Scorpio and they're also saying
it's going to be the smallest Xbox ever
now bet they've got 4k and VR support as
part of it but so far there's been no
games for that yet so does any of this
actually even matter
oh come on it matters what look you
can't say we can do all these things and
then like not have anything to show for
it okay you are right on the VR front I
actually read in our story today that
not only is VR not available out of the
gate for this but it might not even be
available in 2018 either it's just
what's the point like you could have
waited for that I mean like they're
still fresh off the Xbox 1s right and
then and then it's just like oh we've
got all these cool new things for it but
it's also not
okay you are gonna get a graphics boost
from this even if you don't have a 4k TV
it is going to provide better graphics
for your current games no there aren't
going to be exclusive games for the Xbox
one X at least for now but uh you're
gonna get better graphics and you're
also gonna get faster speeds faster load
times so it just seemed inpatient like
like they could have clearly done all of
these things for the Xbox one s and then
like waited a little bit longer for sure
1x the the s also only came out was it
last year that's my point they like they
could have waited like a little bit for
that and then just because people were
still using the Xbox one pretty heavily
by the time they came out with the 1s
yeah just seems like very rushed I don't
know like if you get this feeling from
like this all this like news no I
I think foundationally it seems like a
really impressive machine where you are
going to get a lot of really impressive
stuff that maybe a year or two from now
he's going to make a lot more sense and
some of the stuff about it sounds really
really cool so I am personally
interested and excited that it's out
there but I don't disagree with some of
your your knocks about it you know it's
already all available on the PlayStation
4 just saying ok ok um next up the
reviews are in for the latest iPad pro
our writer Scott Stein got his hands on
it and said it improves on drawing and
editing capabilities that the iPad pro
already had but it's true potentials
would be revealed in once iOS 11 comes
out right I just it just seems like if
you're in the market for a new iPad you
really should just wait until September
yeah of course but that being said like
this is supposed to get us one step
closer to complete laptop replacement
yeah it gets that a little bit more at
least that's according to but that's
that's that's coming with iOS 11 with
you know the files exploring things like
that right Oh totally so so if you want
to wait until sometime for sure but it's
going to be the same price regardless so
if you want to buy it sooner than that
and start to mess around with it in the
you know with iOS 10 to me that doesn't
seem like there's anything wrong with
that that's not like it's going to be a
bad experience for you but do you see
people like actually starting to
legitimately replace their laptops with
like a tablet hybrid kind of thing like
the iPad pro is in general
from what we've seen I think it's mostly
been the surface not as much with the
iPad but maybe this helps Apple get a
little bit closer to that and next up
you know I don't know if you've heard
about this small company called Nintendo
but uh you know around last year they
were very successful with the NES
classic and now Sega an Atari - video
gaming Giants are hoping to do the same
with the Genesis and the Atari what is
it like on machine
yeah the pong machine okay you know
people are gonna buy that thing I don't
know because these games are not from my
generation so I'm wondering what like
your thoughts are on this because I grow
up if any of these games obviously the
Sega Genesis flashback that's what
they're calling it it's going to be this
mini console is definitely working on
the nostalgia of you know the same thing
with the NES classics so my expectation
is is that people would want to buy that
they like sonic they like Mortal Kombat
that that to me seems like a good
opportunity well that's all the time
that we had for today's podcast if you
um want want to see more of it check us
out on cnet.com I'm Alfred I'm Ben Fox
Ruben thanks for listening alright so we
have a few alternative name suggestions
going on in the chat Xbox one X Xbox one
sex that's the combination of Xbox 1s
and Xbox one that is a peak creativity
we have at this table as well if I was
Brian Gionta pop and legend if if this
was a Bryant on show I'd start singing
Xbox one X when I sex you up or
something like that
YAG time I'm sure he's giving on it yes
and we'll do a music video it's one SSX
tricky volume 5 featuring Dante from the
Devil May Cry series this is this is the
continuation of our referencing of
Bryant on on every podcast isn't that in
his contract yes what is not on screen
the lesser that lesser podcasts have to
rest at ant represent where's Brian
so let's hear from everybody out there
if you are super excited about the Xbox
one XX bunks or not some people
definitely are some people are like it's
just a $500 graphics boost it's not
doing much for me that's I like Striders
world comment in general the e3 equals
cringefest and
this is very tricky on the notes on that
one I said like really want to go to e3
when I was a kid like I'd watch like the
coverage on tech TV which turned into g4
eventually and it was just like oh I
really want to go to that and then it
just got to a point where like now I see
it for what it is I don't want to be
there yeah it's very nerdy why that's
not me why I don't want to go it just it
just seems like a whole bunch of nothing
mmm I guess that's true that being said
I think hey do you wanna go to something
cool you know I I still think the Xbox
1x is it seems to me to be a fairly big
deal again I don't think that we're
really going to see the total benefits
of it now or maybe even next year but it
really does help Microsoft get a little
bit closer to what PlayStation has
particularly with VR but it's not quite
there yet it's not fully baked but I
think it does provide the foundation for
that I mean I just wish they made it
more like PC gaming where it was it
basically you could get games from like
Steam on it and stuff like that that
would like actually be something really
cool for the Xbox one X expects why
don't know what the initials for Xbox
one X spell out Xbox it's such a meta
like whoa console name holy moly
so I'm just pretty awesome they should
have just called it like the Xbox Triple
X or something like that
I don't know yeah maybe we'll get there
at some point I gonna run down the
prices on this so yeah got the Xbox one
which is like from 2013 now two hundred
and fifty dollars you're gonna pay twice
as much for 99 for the Xbox one X I
think you can also get the Xbox one s
which came out last year also for 250 if
you want to go to the ps4 that's also
roughly 250 299 depending on whether
it's on sale and the ps4 Pro which gets
you 4k and also VR is $400 so it's $100
less than this Xbox one X and it's
available now and it has executives and
you can play VR on it already
PlayStation 4 room there you go there
you go
get oh man switch this off or Microsoft
Watchers but I mean okay it is what it
is you're not wrong
pop and legend says it
should have been called Xbox one elite
or something like that I I would really
like to find Microsoft's naming
Department because how do they jump from
Xbox to Xbox 360 then to one then to one
Aetna and then from s to X I don't I
don't understand it it doesn't make a
lot of said we would have been cool mark
my words the next one's called the Xbox
box Xbox box box box put it into
calendars now I mean to me calling they
yeah I mean like PlayStation 4 when they
came out there like souped-up version is
like PlayStation 4 Pro right that means
it makes it makes a lot of sense is
slightly higher price point station 4x12
know isn't it like in tech circles you
had an X to the bottom into the end of
something it suppose yeah some sort of
way
dalinar idea 90 okay I did either
extreme to it I'm getting tired of
defending this thing forget it I'm
giving up this position yeah I mean it's
just like what are we really shooting
for here Tony Yayo says I still have my
original Xbox one my name my name is
Jeff he says I still have my xbox 360
Jeff me too I'm a very casual gamer I'm
not that excited about this I was kind
of thinking like oh maybe it's finally
time to update I've skipped a generation
let's go let's go down this primrose
path and nope no thanks okay fair enough
by the field hey I had an Xbox 360 for
about a year
yeah mine too yeah it's the graphics are
really not that good I upgraded to the
PlayStation 4 about a year ago it was
totally worth it for me especially
because the price kept dropping where I
got it for like 250 it might be because
I've never like played on like the
current generation where like the
graphics are like stunning but like
whenever I play my xbox 360 I'm like
this is fine I'm okay man I I really
didn't feel that way it wasn't as
enjoyable or interesting to me so that's
why I like stopped playing as much with
the 360 and to me that's when it was
worth it to upgrade to a new one
however convincing people about 4k is
another thing entirely yes like are you
really gonna notice the graphic
difference you're probably going to need
to get a new TV in and even when you do
get a new TV you've got to get like a
giant one so you're really going to see
a lot of those differences when I then
put on like the 4k glasses yeah you
could do that too but that's been the
problem for TV manufacturers that's been
a problem for the hardware makers really
convincing people to
jump over this whole 4k thing I mean
like HDR is another idea to get people
to buy new hardware but I don't know
nearly as much about that so I'm not
gonna talk too much on that is anybody
actually excited for the Sega Genesis
and Atari whatever like remake no been
given names yet or they're just exactly
I think it's the Sega Genesis flashback
according to our story
I'm sorry disparity Sega I'm looking at
it right now Sega Genesis flashback I
think this is way cool I've literally
never played any like Atari consoles I
was really eight years ago yes yeah I
mean I did play Atari and but but like
for me the nostalgia really kicks in
with the Sega Genesis and the NES
classic frankly I feel like the NES
classic was like that was the sweet spot
like the Sonic the Hedgehog games sure
isocitrate I'm still I just read down
loaded yeah dog 3 the other day yeah but
I I still think that like it was a big
mistake for Nintendo to just not keep
churning out those NES classics until
well say Jamie there there Sega
definitely is capitalizing on our
mistake being that they're gonna let you
plug cartridges in right oh that would
be sweet take that true that's what I
heard yes I just one of the rumors yeah
like it comes no say it didn't happen
something's not working
Sega didn't have as bad of a dust
problem because I had a dust guard on
the actual console as opposed to
Nintendo would they go dupa drop drawer
oh my god I love that drop drawer there
was like they had to make it a game for
kids to start their games I had I had a
buddy a junk there was there was in
college somebody still had one of those
old systems and there was like such like
this this beautiful like effort that he
had to do to get it to work perfectly he
blew on it for like three or four
minutes and then had to put it right on
the edge yep for it to actually work any
and you know 50% of the time even after
like that entire process like it still
wouldn't work but I guess I was part of
the fun do you know do you know if the
new Sega console will also support 4k
yes absolutely well that's Sonic the
Hedgehog in 4k pixels
yeah there's seven
I just jump back into the chat before we
gotta wrap it up of the day strategies
world says so many new iterations of
existing generation consoles is new
generation console more of a marketing
campaign yeah yes that's a lot of it is
my xbox one SX that's the that's the
point
beta elite that's something I've always
bothered me where it's like it used to
be like you would wait like 10 something
years and then they'd come out with like
this whole new one that like is like
really different and now it's just like
every two years it's like almost like
you're getting a new phone but with like
a console which is like very frustrating
right and and the changes are mental
what's that just a lame paint job yeah I
I would argue that this one is a more
significant upgrade but you're not going
to really see the benefits of it right
now by brick walling just like Apple I I
think I agree I agree with the general
sentiment I don't think that was not
true have you seen the Nintendo switch
alright that's pretty cool yeah I mean
like and that thing is selling like
hotcakes yes put in the same time as a
whole new look no come on
either way at the same time Nintendo
really did not focus on graphics 4k and
all that stuff yeah no it didn't need my
focus on the game is good enough then
like the graphics like really shouldn't
be like the deciding factor of whether
or not it's a fun game it's you're
discussing we were jealous ah fickle
differences between Nintendo talking
about how excited we were for like the
Sega Genesis whatever that's really it
like the obviously the graphics are not
4k on that so like that's my point
they're fun games they like last the
test of time and as long as the graphics
are like decent enough I don't think
that like it really matters if you know
mark you can count the hairs on Mario's
mustache yeah which I would like to do
back back to pop and legend in the chat
why can't console makers just focus on
making gains I just want the games to be
fun are we missing something in this
generation
I think that's weird like I mean look at
us we're sitting here getting way more
excited about the rebirth about Sega
Genesis I'm writing the nokia a classic
retain collections which they don't have
the best graphics obviously they don't
even perform all that well sometimes but
there's a nostalgia factor we all have
pleasant recollections and memories of
experiences with these games maybe
they're heavily biased they're probably
heavily biased
by then they're like look at all this
under the hood and we're like all right
I mean like look at how crazy like
popular like minecraft is which is not
like a graphics driven game it's like
good gameplay yeah which I did see an
article that like oh like Minecraft Xbox
one X is gonna come in 4k really Y or is
the point if it's so they can put 4k on
a box that's it like what's the like
it's minecraft alright in the in the
defense of graphics I mean like
uncharted 4 is a beautiful game to play
and it's when the graphics are smooth
and it's a lot of fun I've also played
like some PlayStation VR not allied it's
very immersive it's very interesting so
I'm I'm happy that we've moved on from
the second Genesis ultimately yes but I
appreciate what you guys are saying as
far as those games as far as gameplay as
far as nostalgia and a ton of value and
obviously a lot of money to be made on
them too yeah we gotta talk at least
once about the iPad Stratos world says
do you think Apple doesn't update the
MacBook Air because the iPad pro is
being marketed as a laptop and therefore
is the entry-level laptop now great
question they're not English yeah that
makes a lot of sense especially since
like they didn't really talk that much
about the MacBook Air that much more so
those like pro our desktop client and
then the iPad the iPad pro yeah but like
I would argued so the MSRP on the iPad
pro the new one is 650 the MacBook Air
is $9.99 so I think that Apple probably
still wants you to buy one other MacBook
Pros which is no the pros so the air is
a thousand bucks the pros I think start
around 1200 or 1300 something like that
so they probably would rather that you
didn't buy a pro because you're spending
less money I mean if you think about it
those like the biggest selling point for
the MacBook Air was like how light it
was mmm and then if you've got an iPad
pro which is like definitely lighter
than the then the MacBook Air is it's
just one of those things where it's you
know I do think they're trying to phase
out the MacBook Air they've been
trilling trying to kill off the MacBook
Air for a long time however it just
keeps selling like it's just
really very much a sweet spot for a lot
of people as far as a laptop is
concerned yeah
for whatever reason Apple along with a
lot of these other tech companies like
Nintendo does not want to give its
customers what they want they want to
tell their customers what they want and
I feel like this is another example of
that so I and and if somebody were to
ask me you know oh I need a new laptop
like should I get an iPad pro or should
I get a surface or whatever I personally
would not switch over from a laptop like
to actually get actual work done I still
yeah strongly believe in laptop I think
the surface pro is like a decent like
laptop alternative though I can't speak
that probably more that because it has
like Windows 10 on it still like you can
do all of the things that you that the
iPad pro is supposed to do with iOS 11
right like already on a surface pro yeah
all right before we wrap it up uh Tony
is asking where's Jeff Bakalar he's
actually at e3 right now yeah he'll be
there all week unveiling more and more
coverage I know Nintendo's tomorrow and
we'll be rolling out clips from
everything so he's on the site there and
we'll make sure to have him yeah we'll
try to get him on when on the show when
he gets back to do like a recap of his
III experience that would be great and
on that note probably a good place to
wrap it up for the day yep if you liked
