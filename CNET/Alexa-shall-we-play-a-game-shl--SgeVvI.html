again are we the game are we still in
the game this house spooky it's like
existence companies are looking at ways
to incorporate Amazon Alexa into toys
and games Mattel has a puzzle solving
game that works with Alexa it's called
escape room in a box though werewolf
experiment
you don't need an echo speaker to play
but it's supposed to enhance the
experience journey into the unknown
the werewolf experiment rules a lot of
stuff here
you need a timer pencils no phones
that's cheating seriously stop open this
when you're ready to start the game
let's open it so should we do it yeah
we'll just do it okay we went into this
without doing any research we wanted to
be totally surprised and you know what
it's not clear at all what we were
supposed to say to Alexa to make her
work
quark oh my god how could you do this in
15 minutes I don't believe it okay I
feel like if I do this in four hours
where does the echo come in there is no
indication of anything technically R
because you don't need to have Alexa you
know she should I have said Alexa start
like a game there's no indication here
if we looked it up on our phone and
you're not supposed to use a phone in
this game we later saw we were supposed
to say ask escape room for a hint or
tell escape room we won the game how are
you supposed to remember those freezes
under pressure Alexa play escape the
room in a box I'm gonna keep solving
puzzles why is there a car escape room
in a box
the werewolf experiment from Mattel
games welcome to escape room in a box
the werewolf expand
you can ask for instructions or start
game start gaem we should have done this
at the beginning
fYI that's what you do you have to start
it yourself okay so it's a music turret
okay using the doc knows latest
experiments please listen to the music
relax don't bother to do the puzzles and
you'll all be wearables in an hour no
distraction so if were just ambient
music I expected more to ask for
assistance or is it gonna just
automatically say things I had high
hopes for the music part I had high
hopes for being able to actually
interact with it I thought it was gonna
be maybe maybe they're assuming smart
leave it maybe you don't
Alexa what do I do there is a lot I can
do such a disconnect no I like say I
want you to solve my puzzle for me all
right
Alexa play escape room in a box so
putting Alexa in a game has potential to
be good if the trigger phrases were more
obvious to us when we started let's goes
to show you that you ain't helping no
yes it doesn't make it werewolf that's a
total buzzkill also what if anyone comes
and suddenly activates Alexa which
happens like every 50 seconds in my arm
then they're gonna ruin your escape roof
okay well almost hit the next guy hit
book only 15 minutes in but I can tell
you are going down sometimes in a real
escape room someone is like watching you
and they're like I'm judging you
watching they'll say something like oh
like that will in turn it turn it around
yes a little Internet is watching and
judging us yes there's exactly no no
stir it no pressure is there second
piece of little white paper there's
white paper here oh look everywhere no
we didn't look everywhere we totally
failed now this game more than once
okay ah oh this is like in school when
you get the four chairs
yeah got to tell you who are you gonna
marry here I live in a mansion or a
shack when I wish it only these games
yeah I go special espy ecial and then we
want special special full specialty
specialty oh I get it what finish is the
word specialty is - oh that's the answer
so I left 74 come on all right with one
minute and 15 seconds in it in an hour
with the help of some answers make sure
not to mess anything up it's a one-time
experience
we're not we already solved it if only
she knew you did we need you I think
this was the most super fluid experience
I could have done without the echo
actually was really distracting to have
that I liked the music but I now want to
like tell her like I everyone but all I
did was play music I really thought
there was going to be something
interactive like you actually thought
you'd open something you would say ask
your friends like the echo it was a
design ask Alexa for help that's gonna
no we don't want you know we're done we
solved it well you would hope that maybe
she would have extra clues but that's
not the case because you don't need her
to have the clues but you know what
they're doing in a lot of these games
when they incorporate Alexa is have
music or scorekeeping there's no way for
her to keep score in us what we have
with us if there's an extra rule or
command we should be saying I don't have
that with him on Hannah because I'm not
supposed to have my phone with me
because having my phone with me would be
cheating right so you're stuck with this
now I also think this shows the limits
of where voice assistance is right now
because this thing does everything and
so like was we discovered the moment you
invoke it which I will not name because
it'll happen it interrupts and you could
launch something else and when we try to
it restarted the entire experience so
there was no resume enga√±o of the
experience and then how do you interact
with it we don't know it's a total black
box in a future version they should
include something we're like here are
the commands but that would have thrown
off the ambience of like you have
puzzle to solve I would like if you were
asking if you if it gave you the
invocation like the say this to it to
the echo and then I did and then it
started an audio riddle that you had to
solve that would be interesting I I was
surprised there wasn't that you could do
that but you have to tell people what
the invocation it's like a magic spell
you know like that we won Alexis we won
she's a cool timer with cool music it's
interesting to think of her as a
scorekeeper or a rule explainer so I can
see this evolving in future products
Alexa aren't you excited for us alright
Scott congratulations are not being
aware we did it graduates is not being a
voice assistant we human beings won this
round humans 1 Alexa 0 Alexa total
distraction we did not enjoy your help
on this one
sorry I don't know that one Alexa play
