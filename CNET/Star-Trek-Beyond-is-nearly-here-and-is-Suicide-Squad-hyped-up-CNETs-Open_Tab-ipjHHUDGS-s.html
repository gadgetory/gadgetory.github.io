is a pop culture event kicks off july
twenty first and it's not just about the
cosplay and toys for me it's about the
toys but this year we've got plenty of
movies getting the spotlight attention
at the convention this summer alone
we've got Suicide Squad we've got Star
Trek beyond who knows what beyond it
that's where we're going what movies are
you guys looking forward to and letter
you're not allowed to say X Files
because your next box hat we know you're
excited about that franchise you are now
here now not all have to talk about that
so yeah what movie what movies are you
guys looking forward to in the maguey
communiversity about suicide squad but
that's just because I'm obsessed with
Margot Robbie who is gorgeous and she's
what is the name of the character Harley
Quinn yes well that's that's kind of
important i forgot that part I was
important yeah i'm not into the i could
be into the geek side of it she's just
like her I just like I'm just gonna am
our garage thing yeah alright I'm into
that she's great she is yeah I don't
what is she done uh she was in wolf of
Wall Street oh she was a very sexy okay
why it's really like Margaret I respect
the hell out of that all right so what
about what about suicide squad are you
are you into the whole sort of back
story about what that group of villains
are like what that is yeah they're all
like villains who are now coming to help
save the day is that the premise I
really just know that Margot Robbie is
in it okay fair enough you've got a
one-track mind apparently so I so line
of woody what are you what are your
thoughts on that movie um I I like the
idea that it's another comic book based
movie sure and I'm Pro comic book movies
so you know the more the merrier right
so I wish you success yeah but there's a
but here I can hear it comin screamin
coming in high just like I don't know
yet
I'm not quite on board yet I don't know
what it is I know what it is what is it
you're just not convinced yet babe
that's probably what it is not convinced
of what how good it's gonna actually be
forgot a hype around it and I understand
why yeah so I support that sure but at
the same time I'm like is that story
gonna be really as good as their promise
I don't know looks good though it was I
got it good I like the fact that will
smith is like getting his hands dirty
with a comic book movie I think that's
really cool the whole Jared little Joker
thing yeah not island of and don't get
me wrong that's Jordan Catalano okay
like I go way back with jared leto okay
you know it's a fan do you know no my
so-called life no no oh right got take
25 right 22 oh yeah you have to get that
any good one in the building feel old
hey so we needed to do uh so he I don't
know I feel like the all the hype
surrounding that movie was a little
muddied when they debuted him as the
Jill right not that he's an incapable at
inferior actor he's a brilliant I
something didn't jive right right what
was it just a little all right just
can't put my finger on it I think people
were maybe a little unimpressed with the
depiction of the Joker that they were
trying to go for with that I mean people
who've played the Joker it's a pretty
high-profile pedigree I memory talking
jack nicholson heath ledger okies was a
joker oh right it's crazy yeah like
Margot Robbie exactly okay that's oh I
mean come on let's be honest it kind of
just did it for you yummy I mean we're
both for both he did it for both of us I
know um yeah I don't know what it is I
feel like things kind of got started off
a little weird with that I don't know i
mean there's capable people making this
movie it's not like this is a de left
field so I'm cautiously optimistic how
about that way I'm ready to put it let's
leave it at that all right then we have
the new star trek film um I really dug
the first one that JJ Abrams did ya
saying people kind of didn't like a sec
the middle one what was that called like
more stars in trucking basically that's
what of what was happening yeah I don't
remember do we know this is the queen of
the memory what the hell that movie was
called Brian um you know he's like I
don't know a darkness seemed to the dark
oh thank you thank you they went to the
darkness yeah um I don't like it I you
know I guess I'm cuz I'm a fan of um
what's his name God here I go again Zach
Queen don't know I'm the one who played
out the main guy the main bad guy the
main bad guy Oh Eric Bana erich von all
those the first gonna be playing doctor
Oh cumberpatch guy Benedict cumberpatch
oh yeah comber ditch that went out of
Comber bitch but uh oh I didn't say that
that's what they're called the groupies
are comfort yeah really oh my god that's
how they close i'm not that one but i do
like his work okay yeah i thought i
thought i already did a great job sure I
enjoyed it oh I feel like this one the
the hype is kind of lukewarm agreed
however on the social side yes Zulu is
supposed to be gay oh and this one
what's which I was I mean kids pretty
people are pretty excited about it
except for the guy who used to play him
was it Sulu right do it do it yeah okay
the guy you used to play him is not
happy about it well cry me a river right
what are we gonna do get what times all
right yeah roll up how about you grow up
all right so that's cool there's new
Marvel stuff coming out that was
arranged Irene golden Doctor Strange
what do we think about dr. strange I'm
all on board I know there's some some
conflicts in regards to some of the
characters we'd like to explain to me
because I I Know Who Doctor Strange is
that's about it so what's what are the
conference people are talking about
there's that I want to bring it up but
no this is a safe place well they says
some some people are saying is being
whitewashed oh I'm just like really I
like the whole thing like they're
changing it up sometimes I'm against it
but this one it looks like it'll work
okay um when the other bad easels may
not be as bad as people are gonna think
here so that's another thing you were
kind of like I
no I think it's gonna work out Sam and
he thoughts on Mr strange I know less
than you do but it sounds thrilling okay
that he was a very genuine opinion I'm
sorry I'm sorry um it's also a very
exciting because it's more deals with
more supernatural side right sure comics
which they kind of tried to do in four
but they were timid eight okay something
on how you really you know your stuff oh
yes abhi set up around this yeah no I
but I really when I saw dr. strange to
the comic book movie I was like wow this
is really good stuff I'm really glad
that I charted put it on the big screen
I think people will enjoy it okay there
you have it and then finally uh I love
the first one of this franchise it's a
relatively new comic book series
guardians of the galaxy two who if
you're a fan of my podcast for four sho
i'm actually interviewed james gunn the
director of it sorry to be a psycho we
did that like years ago way before there
was a guardian or a galaxy uh-huh way
before I galaxy way before there was any
of that it was important you never seen
in spider-man Wow no it was red he was
actually directed or wrote a video game
at the time so we had them in there oh
pretty cool you can go back into the
archives and check that out but la the
sequel to guardians of the galaxy did
you see the first one I did would you
think I loved it yeah and I'm very
excited for the second because I mean
I'm into every type of this kind of like
action or superheroes and this was sort
of a funny satire love that and I was
into that for me like almost scratched
that the itch of like a hitchhiker's
guide yeah yeah that kind of thing I
think I just really dig those like goofy
sort of space opera things yeah and this
really you know did it for me lighter
with you think same yeah thank you
feeling it okay before we take questions
let's talk real quick Star Wars rogue
one like lot of information coming out
about that there's like a new there's a
new droid there's yeah I think I like
don't want to know this stuff I just
want to sue them exactly people aren't
really happy until they show you every
land
thing is moving I know like a bug a
giant buzz gotta go he's got a weird you
seen it right yeah he's got a hot head
seems like k2s 05 yay 6 11 12 yeah g 11
12 I'm like really what so there's all
this stuff that's coming out about Star
Wars some of it is a little spoilery
we're not going to get into it new
artwork they did they have a whole
behind the scenes a video it did I saw
it it's amazing you want to get psyched
about that may watch that can you like
give us like a quick crash course like
without spoiling sure well basically
they just take you into a lot of the
like tracking shots will show the
director and the camera guy like
actually moving with all the characters
and they show the big explosions now a
lot of it was shot outside without a
green screen and it's really exciting
alright and the music that goes along
with the video really gets you yeah
right it's tough look I'm not gonna lie
I thought what was it the latest Star
Wars was I thought was okay for a carbon
copy of a movie yeah people playing yeah
I'm into the rogue one stuffing yeah I
did they all knew I'm hearing we have
some questions from the control room
what do you got for us in there hey
everybody so we have a few questions
from our live chat Jason Oh Anna co
comments as well jason says that he
can't wait for the guardians of galaxies
to see well if I pronounced that right
wants to know your thoughts about if you
heard the news about a young lady taking
over the Iron Man role but i'll be in
the comics and raymond wanted to ask if
you guys think the enterprise will race
other starships in star trek and a quick
shout-out to dean and youtube hi we're

happening right now at this very you are
freaking out man um so will the
enterprise race other is that a Star
Trek they don't know I don't know I've
never heard of that that would be weird

be good yeah are you meeting that I
raised to set looks for 27 where he goes

interesting topic the Iron Man as a
female character I heard a little bit
about that isn't she a young black woman
and she's like a badass right where did
she doing cool things oh it's come first
of all all over seen it so that's how I
heard oh I just heard my ear she's 15
years old yeah she's a 15 year old like
brilliant warrior type of like an
Antoinette stark sort of situation here
yeah here's the cool thing right well
here's where I want to know and again
I'm a full transparency I don't know
enough about this whole story but so is
she like because if it's if everyone
knows like everyone knows Tony Stark's
Iron Man right so this girl is I like

universe right you're right it does
sound like a vitamin right right have
you taken your iron tea today exactly
pergi it's really great what was the
other questions when it wasn't it was
there another one the other over rod or
the other question was do you guys think
the enterprise would race other
spaceships in Star Trek right right did
we talk about it what yeah we talked
about that it wouldn't it wouldn't round
I wouldn't race they wouldn't raise and
iron teen is our newest friend who would
win in a race iron teen or the
enterprise oh now that what the
enterprise is thousands of times hotter
girls like a speed of light what if iron
teen is actually several miles tall oh
oh boy you're mine oh my god while our
minds are being blown over that comment
Mike you have another question for us
yeah one more question from Raymond he
was wondering do you guys have yes
follow the Fast and the Furious films
and they're getting sequels what are
your thoughts on that franchise okay
real quick they shot
a huge scene like two blocks away what I
did excellent sure yeah I did that's
very exciting so many freaking cars it
was I don't know the old fashioned
furiously yeah I mean by that's eight
now look where are they like what brace
on the moon already cuz ya know it you
have to change the plane literally like
we have to just go to the moon yes go
darkness yeah go to the moon and then
I'll watch it go to the moon and race
the enterprise and I arcane and I hot
teen be Vin Diesel in like a charger or
like a mustang cobra like a Shelby right
yeah who that like nitrous I'm teen that
be coerced with her like nuclear
accelerator yeah Enterprise I can go the
freaking speed of light or wherever
passive and go yeah I think it's faster
and faster that I'm sure who's gonna win
