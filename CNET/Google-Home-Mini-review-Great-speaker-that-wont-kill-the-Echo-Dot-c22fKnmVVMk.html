smart speaker the Google home mini it
packs everything that people liked about
the original Google home into a much
smaller much more affordable package it
isn't as loud but it's just as smart and
it only costs 50 bucks that's the same
price and the same pitch as its rival
the Amazon echo dot that product was and
still is a smash success for Amazon and
Google wants in on the action
hard to blame them so how did the two
compare well as you might expect they
have a lot in common
they can both stream music they can both
answer random questions and tell bad
jokes they can turn your smart home
devices on and off and a whole lot more
they both keep learning new tricks too
which makes it fun to own one to set
itself apart the home mini sports a
distinctive fabric top design that comes
in your choice of three colors it's a
clean simple build
the only physical button is a switch in
the back that meets the microphone
though you can tap the top to play and
pause tap and hold to wake up the
assistant or tap the sides to adjust the
volume its fancier looking than the dot
but I think there might be some style
over substance here for instance it
can't really pick the thing up without
accidentally toggling those finicky
volume controls and those white
indicator lights are a little hard to
see from across the room especially on
this chalk colored model the dot is much
easier to see at a distance for that
reason I recommend going with the darker
gray charcoal color if you're thinking
of buying like the speaker that came
before it the home mini can also
distinguish between different voices
which lets the speaker tailor custom
responses for different family members
Alexis still can't do that
the whole minis other edge over the dock
is that it offers noticeably better
sound quality just listen to them both
tell a joke when is it door not a door
when it's ajar
did you hear about the guy thrown in
jail for refusing to take a nap he was
resisting arrest of course if you really
care about sound quality then you'll
probably want to hook this thing up with
a stronger set of speakers that's an
option but only if those speakers are
hooked up with a chromecast Audio with
the echo dot you can connect with
existing speakers directly via aux cable
or Bluetooth no extra gizmos necessary
that's a much much better approach and a
smarter ones since connecting with
external speakers is such a common use
case here
I predict that lots of people are going
to end up choosing the dot over the home
many of this holiday season for that
exact reason and I can't really say that
I blame them in the end if you prefer
the Google assistant / Alexa and there
are plenty of reasons why you might then
don't hesitate to give the Google home
Mini a shot it's a low cost low risk way
to take Google's mastery of machine
learning for a test drive and a great
way to expand the Google assistants
footprint in your home that said the
mini isn't a silver bullet and it
doesn't distinguish itself enough to
establish Google's unique vision for the
artificially intelligent living space if
anything it feels like a concession that
Amazon got there first</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
