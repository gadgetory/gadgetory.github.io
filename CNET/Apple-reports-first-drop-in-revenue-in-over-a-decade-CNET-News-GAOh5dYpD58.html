apples growth trend could be coming to
an end in its quarterly report with
investors apple reported a thirteen
percent decrease in revenue compared to
the same period last year the first time
this number has fallen in over a decade
and the first time iphone sales have
dropped well ever and while many critics
may be quick to spell doom for the
Cupertino giant the reality is most
companies would kill to have apples
so-called problems with a revenue of 50
point six billion dollars in last
quarter alone and 10.5 billion dollars
in profit according to the analyst the
biggest problem they face going into the
third fiscal quarter is how to continue
to grow a company that's already a
behemoth in the industry tim cook
apple's CEO insisted the company's
future is still bright despite these
hurdles promising more amazing
innovations in their product pipeline
but judging from the rumors about an
iphone 7 with few physical updates this
will be a tough promise to deliver on
despite better ipad sales with a new pro
line the iphone continues to be apple's
cash cow and accounts for two-thirds of
its revenue so while this may be only a
dent in Apple's armor it's a trend
that's likely to continue through the
third fiscal quarter based on Apple's
own guidance so the question is what's
the next cash cow gonna be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
