Dreyfuss and welcome to rumor has it the
show where we round up the week's
biggest tech rumor and then we vote on
which ones on legitimate seems like it
will never ever happen and remember that
you can vote along with us so keep your
eye out for the poll in the interactive
player if you're watching on CNN first
cult of Android reports that a sous may
be working on a new low-priced Android
tablet that's just a little bit stripped
down from the Nexus 7 why do they think
that because someone apparently tested
an asus tablet matching these specs on
benchmark site GL benchmark com now a
sous is the manufacturer of the Nexus 7
and there had been rumors that it would
team up with Google to make a $99
version but then that rumor was called
into question when digit times reported
that Google was going to work with
someone else not a sous on the
lower-cost Nexus 7 so this rumor could
mean that maybe Google is going to work
with asus on the lower Nexus after all
or that asus is just making this all on
its own or that these benchmarks are an
error this tablet doesn't exist and that
we can go back to watching homeland and
not worrying about this rumor amen next
up we have the birth and death of a
rumor all in a matter of days TechCrunch
reported that whatsapp was in talks to
be acquired by Facebook whatsapp
messenger is a popular cross-platform
mobile chat program with about a hundred
million daily users the thing is however
we don't buy it and here's why this week
Facebook announced its own new messenger
app which is essentially an instant
messaging network complete with separate
apps to use the service but people need
only a phone number and no facebook
account to use it so it's basically a
whatsapp copycat because of that we
conclude that techcrunch's sources were
wrong barring some behind-the-scenes
story that we're not anticipating
there's just no incentive now for
facebook to acquire a pre-existing chat
app finally an apple rumor that some of
you are excited about is heating up
again back in September we reported a
rumor that apple was coming out with a
streaming music service and now market
research firm BTIG research predicts
that this will in fact happen sometime
in 2013 the research report insists that
I radio as it's being
will be quote unquote vastly superior to
Pandora with a global solution increased
skips and most importantly perhaps
extended caching so that wireless dead
zones are no longer a problem remember
that Apple bought the music streaming
site lolla calm in 2009 and according to
a New York Times report in September the
only reason that Apple didn't announce
this service at the iphone 5 launch
event was because of a failed
negotiation with sony/atv music and that
is precisely why I think that this
report is bunk Apple is not good at
wooing industry execs they famously
don't play by the wining and dining
rules that music labels operate on so
unless their pricing scheme is radically
better for the labels in Pandora's I
don't see the labels getting on board
with this and I really don't see Apple
offering a better profit margin in
Pandora that is totally not their style
but like I said back in September I
think that this report is likely true
pandora is the one product that Apple
has not yet tried to kill and making the
radio button more prominent in iTunes 11
is further evidence that Apple has
something up its sleeve and it could be
awesome it would have access to your
music library so would already know what
you like without you having to tell it
what do you guys think will Apple enter
the murky mire of streaming music to
release I radio in 2013 and how do you
think it could be better than pandora
leave us a comment and don't forget to
vote while we check in with the cnet
council the cnet council is composed of
five editors who cast their votes
anonymously their opinions are not an
endorsement by cnet or CBS interactive
obviously because these are rumors folks
and the cnet verdict is split three out
of six of our editors think that Apple
will not come out with a streaming radio
app 3 think that they will and only one
editor was optimistic enough to believe
that it'll be vastly superior to Pandora
now we had so many great comments last
week about Darth Vader's new role in
Disney star wars franchise that it was a
really hard to pick a favorite some were
funny some were angry many were creative
all were delightfully nerdy but this one
seemed like it was the most probable
will you please read this in your best
nerd voice sure my nerd voice has
allergies okay this one came from
triarii 3 in the episode between three
ad for Darth Vader took 20 years to
travel around the galaxy and head out
Jedi it hi dikh after the Jedi purge I
can see some epic story even a trilogy
that bites pit out for this time frame
which could also give us more insight on
the early days of the rebellion that is
her show everyone please share your
rumors with us I remember has it cnet
com where call is at 1 800 750 cnet or
tweet to us and tune in next week for
more tech reverse</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
