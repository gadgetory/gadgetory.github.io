kicks it up a notch in all respects it's
got a higher resolution sensor faster
continuous shooting performance better
and more flexible video quality and a
host of attractive new features without
question the D force photo quality is
excellent with a great noise profile its
JPEGs look clean as high as ISO 1600 and
they're decent at 3200 there though you
start to see some detail degradation
they do remain usable at iso 6400
depending upon the content and although
better by the numbers than the D 3 s's
JPEGs at iso 12800 and above I wouldn't
suggest using the JPEGs beyond iso 6400
the color rendering looks great as well
bright saturated colors that are heavy
in the red channel can end up with
clipped highlights in the JPEGs but if
you shoot raw it retains all the detail
and generally the camera does preserve
enough highlight and shadow detail and
roz for good recovery in really high
contrast images and it doesn't introduce
a lot of noise in the shadows when you
try to bring them up or too much
contouring in the highlights when you
try to bring them down I'm not as
thrilled with the video quality it's
very good but for six thousand dollars I
expect wow the Nikon d4 is one of the
fastest cameras I've ever had the
pleasure of shooting with that's not
quite perfect the autofocus system is
mostly excellent it locks quickly and
usually accurately in both single and
burst shooting and fixed subjects as
well as while you're panning but despite
gaining a stop of autofocus sensitivity
and low-light centerpoint AF at f28
remains more frustrating than I expect
for a camera in its price range and with
its specs and the sluggish live view
autofocus still makes me sad like other
vertically gripped pro bodies the d4 is
big and heavy with the same rug and
sealed construction of its predecessor
the control design and layout deviates
slightly from the d3s mostly to
incorporate the addition of the
necessary video controls the record
button occupies one of my least favorite
locations for it
we prefer operating it with my thumb and
while I like the live view movie control
design I find it too far down into the
middle of the back of the camera plus
Nikon doesn't deliver as consistent a
horizontal and vertical experience as
some cameras do you've got the two
programmable buttons between the lens
and the grip while shooting horizontally
but not while shooting vertically and
instead you have a tiny button by the
shutter that feels just slightly in the
wrong place for using in conjunction
with one of the command dials because of
the new location of the auto focus area
control it's hard to operate while
shooting vertically and some of the
seemingly duplicate controls operate
differently in the different
orientations for instance the horizontal
sub selector can be programmed as an
auto exposure lock but the vertical one
can because it's not a sub selector it
just looks like the same control when in
fact it's a duplicate multi selector
your these deal killers no but it's an
expensive camera any of the right to be
cranky about small design issues on the
other hand they're too subtle design
tweaks that I really like when you touch
the shutter button or any of the other
controls for that matter all the buttons
and display back lights illuminate and
the new battery design separates the
battery cover latch from the battery
itself the new Ethernet connection
allows for surprisingly full-featured
tethered shooting via a browser rather
than having to use Nikon's proprietary
software as well as for features it's
easier to say it's not missing much than
I can think of than it is to enumerate
what it does have one missing thing
support for timecode in video like the
1dx has features it has that the 1dx
lacks as far as I can tell our time
lapse mode and tiff output as usual
wireless connectivity flash and GPS
remain add-ons unless you really need
the speed boost or improved video I
don't think it's a must-have replacement
for the d3s and the d800 delivers
equally good low ISO photo quality and
better video quality for a lot less
money even when you equip it with a
battery grip but the deal before is
seriously faster an overall it's a very
well-executed update to nikon's
professional camera line that's worth
the admittedly
hefty investment if you need its talents
