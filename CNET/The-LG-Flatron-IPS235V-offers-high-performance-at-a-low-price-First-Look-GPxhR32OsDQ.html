shopping for a monitor can boil their
knees down to the following sentence I
want performance at a reasonable price
with the ability to calibrate the
display as I see fit if a monitor vendor
can offer that that's half the battle
with this IPS to 35 v LG seems to be
trying to meet that need head on hi i'm
eric franklin and today i'll take a
first look at the LG flatron IPS 235 v
the LG is really nothing special
physically aside from this sort of wood
grain finish on the bezel and a somewhat
wider than usual foot stand the screen
can wobble a bit when not from the sides
but just make sure you tighten this
thumb screw here on the underside to
keep it from getting too wobbly the
monitor tilts back about 15 degrees and
5 degrees forward but no other ergo
features are included it has vga DVI and
HDMI for video connections and there's
this headphone jack which probably won't
blow your mind but it's nice to have
movies play with the correct color
balance well once the color was balanced
correctly that is I tried the movie
preset but found it to be a bit to
greenish the user preset with green
turned down to about 32 made a huge
difference those same settings work with
games too although games tended to look
a bit darker than I would have liked
yeah you could increase the contrast but
then you run the risk of washing out the
colors which not the best trade-off in
the world the LG can be found for as low
as 210 dollars now I don't know what
that means to you but that's a really
great price for a quality IPS monitor
now that price may have changed by the
time you see this video but even if it's
two hundred fifty dollars that's still a
really great deal once again i'm eric
franklin and this has been the first
look the LG flatron IPS 235 v</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
