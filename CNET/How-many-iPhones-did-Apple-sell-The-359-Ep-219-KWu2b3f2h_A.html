gonna be May it is May I'm DBT and
corrected by Alfred Inge and Roger Chang
in the house good morning guys
morning morning I did Monday at midday
it's May it's Meg what is it where the
olds don't get Mayday off you can
Australia get the day off
because America doesn't need Mayday we
need another holiday no we don't I do
fine all right all right we've got a
busy day for you we're talking about
Apple's earnings tomorrow also tomorrow
Microsoft is holding is edu event so
we'll be previewing that and lastly
we'll be talking about what Donald Trump
said again a great yep I know you can
get excited all right as always if you
have any questions leave it in the
comment section Brian will pick out the
best and we'll get to them in 3 minutes
and 59 seconds there we go from 3 to
welcome to the 359 I'm Roger Chang I'm
Alfred hang-its earnings season and it's
Apple's turn tomorrow the company is set
to report its fiscal second quarter
results and of course the number is
gonna be huge analysts expected to sell
52 million iPhones a tick up from a year
ago when it reported its first decline
ever offered are you excited I'm so
excited for earnings I love earning so
much I can't wait to see how much money
all these companies make money that
we'll never see
yes that's who because we don't get paid
by apple jack we're actually giving them
money yes um but yeah I'm looking
forward to see you know if the iPhone 7
actually helped its its sales right they
got rid of the headphones their
improvements weren't really like that
much but you know from what Apple's been
reporting like over the last year or so
since the phone has come out that it's
been doing pretty good in sales I'm
surprised to see how that happening but
I mean especially if the competition
that it has out there but despite that
early backlash at the iPhone 7 keeps
chugging along I mean Charlotte it can
wrote the story basically well Wall
Street sort of looking at now they've
already kind of started looking ahead
usually they don't they wait a little
bit later the year before they start
blanking out on Apple articles but no
one seems really care about these
quarters results
they all just care about the iPhone 8
and whether or not the iPhone eights
gonna you know drive what they call a
super cycle where everybody just rushes
in and upgrades to the next phone I mean
yeah I think the reason why there
weren't that many upgrades and more
people buying the iPhone 6s you know
when the phone sales like actually
dropped yeah was because there wasn't
that much change in like what the phone
looks like or innovations or anything
like I there's from all these like
predictions like the iPhone 8 is
supposed to be like this whole like new
thing for them yep
whether or not that's true like we still
have to see but in a way that's where
all the hype is as usual so next up
Microsoft is holding its edu event
tomorrow we're expecting a low-cost
Windows 10 option maybe some hardware
perhaps surface or have some sort of
laptop to really help it better compete
against Google in the classroom that's
because students love their Chromebooks
and Microsoft is hoping to change that
with whatever they introduce tomorrow
hmm so it makes the most sense if they
would have something with like a surface
tablet kind of like two and one yeah
right like that would give it the
biggest edge over the Chromebook I mean
the biggest thing is got to be the cost
right those Chromebooks are really cheap
that's why parents love them they're
sort of a low-cost investment to kind of
help your kid get online rather like a
full-blown you know MacBook or iMac so
Microsoft really kind of has to get
something out there that's that's really
cheap really affordable for for folks to
kind of pay attention to it that's the
thing so like I completely missed out on
the generation of like Chromebooks being
in the classroom I was like very
surprised that they overtook your just a
few years of I was literally what like I
left high school when the first
Chromebook came out well yeah and now
they're they're the most popular school
device it's like you know you kind of
thought it might be Microsoft or or
Apple when the Mac books but the
realistic speaking like MacBook sucks
but like even in college I never saw
like Chromebooks like in the classroom
it was like either some like a MacBook
or like somebody on their right I think
it really is more beneficial for folks
or for kids yeah like elementary school
high school were you know it's fine to
get like a low-cost device hmm all right
lastly well speaking of low cost devices
so Trump
president Trump still doesn't believe
that Russia was behind the hacks from
the Democratic National Committee in an
interview with CBS's Face the
face the nation he says that it could
have been anybody could have in China
he's basically not denying that Russia
might have been behind it but he's also
saying that anybody could have been hot
behind it and very hard to prove which
to be fair it is I mean the during
WikiLeaks like reveal of you know the
CIA's tools one of the tools that they
had was about you know being able to
frame other countries now that being
said though I mean there's a lot of
evidence pointing towards Russia's way
and he's still saying that it could have
been anybody it is just weird that he's
speaking about like when he was a
candidate that's one thing yeah he's a
president United States so where he
speaks there's an air of authority yes
and so yeah that he's still kind of
doing this weird wishy-washy could have
been China thing was a little he's
little he's sticking by his firm stance
of I don't know right alright for those
stories and more check us out at sea net
Procter chant I'm Alfred Inge thanks for
listening
and we have a few people in the chat who
are not gigantic Apple fans go figure
all right
what bring it on so wait what Alfred
people are a little stunning you are
what was your computer experience in
high school I mean to be fair I was like
really obnoxious about my laptop in high
school so I like what laptop did you
have in high school um I purposely
bought really cheap like Windows lap
laptops that were like the original
two-in-ones
so like the toshiba satellite and like
the ThinkPad like x 51 x 41 sorry those
thinkpads are solid though yes but they
were also very little bells and whistles
but I mean well yeah you also missed out
of a netbook generation right no I was
there I was really stupid
okay like I'd never bought into that I
mean people were - that was a little
tiny were those tiny super crappy Chi
desks Kesey laptop they were so bad they
were so Tara but I so everyone had one
though
basically I worked on trail and though
you're complaining about I found out
that we can bring laptops to classes in
high school and I was like why do I have
all these pens and papers for I'm just
gonna buy a hundred dollar like laptop
off of ebay and just like be a jerk in
class for that and then I like expected
all this like kind of like special
treatment over is like I need to sit
next the charger miss because my phone
like the laptop batteries like heat up a
lot I know but yeah I was I was like
kind of a jerk about it but at the same
time I was like I like people to take
notes on my laptop in class but it was
still for you still for your generation
still unusual that you had a laptop yeah
yeah no it was even weird though big
worse though because I like very
obnoxious about it because it was like a
two in one thing so instead of doing the
normal thing and like typing outside
Swiper
they had like a stylus and I I'd fold it
so it'd be like like a book look kind of
like ah yeah yeah and I'd go on one note
and I write it like that I was like why
don't you have a pen and paper yes
yeah it was right it was very obnoxious
um but I you didn't Matthew had a Lenovo
s10 that's old Wow that is okay oh yeah
that's a throwback
I had a Sony Vaio that was the first
laptop I bought that was my first
college laptop yeah I think I had a
strength to Sheba's
I can't remember the days I remember
they had Harman Kardon speakers and I
was like that's that's awesome oh my god
Mike show on the chat when I was in high
school we had a teletype in the closet
that dialed into a server 10 miles away
had a few minutes each to run our
programs in 1978 Bravo sir yeah you win
that's that's intense though let me
think about it think about how far back
that really is going not to age you too
far sir I apologize but computers in the
classroom in the 70s yeah that's a
thought right they have to heck peers
back then yeah I know technically in a
different way yeah but not like I'd like
to like see what a classroom looks like
now I don't know if everyone's like on
laptops there now is that like computer
- yeah Ayanna they have been to a
classroom it that's what it was many
mentor was like for me we had a specific
class just for computers where you'd go
under like the computer lab and then go
yeah what if that is the dorm like
everyone just like when they get to
their yeah laptop I mean by the time I
was in college that was the norm you
carried your laptop yeah College yeah
yeah exactly Scott have a laptop yeah
College not necessarily I mean a few
years before year was on it your age yes
yes like I was right on that board I was
so become the noise I was still taking I
mean I I have classes where like they
like in the syllabus they say like don't
bring your laptop because I know you're
not gonna look at you're not gonna pay
attention to the class yeah yeah I I
think I still had no I I didn't bring a
laptop to my classes I just had a
notepad yeah I was kind of a nerd about
it where like I had my laptop on me and
then I would take notes and then like
during like breaks like lunch breaks and
stuff I would just transfer all the
important ones to like my laptop dad
like type it up Danny Green had a
computer with punch cards at a boy
gaming TV had a toshiba satellite in
college best laptop yeah yeah work yeah
yeah cool I mean I knew many friends who
had those but I for whatever reason what
the Sony Vaio and ended up accidentally
drowning in Mountain Dew I think I only
really got cuz the speaker's I took my
dad because we're good and one thing I
experienced with the Toshiba though is
that it had iffy battery life I remember
one friend of mine there's died really
early I like you couldn't hold a charge
and then eventually just stopped taking
power at all whatever was wrong with the
adapter like something which is
shot but so do you think that like with
microsoft's like laptop that they might
be introducing tomorrow for for students
do you think that they're gonna try to
match the chromebook price or anything
they're gonna try to go lower I don't
know I mean I would imagine they'd at
least try to match yeah nice is a big
like deciding factor but it's not it's
not like every parent is buying it's
probably like those states like
Department of Education that I yeah
definitely shell out like a kind of like
deal with them over it I mean I think
anything in the realm of corporations
fighting to get into schools is good
yeah
remember Apple tried to do with their
iPads yeah they kind of a push to Daily
USD actually embraced iPads for all
their students apparently that program
did not work I can't imagine going to
schools with like a signed laptops and
stuff because all that means is that
like there's just calculators yeah but
I'm saying like connected online what
cuz all that means is just like more
homework like all the time and I just
sounds awful well just like when they
the first time the outfitted workers
with blackberry and they can check like
when you like like sent in your homework
and stuff you can't like make up some
excuse like I left it at home when
you're really ninja really my dog eat my
homework my dog it might fly more loud
the hackers stole my home there you go
China stuff I don't work let's avoid
that one yeah let's swing over an Apple
territory because we have to Michael EOD
in the chat says business news channels
keep talking about all the cash Apple
has and he has an interesting thought
branching off from that what will they
do with it all they could by Tesla they
could buy Home Depot with all that
something Apple's really going to like
man to other neighborhoods or do you
think they're going to keep it all into
pursuing smart cars those are it those
are all interesting points I do want to
bring up one thing Apple has a lot of
cash but what a lot of people don't
realize is a lot of cash is trapped
overseas mm-hmm it's it's made by the
generated by subsidiaries overseas of
China wherever Europe wherever if they
take that money back to the US they have
to pay a huge tax a huge so they can
right now it's it's it's a term called
repatriation and companies all want to
do because they don't pay the taxes so
it's actually kind of kept outside they
can't actually access a vast amount of
cash that they have because it is
overseas maybe they could pipe that back
into some of the manufacturing
innovations possibly shots fired I know
we'll see if we'll see if Trump plays
ball with them uh but in terms of buying
other assets I mean definitely they do
that they're they're testing out a smart
car or self-driving car I'm either
constant rumors that they're gonna buy
you know B company like Disney and they
spoke about the echo their version of an
echo possibly coming with sorry
right right should be another huge new
avenue for them to venture down but
that's not I mean they don't necessarily
to buy for that just they could build on
in-house true but that's where that
money could be repurposed oh yeah not
repurpose that's not the right term just
purposed I mean it's a lot of money they
could buy a country or two they could
Admiral and where you from Apollonia
yeah um I don't want to talk about
politics did you no okay no no I just
gotta move it on I want to keep
reminiscing about like high school
computer experiences if that's okay with
everybody else I mean I
okay so I had multiple computer guys II
had a typing class you had a programming
class which was an elective like I
decided I want to try to learn some C++
like all they offer you guys grabbing a
high school high school Oh fantastic
yeah my high school was really weird
where they did have programming classes
but you had to be in the major for it
which yes my high school had majors Wow
it made no sense why schools you go to
Brooklyn Tech oh so like you could pick
what me one of those smart kids had to
test to get into school I just got I
just looks cool I just lived right yeah
I look good to be fair it's also the
largest high school in the country so
something's not adding up here where
you're the largest high school in the
country and it is a public it is a
public high school as well okay that's
an - it's very weird for the further
record Ricky in the chess as C++ is my
language I've forgotten more than I ever
learned about it actually
well they didn't they taught basic and
was it your high high school for me I
tried to learn C++ in college I spent I
think I spent two weeks in class I
dropped out of immediately I thought it
was fascinating because that kind of
spawned a lot of attention from people
who are more into it than I was and I
got friend who decided to want to learn
yeah Java who's the blue wind project is
bringing up coding in Java Java
Johnna uh and he got it way into that I
kind of like enjoy looking over shoulder
trying to figure out some stuff yeah
granted we didn't do anything of value
with it but it was kind of an
interesting new experience because it
was very fresh when I was in high school
and computers are starting to become
part of the day-to-day yeah but like
what did you do you have any good
memories of like what you guys did to
kind of like exploit the system with the
computers at school or no I mean we had
penises and the websites that we built
yeah I mean um we figured out I had to
build like what we we went we did wedges
actually no I take the back that was in
college we did a web design course okay
yeah of course you gonna like high dicks
in there of course freshman year we
figured out that um you could put Halo
one on the school computers yeah uh well
really on a flash drive have you had the
game on your flash drive you just put it
in you just play LAN
oh my god we had like the computer lab
and we were supposed to be doing like
CAD like the desert yeah yeah um but
like pretty much everyone was just
playing Halo in that class it was great
and I found out that there was like a
server like a like was kind of like a
server where everyone put their like
saved files on if you really mean you
delete somebody stuff but like if you
were just like messing around people you
just like put like stuff like in their
folders where they save their something
you what is this file that you have man
we got a pervert re but oh man that
brings back some good memories they
can't do that these Chromebooks now now
you can't everything's locked down yeah
everything's locked down
I wonder I'd be really interesting if
anybody do we have anyone in the CNET
family who has kids kind of getting in
the high school at this point Oh dad you
think my boss Bonnie her kids and in
high school going into college
actually I'm Charley the rest of our
staff a most of them are fairly young
still
anybody out there and chatlin got kids
or no family friends who've got kids in
that high school area right now what the
computer experience is right now I for
them I've been invited to go speak at my
high school a few times now I feel like
I should just go just to like spy on
them and see what kind well what would
you talk about they want my journalism
teacher wants me to talk oh jeez like I
don't want to you know be a bad
influence to your students so stay a
Jules yeah basically
any money he's alive oh my god
blue in project I got into my old school
server when I was there and found a way
to get around the server in grade 9
that's impressive
oh I was nowhere near that advanced we
did figure out in college how to punch a
hole in the firewall to set up land
parties in our dormitory oh so we had
your firewall didn't allow that in
college they just they would constantly
like the monitoring system would
constantly like ping you so I he figured
out a mask ip's you know not not rocket
science here but we were all new to that
at the time so we were able to set up a
Star Wars Jedi Outcast land parties and
like literally the the digital security
team whatever the hell they were called
would like come knocking on doors
looking for people I don't know where
you're talking about I'm writing a paper
nice that was fun though that was fun
alright we're just yeah get this
probably good spot ain't it yeah a
