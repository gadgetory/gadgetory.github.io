that is if you don't update your iPhone
I'm Bridget Carey and this is your CNET
update Apple's mobile operating system
update fixes some bugs and also brings
new skin tone choices for emoji
characters once you download iOS 8.3 the
emoji keyboard will feature people with
a Simpsons ish yellow skin tone as the
default and you can hold down to select
what color you want the person to be and
it's not just more choice in skin tones
there are also new flags but a word of
caution when using these new emoji if
you send a character with a custom skin
tone to an iPhone user that hasn't
updated little alien heads will be in
your message it can't read the new code
if you send it to an Android user they
won't see anything at all that is until
Android gets an emoji update these
Unicode changes actually include a few
other icons that Apple did not add on
the keyboard like Spock's live long and
prosper Vulcan salute from Star Trek but
there's a secret way you can add it to
your phone you have to find the icon on
the web copy it on your device and then
you can paste it in a text message or go
to keyboard settings to save it as a
shortcut you can make it so every time
you type ll ap for live long and prosper
you can have the icon pop-up we have a
very logical walk through and how to do
this up at CNET in other Apple news the
company has confirmed that right now it
is only taking orders for the Apple
watch online so don't make plans to camp
out in line in front of a store like
people do for an iPhone in a statement
Apple said it is expecting demand to be
high and the company is only taking
online orders during the initial launch
period but that's unclear how long
that'll be the first to pre-order the
watch will get it on April 24th also in
short supply is the Samsung Galaxy s6
edge phone it hit stores Friday samsung
executives have told reporters that the
company is struggling to meet demand for
the edge which has a screen that curves
slightly around the sides that model is
harder to manufacture meanwhile in the
world of video games Lego has created
its own form of Skylanders called
Lego dimensions where people can collect
physical toys and put them on a scanning
platform to unlock a virtual
version of the characters in a mashup
lego game it fuses franchises like DC
Comics back to the future Wizard of Oz
and Lord of the Rings and of course
characters from the massively popular
lego movie in the same spirit as
Disney's infinity and Nintendo's amiibo
this may get you hooked on collecting
different characters to play when it
comes out on September 25th starter
packs for lego dimensions are about $100
they work for PlayStation Xbox
Nintendo's Wii U and extra character
sets will be $15 and $30 apiece
