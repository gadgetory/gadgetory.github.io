here at CES 2014 I'm riding the in
motion SCV
is coming to the u.s. in just a few
weeks it's basically a much cheaper
slightly lighter Segway so let's examine
it more closely so if you're familiar
with the basic Segway concept then
you'll know exactly what this is it's a
vehicle you hop on it and you lean
around lean forwards and back and to the
sides to move around I've had a go on it
it's surprisingly intuitive it feels
exactly like riding a Segway to be
honest but this isn't just like a Segway
it's very light it weighs 15 kilograms
so it's I mean it's pretty heavy to lift
but you might be able to move it around
a little bit more easily it has a top
speed of 15 km/h and the battery will
supposedly last you for 20 kilometers
worth of driving one advantage this has
over the Segway is you can do this
remove the steering column so maybe if
you're trying to fit this in the boot of
a car to transport it around that could
be pretty useful new with this model of
the SUV is this rather nifty smart key
this lets you look it remotely change
some functions as well and also what's
new is a smartphone app now that lets
you remotely control the SCB you can
also set predetermined routes for it and
using a GPS built into this thing you
can see where you've already gone in
motion told me that one potential use of
that remote control functionality is
that you could strap a camera to the top
of this thing and drive it around to get
some cool motion shots as I mentioned
it's coming to the u.s. in a couple of
weeks it's not exactly cheap it cost
twenty five hundred dollars but that is
quite a lot more affordable than the
Segway so if you're desperate to own
something like this maybe it's worth
considering I'm the quest rate for seen
at a CES 2014 check out CES jour senior
