this is your cnet update Mobile World
Congress the mother of all mobile trade
shows kicked off in Barcelona and we
already have tons of news to talk about
Samsung did not bring out the galaxy s4
to the show but it was announced that
the s4 will be unveiled on March 14th at
a New York City event this one is the s3
and as one of the most anticipated
smartphones of the year it's no surprise
that the s4 will get its own spotlight
at a separate event but you can expect
the s4 will have a visa mobile payment
system called pay wave samsung and visa
announced a partnership where future
samsung devices will work with visas
mobile payment system and the s4 will be
the flagship product for that program
many groups have been spending years
trying to grow mobile payments it's the
idea that you can wave your phone at a
register to pay but it just hasn't taken
off yet in the u.s. samsung phones are
very popular but it might not really
take off until Apple includes that
technology in the iphone mobile payments
will be a big theme at this year's show
as MasterCard also unveiled a digital
payment system called master pass which
works for purchases and stores as well
as online and on a phone samsung did
show off the Galaxy Note 8 it's an
8-inch tablet that will compete with the
ipad mini but of course price will
determine how competitive it will be and
samsung didn't announce the price and as
an SD card slot built in S Pen Stylus it
will be loaded with Android jelly bean
and will be Wi-Fi only in the US
expected to come out sometime before
July Samsung is also launching a rival
to the apple TV streaming box it's
called the homesync it's an
android-powered media box that streams
movies TV shows and games to your TV and
it also streams movies from a galaxy
smartphone no word on price but that'll
be out in April and surprising news web
OS is still alive LG will be using HP's
defunct mobile operating system on
future televisions meanwhile HP is back
in the tablet game this time with an
Android model called the slate 7 it will
be out in April for 100
seventy dollars also at Mobile World
Congress we got to look at a voice
control personal assistant app called
the indigo it's like Apple Siri but this
works on Android Windows Phone 8 and
your web browser it'll eventually also
come to iOS it's similar to how Siri
works where you ask questions and get
answers based on web search results and
it can create appointments open apps
dictate emails or post statuses to
social networks and one indigo account
will sync between your devices even if
you have a Windows Phone and an Android
tablet that's your tech news update you
can find more details on these stories
