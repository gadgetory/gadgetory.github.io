with Scott Stein and one of the
traditions we always do here every year
Scott is a roundup of the best laptops
and other pcs from the show obviously
computers always a really big category
of CES tradition and now you know this
year it sort of feels like a lowly they
don't have the surprise of the tablets
and convertibles in the same way but
there's still some new things coming out
last year we chose eight for the first
time we have a lot of people doing the
high bridge things that change shape and
form before that you had ultrabooks even
before that netbook so this year I don't
think there's a big kind of computer
theme I think we're seeing refinement a
lot of things that we saw before yeah it
was like you know it's like price of
Fort you know portability maybe taking
some of those ideas and like I said
refining the cock assigns a little more
a little more Bible speaking of refining
actually we have a refinement of one of
our favorite laptops / hybrids from last
year this is the live yoga to the yoga
obviously was one of our big hits last
year the yoga 2 pro came out in the fall
of 2013 that was a very expensive very
premium system this is the yoga 2 minus
the pro so it's a little bit more
affordable and what they do to make it
more affordable is they take out that
super high-res 3200 x 1800 screen just
goes back to regular 1080p so that's a
little bit thicker but you still get
that awesome hymns look at that that
bends all the way back and this is the
13 inch version I think it's a bit under
a thousand dollars it's still kind of
premium what I really like a lot is that
they have an 11 inch version of the yoga
that has an intel pentium chip so you
trade down a little bit there but that
starts at 549 and to get this really
great mechanically in John that
fantastic well you know it actually
feels more like the idea pad line before
the yoga you know if you look if you
ever shop for an idea pad and looked at
those like mid-range models kind of has
that feel but then they're incorporating
that hinge you can imagine like you'll
start seeing this in more laptops tell
you saw touch across more laptops maybe
all laptops will start becoming
convertible like that's kind of the big
secret I've actually seen a couple of
other things this week that have this
style of hinge on it yeah some of them
have been out
some of them haven't but I think people
are figuring out in that hybrid space
this is one of the designs that actually
works because it doesn't mess with that
laptop form factor we don't lose
anything so like why not throw that in
it's like you know if you can do that
and it's not a really crazy experimental
design it's just there for you and the
price is reasonable you're not paying up
for it let me show you real fast before
the four ways they want you to use it
are in a regular laptop they have kind
of the the table tent like this that's
the one I'm lesia a way to use i would
probably i'll use 10 less you're just
playing like restaurant specials there's
a high things underneath then we have
the kiosk which i think is actually kind
of cool because you love that like this
like playing a movie you're doing a
presentation keyboards out of way but
you can still manipulate the the
touchscreen and then of course there's a
tablet mode and you still have the
keyboard of the back here some people
find that really weird but it's
deactivated it's not a deal killer for
me but I'd love for someone to come up
with one that like kind of like you know
makes the keyboard disapproves it or you
need like a keyboard cozy underneath
don't keep any liquid own liquids on
your desk anyhow there's like something
you don't want any schmutz on your desk
but i love the yoga line and i love that
they have the more expensive yoga 2 pro
and now the slightly more reasonable
yoga what's great how affordable those
are becoming it's nice that's a great
segue co speaking of affordable here we
go everybody likes Chromebooks that's
like one of the hot topics right now I
thought this was a macbook looking at it
from behind and the keyboard I just got
this like macbook industry especially
the keepall silver and my keyboard at
that angle then you crest over and okay
this is different what is this and yet
it is only two hundred and seventy nine
dollars because this is the toshiba
chromebook that that's the only name
just toshiba Chromebook so it's a 13
inch chrome book and we haven't seen a
13-inch chromebook before which is crazy
to me we've seen some 11 inch models
yeah that's really been most of them a
couple of four teens but nothing right
here in the middle and the sweet spot
well it feels exactly like you know kind
of like an ultrabook but a plastic type
feel but it reminds me of the chromebook
pixel reminds me of like an affordable
version of like that type of level of
laptop but in a super budget area if you
want to explore okay you know the idea
of like a full chromebook experience if
you can you want to buy that for like
simple browsing it's not bad and a 279
you know you know it's going to be kind
of plasticky but it still actually looks
and feels better than a lot of the other
Chromebooks I've seen and I like the
screen that's not too big not too small
we always say that a 13-inch laptop is
really the ideal size because it's big
enough you can work on it all day
but it's small enough that you can
actually put in your bag and carry with
you you know at least three or four days
a week so that 13 inch size in the
middle it's got an hdmi output yeah it's
got a lot of outputs I mean your
electricity no 2 USB 3 and HDMI SD card
slot so he got all that stuff I remember
I tried using a Chromebook to like a
week or two and it was a little bit of a
struggle it didn't do every single thing
I wanted it to do but it wasn't as bad
as I thought it would be if you're
blogging you're living only in a web
environment like even the stuff that we
file year at seeing it you can totally
do it as long as you're not too
dependent on advanced photo work you
know you could do that too but yeah for
for your basic stuff it's very
functional as long as I have that you
have an internet connection yes there is
otherwise there's offline elements but
it's I feel very worried you can cash
google docs it feels like a leap of
faith even though I've never lost
anything it's a sense that you're still
in a browser environment looking a
little better with offline apps a little
better with that but it is a largely you
have to be connected and if there's any
kind of stress test for whether you can
stay online reliably it's definitely
here at CES where there's so many
signals and some ice your finger does
carry three hotspots with you just to
get one signal yeah actually the
built-in ATT Wi-Fi alternately is
fantastic for me or not sometimes it's
my Savior and on the very high end of
the scale opposite the low end is it is
a new addition to one of your favorite
laptop line Scott and that's the advance
on eight of book nine this is just
called the aid of book 9 2014 edition
it's a 15 inch version and I'm calls
daylight or any I don't think the plus
or light and that and you review the 13
inch version the best nine plus and you
loved it why did you love it well I
loved it because it was it was thin it
had a tremendously high resolution
screen the price wasn't too off of what
you're paying for equivalent products
like that and just the design and
performance we're great and the battery
life was great and that line of book 9
or before was series 9 those have been a
great line of products and there's been
experimentation remember the 15 inch
series 9 it came out a little while ago
I mean it's bigger I love the
compactness but still you got the design
here is you know largely the same and
let's say the port design is the same
too yeah I like having a super big
touchscreen on a super slim laptop you
don't really see that too often even now
this doesn't have the super high
resolution screen that the 13 inch
version has it
it's just a 1080p screen but it's also
only going to be about 1,200 bucks so if
you're going to compete kind of with
Apple in that over a thousand dollar you
know price area you're really have to be
super premium and I think this a book 9
series is one of the few guys that
actually does that they have some new
audio decoding hardware in here that's
kind of interest to audio files that
works very nicely with uncompressed
audio files kind of like lossless at
track files and if you bought something
like I don't like like that Beatles mp3
Apple that came out a few years ago you
get the regular mp3 files and you get
the a tract files okay which are like a
24 24 bit files and not a lot of
computer could Ben plays nice to those I
think that's kind of cool can I wish to
set a higher resolution screen although
you're looking at it I don't notice that
the difference is there I mean it looks
you know from this distance it looks
good it looks very sharp well maybe
that'll be the plus edition that will
come out later probably and by my one of
my favorite things this year is a sequel
to one of my favorite things from last
year and that does this big guy right
here this is the lenovo horizon 2 sequel
to the horizon 27 it is a 27-inch what I
call a table top PC it's basically a
gigantic tablet because it's got a
battery in it and then you can put this
kick stand up and add a keyboard and
mouse and it's like an all-in-one PC
okay lenovo actually has a table stand
right now we've got it sitting down
there that you can actually roll it
around on its like a kitchen cart yeah
you can put it flat and rolled around
all over the place we took it off so we
can play with it here so what the what
the thing allows you to do is stand up
like this regular all-in-one PC then you
push down and the hinge goes down there
we go and then it kicks in to this
special mode called aura it's like a
software overlay that Lenovo came up
with that's good for this sort of this
tabletop thing and in the office
whenever we have a table top PC we put
them on the couch and put them on
Ottomans tables people just want to come
over it's very sci-fi like they want to
like manipulate photos and move stuff
around yeah this is like where you have
your like Situation Room we're like all
gonna stand around and kind of like
manipulate i don't know i'm going to
manipulate on this but i want to
manipulate things but something and it's
kind of like the original product called
surface that microsoft had right that
was a big tabletop pc and then they use
the name for something else so here
we're into it now i can take a photo
right here and i can move
around and I could spin it I can go into
games and do that around and Avan let's
do a little uh yeah air hockey right and
it comes with these little paddles a
couple of the gaming accessories let's
see if we can launch the air hockey game
and that'll give us a fun little it's
thinner that's still have you I mean you
don't want to carry this around houses
last year's was 18 pounds yeah it's
don't want a camera around you can go
from a room at least and it is
definitely fitter than last year's all
right so i'm going to count you very
quickly to a 1 a one-point game of air
hockey let's do it you're gonna go for
this is unfair this is unfair that's
right I'm gonna win the first one then
we're gonna make it interesting yeah
you're right put your panel a little
circle okay ready here we go okay don't
scorn yourself Scott I just did it
you're right so let me win that Josie
were the better air hockey player than
me thank you Scott I appreciate that and
that is a pretty much our collection of
a lot of the favorite pieces that we've
seen here at CES 2014 so far so thank
you Scott sign i'm dan ackerman that's
better these are our best species of CES
