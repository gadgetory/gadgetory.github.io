me you'll see an array of televisions
which you might not see is that they're
all curves this is Samsung's hu 9000
series its best mainstream series of
televisions for 2014 the company decided
to go all-in on curve this year so this
is a UHD 4k resolution television it has
all the bells and whistles Samsung
normally throws into its high-end TVs
that includes gesture control with a
built-in camera a local dimming
backlight with edge-lit array and of
course the curved screen samsung says
the curved allows a little more more
immersive viewing experience one of the
disadvantages of previous curved TVs
that you couldn't mount them on the wall
that Samsung does include a mounting kit
that allows you to put this curve TV
right on the wall which is if nothing
else a pretty striking looking
television other features include the
company's full smart TV sweet this model
also gets the ability to divide the
screen into four different sections you
can actually watch TV in one of them
watch a YouTube video watch a little bit
of web page or another app and all four
at the same time so that's a new feature
for this year the TV also has samsung's
improved smart remote with as much
smaller touchpad and all the other bells
misses you expect from a high-end
television the hu 9000 available in
three different screen sizes there's a
55 65 and a 78 inch size that's a quick
look at Samsung's curved UHD highest-end
TV the hu 9000 series at CES 2014 we're
going to be pricing yet but the set
should be out in around april timeframe
