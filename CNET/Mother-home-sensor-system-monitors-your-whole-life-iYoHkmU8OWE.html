hello I'm request rate for CNET's here
at CES 2014 we're taking a look at one
of the most bizarre-looking and weirdest
names products of the show it is the
mother home monitoring system by sense
all right so this white doll here with
the glowing eyes is the mother
monitoring system and it sits in your
house it communicates with your home
Wi-Fi and it speaks to these these are
called cookies they are tiny little
monitor sensor things that you can stick
to the items in your house and they'll
communicate over a proprietary network
with the mother base unit now these
things monitor motion so you could do
things like stick to the cookies to your
fridge door to see how often you're
opening the fridge you could stick it to
a water bottle to monitor how much water
you're drinking or you could maybe stick
one in your kids backpack so that you
know when they get home from school all
that data from the cookies is then
beamed back into the mothership and you
can view all the information on a
computer or a tablet or a smartphone so
you can see what's going on in your
house the cookies can also monitor
temperature so you could see how warming
is in each room of your house for
example it's going to be available in
the spring and it will cost you one
hundred and ninety-nine dollars that
gets you the mother unit and for cookies
I think it's a cool idea it looks like
it would take a little bit of time to
really set up and start using in your
own house but maybe you'd enjoy the data
that it ultimately provides you with I'm
