it is a Taiwanese startup and it builds
its Apollo 7 headphone as the world's
most compact true wireless earphones
Apple might dispute that claim now that
it's unveiled as air pods but the Apollo
7 certainly are very small key to all
these truly wireless earphones and by
that I mean there's no cord linking the
earbuds that the wireless bluetooth
connection between both your phone and
the two buds is rock-solid or at least
close to it and that's what's impressive
about the Apollo sevens they really do
work well and after I paired them with
my phone once I no trouble pairing them
again can't say the listening experience
was totally flawless did encounter the
occasional dropout but that's par for
the course and using most bluetooth
headphones they also sound good for
Bluetooth earbuds with a reasonable
amount of clarity and decent bass using
one of the larger tips I managed to get
a secure fit and a tight seal and that
tight seal really helps improve sound
quality
these are sweat resistant so you can use
them for running or working out at the
gym and you get a few sets of wing
accessories to help you lock the buds in
place you can control your music and
volume levels using your phone or use
the single multifunction buttons on each
of the earbuds just skip tracks forward
answer and end calls and raise and lower
the volume there are microphones built
into both buds and when a call comes in
you go into mono mode with only one of
the buds outputting sound battery life
is rated at 3 hours which isn't great
but standard for this type of headphone
but the good news is that a charging
case is included and when you're
finished using the buds you click them
into their charging compartments in the
case and close the case to begin
charging at first I thought it'd be easy
to lose the buds but after getting into
the habit of slipping them into their
case it really wasn't worried about that
in the end my only real gripe is the
price these are $300 that still is a
little bit pricey and time that price
should come down but for now it is the
price you pay for being an early adopter
of cutting-edge technology I'm David
