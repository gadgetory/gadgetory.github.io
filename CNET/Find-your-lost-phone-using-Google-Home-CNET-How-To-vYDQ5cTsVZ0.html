device there's no shortage of ways to
find a lost phone these days but now you
can use Google home to find that lost
phone between the cushions here's how
originally even while a Google search
could locate and ring a lost Android
phone Google home didn't have that
ability this week however Google enabled
native compatibility with find my device
for Google home this means it can locate
your Android phone and make it ring even
if it's on silent a particularly helpful
little trick all you need to do to get
this feature working is to make sure
your device is turned on with location
enabled signed into the same Google
account as your Google home connected to
Wi-Fi or mobile data visible on Google
Play under the correct Google account
and enabled in the find my device app
which is on by default with all these
steps taken care of you simply have to
say the wake phrase followed by Find My
Phone or ring my phone Google home will
then walk you through a list of devices
it finds asking which one you would like
it to ring I found a few phones but
first listed is a some g95 five you
should I ring it yes all right your
phone should be raining now the
unfortunate part is that it will call
out the devices by model number which
might be confusing if you have multiple
devices registered and don't know their
specific model numbers and for now there
is no way to rename a device even if you
change its name in Google Play or the
find my device app despite this feature
being limited to Android devices you can
still use Google home to locate a lost
iPhone it just won't be able to ring the
phone if it's been silenced to set this
up you will need to add your phone
number under your my account privacy
settings go to my account google.com
slash privacy and go to phone then add
recovery foam into your phone number and
click Next followed by get code into the
six digit code that Google texts you and
click verify now when you tell Google
home to find your phone it can call that
number and not just a specific phone if
you have registered devices Google home
will ask you if you want to ring those
first however if you keep saying no it
will say let's try something else
let's try something else then it will
move on to phone numbers associated with
your Google account should I call your
phone ending in 3 208 yes when you tell
it to ring a number it will place a
standard voice-over-ip call to your
phone regardless of what kind of foam it
