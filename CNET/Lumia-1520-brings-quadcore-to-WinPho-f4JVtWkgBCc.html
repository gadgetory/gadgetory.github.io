microsoft have embraced the trend of the
super sized screen I'm Jessica doll
court for cnet and this is your first
look now this phone is notable for two
reasons one is the extra-large size and
the other is that it is the first
Windows Phone to use a quad-core
processor but more on that later because
first I want to talk about the design
the 1520 has a unibody design that is
nice and sleek there's a nice little
border around the screen so it's not
gappy at all one thing you will notice
is that there are two doors that you
have to open with a sim card key the
bottom one is for the nano SIM and the
top one is for a microSD card slot and
that will take up to 64 gigabytes in
external storage now how comfortable you
find the phone to hold and use and even
carry around with you is really going to
depend on a lot of things like the size
of your hands the size of your pockets
and the size of whatever else you're
carrying it in the phone did fit well
into my hand when I was just holding it
but it's a lot harder for me to use for
one-handed operation it's very awkward
and I noticed that I had to stretch my
thumb around a lot in order to reach it
it's also really hard for me to reach
other areas on the screen so this is
definitely a phone that you're going to
want to use with two hands unless you
have very large mints it also did not
fit very well into my pockets but I did
find that it fit into the cell phone
pocket of my purse the screen itself is
a very large 6 inches believe it or not
that puts it sort of in the middle of
the field larger than some but
definitely not the biggest phablet that
you're going to find around it's got a
1080p HD resolution also has Nokia's
clear black display filter so that means
it's going to be a little bit easier to
read outside in broad daylight or some
automatic settings you can put on that
will change the brightness when you go
outdoors and when you come back in since
the phone is so large one thing you'll
notice is a third column that Microsoft
has added here for phones of this size
live tiles will still only stretch to
column would slide not the full area but
you have a lot more room to play with
you can see many more icons on this
large screen then you can on any of the
smaller screen phones the 1520 is
running Windows Phone 8 Update 3 right
out of the box it's got a lot of apps
for you three
including nokia apps AT&amp;amp;T apps and a
couple others besides now one of the
phones claims to fame is the 20
megapixel camera on here this does use
the PureView technology most of the time
your photos will resolve to 5 megapixels
like if you update it online or send
them to a front however the 20 megapixel
image can be useful if you're going to
do a lot of lossless cropping and if you
want to print a full size image as
usually you can switch from the default
nokia camera app to any other lens
including the native windows phone
camera there are a lot of photo tools
filters and extra fun apps that you can
use for the most part even on automatic
mode i found that the pictures were
pretty good there's also the typical
windows phone camera button this is
something that you can hold and press to
trigger the camera you can also press it
as a shutter button you can use
on-screen controls as well as i
mentioned before the 15 20 is the first
windows phone to come with a quad-core
processor you're looking at a two point
two gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800
chipset other specs include LTE and NFC
of course the pricing is pretty
reasonable for a phone on this size two
hundred dollars on ATT with a new
two-year service agreement overall I
really like the phone's design I think
it's light and slim and attractive I
especially like this red color think
it's pretty easy to handle to the specs
are top-notch it doesn't have every
single whistle and bell that you're
going to find on some of the other
advanced Android phones but if you don't
need all of these that i can recommend
this device this is the Nokia Lumia 1520
