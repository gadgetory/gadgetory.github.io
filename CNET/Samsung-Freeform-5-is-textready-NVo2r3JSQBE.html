much phone if that's the case then you
might want to check out something a
little simpler like the Samsung freeform
5 I'm testing adult court for CNET
here's your first one now this is a
feature phone its main feature in fact
is that it has a QWERTY keyboard it's in
portrait mode here so you don't have to
slide anything open to start texting
there's a small 2.4 inch QVGA screen on
here resolution is pretty low so the
lettering doesn't look very fine or
sharp and the image is don't either
however it is easy to navigate with this
d-pad right over here and the soft keys
one thing that's really nice about the
keyboard is that although it's compact
the keys are separated fully and are
also raised above the surface so it's
really easy to get some traction with
your finger I didn't find the spacebar
quite as responsive as the other keys
which sometimes messed me up while I was
writing longer messages but overall I
thought that it was pretty nice
usability on a keyboard could be a
little bit better though I noticed that
there is no spellcheck and it does not
insert a period when you double tap the
spacebar those could be nice touches by
today's standards with jumbo phones this
one is very pocketable and portable so
that's a nice touch too there is a micro
SD card slot on the side so you can
expand memory up to 32 gigabytes there's
also a 3 megapixel camera on the back no
flash nothing too fancy here there is a
camcorder built into it the camera is
alright for basic shots but colors
looked pretty dull and they weren't too
sharp or detailed if this phone looks
familiar to you it's probably because
the design hasn't really changed in at
least five years and neither has the
software inside of it overall it's not a
bad phone especially if you're really
looking for a portrait QWERTY for not
too much money but I would say shop
around because there are other options
like it and this one just really doesn't
blow me away I'm Jessica's all-court for
CNN you can read my full review of the
