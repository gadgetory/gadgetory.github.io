Francisco welcome to a special edition
of reporters roundtable so Google this
morning just announced a major redesign
of its social network product Google
Plus now google plus of course is not
Google's first try to build out a social
network other products that company has
experimented with include buzz orchid
and to an extent wave but Google+ seems
to be the company's line in the sand
this is the product that Google seems to
be well it seems to be saying we will do
whatever it takes to make this social
network product really stick there are
two key people behind this initiative
over at Google they are Victor and ultra
who's the senior vice president of
social at Google and Bradley Horowitz is
a vp of product for Google+ and they're
both with us today gentlemen thank you
so much for making the time to join us
on your relaunch day it's good to have
you here you're welcome and very nice
for you to have us on the show right so
I want to get started with a little bit
of background on Google+ this thing is
um not even a year old tell us briefly
why you launched animal and what you've
learned in these last several months
yeah I mean it's a we just celebrated
about two weeks ago our six-month
anniversary of opening up to the public
so we're about six months and a few
weeks old and it has been quite a ride
you know this morning we announced we've
had 170 million people upgrade to a
google plus profile and start using our
product and so we've been kind of blown
away by the progression and the progress
that we've made as you pointed out we've
had other social efforts in the past
we've learned a lot from from those
efforts and we've really tried to make
Google+ something special and we've just
been thrilled at the adoption and at the
rate people are upgrading to google plus
I have to ask you about the numbers the
numbers that are throwing around been
thrown around right now we've got 100
million users this morning hundred and
seventy million people have upgraded uh
that what are those numbers really mean
I mean how many people are actually
using Google+ not just a little update
icon every day or every week or every
month yeah you know I think in order to
answer that question you really got
understand what Google+ is and Google+
is really the unification of all of
googles
services with a common social layer and
so if you think about today products
people love like youtube or android or
gmail or search your identity is
different in every one of those cases if
I take a picture of my wife on Android
and I want to share it with my family
how I do that and how I do that on gmail
or how I upload a video on YouTube used
to be completely different google+ makes
Google simplify by having a common
notion of you your identity and then
your relationships and so as we take the
services people know and love and unify
them then sharing that photo or that
video with your family is exactly the
same across YouTube or Android or gmail
in fact even endorsing a search link
maybe you see an article on Parkinson's
disease and you want your family to note
that you you're endorsing that article
or sharing that article you can do that
in a very very easy way so anywhere
people get confused as we also in
addition to having a social area cross
Google have things like the Google+
stream or the home where you see common
social posts and when we say we have a
hundred million active users which is an
old statistic from from last month we
really mean anyone using a google
property signed in as a Google+ user and
taking advantage of the social graph
seeing their friends comments or
themselves commenting or endorsing so
and so that's a pretty stunning number
we think in just a little over six
months and we couldn't be happier how
many people actually go to plus google
com and interact with it on the page
like they go to facebook com and
interact well I think when you when you
talk about Facebook's numbers Facebook
releases numbers for facebook usage
which includes Facebook photos facebook
messaging facebook groups facebook
tagging facebook likes the facebook
never talks about just the stream right
because that doesn't make sense it's all
integrated when you tag someone in a
photo or when you invite someone to an
event or those are all part of the
social experience and so that's exactly
what we're doing here of course the
numbers on the stream are incredible and
growing every day we hit new record
we had another record again and so it's
thrilling to see that growth but really
it's a misunderstanding of the Google+
strategy to only focus on photos or only
focus on messaging or to only focus on
the stream then then then you're not
getting the Google+ strategy and and
rate this really is in contrast to the
products that you mentioned that are the
historical legacy things like blogger or
buzz or orkut things that are social but
we're really sort of over to the side
and not core to the Google experience
what we're doing with Google+ as Vic
said is unifying identity relationship
across all of Google and we think any
social network should have for instance
a great messaging system and we happen
to have one at Google it's called gmail
and that is part of Google Plus it
should have great support for multimedia
and video we happen to have a great
service called YouTube which is also
part Google+ so thinking of these things
separately is not the way we think about
the Google+ strategy I I get that that's
pretty clear but it might be the way
that people who are coming from other
social products might be thinking of how
they approach the social web actually
we're seeing just the opposite we're
seeing Google users really love that
fact that their Google experience from
YouTube to Android to gmail is becoming
really simplified and unified now we do
acknowledge that there are some critics
who would love to like get technical and
focus only on our photos or only on the
+1 button or you know but that's not the
way users we're focused on users lets
users really we look at the data and
we're absolutely thrilled with the
adoption of services like chrome and
YouTube and Android and bringing them
together our users have consistently
told us that's what they want and the
adoption numbers show it we're really
excited about that let's talk a little
bit about the new design here what was
the the problem you are trying to solve
or what were you trying to improve with
the relaunch today of the interface for
google plus good i I think there's a
couple things that are exciting about
the design one is really around
aesthetics and beauty I think we have
done something that sets a new bar for
Google products in terms of its visceral
experience and we couldn't be
happier with the response that we're
getting it's pretty gratifying we sort
of knew internally that we were on to
something that was a big step function
from where we were but you know we're
seeing very supportive articles in the
press and more importantly feedback from
users about this experience I think in
addition to the aesthetics sort of the
bones of our interface were due for a
refresh and we alluded to some of this
an index blog post there's more coming
and we needed to sort of make space in
an information architecture sense for
where to put the new stuff that will be
launching from now through the rest of
the year and this is a really durable
framework that we're excited about
because it not only accommodates the
product we have today but all the
features and improvements that we know
are coming around the corner yeah you
know frankly when we launched a few
months ago we didn't have things like
games were hangouts or plus pages
there's so many things we've done in the
last few months and many more to come
has broadly said that we had to prepare
for this and make it interface that's
scaled and then the other thing is we
just never anticipated not in Bradley
and i and the team no one ever dreamed a
few months ago that we would have people
on the service that would have millions
of followers you know competitive Social
Services took many years in cases before
followers before people had millions of
followers and because of the rapid
growth people were actually posting very
high value content on Google+ and that
content needed to look beautiful we
wanted not just the people who had a
million followers but for the people who
are sharing with their family we wanted
them to have a place that they were
proud of where their content really
shined and looked beautiful and I think
today's a new and improved Google+ is
about both points the one that Bradley
mentioned getting ready for all the new
stuff that's coming and keeping up with
our torrid growth and the point about
making it a great place for you to be
proud of your content how it appears to
your friends and family and just making
something that has emotional resonance
with people that is something that's
beautiful Picasso once said good artists
copy great artists steal and there have
been many great social network artists
that have come before you Facebook and
MySpace to extend
Twitter product other products you've
done from these other services other
products what aesthetics what user
interaction what emotion have you tried
to put into Google+ and how is it
reflected in today's product I think as
you point out we're not sort of entering
the market in a vacuum and there are
certain established gestures and
paradigms and metaphors that users and
and the industry has developed over over
years I think what we're trying to do is
serve the user so where existing
paradigms make sense and there are sort
of comfortable ways to convey
information we use those where there are
new opportunities to do something more
valuable of I think our hover comments
are an example of something that is both
beautiful and industry-leading in terms
of our ability to sort of allow you to
mouse over any user's name and get
really great representation of who that
user is in relation to you we will set
that new bar and so I think it's a
combination of sort of serving the user
not sort of vaulting them into
unfamiliar territory that that is going
to disorient them but finding
improvements that actually make a
material difference in their experience
where possible and in much of the the
new stuff is not about the pixels you
know it's about providing a new and a
better user experience for things people
need to do you know before Google+
multi-user video with your family where
the camera would dynamically switch
based on whoever was talking those were
only high-end systems or systems that
you have to pay for we've made that
simple and free you know and so that's a
kind of an example where the user
experience were focused on the user
doing breakthrough things I'll give you
another example since you talked about
existing social products when we analyze
those products we found some awkwardness
we'd often ask people is there anything
you don't like and we often heard well I
feel kind of awkward my boss send me an
invite if I don't accept it i'm going to
feel bad but if i do accept it he's
going to see the pictures of me on the
beach and so we designed circles to deal
with that awkwardness you can add your
boss to a circle he never knows the name
of the circle you don't feel any
socially awkward
you don't feel social awkwardness you
can share the right things with the
right people so our innovation is more
than just the pixels it's in the design
from hangouts to circles everything is
really thought through to make it better
for the user enabling the user to share
the right things with the right people
one of Facebook's most powerful features
is the idea of the like and the like
button and we're seeing in the case of
Pinterest for example we're seeing the
that button migrated out of pages and
into the toolbar so people are pinning
everything Google+ has the +1 yet it's
still not completely integrated into the
mainstream of what users are doing it
talked about the evolution of +1 and how
important it is as a social signal yeah
I mean it's very important we r thrilled
with the integration of plus one if you
+1 something on cnet's article it shows
directly up into Google+ the integration
is absolutely gorgeous and it actually
gives the user the ability to decide
which circles that cnet article is going
to go to the coverage this the +1 button
across the web has astounded us I don't
think any of us could have dreamed a
year ago that the +1 button would be
literally everywhere and we're very
humbled by the adoption it certainly has
succeeded beyond anything we ever
imagined you can go literally anywhere
on the web and see that +1 button
integrated yeah but I think one of the
value propositions Wraith is that the +1
button gives you this opportunity to
provide contextual value right now if I
plus 1 a toaster that's probably not
interested to the million or so people
that have me in circles on Google+ I you
know when it is valuable to them when
they want to buy a toaster and they can
go to google and type in toaster and
suddenly see an endorsement from someone
they know someone they trust and so it
sort of changes what used to be spam
this sort of you know inhibition that
people have in sort of spamming their
friends it changes it into a gesture of
generosity that they can actually label
an endorsement for a product or a
website or another person in a way that
is generous and contributes to the
relationships that they have I think the
Parkinson's disease article I used
earlier is an example of that I don't
want all one
millions of followers that I have to see
what article on Parkinson's disease
because i injected it into my strain but
for my family who may be dealing with
that issue that's a great article and i
have the discretion of + wanting it and
then that's it then they see it when
they do a search for Parkinson's disease
or I have the ability to actually push
it into the stream scope it to my family
circle and make a comment we think this
level of nuance this level of dexterity
and control is exactly what users want
and the data that we're seeing uptick in
usage the adoption by users really tells
us that that we're on to something let's
talk about mobile for a little bit
obviously the world is moving to
smartphones how's the Google+ evolution
going on mobile devices Android and
iPhone in particular I'm not sure once
again we could have ever expected
Android to have the success that it has
and remember Google+ is just a social
layer across Google properties and so as
we take the services you see in Android
and unify them so that sharing and
identity is common across Gmail and
YouTube and Android I think users are
going to absolutely love it of course
the Android you're already logged in
every user who uses android is already
logged in and having that identity so
that when you take a picture and those
pictures are automatically backed up so
if you lose your phone your pictures and
videos are up there Google+ and you can
access them at all times even as you
upgrade phones you never lose a photo I
think that's the kind of magic that
we're just getting started with wait
till you see what we're going to go do
next man what are you going to go do
next with Android I just said you have
to wait we have a lot of surprises but
let me tell you across the company
across the company we are working to
unify Google and make it more beautiful
and delightful for users we think
automatically backing up your pictures
on your phone for your eyes only for
free is a kind of scenario that we can
deliver to users that people just love
and what they expect from google now one
of the things that you've done in this
big social push at Google is you've
actually removed some social features
from other products like reader
obviously there was a lot of thinking
that went behind that talk about how
that is part of the integration the
unification strategy um actually we
don't spend much time on things that are
not
solutely core to what we're doing and so
Bradley and I are probably not the right
guys to talk to you about reader we do
have people on the team we can get to
talk about reader but I suspect we're
not even familiar in details about about
that product okay now our time on things
like Gmail and YouTube and Android and
chrome and search and ads really the
main focus of the company and bringing
those together in a magical way now
privacy we have to talk about when it
comes to social networks no big online
company has a perfect track record us
included yes that's what I'm talking
about so what is your philosophy here
how do you correct for missteps because
you're going to make more in the future
we all are and how do you square the
need to protect users with Google's need
to generate revenue well one of the
things about having made mistakes is you
become acutely sensitized to the topic
of privacy and I think that some of what
we have been through as a company has
given us an opportunity to ask can we
make the world's most privacy
considerate social network it was part
of the philosophy and underpinnings of
Google+ from the beginning and it was a
market opportunity frankly it was
something that would be good for users
and they told us that they wanted so the
design of circles is a privacy
considerate feature it allows me to
expose parts of myself to the
appropriate people in my life and
protect parts of myself from others that
I don't want to see it so this is
inherent in the very design of the
system and we're extremely proud of the
privacy track record we have had lots of
people adopt Google+ that have raved
about the fundamental architectures that
allow them to be authentic on the system
because they know exactly who they're
talking to at any moment Vic has a line
that I love which is there's a reason
that there are frictions in systems for
instance there's a reason every thought
in my head does not come out of my mouth
that's a good thing and what we've tried
to do is present the same sort of
contextual opportunities at every point
of interaction in our system so when you
share we always ask you who is the
audience are you sharing this with your
family the public and we expect your
behavior and what you say in your tone
to be different in those contexts and
so that's a fundamental design
philosophy of Google+ and i think that
the lessons the hard one lessons that we
have brought to this have informed the
very design of the product and it's
actually quite hard for competitors to
sort of bolt on these privacy
considerate features they have to be
thought of in a fundamental sense from
the inception of the service and
something we're very proud of I have to
ask you about the recent acquisition the
Facebook made of Instagram it was a very
expensive acquisition and it was
arguably one of of a big user base what
what are your thoughts on on photo
sharing on Instagram and that particular
acquisition I think those 12 people did
very well yes and the users will see
we're really focused on delivering a
great experience for Google users as you
might imagine with Google users across
Android and Picasa and Google+ the
number of photos that our users are
sharing is staggering and Bradley and I
on the team or focus on making that
experience better and that's what we're
putting our energy all right so finally
you've got a bunch of people a whole lot
of people all over 100 hundred seventy
million users being upgraded today in
the next day or so to Google+ what are
the things that you would like people to
look for in the new experience that you
think will reflect most what you're
talking about here well I hope that
people appreciate the aesthetics of the
experience and that is sort of the first
impression in the one that we're
immediately getting tons of feedback
about it's extremely gratifying again
these sort of phase shifts in products
are often hard we both Vic and I both
been through very many of them very few
of them in fact none of them in my
recollection have gone as well as the
you know six hours since we launched
this this morning so it's been really
great to see the accolades and the
acceptance of the community of something
that is a big change for them and I
would invite them to really invest in
the product to play with the product
we're still in a mode where we have lots
of opportunity ahead of us and we're
very good listeners so the feedback we
collect in response to our users very
much informs the product
strategy and and that's what I always
love to see our users who are engaged
and vocal about what they love and what
they'd like to see change because it
really does give us opportunities to
serve those users yeah and I think I
would just say you know we're going to
keep up the speed of innovation that the
world is seen over the past couple of
months we constantly hear from our users
that one of the things that they find
most delightful is not only the fact
that we're listening but the service
itself is improving I don't know too
many services who barely six months
after they've open to the public do a
major forward redesign and I think
that's just indicative of what they
should expect from us going forward
phenomenal rate of innovation and
improvement and we can't wait to show
everybody what's coming next we will be
watching thanks very much gentlemen Vic
Gundotra is a senior vice president
president of social like Google Bradley
Horowitz vp of product for Google+
continue to good luck when will you roll
out be complete when will the users uh
all users have this we think we just
completed the rollout to a hundred
percent so if not a hundred percent
we're almost there almost everybody
should have the whole new redesign right
on alright guys thanks very much for the
time good luck thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
