Dreyfuss and welcome to rumor has it the
show where we round up the week's
biggest tech rumor and then we vote on
what sounds legit and what seems like it
will never ever happen and remember that
you can vote on all of the rumors too so
keep your eye out for the poll in the
interactive player if you're watching on
cnet first up there's a rumor we've been
talking about forever a Pandora killer
service built into itunes within a
freshly jailbroken ipad 9to5 mac
discovered a set of buttons and code
referencing a radio with an iOS 6 radio
buttons already exist in itunes on Macs
and PCs but so far they have not been
available on the iPad or the iphone
there's also another button suggesting
that you can make purchases via the
radio feature presumably from itunes now
rumors that Apple has had a streaming
music service in the works have been
floating around for years but they
heated up last year as talks with the
labels advanced and now that things like
this rumour won't ever die but I just
want to point out that these radio
mentions in the code could just be
remnants left over from Mac OS that
developers didn't bother to take out
when duplicating for iOS so don't get
your panties too much in a twist dude
you're getting a Dell which is now
actually a private company again brah
that's a reference to old dell
commercials youngins i bring it up
because the rumors that dell was going
to leave the public sphere and take the
company private again have come true
with the announcement on tuesday of a
twenty four point four billion dollar
deal between CEO and co-founder michael
dell and the investment firm Silver Lake
partners dell has been struggling of
late obviously and the idea with this
move back to becoming a private company
is that Michael Dell can attempt to do
what's necessary in order to save the
company without the intense pressure of
shareholders and don't forget
Microsoft's two billion dollar loan to
help Michael Dell do just that when
somebody as big as Microsoft believes in
your plan that's a pretty good sign next
up is yet another rumor that we've been
talking about a lot especially lately
but that's because it's so exciting a
couple weeks ago we mentioned that Sony
vice president of Home Entertainment
said that we should expect a PlayStation
4 announcement sometime in the
spring perhaps before e3 last week
invites were sent out for a big event in
New York on februari 20th the invitation
said nothing specific and the
accompanying video was just things
flying around with cool music but then
the Wall Street Journal said citing
people familiar with the matter
obviously that the ps4 will indeed be
unveiled at the februari 20th event and
that the machine will go on sale later
this year which means that I might be
wrong I've always thought that it would
come out in 2014 as did I the journal
sources also said that Sony will add
more social gaming features focusing not
on juicing up the gadget hardware but on
how players interact with the device and
according to the journal the optical
drive has not been dropped as previous
rumors had mentioned gaming site kotaku
also through its ideas into the mix
saying that it got its hands on official
documentation from super die about the
ps4 S controller remember him he
supposedly had all that insider info
about the next connect oh yeah so
according to him the design would
basically remain the same only would
incorporate motion sensing and a
touchpad similar to the one on the back
of Sony's Portable PlayStation Vita I
can't wait I'm so excited I'm going to
get Kingdom Hearts I'm gonna be okay
moving on Facebook is said to be
readying an app for tracking your
friends in real life yeah sounds creepy
to me to bloomberg is reporting that
next month Facebook will reveal a mobile
app that will alert you when you're near
your friends the worst part is that it
will broadcast your location even when
you're not using Facebook so it's like
Foursquare for lazy people you're
checked in to everywhere you go without
even having to do anything exactly and
instead of becoming the mayor of some
place you frequent as a prize you just
get stalked more efficiently by creeps
that you forgot you were friends with on
Facebook I can envision a couple of
scenarios where this would be cool say
like at a ball game or at a concert but
if you're at a concert then get off of
facebook and listen to the music but
more likely it'll just make me wary of
friending people on Facebook who I
wouldn't want to run into in the real
world we all have facebook friends that
we only want to interact with online
whether we admit it or not okay but much
worse than that what if it auto checks
me into a porno shop just because I have
parked out front or what if it checks me
into McDonald's in the middle of the
night I don't want people knowing about
that that's my secret shame sure there
are ways to opt out of the location
services but here's something even
easier you can just opt to not download
this then it won't even be an issue
which is exactly what I'm going to do
what do you guys think do you think that
Facebook will give us a stand-alone way
to stalk each other with minimal effort
don't forget to vote while we go ask the
scenic council would they think the cnet
councils compose 25 editors who cast
their votes anonymously their opinions
are not an endorsement by cnet or CBS
interactive obviously because these are
rumors folks and the scenic councils
verdict is unanimous yes one editor
rights soon there will be no place to
hide seriously now the only good part
about this being our penultimate show
together is that I get to save my
favorite word penultimate stay tuned
next week for our to our goodbye special
no fine okay but can we do a Google+
Hangout that's our show of you ready
please share your rumors that rumor has
it at cnet com or call us at 1 800 750
Cena and tweet us and tune in next week
for the last show or I'll be bringing
you more tech rumors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
