and it's time to get loaded lying about
who you are on the internet will be a
crime if the Department of Justice has
their way the department is pushing
Congress to make it a felony to make up
an identity on Facebook or even lie
about how you look on a dating site
basically going against the site's terms
of use the point is to go after people
who abuse a network or commit criminal
acts like identity theft it's a proposal
to strengthen the current Computer Fraud
and Abuse Act but opponents like the
ACLU and Electronic Frontier Foundation
say it's not lawful their argument if
it's not a crime to lie about yourself
at a party why can't you lie online if
you don't want Google to have your home
Wi-Fi in its geolocation database google
has explained how to take it off you
just have to know how to change the name
of your Wi-Fi network at the end of the
network name add underscore no map this
summer it was discovered google had a
database of Wi-Fi hotspots that used for
mapping including some people's home
networks and the PCs and phones that use
those networks the data was gathered
through various devices like Android
phones and google street view cars
anyone could tap into this information
until google curbed that feature but
it's only now that google offered a way
for someone to remove their network info
from the database the iTunes Match
service went live yesterday in an update
to the iTunes software if you have music
that wasn't purchased from itunes the
service will find the matching song in
the iTunes library and make it available
for your account on the cloud it costs
twenty-five dollars a year but the idea
is that a user doesn't have to worry
about where their file is saved when it
could be accessed from any device that
uses itunes software it won't work for
rare tracks that aren't sold already in
itunes and stay tuned for how Google's
new music cloud service will compare
that announcement comes tomorrow ATT
continues to work to catch up to
verizon's LTE 4g network by the end of
the month AT&amp;amp;T will have 15 areas that
can use LTE 4g adding Charlotte North
Carolina Indianapolis Kansas City Las
Vegas Oklahoma City and San Juan Puerto
Rico so for anyone counting that's 80
with 15 LTE cities Verizon with 165 18c
currently
24 devices that can tap into their
faster 4G network Twilight fans better
watch what they search for and click
this week as the new movie comes out
friday security experts from norton warn
there is a rise and malicious websites
ready to sink their teeth is this poor
unsuspecting Twihard searching for
details on twilight breaking dawn
searching for photos trailers clips and
plot details can pull up sites that
automatically download viruses or key
logging programs that will stalk your
every keystroke and in turn likely suck
the life from your bank account those
are your headlines for today I'm Bridget
