of video games climbing the ranks
mastering all the move sets and
strategies you know being a true gaming
badass but may actual experience level
well not so great I played games like
Grand Theft Auto Super Smash Bros and
Lord of the Rings but I was never really
good at them so naturally I thought a
dive headfirst into the professional
world of eSports but as insurance
I recruited eSports coach Donnie Chow
from dota alchemy to teach me how to
play dota 2 I watched others play dota 2
before I thought a game was so simple
you don't have to manage your kingdom
just guns blazing kill your enemies then
you win but apparently I had no idea
what I was getting myself into Donnie
and I didn't have an exact strategy our
plan was really simple don't die
Donnie was very helpful in getting me
started he talked me through general
navigation getting acquainted with
controls and to me my timing as a person
below level zero on video games I felt
much more confident playing it with his
instructions and I was learning more
quickly we arrived I make content for
YouTube and I have a website dota
alchemy comm play online courses
basically right so you have series of
different concepts in the game so one
thing that maybe we struggled with was
buying items granny game right and
there's 130 hundred 40 different items
so we might have a series on what items
to buy on what hero at what time in the
game because there's so many different
complexities about when one something is
good and when it's not good besides the
video lessons that people can just watch
you know like we played a game together
and that would be like a one-on-one
coaching
or we can even review previous games
kind of look at film look at the tape
there was a lot going out in the game at
least a lot more than I was used to dota
definitely tests your skills the game is
gorgeous but at the same time very
distracting
there's a lot to be constantly aware of
i had to click fast my left hand needs
to keep up with attacks my ears need to
pay attention to what donnie is telling
me my eyes had to keep with where my
hero is and my brain was just in a shock
stay like what the did you just do
and I will even admit I once followed a
creep in state of Donnie for several
minutes because they were both green
hold on come back here okay then I lost
track of the map I almost stepped into
enemy territory before Donnie stopped me
coming towards the bottom good idea
games like dota 2 Diablo common and
conquer any MMORPG or strategy game
really makes you appreciate a big
high-res monitor
I feel myself getting most frustrated
when the enemy heroes gang up on me it
was tough to try and think for myself
but also follow Donnie's lead he's tried
to heal me but I'm also trying to put
some distance between us and the creeps
but then I got stunned and it was all
too late
needless to say I die a lot
and I even took Donnie down with me and
he was just one other person I cannot
imagine what will happen with an entire
team this experience taught me just how
important communication is when it comes
to team competition from my own personal
perspective it kind of reminded me of
playing an instrument in a band we have
to watch the conductor's every movement
tons of notes on the music sheets listen
to each other sounds and tones manage
our own fingers on the keys and
breathing and now according to the music
and our own capability I can only
imagine the intensity when it comes to
competing in the International which is
the extravagant dota 2 world competition
where teams compete with five players
each Perl players from all over the
world that have years even decades of
gaming experience gather at the
international scouted recruited and
trained by eSports companies all eyes on
the million dollar prize money the
players have to manage their own heroes
watch their teammates pay attention to
the map analyze the situation coordinate
attacks with others and even plan out
advanced strategies to trick the enemies
players need to inform each other and
keep the communications clear at all
times it's like playing a physical sport
but with more intense actions
Donnie himself said he compares it to
his background playing baseball and
snowboarding so I've just had a lot of
athletic experience you know I taught
snowboarding for three years and that
really kind of cemented to the fact that
I really enjoyed teaching people
activities that I like and specifically
physical or like complicated ones
snowboarding for example is really scary
to a lot of people and seeing people
overcome that fear and like get it and
you know start turning is really really
exciting for me same thing with baseball
when you teach a kid how to throw a
curveball or you know how to field a
ground ball for example and they get it
and they do it it's really really
rewarding to see that growth I mean I've
been gaming my whole life my
grandparents had a regular Nintendo
back at their house and every time we'd
go to Colorado I'd get to play dr. Mario
and Tetris and we can be competitive
wideout a - it's just been a game that
I've been playing for like off and on
probably 13 or 14 years I really like
how competitive it is how much growth
there is to have in the game depending
on how much effort you put into getting
better that's a big part of dota is that
it's really really teamwork base these
pro players are actually they do what's
called bootcamping they all go to like a
location or they have team houses some
some of them even have like training
facilities now so they're all there
playing like 15 games a day looking at
their replays of their previous games
watching film basically you know how
basketball and baseball players will
watch film of their games to break down
their mistakes and they're building up
their communication and camaraderie and
teamwork it's like any other sport right
because you start to learn something
it's slow but then as you get better at
it you speed up and more things become
possible and so these guys are thinking
and moving and reacting at like Mach
speed compared to what we were doing the
International 2018 is coming up on
August 20th beside the Pearl players
another exciting team to watch will be
open a ice box team they have already
beaten top players in single player
match last year now they have five box
working a team to challenge pro teams I
have so much fun trying something a
little different here and learning the
basic ins and outs of dota 2 from Donnie
the experience really has taught me a
lot about multitasking
coordination and concentration and
really showed me just how demanding
eSports can really get there's certainly
a lot more for me to master but maybe
that's a video for another day
special thanks to DOTA alchemy and steal
