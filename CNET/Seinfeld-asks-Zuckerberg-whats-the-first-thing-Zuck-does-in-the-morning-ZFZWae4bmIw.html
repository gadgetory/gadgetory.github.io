interesting people who come by and visit
the office and I think I just caught
someone out of the corner of my eye I'm
gonna see if I can pull this off so give
me one moment and I'll be right back all
right I thought I thought I found
someone of interest here we got mr. mr.
Jerry Seinfeld hi how's it going I'm
doing great mark it's great to meet you
it's good to meet you I had no idea you
would be here
so what we're here we I think we have
like 10 or 15 more minutes in this Q&amp;amp;A
you oh no you don't take some questions
yeah sure
so here we should we should just pick
one I don't find any of these
interesting at all all right well then
what I revised what I would like to know
first of all I'd like to know what time
you woke up this morning 6:00 a.m. 6:00
a.m. okay now I'm not normal but max
rise like a pterodactyl right I thought
she I mean it's like I didn't know a
human could make those noises from its
butt but I guess that's the way it goes
I was never a morning person max is
definitely turning me into a morning
person so you can add a bed I didn't say
that you asked me when I woke up yo so
you wake up and you stay in bed well you
guys someone's gotta go gotta go calm
her down but and then what do you do
this morning I I went for a short run
okay before that I want to know the very
first thing you do you get out of the
bed you go to the bathroom
oh I don't know the first thing I do is
look at my phone oh you look at the
phone
okay that's interesting yeah I do that
too and what's the what do you want to
know what I usually want to know did the
Mets win or not that's what I want to
know what you do I look at Facebook all
right to see to see what's going on in
the world right I'm right and I and I
check my messages I look at messenger
and whatsapp and how long how many
minutes would you say you spend it
depends on where you go I gotta go to
the bathroom um you know it depends on
what's going on in the world on a good
calm day right it'll probably be no more
than a few minutes right
so you stay in the bed or you sit up on
the edge of the bed yeah I think it's um
it's down it's on the night table and I
just pull it in and it's it's actually a
pretty sad situation to be honest
because I I have contacts right I know
right see that well right and before I
put my contacts in I often go look to
see what's going on on Facebook - I'm
very nearsighted so I'm like yeah right
the phone so that um that's uh probably
not my my best moment no it's not any
but I mean I wasn't planning on talking
about this publicly but um well that's
what I like to do is I've is what I'm
interested in okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
