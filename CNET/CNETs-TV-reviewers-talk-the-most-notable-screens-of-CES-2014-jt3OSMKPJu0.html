live coverage here from international
CES 2014 I'm Brian Cooley and with me
are cats and ty ty pendlebury David Katz
Meyer are seen at TV experts and you
guys must love CES because no matter
what they say it shows about tvs oh yeah
a TV show just like this it's a TV show
get it we're here to round up the top
five television stories here the actual
television device stories of the show so
far when we're at the point now we can
say this is the definitive list right
pretty much okay absolutely so let's do
it I know you've heard a lot about these
TVs as we go along we're going to try
and demystify some of the technology as
well because there are some terms that
are getting bandied around that maybe
aren't fully understood so we'll learn
you a little bit or we're going over
these as well let's start with the
samsung you 9000 what's notable about
this guy well this is Samsung's real
push into curved TV they're coming out
with two series of curved TVs you 9000
have to be the 4k one the ultra
high-definition one it's curved you know
what else can you say I mean it's really
easy to describe it's really easy when
you have it on your wall to go you know
what I've got a new TV and this is very
different the one curved TV I got a
chance to play around with was there
OLED from last year that TVs curve
really didn't impress me it would seem
like the image was a little bit
distorted I haven't spent enough time to
really sit down and watch one of these
curved TVs for an extended period of
time they say it's really immersive a
little bit like an imax where they're
curved screens yeah but to me it seems
like you know tiny bit gimmicky i'm not
going to say that right yet because I
haven't spent too much time with them
but my initial impression is yet the
problem with curved TVs is that they're
really designed for one person you've
got to be a bit of a jerk if you own if
you have a family and you buy a curved
TV because you got to sit at the age
where you're at the apex that thing
right because if you're up over to one
side the near edge is going to get
really distorted yes very much I mean
you're truly off angle at that point
yeah the curve isn't that extreme but
you'll notice the distortion even more
when you're off angle and that's you
know it's just the nature of my other
question about about curve well one
observation that the video we just saw
of those curved TVs and those are real
sizes 60s and 70s range this is about
the giant 105 everyone's heard about
that's a different story but the thing I
noticed is the curvature seemed to be
more interesting on the 20 19 ratio that
big boy they rolled out then I really
felt like I was immersed do you think
ratio will make curve more important the
problem with that TV is that not many
content is available in 21 by nine it's
all 16 by 9 or 4 by 3 so if you're
watching you know normal cable
programming you're gonna be had there
and all that's going to be playing back
the letter box on the side right or
you're expanding it and stretching it
and if you want to stretch it and play
around with it then you're looking at a
curb stretch distorted you know cropped
image is distorted 4k yeah it still
looks great though okay ah now all the
other thing about that is you know
everyone's do buying TVs now LED LCD
largely because they're so thin we love
how they just kind of stick on the wall
now we're getting TVs that are six or
eight inches effectively deep because
their current is that a weird reversal
of consumer tastes yeah I think so I
mean it it does mount on the wall that's
one thing in Samsung's favor they are
shipping wall now kits with other curved
TVs least you're so right yeah so you
can actually put these things right on
the wall and it would make me walk into
a room that has a curved TV on the wall
that's that's pretty impressive itself
but you know decor wise unless you put
in a corner or something nobody's going
to stick out a lot more than flat TV and
I can imagine some people are maybe a
little bit sensitive about the decor
opting for the non curved UHD and of
course Samsung has you covered with that
too well that gets us to the next one
the bendable well of course TV so here
you have it both ways yeah do we want it
both ways we want it flat you've got to
have this I haven't actually seen it in
person but it's got a motor in it so it
actually cursor on the screen now so
people can watch it in the audience
they're there beside coming out kind of
an accordion on the side the kind of
make it tidy yeah that was me with the
remote control justjust it was addicting
band Thunder unban bend on bed but I
didn't break you know I did it I'll
jealously I can't wield that motor break
I don't know I hope that's covered by
the warranty you know maybe you got a
thousand bends you know and then it said
hope it's in-home service though yeah
because I don't want to truck that thing
out no so what it essentially does is
goes from jerk mode to family mode right
single person watching to family
watching
you can the weird thing about this TV
it's not an oled TV I thought when I
first saw it that it was going to be
OLED which is the standard curve thing
though headphones that are curved you
know to bring a flex friendly technology
this is an LVAD LCD so Samsung's
engineers did something to make you know
you're making the screen bend you make
the backlight band you're making the
frame around the edges Bend it's pretty
phenomenal sort of technology the crazy
thing what do we find out later early
coming the second half of this year it's
a real it's a real product not a concept
this TV is actually coming out according
to Samsung incredibly expensive die
haven't announced pricing yet i guess i
would say sixty to seventy thousand
thousands of thousands of dollars yeah
it's eighty five inches UHD if that
makes a difference but really it's just
call it Mandy alright which as good as
they may say it is it's clearly not the
world's best TV cuz Vizio just told us
what that is lutely now we know we can
everybody can write it down I'll go home
now we know the world's best TV vizio
says it's our my job is done what is
this one the RS 120 yes so the 120
stands for the size this is the largest
TV at CES that I've seen anyway 120 inch
diagonal its Vizio they again Vizio says
they are coming out with this television
they hit all the all the great things
that a TV reviewer like me really wants
to see it's a full array local dimming
with 384 zones it can actually hit the
rec 2020 color gamut which means that
it's got much wider color than other TVs
out there and it's actually part of the
4k standard this wreck 2020 and no other
TV i've ever seen and no manufacturers
claiming to come close to this so it'll
give you really punchy colors and they
can do that but actually having white
and red LEDs behind the screen so it's a
really kind of phenomenal engineering
front they've done here so again it's
interesting because this TV is this an
LED yes so it's an LED LCD and it's not
curved know they've eschewed the two
biggest sort of hot button things right
and kind of go on serious performance
right yeah i mean sorry for any local
dimming is is our favorite you know kind
of technology for LED LCD to make it
look good again not quite as good as
plasma there's some issues with LED LCD
with blooming and like that but
theoretically especially neff 384 loans
this can look phenomenal what brings
this what this brings to mind for me
is the old sharp elite TV from a couple
of years ago which bought the Kuro named
the Kuro elite name and that was a great
TV and it was a similar sort of
technology a lot of local dimming zones
a lot of money thrown at this thing this
thing is not going to be cheap it's a 65
inch version to you know if you I don't
know how much it's going to be for the
120 but long story short they put a lot
of rd into this TV and it seems like it
could be a really good television ozio
has told us in themselves that their
focus this year is picture quality and
they want to educate the public about
what local dimming is and how it makes a
picture darker and brighter as well yeah
basically just improving so they would
agree in pixels trying to fight a
backlight all the time when they want to
show black or dark absolutely the
backlight will dim in parts of the
screen that are supposed to be dark and
brighten imparts the screening supposed
to be bright the end result is great
contrast and tie you review the the
e-series from last a series is even
better this year they've come out with a
new model of that um you're going to see
in series of whose line all cos that's a
busy oh okay what are you going to sing
entry-level local dimming from Vizio
which no one else's to okay so
affordable with your favorite
illumination yeah it could be a really
good television which is great cuz
plasma just ended so we want to get so
it's interesting here is that so much of
the stuff that makes a TV great is the
subtler harder to explain stuff yeah you
guys have to pull this out in every
review and say look there the things
that are really great are not tangible
or gimmicky yeah they're measured in
subtle degrees of contrast color and
light management yeah and they cost
money to do right and so yeah a lot of
time but they did but you know they are
necessary they don't necessarily pop on
the show floor no you know they
definitely do the opposite of that
they'll pop in your home don't want a
problem on so yes big I trust a review
all right that's what way from the the
panels in the displays themselves to the
guts of the of two TVs one from hisense
and one from TCL to up-and-coming
upstart Chinese manufacturers who want
to be the next Samsung and LG if you
will historically and they've integrated
Roku into a television why is that a big
deal vs just having it on a cable well
now home theater review of Matt
Mackowiak basically loves Roku you've
got a dozen different set-top boxes you
can use you've got Apple you've got Roku
you know there's there's others but
essentially the reason the Roku is the
best is because it's got the most
services you know it's got like everyone
else does it's got netflix but it's also
got HBO GO
which not many others have else except
Samson got hulu I think you've also get
spotify as well so there's a whole
different bunch of little channel store
you can go into one there goes on and oh
yeah yeah and it's guys got PBS my kids
at home love PBS kids there was like
turn on roku daddys so you love that oh
it's critical odeon this any keeps going
watching something good beautiful family
folks ever have a roku box i'm just
curious love to think about umbria okay
and waffle TV huh very good a chromecast
Oh interesting mixture we've got yeah I
don't see any TVs with apple TV in them
at the show though but yeah one of the
nice things about the Roku is it updates
all the time these guys have been
sending out software updates over the
last couple years the boxes just keep
getting better and better one of things
about smart TVs is that they don't do
much to upgrade their OS is once they
sell you a smart TV you're kind of stuck
with that operating system it looks kind
of old in a couple of years that's the
bore and they haven't done a great job
no manufacturer if I'm if I'm reading
your reviews right has done a great job
with interface on a native smart TV yeah
some are good some are you know not so
great no but nobody's nailed it really
the simplicity of Roku is really so
simple so simple okay our last product
on our list here is not a TV but a
projector and you know one of the things
our projectors are you got to put them
away from the wall and things can get in
the way you know people walking in front
of projectors or what have you it's hard
to move around the living room all the
things working so sunny says push that
thing up against the wall which most
projectors you'd end up with an image
that big what is this one doing well
this it's similar it's called a short
throw projector so again you can get 100
47 inch image from a projector that's
right near the wall this thing is
basically a piece of furniture looks
like a little credenza there the
projector kind of pops up in the middle
that on the sides you can store your
equipment and that sort of stuff LG
actually came out with a product like
this last year and we thought it was
really cool as well but it's a new kind
of television I mean it gives you a
projector without having to have you
know again all of that stuff and walking
front of its ceiling mounted and that
sort of stuff this is a lot more
expensive than LG's is going to be
thirty to forty thousand dollars
definitely one of those concept high
enhances uav's I love it 4k resolution
that sort of thing so I mean Sony's done
some great things with design I don't
think this is an exception it's a
great-looking little products gorgeous
yeah and they have great projectors I
mean there's sony SXRD projectors we
reviewed
what is interesting about these is that
they're sort of deconstructed rear
projection TVs so at the same time the
Mitsubishi out of them yeah LG and sony
get into them yeah it's a short distance
so you're not worried about getting in
front of anything it's that huge screen
size that well not in this case had a
good value per square inch but that's
what your projections always did yeah
but this one is actually furniture it's
a place to put stuff it's a totally
hidden television you don't to pay I
mean compared to buying something that
brings up your TV from the floor I'm
sure that's a bargain and one of the
things the benefits it has versus rear
projection tvs that you don't have that
narrow viewing angle whereas we'd be a
projection because it's all over our
piece bad though oh yeah yeah you
couldn't watch them from the side but
this one obviously it's on a wall it's a
projector you can watch them for their
own people that are weird you're just
actually moving around its light on a
wall yeah i see i love projectors I've
always felt you guys have projectors or
just TVs on the way yeah we use
protectors at home I you know I don't
have enough room right now but you know
that's a dream but in the office we
actually started doing projectors last
year they've been really popular will do
movie nights at the office that's fun
but yeah we we stack two or three
projectors one on top of each other and
project them onto the screen we can
compare it don't you want to go to movie
night at the cnet TV lab I want to go to
moving that at the scene that TV line
next time that's the best night okay uh
last thing is join hands gentlemen won't
take a hand came again all right join us
hold hands with the tech aficionado with
you everybody come on everyone grab the
hand this is not weird bow your heads o
Lord we will miss you panasonic plasmas
you've been our favorite for many years
and a tremendous value you force took us
but will forgive you amen amen amen the
end of our favorite TV right yeah too
bad this show is the official nail
they're not coming out with any plasma
Spanish that's it and am sung says they
will yeah maybe okay so their name
looking a plasma flag raised for at
least another few months the only
company who as has actually said that
coming out with one is LG right I
haven't even shown them on the show
floor so yeah it's gone it's dodgy
planners he's got a dodgy future sad and
panasonic said in their press conference
that they're gonna make LCD that looks
as good as plasma whatever that means
yeah why reverse engineers something to
be as good as but more expensive right
on
understand that yeah I guess people are
allergic to plasma because of the i
guess the burn-in problems in it yeah I
guess it has the stink of being the old
technology it's not the exciting shiny
object yeah yeah tell that to someone
with the plasma in their home it goes
I'm got this thing i'm watching it looks
pretty good i feel these are plasma guns
great oh yeah i love telling that inside
store you go to our cnet TV experts
homes and what do they buy with their
money plasma right yeah oulad it'll be
our lead but give it three or four yeah
well that's affordable yeah absolutely
alright folks uh thanks guys anything in
the cat's meyer ty pendlebury our TV
