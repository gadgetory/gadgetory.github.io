welcome to the apple buy for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
this week it's a little iphone 6 apple
and beaten a black mamba in cupertino no
joke alright let's get to the show in
the latest iPhone rumor making noise
from nine to five Mac claims Apple may
be making a jump to a sharper 1704 x 960
resolution from the 5 s's 1136 x 640
that would be compatible with future
iphone models now on the rumoured 4.7
inch phone that would result in a
display with a 416 pixel per inch
resolution with the same 16 by 9 ratio
as the iphone 5s 5c and five while the
larger 5.5 inch iphone at that same
resolution would carry a 356 PPI that
would still fall under Apple's
definition of a retina resolution now
with these larger new screens in play if
Apple is keeping the phone at its
current resolution it would drop below
the retina criteria and it's important
to keep them compatible with current
apps and make the transition easy on
developers now the report also says
Cupertino has been testing phones at
this resolution but it's still not known
for sure if this will be the final one
that Apple sticks with all right we've
seen plenty of mock up to the 4.7 inch
iPhone these days but the first
comparison shots of a physical mock-up
of the 5.5 inch screen iPhone appeared
on rocketnews24 base on the mac fan
leaked design drawings and I'm sorry
that thing looks so huge and big even if
it's skinny now I'm down with the 4.7
inch screen but I don't want anything to
do with that phablet thingy alright and
if you're looking for any credible signs
when the next iPhone is dropping German
website I fund says Apple is looking to
restrict vacation days for german retail
employees this sep tember ahead of the
likely lunch for the iphone 6 and more
this has been an established policy over
the past few years and last year Apple
restricted vacation time during the last
two weeks of September for the 5s and 5c
now I'd like to apologize to the Apple
employees who might not be able to
celebrate mexican independence day on
sep tember the 16th
elephant appreciation day on the 22nd or
my personally culturally relevant
confucius day let's see what we got here
guys you have an ambitious nature and
may make a name for yourself right here
thanks for food fish now we told you
about a black mamba siding and we were
lying the world's deadliest basketball
player kobe bryant aka the black mamba
was spotted inside apples Cupertino
campus with his wife and according to
reports Kobe met up with Johnny I've
with the meeting centered around
upcoming products now why is this
important well one because Kobe and
Apple are two my favorite things and to
Kobe and Apple are two of my favorite
things but think about it right now Kobe
knows more than almost anyone does and
maybe the Black Mamba will be part of
Apple's new wearable campaign doing this
uh and he did that to my warriors my
dubs all right in iOS 8 news reports say
Apple is likely to bring split screen
functionality for specific apps to
Apple's iPad in iOS 8 yes please the
feature will allow users to run and
interact with two ipad apps at once
taking a page from Microsoft Surface now
this concept video from Sam Beckett
gives you a rough idea of how it could
be executed and it allows specific apps
to interact with each other more easily
now this new feature along with the new
health book application updated maps and
more are expected at WWDC during the
June second keynote but they could also
be pushed out in a later iOS 8.1 update
now you've heard about the rumor deal
where Apple is buying beats for 3.2
billion dollars in its expect to be
finalized next week according to recode
dr. dre pretty much confirmed it with
Tyrese in this video clip they need to
update before that let's just change in
a big way oh my oh my first big in there
in hip hop right here from the best
coast believe oh there were a lot of
bends in that video and come on guys
this is a children's show now beats
co-founders dr. dre and jimmy iovine are
expected to take on senior roles at
apple once the deal is done and everyone
has their own ideas if this is a good
deal or a bad deal and that's going to
really play itself out over time but
this is how Apple might be looking at it
beat sells over a billion dollars in
headphones every year at high margins
and that's a good thing but this isn't
just about headphones Apple has been
criticized for not having a music
subscription service and yes beats
didn't really create the most popular
one in fact reports claim they only have
about 110,000 active users and that's
nothing compared to Spotify is roughly
10 million paying subscribers worldwide
but beats has secured the licensing
deals and all Apple has to do really is
roll this into their own subscription
service but lastly Apple really hasn't
had a creative artistic mind since SJ
passed away and Dre and Iovine can bring
some of that unique music mojo to the
table that no one else on their staff
has in its leadership roles plus it's
big bucks it's a big deal but one thing
we do know is that an apple a day still
keeps the doctor away
you know I'm mopping with the
d-o-double-g straight off the killer's
recent CPT unless it's offering 3.2
billion dollars and it's official flappy
bird is coming back in august according
to creator dong un during a CNBC
interview he said the new version of
flappy bird will be a multiplayer game
that is less addictive don't that's the
worst idea ever less addictive bad apple
then don't drop sneak peek at his new
game with this screenshot he said he's
making a new game so people can forget
about flappy bird for a while and again
the worst idea ever don't you killing me
but come on I've got nothing but love
for someone who made a game that rakes
in over fifty thousand dollars a day
alright guys that's going to do for this
we show keep sending me your emails to
the Apple by to cnet com or tweet me
tweet tweet tweet thanks so much for
watching i'm brian Tong it will catch
you all next week for another bite of
the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
