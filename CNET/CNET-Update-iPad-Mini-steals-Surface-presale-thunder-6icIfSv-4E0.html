surface moment I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update Microsoft has
finally announced the price of surface
its first tablet computer and the
starting price is the same as the iPad
at five hundred dollars but it has
double the storage with 32 gigs and a
built-in kickstand as well as Microsoft
Office the surface now can be
pre-ordered you'll be seeing commercials
for this now
but that colorful snap on keyboard cover
which makes it so unique well that will
cost you a hundred dollars extra so
really the starting price is like six
hundred dollars but it's still cheaper
than buying a 32 gig ipad with all those
accessories and you should know that the
touch cover keyboard doesn't have
buttons if you want something more
tactile that feels like typing that will
cost 130 dollars all these goodies come
out on October 26 the same day Windows 8
is released and one hour after the
surface prices were announced and it
went on sale Apple just steals the media
thunder and sends out a notice that the
ipad mini will be announced next week on
tuesday october 23rd so it's official
iPad Mini is coming tis the season for
tablet throwdowns Facebook has added a
list of emoticons that can go way beyond
the usual smiley faces you can have a
Chuck Norris head a robot or nyan cat
yeah these more complex ones are only
for chat or private messages but you can
also use some fun ones in comments like
a shark or penguin you can find the full
list on our story at Cena if you like
your phone screens big then get excited
for the galaxy note 2 this 5.5 inch
screen android is coming to sprint on
october 25th and it will have new
features for the s-pen stylus be sure to
take a look at the updated foursquare
com the site is now more of a social
search tool that anyone can use to find
recommended places nearby so basically
it's less about earning points and
becoming mayor and more about being a
useful tool like Yelp get ready for a
whole new take on DVRs with the new
boxee TV there's no storage in this box
it saves all your recordings in the
cloud and there's no limit to how much
you can record it costs $99 but you also
need to pay a fifteen dollar a month
subscription for the service if you're
looking to cut the cost of cable this
could be a dream come true it has its
own antenna for recording over-the-air
TV and it can pick up some basic cable
you can record two shows at once and
shows can also be watched on the boxee
website this new system launches
november first starting with eight
markets it will be interesting to see
how well it works with a typical
broadband connection after all that's a
lot of data being transferred that's
your tech news update for today you can
