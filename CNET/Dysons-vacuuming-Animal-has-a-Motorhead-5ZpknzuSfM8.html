I'm here today with the dyson dc50 9
motor head the reason it's called the
Motorhead is geniusly
it has a motor right there in its
brushroll head it takes some of the
power from the motor here transfers it
to a separate motor down here and it
uses that motor to power the brushroll
agitate your carpets a little bit more
and get those fine particles out of
there with that agitation the motor hood
is an upgrade from the dyson dc50 9
animal and like the animal it's light
it's easy to maneuver it powers with
this trigger here and like the animal
it's almost for a vacuum fun the motor
head is almost exactly like the animal
in fact sometimes it's even a little
hard to tell them apart so the question
is does that motorized head provide
enough of a performance boost to make
this guy nope sorry this guy a
worthwhile upgrade I'm happy to say that
performance was this thing does rock at
picking up fine particles but the
improvements both over the animal and
other stick vex is really only a
marginal improvement and at five hundred
and fifty dollars the price is so much
more
additionally the motorized head actually
results in some performance drops with
larger particles the compartment here is
wire with larger particles that resulted
in this smaller compartment getting jams
and because of the power from the engine
to the motor head the battery life drops
this thing has significantly lower
battery life than the animal this one
also claims that this thing is
worthwhile because it can replace your
standard upright but because it jams on
large particles and because it won't
stand up on its
and because you can't get to more than a
room or two before you have to recharge
no it can't really replace your standard
upright all in all the Hoover Linx for
$200 is just about as good as this one
and this isn't a clear upgrade over the
DC 59 animal meaning if you already have
that one
don't go spend another 550 to get this
one it's definitely not worth it
but if you're willing to pay the premium
for the top-performing stick vac out
there marginally top-performing but it
is at the top then this dyson dc50 9
motor head is worth your consideration
