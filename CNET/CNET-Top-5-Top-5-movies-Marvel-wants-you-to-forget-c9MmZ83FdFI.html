in honor of the latest Marvel movie
ant-man we've got to be fun to take a
look at some of the Marvel movies that
weren't exactly excellent that's right
we're taking a look at the top five
movies Marvel wants you to forget ever
existed for the sake of clarity i should
say we are including all Marvel
properties not just a Disney Marvel
world so Fox Sony and other studios
they're fair game at number 5 is
angley's Hulk I know what you're
thinking wait it wasn't that bad right
sure their worst movies but I'm sure
marbles owner Disney would rather you
remember the Hulk from the recent
Avengers movies as the only Hulk
angley's Hall tried some interesting
things from a film perspective but it
generally didn't work also this movie
had the Hulk fight some kind of mutated
dogs and everyone nicknamed Hulk dogs
Hulk vs hulk dogs let that sink in at
number 4 spider-man 3 Wow where to start
with this one oh I I know the evil Peter
Parker finger guns and dancing there are
two dance scenes one where Mary Jane and
happy Harry Osborn danced the twist
because it's truly integral to the plot
and when evil Parker dances at a
nightclub to show he's evil Parker
between dance scenes was a spider-man
movie that had way too much going on
with Sandman venom and the Green Goblin
to be fair to the Sony Pictures
spider-man series spider-man one and two
were pretty good number three is
Catwoman no I'm kidding it's not a
Marvel movie but it is a movie I'd like
to forget ever seeing anyway daredevil
that's number three the new Netflix
series is pretty dang good the 2003
movie starring ben affleck not so much
there's some terrible dialogue in this
movie including daredevil growling time
to give the devil his due kudos
production team for trying to make an
Allred costume work but sorry it's an
awful costume Colin Farrell is
incredibly over the top as bullseye he
approaches like Joker from the 1966
Batman levels also the fight scenes
couldn't care less about physics who
needs physics not this movie and number
two is x men the last stand I was a
longtime fan of the x-men comic book
series x-men the last and looked like
it's going to follow the Dark Phoenix
saga which was friggin epic so yeah we
get that in the movie Cyclops has less
than five minutes of screen time he's
sort of important in the Dark Phoenix
saga just a little oh and he dies
off-screen if you're gonna kill a major
character in a movie for the love of
Stanley put the scene in the movie I
could probably branch much more on this
we should move on before we get to
number one let's talk about your pics I
asked you guys on Twitter for your
opinion on movies Marvel would like you
to forget and the biggest boat getters
were howard the duck and the 2005
fantastic four movies that didn't make
this list but could have ghost rider
amazing spider-man 2 iron man two x-men
origins wolverine and the punisher the
number two movie on this list made me
the most angry in the number one movie
made me the most disappointed the 1990
Captain America movie now this flick
featured Captain America and a rubber
suit that looked terrible complete with
poorly cut eye holes and caps pretty
inept in this movie the red skull
Captain America is a long time German
nemesis is Italian because reasons
Captain America manages to get beaten up
by the Red Skull strapped to a missile
headed to the White House captain
manages to kick the rocket a bunch of
times which somehow changes the
coordinates of the missile so it lands
in Alaska instead this movie would fly
that awful thankfully Marvel's made some
good captain america movies so we can
all forget this thing ever happened but
if you don't want to forget it's on a
blu-ray right now really agree disagree
with me let me know in the comments on
YouTube or hit me up on Twitter i'm at
is for more top fires like this visit

watching
