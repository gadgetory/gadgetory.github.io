I'm Brian cooleemee cooleemee that's my
new name we're off to a good start
luckily I've got able support real
broadcasters our TV gurus David Katz
Meyer and ty pendlebury come in here at
the end of the show you guys have no
excuse not to have all the answers
because you've tested everything or we
forgotten it all by now awk forgot that
all right now this is arguably the kind
of the most fun of the focus segments we
do here at CES let's face it we all have
a TV everyone in this show loves TVs
they're big they're beautiful and they
just have a tasty pneus about them let's
get right into it now the most audacious
thing we saw rolls up like a piece of
parchment paper yes the LG 18-inch
rollable display like nothing I've ever
seen the cool part about its OLED so
organic light-emitting diode displays
can kind of be rolled into this shape
because they're extremely thin yeah this
thing i want to say point 18 millimeters
thick just about as a paper yeah right
right just and you can you can roll it
up they didn't let me roll this one up
this one's actually plugged in so it
works of course the downside is where
you put the hdmi cable on a rollable TV
they're still working on that but it
allows you know in the future you can
picture you know Rowling's up like a
newspaper taking the tvs with you
they're trying to get it bigger and just
improve this this really cool concept
use case again portability impressing
people at CES newspapers magazines
digital magazines well that's
interesting isn't it to merge the two
media yeah you know cuz right now we
think that print is print and video is
video and they have a portability they
have a move ability of non mobility
interactivity difference maybe they
could add a touch layer to this one day
I'm sure they will all of a sudden it's
amazing then you like you say if it's
just a thin little back plane that has
hdmi and battery maybe little wireless
radio in there and all of a sudden
Jetsons okay now this is most
interesting of the big TVs we get giant
tvs here at the show every year it's one
of the one of the kind of ding dong
headlines I think it's like ah someone
so it's got 180 inch TV and then you
never seen or care about it again the
it's the Emirates first-class suite of
CES want it love it we'll never have
access
but here this one is composed of pieces
yes so Samsung's 170 inch the largest
one I've ever seen at CES a massive
massive but it's not one panel it's X
number of these little panels that kind
of fit together and each of the panels
is goes right to the edge so when
they're all put together you can't tell
that they're put together it looks just
like a complete flat panel so this
little these raised segments and and you
can see they look like one TV and then
all of a sudden they're these little
modules and samsung says one of the big
cool things about this is that these
really large tvs are really hard to ship
they break and shipping yeah so when
you're shipping his module that's a lot
easier you can get them to be as large
as you need to so you know TVs are just
getting bigger and bigger bigger bigger
but how large you know they need to be
before they're impossible yes these
segments are what about a foot square or
something yeah they're a little bit
bigger than that but and and and they're
not quite square so you know you can
make them into the sixteen by nine or
even the 21 by nine okay how do you
build right right you need the
widescreen or maybe you want a TV that
goes from widescreen to cinema scope
which is 21 by nine you can do that as
well and not have any black bars so you
know it's a pretty cool transformable
concept like I said I came along on this
one I thought okay this sounds like a
like a retail installation or commercial
display industry thing it could be
gimmicky but you know we think about it
there are some real uses for it this
addresses the yield issue because big
panels are hard to make little panels
are easy really good point Brian sign me
up there you go all right uh Todd you've
got a piece of home audio that you're in
love with and this is often one that
people they skip that part of CES
sometimes it doesn't blend if kidding
over in the venetian where no one goes
ok so it's hidden there to begin with
right but there's some speakers that you
say are the best anywhere at their price
absolutely 0 back three years ago four
years ago now the LG OLED remember that
thing the first I led the coma I was
really excited about that TV I had the
same level or the same feeling about
this product when I saw it yesterday at
the Venetian on the thirtieth floor
essentially it's a small bookshelf
speaker it's very cheap it's 500 bucks
it's designed by Andruw Jones who was a
pioneer now at elac America that
basically started up an American arm of
this German German company
okay and he's making budget entry-level
speakers that sound amazing and out of
here on the screens pull that up okay so
there it is i mean you know speakers
sometimes can just look very
unimpressive right it's a pretty speaker
right but i would look at it's okay it's
got two drivers and it sits in a box and
huh so you see the weird thing about
that that tops driver is actually
concentric drivers so it's actually got
a tweeter in the middle of a mid-range
Oh interesting so bad and it's separated
it's actually divorced from the base
drivers so they don't interfere with
each other very very cool floating
concentric driver right and it's very
cool technology to really good price so
tell me how the average person would we
would be amazed by this what might when
I hear that would make me so okay well
that is amazing well you'll just hear a
lot of bass it's really small speaker
you'll hear a lot of bass coming out of
that did you'd only hear from a
floorstanding speaker okay the imaging
it's amazing it's like you don't hear
the speaker's themselves you just zero a
wide range of sound across the whole the
whole plane yeah because the worst
imaging is usually when you can really
specifically here left and right speaker
and it sounds like you have two speakers
right this is hifi at you know an
entry-level price it's really amazing
nice okay so there's a great great
speaker for your home theater system
these would be great for your like main
left and right in the front of the room
for example absolutely and reuse as well
okay nice 500 bucks a pair not bad
quantum technology we're going to talk
about a TV and we're going to educate
folks first of all what are quantum dots
well quantum dot is a technology you can
apply to the inside and LCD television
they're basically little nanocrystals
miniature crystals that focus the light
from the liquid crystals for the LED
backlight so the lights LED light shine
through the the SU HD in this case
quantum dots yeah and focus the light
purify the light make it a little bit
better a little bit wider than the LEDs
could do normally so then they hit the
liquid crystals which are also RGB and
the end result is a wider color gamut
and what samsung is calling a pure light
quantum dots are used on other tvs of
course but samsung is the real main
proponent of it this year and you the
benefit that we've seen is that you get
this wider color coverage than you would
with other LCD technology so path to HDR
that's part of HDR is is the wide color
gamut is the representation of more the
colors in nature that you had on the
screen and you would before the just we
have it's right now you've got an LED
backlight as usual in the back up then
there's a layer of quantum not
technology and then you have your liquid
crystals and it's a sandwich okay just
goes in the middle it's a big contrast
to oled which is again we looked at it
before these really thin displays that
are basically one layer because all that
is emissive you're all red light comes
out of the same land you don't need all
these fancy things that's so that's so
incredibly thin okay the SU hd2 actually
showed a really thin concept su hd2 but
they can't get it that thin and
obviously you're not going to roll up an
LCD TV anytime soon yeah especially when
you've got layers of expensive
technology there but you know everybody
be a lot of shattered parts now I want
to get pho I'm gonna get a graphic up
here as we continue to talk about HDR
because the you engine that's part of it
is showing more colors that the human
eye can see and then there's also a
contrast piece but so people can
understand a little bit more about this
whole idea of colors i have a only
moderately wonky graphic we use this
couple days ago but now we actually have
the experts here so this big old lobe is
all the colors the human eye can see yes
alright and if I have this right the
small wreck triangle in here represents
what the current spec for HDTV can show
it's a smallish subset that is I don't
know it looks like it's about half yeah
the colors I can see now here's my
question for you guys I've heard about
both these two triangles p 3 and 20 22
different specs both being considered in
the HDR realm can you clear that up a
little bit well yeah it's pretty simple
I mean nobody can make 2020 doesn't
exist there ok so this later one here
that is on the outer edge display that
can actually hit all the color points to
accurately produce 2020 ok maybe at some
point in the future some quantum dot
magician will create it but right now
we're looking at so we're back to this
right III so p3 is the maximum that you
can get in a display today there's an
advantage though because actually the
content producers are making things
inside a 2020 container you want to make
it the content itself it is a large of a
container as you can so you can kind of
dumb it down and you shouldn't roofs it
as well so you can you can scale the
color down to a p3 or down to a 709
depending on what the television can
handle and that's one of the benefits of
HD
rhd are specs have the ability to
actually take into consideration the
televisions own capabilities and scale
the content dynamically to what the TV
can actually predict because you always
want to flee the television the max if
not more than it can show and let it
pull that down and right now what you're
feeding these TVs is 709 and and with
the TVs are capable of much wider than
that generally interesting so you want
to have the content match what the TV
can produce at its best so just so you
know just fit folks to them you look at
this graphic and look how little of the
color your eye can see that your HD TV
shows in this 709 spec we use today you
know anything that gets toward more of
those colors and the other part is the
dynamic range between dark and light
right yes so that's actually what HDR is
is really impactful for so the HDR TVs
that they're coming out the very best of
them can hit a thousand nits which is
aspect really bright and that means that
the highlights for example the glint of
sunlight or you know any sort of really
bright color looks much more realistic
and you know skies are a good example
and so you have the TV able to produce
these really bright highlights and it
makes it look spectacular if you have a
really powerful expensive television
that can produce these kinds of things
the problem with HDR right now is that
all of these TVs are getting HDR
compatibility so they may or may not
actually give you much benefit at the
end of the day so a lot of guys are
selling HDR compatibility on their mid
and lower range televisions yeah and
those are the ones that are not going to
really give you that great impact so
let's see how HDR is implemented
throughout the year and what kind of you
know what kind of pictures you actually
get out of content so HDR is not just a
matter of a certain spec it's a matter
of how will they execute yes what they
say is on the label absolutely and on
it's not it's not binary I've always the
rub always the bubble the 4k was
different me 4k is a little simpler it's
like you either have that many dots or
you don't right it's a little more of a
switch for K is easy to understand but
again the implementation is not
necessarily going to give you a greater
picture quality just because it's for
can you guys believe HDR is the under
some hero of the new resolutions and
color technology has the potential to be
incredible and and the other thing gotta
clear is that it's a whole suite of
content improvement so Hollywood creates
these things they actually scale the the
movie or the TV show to HDR yeah
you know they're they're in there making
their decisions on their mastering
displays and punching up certain areas
color then they have a much wider
palette to do those things with you know
they have a much wider range of color
than much wider dynamic range of light
to dark to make these decisions and make
the the video look more like the intent
okay so bottom line is HDR is arguably
more important than 4k I would say to
the eye you can actually see no artist
or you could really not actually really
Italy more important easily more
important okay so that's the key thing
to take away from this guy's you're
gonna hear for Kane it's very
understandable but know that HDR is the
harder to tell more important story
around your next television purchase hit
a pretty good job wasn't that hard no
right more colors better imple LG g 6
yeah the lgo LEDs have been the one that
we are widely quoted in their
advertising lately because they love us
for saying best picture ever right and
this is the son of best picture ever
it's the better than best picture of
agree because you know it's CES so how
could you possibly be the best again
because this is the new year this day
they bumped up the brightness they
improve the color gamut they just they
actually buff that almost all the way
they're saying to the edge of p3 so they
can do all these things and they also
made a lot thinner so this TV you're
looking at right now is the g6 the
top-of-the-line really crazy thin you
know again you can't roll it without
breaking it but you can you know enjoy
this amazing dynamic range because you
know the real selling point of all it is
and always has been the very deep blacks
you can get on the screen basically
infinite complete black and from there
you could marry that with the really
bright highlights and you get an
incredible picture because this does
something that plasma could never do I
know if anyone's ever got a plasma TV
whenever white comes on the screen it
sort of goes it closed down it's like
it'll go kind of red depending on the
plasma that you have whereas this OLED
you get white it's white get black it's
black so it can get much greater than
platter I'm endless fidelity to the
picture absolutely and of course these
are ultra-thin plasma could never do
that right yeah yeah there's other
advantages to you know especially
compared to LCD when you go off angle I
think that's the biggest demonstration
you got a fan go on an LCD or if you
look at your laptop from the side gray
out absolutely the washes out the colors
get you know less fidelity so with oled
that doesn't it
no she looks great from the crappy seat
on the edge of the room okay this big
boy we just saw how big was that TV that
65 they also make it into 77 this year
new new for this year the 77 is flat not
curved in fact props to LG for making
most of their lineup flat the way we
like them the 65 price on this not
determined yet they actually said it
would be less than ten thousand dollars
i'm guessing it's about a dollar less ok
a big discount yeah i'm a super skeptic
on this one 4k blu-ray players uh tell
me I'm right or wrong 4k blu-ray players
well that I think it's going to be the
last ever disc format they'll probably
try to get more through but they'll
probably try an 8k player for example
but 4k is the limit because obviously
you've got netflix you've got amazon
coming through with 4k streaming
services right they may they vary in
quality but i mean some of the stuff
we've seen for example house of cards in
4k looks really really as a stream yeah
absolutely looks pretty good so it
depends on the the content providers to
get the streaming service correct but
the thing is that the 4k blu-ray will be
basically a reference quality it will
look really really it's always gonna
look at what kind of an edge and you're
fetching a point of diminishing returns
and picture quality of the of the format
the delivery format I thank you so
hooray looks really really good and in
fact you can even ready the blue he
looks better than some for case dreams
but streaming looks really really good
too so you know to get for cable you
know we don't go home and a be anything
let's face it we at home great is great
right and and and usually the part that
breaks down is the display itself or
your calibration or something like that
the actual delivery format look really
good okay and this is all a lot of folks
ask you know how is that ever going to
get across my home broadband they have
new codex that go along with this h.265
vp9 there find a way to give you a
dramatically more a large number of
pixels and more color data in there
which is the bit range and do it with no
not too much more bandwidth as I
understand and that's huge to be able to
pack all that I kind of like the idea of
for example HDR video with 1080p
resolution instead of 4k so all the
sudden you're taking those pixel you
can't even tell the difference with 4k
anyway using that bandwidth not to have
all these pixels you can see let's
actually
move the dynamic range the color and
even you know the frame rate if they
want to they can make a 60 frames other
data lever that's absolutely in general
though the HDR TV you gotta buy 4k right
there's not a lot of 1080p HD are no I'm
just saying for the content itself in
fact there are no 4k TVs that are no a
chair TVs that aren't forecast so it's
it's 24 k anyway so you might be able to
tell the difference you won't see any
sort of screen door the internal
upscaling on 4k TVs is pretty good right
when I buy my better than when I first
got a much much 4k content sir alright
so I saw my existing you know DVD
library or blu-ray library is going to
get pulled up by that 4k okay so this is
all LG and Samsung a lot of big names
but I hear about TCL and high sense and
a few others where are these next
generation upstarts standing as of the
end of issues so they're both those
companies just mention our Chinese guys
they're number one and two hisense
number one TCL number two in in China
and license number three in the world in
terms of TV shipments so these guys are
really big and they really want the US
market so at CES they kind of made a big
push in the US market all them announced
a bunch of different televisions both of
amounts high-end televisions that do all
this stuff that we just talked about the
HDR the quantum dots the curse 30 for
sure absolutely a TCL even supports
Dolby vision which is another HDR a
format that's pretty rarely supported
right now so these guys are really
trying to say hey you know what you
think hisense did they went out and
bought the sharp name so everybody's
heard shorter yeah so shrub doesn't have
a booth anymore I don't if you know what
I noticed yeah as you mentioned uh you
got to find Deedee's are in the back of
a high sense booth you got to make an
appointment or whatever but sharp exists
in the marketplace and hisense bought
them to basically improve their own
image so you end up with having these
Chinese guys that are going to undercut
the lg's in the samsungs of the world
yeah and and be at that vizio price
point and take share away from Vizio
perhaps be in this story before yeah so
they're the new guys in the marketplace
and of course they're coming in at the
expense of visio into a large extent to
the Samsungs are sorry to the Sony's and
the panasonics which are you definitely
you know fading popularity Sony's is
actually doing a pretty good job of
maintaining the high-end they have some
pretty good high end TVs but they're not
doing anything to sell in that mid range
you know kind of the sweet spot of the
market and TCL seems to have gone almost
wall-to-wall with roku integration going
forward
yeah the roku TV is my favorite smart TV
functionality is Roku built in TCL sells
a lot of them and they built a Roku 4k
TV this year which is really interesting
so you can get all those 4k apps and
streaming apps for okay netflix 4k
amazon built right into the roku TV
interface which is again the best my
favorite so I get a TCL 4k with roku and
HDR not this year but what maybe yeah
yeah I want to see all these guys just
just stop built baking their own you
know smart TV and put them row cooling
it roku yeah i'm i'm out we're gonna
hook i Roku up to it anyway if the
donors we've been saying there's at
least three that i can recall words like
guys roku still the benchmark yeah for
width of content yeah and they held off
chromecast like we just amazing Ryan
didn't kill their market you know I mean
growth is still number one Apple still
number four of the big four right i mean
still kind of a niche player with Apple
TV yes and then amazon and chromecast in
the middle there somewhere yeah yeah all
right this is uh this a great you take
this show and you know how to go buy
your next TV including waiting a while
right for things to settle out shimon HD
or HD are the prices and technologies
get a little better executed and come
down thank you guys really appreciate it
