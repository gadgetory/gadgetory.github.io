price and what's the best music
streaming service Spotify or Apple music
well hey everyone I'm Jeff Bakalar
welcome to nope sorry the debate show
where I argue over three rounds of dead
serious topics of the day
joining me Scott Steiner man what any
given moment is wearing fourteen wrist
watches only two today but I'm ready to
take you on which is one more than
anyone needs
we got three rounds of debate topics for
you today
Scott and I will each get one to five
points depending on how well we make our
case assigning those points is senior
editor Bridget Carey in studio to our
right hi Bridget hi Jeff
always happy to give you judgment that
happens off show as well all right we
flip the coin backstage to see who will
make their case first Scott won it
Bridget introduce the first topic please
alright gentlemen your first topic is
about streaming video games over the
internet this is not a new concept
there's been criticism of it because of
latency issues and Sony's PlayStation
now just recently started letting folks
download games instead of stream for a
better experience but this week we have
a new twist
Ubisoft and Google have teamed up so you
can stream Assassin's Creed Odyssey
inside of a Chrome browser question is
this a big deal 90 seconds go look I did
streaming video games years ago on live
and sure there's Playstation now this is
a project Google is looking at the
project of where this thing can go with
streaming and I'm not gonna stream games
all the time but streaming is an
interesting idea as we start looking at
VR other technologies and you know I'm
laughing because I think sure not
everybody has the greatest internet
connections but in the future if we do
get 5g we get other tech maybe there are
ways that you could do stuff you didn't
expect via streaming and that's what
gaming is all about the interactivity of
it I think if you are putting stock in
the future of home internet speeds
I don't think 5g is something to really
rely on to have this kind of low latency
stuff none of these streaming services
have worked in a way that is long
lasting look at online jet look at
PlayStation now they
walked it back and now they let people
download the games instead of streaming
them online it just doesn't work it
we're not there yet it's okay to admit
that internet kind of sucks in this
country if you're comparing it to the
rest of the world we're just not there
yet
I think a lot of people are in places
where they don't have high-speed
Internet and those people are screwed so
I think from like looking at it where if
is it practical not really is it a cool
idea sure but we're just not ready for
it okay what say you I say come on of
course we're not ready for but that's
why we're exploring it that's why it's a
project the whole idea here is that
they're beginning to look at this it's a
free experiment free you could sign up
and you just are playing it like a play
sounds great for free if you get into
project stream oh I didn't realize was
free and then on a free note alright I
have five points to dish out between the
two of you then I have to give a little
bit more to Scott for his positivity on
the future of technology and trying new
things the future sucks nothing works
why are you so positive about that it's
a Behrman three points just got two
points to Jeff although Jeff solid
arguments because yeah internet
connection isn't great for everyone but
that doesn't mean you can't try give it
a try all right fair enough three two -
we're on to the next round Bridget what
is the next topic topic - keeps us in
the video game universe Nintendo has
finally launched its online service
which lets players play with others
online and you're gonna access to older
NES games and more it's just $20 a year
question is it worth it 90 seconds on
the clock
yeah all right I'm starting with this
one no it's not worth it it's 20 bucks a
year and it's still not worth it that's
like I don't know 14 cents a day it's
not worth it if you look at like what
the specs of this service are it's
ridiculous they took away free online
gaming it was free before this and then
they were like no no took it snatched it
you want to play splatoon let's say
you're an eight-year-old kid and you're
like aw spittoon on what do you chew on
lines been so great one day you fire up
your switch and Nintendo's like giving
you their fingers like sorry kid
pay us 20 dollars a year get your
parents credit card because this used to
be free and now it's not welcome to the
future little kid and also the NES stuff
is ridiculous
yeah go ahead take it away yeah may I
say something I'm gonna say this look of
course there's not a lot of futures on
it but that online stuff at the
beginning they said from the beginning
that that was a trial service before the
online so maybe it let people down but
eventually they were planning on
charging don't make it so that and wait
and right now for this first year
compared to $50 I'm not justifying the
idea of paying for online but everybody
else does it and they're throwing in the
NES classic games which are there
between dollars for one year for $20 my
question is after this year like what
else will they add to the equation SNES
games other things sure if that's just
the only thing you got sure but I don't
mind it as $20 a legacy thing where
splatoon two and a couple games were
free over the phone app but whatever you
know Nicholas I'm gonna give them one
year trying it which is great but this
is stupid bridge number 20 what do you
think all right guys looking at your
arguments I mean Scott everyone else
does it was one of your arguments a
little weak there I was and and how many
more things are we gonna pay for it
Geoff tugging on the heartstrings with
the children kick very kids matter yeah
carry on I'm gonna have to give four
points to Jeff on this one one point to
Scott sorry
you have two children yeah well yeah
next round the final round score is six
to four I think Jeff's in the lead
oh wait I'm Jeff round three let's go
all right final round guys we are
pitting the top two music streaming
services against each other which is the
best around Spotify or Apple music 90
seconds on the clock please
go okay well let me just say I've
subscribed to both I think I'm still
paying for both and so that's stupid but
sure Spotify I'm not gonna argue is what
everybody is using I'll explain why I've
been using Apple music and it should be
pretty obvious because they use a lot of
Apple devices they test
and I got into this thing right glommed
my itunes library into the catalog so it
is dreams I did that a long time ago so
now because it plays on Apple watch and
that's the sort of system they've got
you in so between that and the ability
of stream music which is now spidered
itself into that collection there I go
because it's the only way it can access
it
Spotify doesn't stream as smoothly
although they are making strides with
that okay let me just summarize a
Scott's argument for you Bridgette his
argument is I screwed up and now I have
to use Apple music that's its argument
here's the deal Spotify is just on a
different level music discovery is
amazing
the only thing Spotify maybe doesn't do
well is like friends sort of list
sharing him and whatnot but it is the
most it is the lightest service it's
very easy to use it'll run on anything
you have all this sort of customization
and for me I mention it at the top the
most important thing about Spotify is
music discovery I have genuinely
discovered bands that I never would have
heard of if it wasn't for this so kudos
to their algorithm or whatever it is and
you know you gotta be happy with with
the fact that like people push out their
services there there's no exclusivity
with Spotify for the most part where
Apple music tried to pull that crap a
couple years ago I mean come on it's all
in what Spotify alright from someone who
uses neither service oh I feel like am I
really fair judge here wait what are you
use extreme it on Pandora okay and I
don't like paying for things sure so
Jeff you did have the stronger argument
about music discovery although I've
learned a little something from Scott -
although gonna have to go with Jeff on
this one three points Jeff two points
Scott for trying to make Apple music
into a good argument it's a little tough
though it's a valiant effort
alright nine to six that makes me the
winner I'm sorry Scott Stein but what
did I win whoa that came in hot it's a
limited edition earthworm jim steel
lunch box it's okay I didn't want that
it's not a big deal well maybe you could
shorten it to your children who you
apparently dislike a great deal oh ouch
wait okay actually my kids would have
liked that don't watch that
well maybe you think about them ever
and then Bridget Carey thank you so very
much for being here and judging the
first episode of nope sorry you're
welcome
yeah thanks a lot Bridget all right
that's gonna do it for us thank you so
much to Scot Stein if you want your
