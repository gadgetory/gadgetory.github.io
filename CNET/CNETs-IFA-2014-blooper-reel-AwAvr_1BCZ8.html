it's not the only kind of wearable in
town see it's a tin shop maybe if I'd
just keep talking loudly I'm Andrew
Foyle cnet and this is thus mony mony
smote thus mony mony smart using selfie
mode to adjust my hair mark how's that

much is it 200 29 years this one as the
are in the name suggests is rounded it's
got an aluminium wait note stop it

designed for business types but that
doesn't stop us being very interested in
what it has to offer what am i doing
sorry just lost the faith don't matter i
resign fuck designed for business types
and unveil an unlit sorry and unveiled
its when something is unleashed and
unveiled its waterproof as well samsung
says it wouldn't recommend holding it
under water but it should be fine for
things like rain did that sound

attractive phone though particularly for
an entry-level device and I'm quite keen

if you could have the recipe while
you're cooking in the screen keeping
your hands-free for doing important
things like what am I talking about

water put their waterproof so you can
pump you're banging chips so I lost it
and cast your eyes over the Asus Zenbook

waterproof so you can pump you're
banging juice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
