a look at the brand new dell inspiron 23
dell says this is the thinnest 23 inch
all-in-one ever it certainly is very
thin partially that's because a lot of
the ports and connections are here in
this big heavy weighted base there's
also a pretty hefty arm right here and
that arm actually lets you adjust the
screen of reasonable amount and go down
like this and up like this but more
importantly turn the entire thing flat
so you have almost right call a tabletop
PC although it's kind of lifted up from
whatever a desk you have it on why would
you want to do this you know board games
are kind of fun this way or missing
around on a map I've certainly had a lot
of fun with some of the other tabletop
pcs that we tried so you may not usually
like this all the time but it's it's
cool to have that option it's especially
frustrating when some on one's been down
almost that far but don't give you that
full flat plane like that more
importantly this new own one from Dell
has Intel's latest Haswell processors
that's the fourth generation Core AI
series and you can even get optional
discrete graphics like we have in our
test unit right here there and E
graphics are kind of middle-of-the-road
but you can still do some basic gaming
with them which I definitely appreciate
the screen is a full 1920 by 1080 screen
that's important even on a 23 inch
monitor like this and the Inspiron 23 it
starts at 999 we've got a couple
upgrades including a better processor
and that discrete graphics card that
brings you up to thirteen ninety-nine
for this particular model you know for
about that price and a little bit more
you can move into some fancier brands
than Inspiron Dells XPS 27 actually
starts at I think $15.99 and with that
you get a super high res screen but if
you build one of those out the way you'd
really want it would be a lot more
expensive I'm Dan Ackerman and that is
the Dell Inspiron 23</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
