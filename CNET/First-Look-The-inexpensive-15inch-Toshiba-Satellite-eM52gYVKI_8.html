a look at the toshiba satellite c 6 v 5
a laptop that asks a very important
question just how little can you get
away with spending on a midsize laptop
well if you asked her if she but the
answer is $399 that's usually what this
guy costs we've actually looked at
versions of this C 6 v 5 before the 2012
version pretty much the same except in
the kind of year or so since we've
looked at this last we've seen a lot of
low-cost laptops especially the lower in
ultra books that have really brought a
lot of sort of design and materials and
construction savvy in so you almost
expect something a little bit better
that makes kind of the plastic body and
the flexi sides seem even a little bit
cheaper but then again you are spending
$400 on this now of course there are a
couple of other corners to be cut the
most important one of which is this is a
laptop with an Intel Celeron processor
that's right Intel still makes Celeron
processors and these still make Adams
also so you're not gonna get a core i3
or i-5 or anything like that in this
particular laptop you've got this older
Celeron processor which is really
frankly kind of hard to recommend for
anybody except if you only have $399
then you need a 15-inch laptop in that
case you know it'll go online it'll surf
the web it'll do email will do all the
things a little bit slower than maybe
you're used to but it does pass the bare
minimum level of functionality that you
would expect from a laptop you are gonna
miss out on a few things there's no
Bluetooth there's no wireless display
there's actually not even an HDMI port
which seems like a pretty big omission
in any laptop you know in this day but
if you can get along without that and
you really need the bigger screen then
you could take a look at this guy
instead of something like let's say an
11 inch ultra portable laptop with an
AMD processor those are usually around
the same price and the smaller size and
the extra portability makes them feel a
little bit more appropriate considering
the performance and the size so one
thing this guy does have going for it
it's actually a pretty decent battery
life a little bit over 4 hours it's not
extraordinary but for a $400 laptop but
that 15 inches that's actually pretty
good
