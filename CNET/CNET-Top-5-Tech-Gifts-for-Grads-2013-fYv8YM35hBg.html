of hope and the time to really cash in
on your parents before they realize what
a total disappointment you'll be and for
parents you're probably shopping for a
graduation present right now and the
question you should really be asking
yourself is what can i buy them that
they won't immediately pawn on eBay I'm
Donald Bell and this top 5 i'm counting
down the best tech gifts for grads
starting off at number 5 the JBL charge
bluetooth speaker this thing just came
out a few weeks ago and it jumped right
on to our list of the top five bluetooth
speakers $150 gets you some big sound in
a compact package 12 hours of
rechargeable battery life and a USB port
on the side for keeping your phone
charged comes in a bunch of different
colors which means you'll probably pick
the one that your kids hate of course a
Bluetooth speaker isn't going to do them
much good if they're still getting by
with a crappy phone so coming in at
number four is the HTC One this is one
of the most stylish android phones you
can buy and it is crammed full of some
serious tech quad core processor 1080p
screen android 4.2 and some killer
camera features especially if your grad
is setting off on a job hunt you can't
send them out there with that old iphone
with the cracked screen give them a
fresh start but if you really want to
set them up proper get a new car a
number three pick on this list and see
2013 subaru XV crosstrek your kids
driving an old beater it's just a matter
of time before they going to ask you for
a reliable set of wheels and that's just
what this is you can drive off the lot
for 22 grand it's a safe car especially
if you get them that safety cone orange
color this one came in but when it comes
to bang for your buck nothing is going
to make them happier than a new TV
number two on this list is the visio III
20 iao say 32 inch led-lcd TV that is a
crazy good value at three hundred
dollars it's also a smart TV so you get
direct links into netflix you to hulu
amazon even Skype excellent picture
quality for the price if my 20s are any
indication this is probably going to be
the TV they own for the next 10 years
finally for the number one tech gift for
grads I'm saying
laptop our editors pick here is the
lenovo ideapad y500 whether your kid is
graduating from high school or college
chances are their current laptop is
around four years old and after that
last term paper they probably never want
to see it again this one from the Lenovo
is powerful enough to do anything you
want whether it's games or video editing
or patting your resume it will keep them
going for at least another four years so
there you have it five great pics for
any young graduate or even the old ones
for more suggestions check out our
complete list over on cnet com I'm
