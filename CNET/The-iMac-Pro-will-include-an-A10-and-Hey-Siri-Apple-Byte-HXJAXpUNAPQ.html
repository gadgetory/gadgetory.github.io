welcome to the Apple buy for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
did you really think we were gonna leave
you hanging without an episode because
of Thanksgiving it's a short week but
come on let's get to it
all right Time magazine named the iPhone
10 one of their best 25 inventions of
2017 and yeah I know some of you are
like really time now let's just not make
this a two-hour debate about if it
really is or not but let's say Apple
okay you put a lot of pieces together
even though an OLED screen and face
recognition and a buggy iOS have been
done before but Apple is doing it
differently wait I know it had to be
because of an emojis I knew it
now some of the other top 25 inventions
what about the esight three glasses that
help give sight to the blind or the
adaptable airless tires from Michelin
even the amber mug that heats your
coffee just right like I'm on board with
those then time narrowed it down to
their top 10 gadgets for 2017 and at
number one drum roll please the Nintendo
switch and at number two the iPhone 10
and let's give some love to number three
the Microsoft Surface laptop if we go
down to number nine guess what
the Apple watch series three with LTE
and really that's a product I'm now 100%
behind if you're someone who works out
or has an active lifestyle they finally
made an Apple watch with watch OS 4
worth getting for me after all these
years now we posted a standalone
reaction to the home pod delay to early
2018 you can look for it if you haven't
seen it already but one product that is
still expected to make its December 2017
time frame Apple's iMac pro tell me you
didn't forget about this powerhouse that
is really not your mother's iMac now you
can always count on developers to dig
deep into the code before we see
anything for ourselves and Steven
trounce myth Jonathan Levin and Gil herm
Rambo uncovered a lot before the iPhone
10 release they've done the same for the
iMac pro now get this the new iMac Pro
will reportedly include an a-10
processor with 512 Meg's of RAM that
will run its own variant of iOS called a
bridge OS full functionality of the a10
chip isn't known yet but Gil herm Rambo
posted confirmation that it will have
support for hey Siri functionality and
it could possibly work even with the
iMac Pro turned off now the iMac Pro
looks amazing it still doesn't have an
official release date but it also has an
amazing price starting at four thousand
nine hundred and ninety nine dollars
like I said not to Mama's iMac alright
more iPhone future stories even if
plenty of you people are still waiting
to get their iPhone 10 according to Fast
Company Apple is leaning heavily towards
choosing Intel's 5g modems for future
iPhones and are already working with
intel on the upcoming tech discussions
with Qualcomm are described as limited
but they have superior modem performance
that's been tested now Apple and
Qualcomm they're in an ugly
back-and-forth legal battle right now so
it's not like they're just gonna kiss
and make up anytime soon
the report says Qualcomm 5g modems offer
more specialized features for carriers
but many of those features won't be
adopted by the carriers and they believe
Intel's Hardware will be enough for
future devices and also check this out a
digit time supports as Apple is working
toward mass production of thinner and
brighter micro LED displays to be used
in future Apple products and you know
what they should be they have all the
benefits that OLED displays do over LCD
but can be even thinner brighter and
more energy efficient than oh let's now
the top candidate to get these screens
first wouldn't most likely be a future
Apple watch an apple also recently
opened up their visitor center for the
first time to public on its new Apple
Campus dubbed Apple Park so if you're in
town go check it out but we'll be
working to get out there on our own and
in the Apple executive whoops of the
week CEO Tim Cook tweeted out a
congratulatory message to Australia for
passing its same-sex marriage vote
the only problem Cook tweeted out an
emoji of the New Zealand flag instead of
the Australian flag come on Tim that's a
bad apple now he replaced it shortly
after everyone called him out and Tim
it's so obvious come on everyone knows
that the Australian flag features the
large Commonwealth star because the star
is a symbol of Australia and the New
Zealand flag has just four or five
pointed stars in red with a white
outline while Australia has four seven
pointed stars and one five-point star
duh and I know this because I just use
this amazing tool on the internet called
ooh
all right that's gonna do it for this
week's show to everyone celebrating
Thanksgiving to enjoy the time with your
loved ones and people that matter you
can also afford your amazing stuffing or
like cranberry sauce recipes I love that
send them to me by email the Apple bite
at cnet.com or two in Bryant tongue
thanks much for watching we'll catch
y'all next time for another bite of the
Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
