your phone to multiple speakers
throughout the house there's a new
product that lets you do just that it's
called rocky and each one of these
devices is forty nine dollars and you'll
need one for each speaker you want to
stream to but what's great is that you
can use speakers you already own here's
how to get started first plug in a rocky
device to each speaker and what's great
about Rocky is that you can get these
colorful covers to either match your
speaker or help distinguish one rocky
from another in this case I got green
pink and orange lots of fun colors in my
collection okay so you just plug in a
rocky through a line in port then turn
it on using its little power button here
and once it's on you'll see the LED
light here and you should hear a voice
command telling you it's ready to be set
up I've successfully started hotspot
mode there you go now you know you're
ready to set up everything else in the
app but first I have two more speakers I
need a set up I've successfully started
hotspot mode I've successfully started
hotspot mode great all of my Rockies are
in hotspot mode which means I can move
on and finish the setup in the app
basically how rocky works is instead of
using bluetooth it sets up its own
private Wi-Fi network that's how you're
able to control multiple speakers
through one phone there you go I have
three Rockies and I'll just set up each
one one by one
I know that it's talking about this
rocky because the LED here is red so
i'll set my color that's my green rocky
pick a name green now i'll just select
my Wi-Fi network I've successfully
started hotspot mode all right my first
rocky is set up now I'll set up to other
speakers I've successfully connected to
your Wi-Fi router cool my Rocky is set
up now I'll do the next one all of my
Rockies are set up and I know they're
ready to go because when I tap the green
bar at the top of the app I can see
every single one of them now before I
start streaming music to them I'm going
to go set them up in each room
so all of my Rockies are set up
throughout the house and now I can
stream music to that one thing to know
is that right now Rockie only supports
music you have stored locally on your
device but more streaming apps like
Spotify and Pandora are coming really
soon for now I've got a little Aloha
screwdriver here so first thing I want
to do is tap the green bar choose my
rocky I've got my green rocky right in
front of me hit play and I should hear
it streaming for that device
nice now I can do the same thing for the
other speakers tap the top bar choose my
speaker pick a song and it'll scream to
that speaker too
now anytime I want to pause play or
choose a different song for any rocky
I'll just head to the top I'll choose
pink one in the kitchen and then from
the left menu here I could just choose
another song or just pause it all
together Rocky is great because it's
really the first of its kind and the
only device right now that lets you
stream music from your phone to multiple
wireless speakers but we should see some
competitors come into the mix pretty
soon if you have any questions or tips
of your own hit me up on Twitter and
