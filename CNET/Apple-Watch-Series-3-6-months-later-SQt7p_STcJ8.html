the Apple watch Series three and it's
been about three years since Apple first
launched the Apple watch that's a long
time and it's a long time that I've been
wearing the Apple watch Series three
what does it feel like to wear the watch
is it worth the upgrade and are there
any things I love and things I'm really
annoyed by here's my check-in so things
I love I like what the Apple watch does
with the music and that was a surprise
to me because I'm not really big music
listener on my watch in general but if
you're inside the Apple music ecosystem
and you have music there it syncs now in
a way that automatically does it before
you even decide you want to do it and
the fact that it puts recently listened
to albums and a couple of playlists
automatically on there it's enough music
to keep me going it's like an iPod
however because there's no headphone
jack on this and if you want to take
phone calls and not speak on the
speakerphone you're gonna want to use
Bluetooth headphones or air pods and
luckily this ecosystem works really well
Apple bet that with air pods and Apple
watch and the iPhone that you can use
them all together and they work
seamlessly and they do however you have
to buy them all and that's a lot of
Apple gear between the iPhone and the
air pods and Apple watch if you've got
two of the three then getting the other
you know what you're gonna get a really
good experience I'm gonna take these air
pods out of my ears
now and not wear them for this entire
thing the Apple watch also has pretty
good fitness tracking and pretty good
meaning that for everyday stuff that I
need it does a perfectly fine job keeps
track of my steps gives me a little
nudges in the morning in the evening to
complete my goals and complete those
rings
I like the enhancements to heart rate
tracking I like that it tells me my
average resting heart rate I like that
it tells me my average walking heart
rate even if I'm not tracking an
activity for some reason I like checking
that it makes me feel better about
myself I like how the Apple watch
handles messaging I'm not gonna respond
to messages all the time on this that
would be ridiculous but I like being
able to check quick text messages to
look messages on slack that might pop up
dictation is a bit hit or miss but again
it's the most hooked in way to respond
to messages if I've got a knife
I like paying for things with Apple pay
on the watch why because it's right
there and it's double-click and pretty
convenient it's actually a lot more
convenient than paying for things with
the iPhone 10 where I have to Center my
face and click and do that
hey Siri set a timer for 10 minutes
that's like the thing I do the most I
basically just use this for setting
timers I use it to find my phone
there it is it was in my lab what else
is really good about this it's fast it's
really fast and this is kind of
surprising if you haven't used an Apple
watch in a while you forget that three
years ago the Apple watch was really
slow it took a long time to load apps it
took so long you didn't want to do
certain things now the Apple watch is
generally so quick at loading things
that it feels pretty seamless and that's
nice because it's basically at the point
where I wanted it to be three years ago
when I first reviewed one that looked
pretty similar to this so your the thing
is I'm not so wild about let's start
with cellular a lot of people may love
the cellular function and it works fine
to use it as a phone away from the
iPhone but I'm always carrying my phone
with me and the amount of cost per month
really needs to change it's about ten
dollars it's more than ten dollars a
month when you add in taxes and that
amount to be able to use your cell phone
plan on another device is way too much
for a watch and I'm okay with the Apple
watch general design but it has looked
the same for a while that's skwerkel has
been around for a long time the
rectangular skwerkel I'd like a little
bit of a change I also like some new
watch faces because Apple's watch faces
are very nice but there is no watch face
store
why is there no watch face store it I
want my New York Jets watch face I want
my sonic the hedghog watch face my NFL
stats watch face Pebble had new watch
faces come on and as far as fitness
tracking goes it's not all perfect in
fact there are a lot of things I would
still like to change one of them is the
stand right one of the three rings is
supposed to motivate you to stand more
and I always close the stand ring look
I've almost closed it right now I've
been sitting all day long I don't want
to recharge the SmartWatch every night I
want to be able to wear the Apple watch
all the time
battery life is better now it's about
two full days maybe but to be safe I
charge it every night because I don't
want it to run out and that's annoying
that's really annoying other watches
like fit last longer look at this I have
a faded part of my wrist because I've
worn a watch non-stop since I was about
12 I like wearing a watch all the time
day and night I know that's weird but
that's me let me be me I also want the
Apple watch to be free to be free of the
iPhone to be its own device why can't it
be something like the iPod which you
could use with a Windows computer and
you could set up you still needed iTunes
but the iPod stood on its own the Apple
watch needs an iPhone and that's a lot
of money to put into the Apple ecosystem
again I would like if you will set this
up with anything or even people who
didn't have the fanciest smartphones
that could just use this to track or get
notifications connecting their home just
let it be a standalone but despite my
gripes the Apple watch is still my
favorite SmartWatch right now and that's
because it's largely won the war of
attrition on wearables because a lot of
the competitors are now out of the
landscape and a lot of people are just
not making great smartwatches Apple has
stayed true to the course and improved a
lot of things over time and that's paid
off in making a much more refined
product in the end
it's not everything that I've wanted to
be but it's a lot better comparatively
than other things that are on the market
if you have an iPhone if you have an
iPhone
that's the big if hey thanks a lot for
watching so what do you like about the
Apple watch Series three do you think
it's great do you think it's terrible
is there anything you've dreamed of that
you want to have be different let us
know in the comments and thanks a lot
for watching
