new forms I'm Bridget Carey this is your
scene that update it's another day at
the consumer electronics show in las
vegas and the tech news train keeps on
rolling the convention center show floor
has been swarming with people checking
out the future gadgets of 2016 and one
of the trends were seen is a focus
around health and new ways to track
fitness Fitbit is a popular fitness
tracking brand that showcased a new
watch called the blaze now it still
tracks the same activity but now it has
a color screen you can strap into
different bands and cases to fit your
style it also links to your phone for
some notifications like text messages
and appointment reminders and it
includes some preinstalled workout
coaching programs it comes out in March
for two hundred dollars but while Fitbit
was showing off this new gadget it also
was hit with a class-action lawsuit from
users that claim its heart rate monitors
are inaccurate and that the devices
don't count every beat some claim it
only counts half of your beats per
minute with questions around accuracy
and fitness trackers maybe you don't
want to spend two hundred dollars and so
we're seeing many cheaper options on the
show floor the huawei honor band z1 only
costs eighty dollars it comes out this
month it has a round SmartWatch design
and along with fitness tracking it gives
you some missed message notifications
from your phone it's not really heavy on
apps the width eames go is a seventy
dollar fitness tracker it has an e-tank
screen so it's always on the battery
lasts eight months now it just shows you
your daily fitness progress but when you
click on the screen you also get the
time it could be worn on a band or put
in a clip and you can also take it
swimming there's also some new fashion
designs the misfit Rae does the same
tracking stuff as misfits other models
like the shine but the Ray looks like a
simple jewelry rod that you pop on a
necklace or your wrist and that's neat
if you already wear a normal watch you
don't want to wear to circle watch
things on one wrist it starts at a
hundred dollars and if you rather not
wear anything on your wrist we're seeing
more tech for the Feet Under Armour has
these smart sneakers that do all the
tracking for you during a run and they
look at your stride these costs 150
dollars they come out next
or you can put all the smarts in your
pants with the LUMO run shorts it's a
sensor that tucks into the shorts to
measure not just how fast and far you go
but also how you're moving with analysis
on things like pelvic rotation that's
also a hundred and fifty dollars coming
out in the spring and we're still
running right along covering every
corner of CES 2016 so keep checking in
with us on cnet com / CES coming to you
from the cnet stage at the Las Vegas
