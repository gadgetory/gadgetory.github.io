saying uh it's that guy again it can be
another boring product you are right I
have another purple drive right here but
before I get to it let me tell you one
thing about portable drives they are
delicate maybe to be handled with care
but at the same time they come in a
perfect shape and weight of something
that when you hold your hand it will get
angry you want to slam it on the floor
or at somebody with that in mind this is
the armor a 15 purple drive from silicon
power now this drive right here is very
similar to the rest of purple drives on
the market but come with in a protection
against a draw from up to four feet high
why traveling and guess what four feet
high is where I am right now so are we
go oh there we go I did it and the drive
works fine I will show you about James
doe now the a-15 silica gel chass√©s can
also protect the internal drive from
vibration and dust and that mean is a
great device for those who works in a
rough environment but it's also a great
drive for all of us too because in my
testing it is for now the fastest USB
3.0 drive on the market now it's not
perfect though because it's come with
software and this backup button right
here that do not work as expected but
even without those is still a great
Drive this drive here is buzz power and
it comes included with one USB cable and
that's all you need to use it on the go
and the good news is is quite affordable
to costing just $90 for one terabyte to
find out more you can always read the
full review described as calm in the
meantime
trust me it'd make a great present for
your anguish significant are not for me
though not that I never get mad just
that I'm very good at anger management
and that's because I'm don't know and
this has been the first look at the
armor a 15 portable drive from silicon
power
stop throwing that at me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
