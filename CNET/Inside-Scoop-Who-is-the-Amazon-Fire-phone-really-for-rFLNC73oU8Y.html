Sumi das joining us is senior editor for
cnet Jessica dole court Jessica thanks
for being with us of course you are
holding in your hands the Amazon fire
phone tell us what the standout features
are well they're free really you'll
notice that there are four cameras on
the front or five actually but therefore
around the corners and this helps with a
something we would call 3d effect but
Amazon calls it dynamic perspective okay
and litter to all throughout the
operating system you'll see these extra
rich immersive graphics as it made you
nauseous when you've used it it only
with this auto scrolling when you're a
reading thing like on a web page and
that I would turn off but everything
else is kind of cool it adds an extra
little somethin'-somethin but you can
definitely live without it and and you
can turn it off in the options you can't
turn it off yeah absolutely yeah so
there's some gesture controls that are
part of that as well if you don't want
to swipe to get menus you can flick your
wrist a little bit and then it's all
tied on into it okay that's cool there's
also a firefly and and you trigger that
either by pressing something on the
screen or by pressing and holding this
physical button on the side of the phone
and what this does is it scans the world
around you so much like other Amazon
scanning apps for their smart phones you
can hold up any kind of object or a bar
code and it will read it and find it for
you in the Amazon catalog how convenient
yeah but it goes beyond shopping because
you can also identify music videos
movies got that Shazam element to it it
does and in addition to that there's
some optical character recognition see
if you see a phone number somewhere or
on a business card you can actually
integrate that phone number and an email
address into your phone he's sort of
like copy it to paste it a clipboard
right away or you can actually add it to
your address book so these are things
that already exist in other phones but
it's tied up in one package okay and
then the third thing that they have is
made a and that's basically live video
conferencing help you see their face
they see your screen they can write all
over your screen and kind of step by
step walk you through things it's based
on an android foundation but it's not
the traditional flexible android
experience that you'll expect so that
means you're not going to get things
like Google Play sir
says most notably Google now knowing all
of that who should buy this 5 if you
have you know the Amazon fire TV and the
kindle fire then you might want to get
this phone as well if you don't really
care that much about Android or iOS or
any other sort of OS that's already
well-established one other thing we
should mention is that in terms of
wireless carriers you are limited right
right now this is exclusively sold
through AT&amp;amp;T okay all right well Jessica
thanks for the in-depth preview and
we'll see how consumers react once they
have it in their hands absolutely for
inside scoop I'm soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
