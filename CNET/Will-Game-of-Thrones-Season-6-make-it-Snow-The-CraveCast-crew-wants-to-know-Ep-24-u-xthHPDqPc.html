host eric mack live from cnet's always
busy Taos New Mexico Bureau AKA Westeros
north more on that later joining me
alive in the Cena studios in San
Francisco are Caitlyn Patrick of it but
i will tell me before you had it kalyn's
the track of its there we go Jeff
Sparkman and behind the controls Stephen
Beecham howdy and also skyping in from
Westeros south in Albuquerque it's
Amanda Kooser okay as everyone doing
good excellent and then anyone else can
join in if you're watching on youtube or
on livestream jump in the chat room
there you got you can also tweet at us
at crave and I'm at erics ce mec and
we'll keep an eye on those so for today
it is time to sing songs of ice and fire
because the season 6 premiere of Game of
Thrones on HBO it drops on Sunday yay
Thunder Thunder we're basically talking
about it non-stop all week so we figured
we should probably turn on the cameras
for some of that so we can capture a
little of our state of consciousness um
but so why don't we go ahead and kick it
off with the Iron Throne equivalent of a
pledge of allegiance and let's begin
with the all-important viewing of the
trailer or her dinklage me thick know
what he did okay so which one's the
trailer cuz there was one never there
wasn't one that said trailer one there
was trailer to that I found trailer tues
a little more awesome okay let's see if
i can find that one here duh sorry guys
they're all named funny let's see
trailer 2 fits in like
we listen this is trailer one right and
we remember no I don't think so now past
is already rich this is like the ink is
dry okay here we gonna show this one
that it's trailer number two I thought
he was the man to lead us through the
long night that I was wrong you like
games little man he would spill blood in
this holy place the gods won't mind they
spill more blood than the rest of us
combined
who are you no one a girl's been given a
second chance there will not be a third
so I think about what's taken from me I
know what happened
there's more hiding for this we have to
fight
stand at the head of Army where you
belong
show them Estes Park
we do too I
the wheel boy is between the living and
the dead and make no mistake the dead
are coming
you
magan's do not do well in captivity how
do you know this that's what I do I
drink and I know things new tagline
that's that's like my resume
oh so not coming I don't think I'd seen
that trailer yet that's a good one jinx
so I you know before we jump into this I
should say that if you feel like you
watch that and you actually knew what
was going on the entire time you really
need to go do our quiz we set up a quiz
a creative quiz for Game of Thrones
leading up to the season premiere on
sunday I took it this morning um I only
got four of 15 questions right which is
kind of sad because Jeff who's never
seen an episode of Game of Thrones also
got four out of 15 right Kaitlyn that's
how I right man who's our resident
expert got 16 out of 15 okay we like to
question believe whatever extra credit
can't be my score so yeah well we'll
deal with that later uh so you know what
do you guys think are you are you
excited Kaitlyn what's the scoop are you
looking forward to most um I don't know
I I hadn't actually seen that trailer so
I'm kind of still thinking about it to
be honest I want to know what's gonna
happen to Khaleesi last we saw her she
was dropped on the side of a mountain
yeah and then in the dragon later she
was getting her clothes ripped off
attend probably by another Khal Drogo um
hater yeah I mean she is pretty much got
turned like upside down in the last
episode like I mean the Lannisters are
you know largely out of power we all
know what may or may not have happened
to Jon Snow you know there's you know
tons of unanswered questions uh not to
mention you know we're like Melisandre
the red which stands and there's so much
going on I guess there's always a ton
going on but on the main question of the
offseason I which I guess would be Jon
Snow right i did a post this morning
based on some students at the University
of Munich the technical university of
music Munich they used an algorithm and
they went through all the books I and
also the shows and kind of pulled out
different dad on all the characters and
then
try to calculate who had the most likely
chance of surviving and the most likely
chance of dying the person with the
least likely chance of dying you want to
guess who it is similar to survive not
Peter Dinklage oh no most likely to
survive very close Amanda hmm Melisandre
look like I'm suffice Sansa searcy
seriously likely to survive only so
according to this ad this algorithm
Cersei Lannister only has a three
percent chance of dying now number two
is very interesting number two most
likely to survive Jon Snow eleven
percent chance of dying hmm uh so I mean
mathematically algorithmically I think
things are actually looking up for John
any guesses on who's most most likely to
die this is actually this is actually
kind of easy if you think about it ah
that's a tough one um most likely to die
yeah but not like most likely to die by
george RR martin standards but most
likely to die by the algorithm by the
algorithm and basically what they did is
they assigned like each character like
24 characteristics features and so then
they went back and looked at who has
those features and who died so in other
words if a character has all the
features who's still living of somebody
who care who's already died well then
they're probably pretty likely to die
hopefully that makes sense but that's
kind of how it works so the most likely
to die by that measure is a Tommen
Baratheon the the like current boy king
so yeah yeah it looked like something
bad was happening to him in the trailer
that we just saw so yeah I mean that god
is what guys I've only seen that trailer
once I really want to watch it again it
looked like something bad happen to him
I want to dissect it again and again now
so so yeah I mean there's you know
there's a million different things going
on what do we think about Jon Snow I
mean what do you guys believe any of the
three
that he's not really dead or there's
gonna be resurrected he's like I think
he's like either hey either he's totally
dead and he's gonna be resurrected who's
gonna resurrect or they're gonna steal
the plot line from the book and it's not
actually Jon Snow it's someone who was
John's okay if you read the books I know
I don't think any of you read the books
I did oh ok so when the giant King and
what it was at Mance Rayder and one of
the other guys like switched faces
basically switched bodies yeah naturally
and we were all kind of confused when
mance actually did die because book
readers were like WTF bro we literally
know what happens I think that plot line
where it was like a switcheroo fake-out
could be what happens with Jon Snow I
don't know who he would switch within
the show but I think it's a open
possibility meet I like that but then
again they haven't gone through a lot of
the mysticism in the show so like we
haven't even gotten Lady Stoneheart
right which I'm bummed about so freaking
bummed about um sorry I was distracted
by the adorable super cute by the way um
yeah so a lot of the mysticism in the
show is kind of fallen away so it'll be
interesting to see if you know maybe
they use the switcheroo or maybe we
start finally getting into some of the
mysticism and he does you know get
resurrected yeah the red which she went
back to Castle black after San as's army
was wiped out at UH at Winterfell so I
could see her resurrecting Jon Snow
because she knows that he has Kings
blood and she's gonna want to bring him
back right to use him for her purposes
whatever she's trying to do so I could
see that happening so much Jon Snow is
just such a big character like it's hard
you know when he got killed off everyone
freaked out there like that's the end of
the show yeah totally I don't it and
there's so much you know so many
breadcrumbs about like his lineage in
his origins it doesn't seem like you
make any sense not to come back to that
yeah and he also survived
his girlfriend when she like shot him
with a couple arrows he survived that
too so he's got like seven lives left oh
nothing Johnson so Matt Smith YouTube
chat room says Melisandre will try to
resurrect jon snow but will fail so bran
and Bloodraven will save Jon Snow does
that follow that'd be awesome that's
totally weird I mean at this point we're
reaching the end of the book readers
knowledge right like I don't know a
whole lot more about certain characters
than people who watch all the episodes
of the show I mean there's some like
Aria we still have some we could reach
into and but we are well past Samsa
especially with the changes to her
storyline Jon Snow we're at the exact
same point Denarius we're at the exact
same point so who knows that's a pretty
cool theory though I like it what about
this one the doctor will say if Jon Snow
and Westeros with his TARDIS now which
book is that in I'm really down for that
crossover I would watch that all weekend
so Amanda what's your take oh I think
he's definitely coming back in some form
or another and that's probably what I'm
excited to see how are they gonna handle
that um maybe he'll end up like a white
Walker II sort of guy um we have an
example of a sort of an undead nice guy
in the book which hasn't been played
with too much in the in the TV show I'm
already getting confused I read the
books but things are diverging so much
that it's a little hard for me to keep
track of what I read in the books versus
what I've been seeing on screen so could
he come back as like a Star Wars like
glowing dead guy I mean anything's
possible I just said that to make Jeff
laughs Westeros a hologram we can mash
up altogether you guys know this entire
show is taking place on the holodeck of
the enterprise yeah this is all just
like data's fever dream I would watch
that show too in a heartbeat someone in
the in the chat room and the YouTube
chat room was asking about Hodor didn't
he quit the show to real life right Oh
door what you left the show in real life
Jaime am I wrong you're making
things up no i'm not i thought i read
that i feel like you're making things up
not making anything up please google it
a bit I feel like we're destroying
months and months ago I seem to remember
that that said that they were coming
back Hodor and yeah man and also liked
the photos of a brand like the actor
he's like a totally different person now
I mean from huberty for the win um that
sounded way more awkward and I mean I
meant it I just meant like very cool um
I am really intrigued by brand story
actually I think that it's finally gonna
get median interesting into his training
and his you know past visualizations and
things like that so yeah I'm interested
in his story line this season I just
found a few articles from September 2014
that bran and Hodor won't be coming back
that's for season 5 that's totally okay
okay coming back is because yeah is
because they totally X brands storyline
from that whole season let me basically
put it on pause you know this one that's
what i get for reading twitter headlines
just scrolling by oh so do we have any
predictions ourselves either who will
you know rise to more prominence this
season or who will die anyone want to go
out on a limb I I think I mean I think
we already kind of know and have seen
this happening but Sansa is turning into
one of these strongest characters on the
show he's turning into her mom I mean
that was one of the story does that not
bode well for her I don't know no I'm
just saying she was one of the strongest
characters on the show until until the
red wedding I don't know I think Alan
left a lot to be desired and her
incessant need to control rob was a
large part of her downfall and I'm
really like I said interested in Santa
and really want to see Arya's story line
this season as she
becomes one of the Faceless Men
hopefully I mean some some characters
are clearly ascendant right like aria is
Chloe ascendant I think we're going to
see a resurgence of Theon Greyjoy i hope
the the pairing of Tyrion Lannister and
the queen of dragons is super
interesting um okay who was that girl in
the trailer the new chick who was all
like ha wink wink like I can't really
wink I'm sorry um but you can't wink I
go back to that meter okay she's in the
trailer and she was staring at Boris and
she gave him like a little like haha I
know more than you do kind of like sassy
snarky look and then descended the
stairs does that show virus in um what
marine where Daenerys was also nurse is
gone so who's ruling is it Tyrion is
parties and also can we talk about Jorah
and His grace cool ah yes that's right
wait who no wait who's that Mormont he's
the knight who got the gray there's like
what were they right i fighting my queen
he's got that thing on his growing on
his arm now does he didn't want anyone
today it's the same um is it the same
thing that why am I looking at Jeff yeah
i was reading for you to throw it to me
i was gonna make its a fishery in head
yes okay grayscale okay yeah i don't
know i don't think that's gonna work out
well for him i don't know we'll see and
then isn't there and then at the end of
season 5 there was a scene with them
Cersei talking to like a huge like
masked the man ya like like or clay gain
bowl which would be right the mountain
fighting what's his face and oh my god
I'm too excited I just forgot all their
names but oh my god zombie
mountain is that what it is cuz he has
like yeah he looked in his his face mask
is all gray underneath he's zombie
mountain yeah so member Khyber yeah
Circe's little Lackey was kind of like
working on his body right so it's like
it's like the Westeros Frankenstein Asia
yeah he's totally the Westerosi
Frankenstein so now so now he's created
his monster and it's and he's about he's
vowed in both of silence until he kills
all of Circe's I mean has he really
vowed of silence well if you just have
no vocal cords because technically he's
dead hm he's his old nose and vocal cord
technicality he's a zombie it's the same
reason we haven't heard anything from
the White Walkers so I saw now I'm
starting to remember what I wrote in
like the wrap up from my back in June
which was it yeah if he turns out to be
zombie mountain or even better
Frankenstein mountain then that means no
logos right that means Game of Thrones
has more or less covered like all the
like fantasy and sci-fi tropes you got
like Frankenstein we got zombies you got
you know magic up the wazoo so having on
a space yet area yeah i was gonna spend
about the space one I mean to say they
haven't yet had a vampire unless John
snow comes back and starts drinking
blood then they've covered it all mikroc
boom okay you can't tell me that
Melisandre hasn't drank my blood yeah I
thought your blood drinking going on I
thought I saw blood I pick for a BAM I
just burst awake black demon cloud okay
it's not be easy ain't drinkin blood all
right you know what you're right i
revise my statement John O is in outer
space that's what's going on cuz we need
to go to space nailed it yelled it's
done George are one out so um you know
it just a couple other things if we have
if we have time do you give the link for
the the Emilia Clarke spoon
it's kind of unrelated but it's like
super hilarious oh I do actually I think
we need to play it um there you go
something cute glamour where's my wig
where's my orange mocha frappuccino
where I can where's my accent wait
where's the toilet with toilet oh my god
sure where's the toilet paper um where's
the plunger like don't don't go in there
you know yeah you know
where are my Spanx red where's the
where's the remote like I want to watch
you don't I mean Beverly Hills
housewives um yeah hi Tom where is my
other where is my cleavage well do you
see yeah I mean Justin where are you now
that I need you
I mean is it too much to say that you're
sorry where is my boyfriend where's my
butt plug where's my privacy do you know
what i mean by
dear Kim that's great there you go and
that says it all oh my god was amazing I
didn't watch that yeah so I had I don't
know if we heard from you Amanda any
other you know thoughts predictions on
on where the seasons gonna go yeah well
I think it's probably pretty clear based
on the second trailer that the queen of
dragons will find her Spanx this coming
season she was getting undressed in a
tent mm-hmm she will find them now
they're probably with the Dothraki
somewhere that's my best guess but I'm
really excited about falling re a
storyline of course anything with Tyrion
I don't know there's so many threads
here they're they're worth getting
excited about but picking up with a
brand I think it would be really
interesting so that's been a while since
we've visited with him and I'm really
curious about how they're gonna tie him
back in with everybody else so we'll see
there yeah last we saw him he made it to
the tree right this magical tree or
something yeah yeah I'm interested to
see to who max von sydow is who is who
the one that he's sorry um Jeff who's
max von sydow oh my God he's been in it
there's one you know my favorite role of
his was when he played the evil
brewmaster in strange brew which is an
awesome comedy and nobody else just have
been revoked so it's trying to go for
your local of them movie The Exorcist
you know in the pictures we've seen Star
Wars II oh yeah we're like two seconds
he is the one standing with brand so I
don't know maybe that's what you're
looking for right now Stephen oh come as
i hear you looking around uh but he's
standing in front of brand and brands
looking at him and we see him a bit in
the trailer and i think we even hear his
voice over oh yeah i definitely
recognized his voice yeah was that in
the trailer we just watched today that
we hear his voice or I it might've been
in the first time it was in the first
one that we yeah I heard that in there
so a couple of couple of more
interesting things from the chat room
Ryan Edward says jon snow will be creamy
did fire will save him because he is a
Targaryen from his father's side oh my
god r+ l equals J that's a good theory
there are a ton of these theories on the
internet and I really really like them
that is a good theory here's one okay
Caitlin uh did you catch this games for
days says Jorah touch Daenerys his hand
when he had gray scale does that mean
she will catch it also what about ice
spiders I know that beats what about
what writers I say spider I think I do
recall I spiders okay Joe I don't but
the grayscale one's a really good
question plus I mean so in the books
help me out if you're murmurs Amanda can
you when they get grayscale don't they
usually like chop off their hand or
their finger or whatever they have yeah
I think it's an option to try to keep it
from spreading but hey I mean that's the
best kind of as bad as you can get that
the daughter that survived it was a
highly unusual case I mean usually it's
crazy creatures or start attacking other
people but right they turn into the oh
yeah weird what evers um but I don't
know has it ever been mentioned whether
fire can stop the progression because
there would be an interesting one with
that Targaryen fact hmm I remember that
yeah I don't remember mention of that
but those books are big right and the
player has to such amazing properties in
the books especially like like the last
commenter said maybe it'll resurrect Jon
Snow who I love that idea I really do
yeah there really is a million different
directions to go with it um any final
thoughts on on this season before we
move on is Stannis still alive or is he
dead because you never see him getting
yelled you just see um what's her name I
don't know her name but she banishes
gonna kill him and then she swings and
we don't know if he's dead he's dead you
know for what it's worth the algorithm
says he's very dead okay very good but
is he most sincerely dead I feel like
there was a interview where he and or
Brienne we're like no I eyes he's out
mm-hmm so Game of Thrones youtube
channels when posting all these short
previews of season six and it's kind of
like spoilery I don't know if I want to
show him just want to see anything
because I have one of Sansa cuz the last
we saw she jumped off of jumped off
right yeah the castle right uh but we
also kind of already know she survives
that because then in the trailer we just
saw we saw her like in the snow with her
same coat like do you want to see right
after that battle what happens there's a
video I have I guess you just we gave
the spoiler alert right this is a
spoiler alert if any of you guys on the
life is a lady just log off yeah I feel
like Stephen you're the one that hates
spoilers the most so well I mean game of
thrones spoiled this so they put it on
their YouTube channel so let's see let's
see you hang on a second let me so we
can find it here we go this is right
after the battle
people who find the location for this
need to win an Emmy that's all they shot
that's it so they're just running
through the woods doesn't really tell us
anything yeah that wasn't super spoilery
you're good you want to see Cersei and
Jaime there's another like little
preview of Cersei and Jaime okay that's
why Rose Cersei and Jaime or is there
any other kind do you remember the first
time you saw her body mother well I can
think about when she died was what would
happen to her now every day every night
what does mamala like now she started to
bloat as a skin turn black her lips peel
back from my teeth
you think about locking masella in a
crypt think about her beautiful little
face starting to know don't pretend like
you have humanity now come on you always
did it's just really misplaced right
like she's always had empathy and
feeling it's just that none of it has
been for anyone other than her family
that's true yeah fair enough loyalty
loyalty anyone else noticed the very
prominent song of a bird in that clip
like there's no way that's an accident
right the bird yeah I didn't notice but
that's a good that's a good one
symbolism alright cool well so Game of
Thrones premieres on HBO this sunday at
six o'clock pacific we're going to be
tweeting about it with the hashtag g OT
cnet all weekend all week all our whole
lives is that right we're doing a KO
yeah wait what you doing and this area
is distracted by peter is equally do we
have the audio for that
he's beautiful and so that video goes on
for an hour an hour yeah an hour I mean
it's just really good like background
music for like your party my podcast you
know I think about it yeah you don't
engage so no it's stuck in your head to
the end of time by the way he was
awesome on Saturday Night Live if you
guys haven't seen that episode where he
hosted check it out for like a month ago
it's awesome and just to continue the
oversized roll the george RR martin
place in my life we had you heard me
mention that I'm in Westeros north and
uh Amanda's in Westeros south that would
be because Westeros central of course is
Santa Fe New Mexico Amanda's about an
hour south there I'm an hour north and
Taos and in Santa Fe last month a little
thing open called me I'll wolf and it's
really weird um and the connection to
george RR martin is that he's just been
like pouring tons of money into the
Santa Fe arts community since he got a
lot of it and he reopened an old
independent theater in downtown Santa Fe
that's totally awesome Amanda's gone to
some events there where he's spoken and
you know he'll like introduce films
sometimes or just like do Q&amp;amp;A s at his
theater and then he also bought the
building for this arts collective called
meow wolf and then they have opened
their first permanent installation and
it's really difficult to describe it
there these are photos i took a bit last
weekend and it's called the house of
eternal return and it is basically if
you took a a premise for a sci-fi novel
and then you built the world of that
sci-fi novel in a real space and then
invited people to walk through it it is
it's totally insane I mean you know you
walk in and there's basically you walk
into this house they've constructed
inside this old bowling alley and then
there's a house and then kind of behind
the house is there this weird trippy
kind of alternate universe
like all kinds of different scenes and
rooms and treehouses and stuff you can
walk through and so base and then there
are also videos playing and there's
little audio things you can listen to
and so it's basically a completely
nonlinear story you just kinda have to
walk around and you walk around inside
this world it's part of the story and
you you kind of have to figure it out
I'm am I making any sense Amanda does
that seem right to you yeah I mean it's
like it is a combination of sci-fi sort
of fantasy there's a little bit of a
David Lynch fever dream happening in
there it's it is very hard to describe
there is an entire house when you first
walk into the space there's a lawn an
entire front of a house a port front
porch and you walk and this is on inside
and you and then you walk inside the
house which is inside of an old bowling
alley but it's quite a spectacular very
hands-on experience there's things that
you touch musical instruments made out
of lasers and you play with those
there's an entire arcade inside of there
with a very nice Tales from the Crypt
pinball machine a lot of time on let's
go I mean it's really it's hard to
explain it and you know when you first
walk in you know it's something like 15
bucks to get in and then they say to you
or you can pay two hundred dollars for
the annual pass so I mean like imagine I
know an art gallery so yeah you can have
paid two hundred dollars to come back
and see the same installation over and
over again but then like once I haven't
gone through it and spent three hours in
there like you I mean you really just
begin to scratch the surface of it and
it actually totally makes sense to go
back time and time again I don't know
that this has really gotten on to the
national radar too much yet but it's
going to I've never I've never seen
anything like it um I honestly it's
worth yeah I think it's worth a flight
to Albuquerque to come check it out it's
that unique and that interesting
supposedly supposedly there's a
companion movie that they're working on
I don't know if that's going to be an
indie movie or something bigger budget
probably pretty india i would imagine
but you know you walk into this house
like amanda was saying and it's a full
size house built inside
bowling alley and it's fully furnished
and nothing is there on accident I mean
there are there are a full newspaper
lying on the table it's a fake newspaper
that has all these stories and within
and within the stories in this newspaper
are clues to what is actually going on
in the story behind this world that
you're walking through as you first walk
in there's a mailbox outside if you open
the mailbox you can pull out the mail I
physically pull out old cards and stuff
and there's you know like clues in these
cards there's papers all over the mean
nothing is out of so can you interact
with them like you were saying like you
can open the mailbox can you go up in
the mail can you try and put a game into
that game console that we saw can you
all that stuff or can you just sit and
like hang out and watch the people walk
through what can you interact with and
what can't you know you can you can
interact with pretty much anything that
will respond to you there's actually
photos and they were like if you open up
and again nobody tells you anything when
you go into the covin oak around um and
so like if you go in and you open the
fridge the fridge is actually a secret
door that leads to a a travel facility
to facilitate travel between universes
there's my daughter silly that's my
daughter going through the back of the
refrigerator so she's in the
refrigerator right now uh and then you
like she goes out the other side ya know
that is but good they put out in Flickr
there's like ads and Flickr oh okay it's
like a very the little frigerator
reminds me of what is it the Disney why
am I the names escaping right now uh
describe what you're feeling the girl
meets the things he shrinks Allison one
dollars in Wonderland yeah oh right I
was thinking it reminded me of like it's
like the refrigerator to Narnia or
something mm-hmm that looks like a
hobbit hole yeah there's a lot of game
consoles in here too and videos dad's
flu I'm like oh yeah you were a say
impossible yeah but there's also the
game console itself on the like the
sharpie'd in game console yeah like if
you put one in what would play on I
didn't I never tried the game console
there is a TV on now you have to
go back Eric my I will trust me very
poor with details this is a TV you're
talking about no there's a TV I don't
know if I got a photo because it's a
regular TV just in the house and it's
connected to a VCR and you can operate
it and it'll it'll flip through
different like crazy video clips that
they have here's the game huh and then
this is 0 that no you so no you couldn't
those are the cartridges were not near
that okay but can they be moved invictus
would you still may be oh no it sounds
like a very crazy interactive exhibition
maybe you could yeah I mean I could I
could go on about it forever because
it's just it's it's so fascinating and
yeah the space the gallery is called
meow wolf the building's owned by george
RR martin and house of eternal return in
Santa Fe New Mexico highly recommended
if you haven't heard about it I think
you will soon and then one other project
I wanted to touch on really quick is the
crowd-sourced sci-fi novel which
actually has similar elements to it that
are in the house of eternal return there
we don't have a title for it yet but I
last November during National Novel
Writing Month we asked the world to help
us write a full-length science fiction
novel and you guys did over the course
of a month actually two months we let it
go on a little longer we had hundreds of
people who from around the world went
into this google doc that I set up I had
kind of an outline of a story and I just
asked people to flesh out the story and
actually write some of the chapters that
I already summarized and you know we got
we're about 40,000 words uh it's insane
yeah it's it's it's a hundred and ten
page I guess novella at the moment and
you know since februari I took what I
took what the crowd had created and I
took it offline in February to kind of
start going through it filling in some
of the gaps cleaning it up a little bit
to something that we can actually
publish and so the plan right now is to
publish it on seen it as a series will
probably
probably one run like one chapter a day
for like a month right here on Cena and
right now we're looking for you know
we've got all the words we crowd-sourced
the words and we're printing him up
right now but we we did actually put out
a call last week we'd love to actually
crowdsource some art for this as well
maybe we crowdsource the words so why
not crowdsource some visuals so that
that piece that Steven had up there on
the screen if you if you can find that
piece on cnet just go to cnet or
anywhere or go to google and search for
crowd sci-fi that's kind of a tag line
we've given this CR 0 WD SCIF I crowd
sci-fi is the shorthand for this we're
looking for people who can contribute it
could be illustrations could be artwork
could be an infographic could be a map
or something could be a vine done some
vines that kind of illustrate some of
the scenes I have your vine you want me
to play yeah it's random but yeah you
can get in i'll play name's Matt friend
your dad's you could say I fund his
research you could say that so that is
one of the scenes from the book I didn't
write that scene I don't even know who
wrote that seems good um you know it's
been a really cool experience maybe
there were people involved from Brazil
from India from the UK from the u.s.
obviously and so I'm really excited to
you know let everyone see the the final
product but we'd love to you know
crowdsource the process of printing it
up a little bit so if you go on on cnet
i have posted some excerpts from the
final version to kind of for some
inspiration if you anyone who's
interested in illustrating those scenes
you see like in the italic there those
are actual excerpts from the final
version that were finalizing right now
to give you a little inspiration and
actually the entire rough draft of the
story it's it's still online and you can
still go into it and edit it the entire
project is creative commons which means
you know it's going to live there as
long as Google let me have that doc
so anyone can go in and mess around with
it add to it edit it take it somewhere
else and build off of it you know I
fully encourage that it's been a super
interesting process and really cool to
work with people from around the world
you know what was what was most
interesting working on this is there
were several people who their English
wasn't their first language and they
told me they weren't necessarily
comfortable writing in English but they
wanted to be involved so we had like
people from Brazil and and India who
like they didn't speak English but they
kind of helped organize the story and
organize some of the scenes and we had a
Facebook group when they helped with
brainstorming I know it's truly
incredible the way you know people just
contributed whatever they could because
I know people love the idea of creating
a world in this case creating a whole
multiverse so anyway that's yay humans
yeah humans air change some who aren't
necessarily grats on doing that Eric
that's a huge undertaking it's pretty
incredible what you did awesome it's
thanks I appreciate it and yeah that's
that's why it started November and it's
now April and we still haven't finished
Exodus it's a gigantic wall or the
one-year anniversary yeah exactly and
Kelsey was normally on here on the crave
cast she's been helping me work through
it and and and and shape it so with with
Leslie we're working on that and we'll
have that up next month so look out for
that and send us your art you can you
can actually tweet it at crave a tweet
any questions about contributing art or
anything else at me or at krave and
we'll get get in contact with you and
yeah so that's that and then Caitlin you
had a future you've been working on too
right yeah actually um we I as an i
crafted a whole Marvel Cinematic
Universe and DC extended universe
explainer and so this kind of just goes
through a lot of those differences
similarities and ultimately which one's
better so we talked about how not all
Marvel movies are a part of the MCU
or the Avengers franchise and kind of
what it means for the future of films
and no actually from the gentleman in
the UK okay luke westaway um made that
video I believe and I don't know I just
it's a topic obviously I'm super
interested in and I really enjoy writing
about Marvel and comic book movies and
we also yeah we have this really great
time line here Thanks yeah it's all the
upcoming comic book movies for the next
few years and so you can see all those
yeah it it came out really really well I
think it's a beautiful piece if it's
something you're interested in
definitely check it out it's on the
front page of cnet right now and really
I think you can actually google marvel
vs DC and it'll it'll be on that page
somewhere it's always that's great
that's that's super helpful cuz I mean
that might be the only universe universe
is that I have as hard a time following
as Westeros ever ever expanding it is
and that's part of why it's so
interesting especially with the release
of Batman Superman recently and
everyone's question of wait is this
connected to Minute Man of Steel is a
connected to suicide squad how do those
all fit in together so this is like a
handy little cheat sheet for you I heard
an audible groan from mr. sportman Oh
was that audit that was out loud it was
a
but Batman register back miss ya that's
part of that movie was Wonder Woman yes
you are correct do we have any final
thoughts from Jeff Sparkman that movie
sucked oh is that outlook um now that
was pretty much it yeah okay all right
well I think I think that's about it for
today Amanda anything else you're
working on that we need to mention Oh
actually coming up for a game of Thrones

have a george RR martin specific quiz so

looking pretty regal up there that's
this is what I put up an all day I
should have a lower third time next time
