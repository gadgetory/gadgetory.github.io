all-wheel drive now it's a little bit
longer than the standard XJ which means
that it's a little bit heavier and a
little bit slower and a little bit less
nimble and why would you want to pay
more money for a car that had left
performance let's hop in the back seats
and I'll show you exactly why
now the five inches of additional length
pretty much translates directly into
five more inches of legroom so you've
got a lot of room to kind of spread out
back here particularly this seat right
here the rear passenger side seat which
has a little bit of control over the
front passenger seat if nobody's sitting
there you can actually move it out of
the way and give yourself a little bit
more legroom so you can really stretch
out particularly with the seven thousand
seven hundred and fifty dollar premium
rear seat systems ability to tilt and
recline these rear seats like we're
doing right here you can get real
comfortable back here and if that's not
enough we've got a couple of different
settings for heating and massage on both
of these back buckets now that premium
system is also going to add these two
ten inch screens that you see right here
that are going to give us some sort of
control over infotainment and things
like route previews if we're navigating
we've also got these fold out trays on
the seat backs which are at a perfect
height for a laptop in case you want to
get some work done or maybe play on your
laptop when you're on your way to where
you're going of course the back seats
are the best seats in the house but we
haven't forgot the front seat let's hop
up there now we haven't forgotten about
the driver in the xjl portfolio has a
lot of creature comforts that are going
to make the front seat a very
comfortable place to be as well
including these really nice leather
seats that are going to include heated
and cooled surfaces we've also got an
$800 massage package it's going to add a
little bit of back rub in up here too so
I'm comfortable while I'm driving now in
the desk where we've got a pair of
screens front and center we've got a
digital instrument cluster that it's not
really my favorite digital instrument
cluster I don't really like the fake
chrome on here but design is subjective
and that's just my opinion and down in
the center stack we've got Jaguars
8-inch touchscreen navigation system
which is seeing a lot of upgrades over
the years since the XJ has been
introduced but those are just mostly
styling upgrades the organization is
still a little bit complicated there's
still a lot of buttons on the screen and
in a given time and it still kind of has
this weird gradient look to it
everything just looks a little over
designed now we've seen that the next
generation of the system is coming and
we're really looking forward to that but
as we are right here it's starting to
look a little bit long in the tooth now
what you can get past the organization
design you do have a lot of nice things
such as a full set of digital media sore
is we've got an 825 watt Meridian audio
system here that sounds fantastic and
we've also got navigation with traffic
it's not the most accurate traffic but
it will route around incidence and
that's good now under the hood you'll
find a three liter supercharged v6
engine putting out 340 horsepower and
332
Talon tative torque now that's not an
overwhelming amount of power but it is
definitely an adequate amount of power
in a vehicle like this where speed is
not the thing comfort is now that is
going to be made it with an 8-speed
automatic transmission putting power to
all four wheels in this example and the
shifts you get from that automatic
transmission are very crisp
we've got paddle shifters we've got a
sport mode we've even got a dynamic mode
if you really want to go fast but even
in its most sporty settings it doesn't
really feel like a very responsive car
it's not that it's hesitating it's not
that the gearbox has been giving you the
shifts when you need and that the
steering isn't giving you the inputs
when you want them it's just a lot of
math to move around and there's not much
that you can really do about that so
there's going to be a little bit of lag
thanks physics now from a comfort
standpoint though this car is very well
sorted we're at highway speeds right now
it's a very quiet ride we're just kind
of floating over all of the engines in
the road and whenever we hit a crack in
the asphalt
there's no jarring sort of coming up
through the suspension just a little
subtle thump thump but you won't really
even hear you're in the backseat
enjoying the loud Meridian Audio stereo
system while you get a massage from your
heated reclining seat
now the 2015 Jaguar X Dale starts at
about eighty four thousand seven hundred
bucks but there are some options to
consider for example if you wanted an
any color other than black car whites or
silver it's about fifteen hundred bucks
for this British racing green the xjl is
a good car to drive but it's an even
better car to be driven in particular at
least ninety six thousand six hundred
fifty dollar example with the very
awesome rear seat amenities now if
you're the kind of person who drives
around VIPs or you just want to be the
best uber driver in your area this is
probably the car for you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
