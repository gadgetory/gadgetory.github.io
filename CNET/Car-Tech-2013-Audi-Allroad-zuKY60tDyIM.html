that looked a little bit too much like a
Subaru
now it's an Audi a4 that looks like an
Audi a4 just taller let's drive this
smallest tallest Audi wagon and check
the tech now in all rode is an all road
and not a wagon because it's got some
extra ground clearance and it's got some
stainless steel guards underneath the
thing so when you go driving around the
Grand Tetons and decide I'll leave the
Jeep at home this will come back more or
less in one piece and you can easily
spot an all road a thousand yards away
because it has this kind of JC Whitney
asked body cladding hmm luckily you can
get that painted more on that later now
the first thing that makes me grin when
I get inside an Audi is that I think
it's the most
CNET looking cockpit of a car and it's
direct competitive set
you got this burnished aluminum kind of
low gloss but a very precise looking at
a functional yet comfortable cabin it's
not too Baroque looking at you Mercedes
and it's not too humorless looking at
you BMW right in the middle the main
display is interesting point of
contention on this car it's squarish and
smallish much bigger you'd find in a
Cadillac or a Mopar product much wider
you'd find in a BMW but Audi hangs on in
what is a relatively older interface now
and it still does the job well it's got
some quirks notably the four corners of
the screen map to these four buttons
I've never really gotten used to that
and the knob goes the wrong way you turn
counterclockwise to go down a list that
strikes me as odd maybe not you it's a
connected system that means you can use
Google search to find where you want to
go and you can use Google Earth as your
view instead of these kind of simplistic
3d buildings look at that
here comes 3d satellite imagery and
Beyond Google Earth you can even get
down to a street view level take a
little tour of a neighborhood you have
been to before might decide not to go
there it's powered by a built-in
internet connection in the car that SIM
card right there is just for the car
your phone doesn't need to do anything
to bring in this data I'm showing you
that data connection is free for six
months then it's going to cost you
thirty bucks a month from t-mobile
partnership that Audi has it's not real
cheap is it all the modern media is here
including my not so favorite SD card
slots two of them to add insult to
injury and I'm not crazy about how they
do portables this is ouch this Audi
interface over here in the glove box
that's not convenient
that's Antarctica this of course is a
traditional iPhone connector you iPhone
five folks I've got to put the adapter
on here and not sure how well it works
yet and you can put other pigtails on
here but obviously one at a time what I
would do keep your iPhone in your pocket
buy a cheap little nano on eBay and
leave it plugged in there the key
technology that answers all of that of
course is bluetooth streaming which
you've got on this car
along with Bluetooth hands-free and very
good phone book handling as well the
parking tech on this car consists of
sonar and the rear camera nothing
tremendously sexy about it this
panoramic glass routes a nice touch you
got a big panel over the second row and
of course a big mover over the first
it's a two row car anything to cure the
claustrophobia is good
now all all roads have a 2.0 T outtie
engine and audi lingo the t either means
turbocharger or supercharger depending
how much they want to screw with you on
this one that means turbocharger on
other cars it means supercharger I give
up 2 litre inline-four sitting
longitudinally these cars of course are
all Quattro it'd be kind of a joke if
you had something called the all road
that wasn't always Quattro four-wheel
drive now because we've got a turbo here
it's torque heavy 211 horsepower 258
foot-pounds of torque gets this 3900
pound car to 60 in a respectable six and
a half seconds while delivering 2027 EPA
rated mpg that means an average of 23
according to the government that means
an average of 20 according to me
now this a4 sorry all road doesn't
disappoint in the fact that it has the
Audi trademarks precise smooth light on
its feet and has lots of power at
initial tip in I feel like half the
power in this car is available in the
first 25% of throttle pedal which is the
perception of great power push it
further and it kind of flattens out a
bit you really find flat spots or I do
anyway when you manually shift this
thing by putting the lever over here on
the right put it in drive and it's a
real poke it hits too many top gears
interesting note this car is an 8-speed
automatic Tiptronic it's the only way
you can get it
seventh and eighth are overdrive I don't
think I've seen that before usually just
top gear in so the top two gears are
overwhelmed if you will by the engine's
ratio and when you need to step on it in
Drive it has to climb out of 8th and 7th
to get anywhere so that's something that
I think is best handled by leaving it in
sport mode I don't know how well you can
see back there in the cargo bay but it's
kind of a it kind of comes to a point
it's kind of rounded in the back and
that kills a fair amount of usable cargo
space especially for square or large
objects so think of yourself buying an
all road for the clearance the off-road
ability and for the fact that it's got a
giant truck but is still kind of using
sedan DNA in terms of what it can carry
okay to do an all road CNET style you
got to order it in the prestige trim the
top of the three unfortunately you're
already staring at a forty-nine thousand
dollar car at that point but that does
give you the nav the google connected
services but to continue CNET style
you're going to want to add 32 54 the
driver assistance package that's going
to get you adaptive cruise control
variable ratio smart steering and the
Audi Drive select which lets you choose
different personalities for the car it's
a very good system and for $1,000 more
they will paint all this body cladding
the same color as the car yes please and
at this trim level we're also talking
about including the panoramic roof and
basically every single thing I showed
you except now we've got a
$53,000 for series and that's what I'm
going to go fill out the least paperwork
and not the purchase</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
