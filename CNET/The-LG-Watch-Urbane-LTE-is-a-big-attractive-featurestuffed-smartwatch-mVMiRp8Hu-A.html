Stein in Barcelona and LG has two
different smartwatches I'm wearing one
of them on my wrist this is the LG watch
urbane LTE this is using a completely
new type of software that's not Android
wear this is the LG wearable platform
based on webos and it runs a whole bunch
of features that you can't do a nandroid
where it says built in LTE the first
SmartWatch that is LTE and can make
phone calls and use for push-to-talk
calls it's got GPS it's got 802 11 and
Wi-Fi and it's got NFC for mobile
payments this should be able to
eventually make payments at a variety of
places a 1.3 inch OLED display in a
stainless steel housing that definitely
is in the sporty bulky man's watch
territory with a non-exchangeable
rubberized wristband that's part of the
design but is adjustable there are three
buttons on the side here that take care
of all the navigation plus touching on
the display and there's a built-in
microphone and speaker to place phone
calls or use voice-activated commands if
you hold down one of the bottom buttons
you can actually activate a beacon that
can be used for emergency calls to this
has a variety of apps already on it
golfing cycling hiking it's got a heart
rate monitor like the other LG watches
so you can use it for fitness tracking
and it's ip67 water-resistant for
showering maybe you could swim with it I
probably wouldn't because it's probably
going to be more expensive we don't know
the price yet but it's actually one that
I feel like if you wear this out a lot
of people would just think you're
wearing a fancy watch and that's what
smart watches are aiming for high
fashion may be the best looking ones
that I've seen the LG watch urbane LTE
can connect with your phone or stand on
its own to make phone calls and receive
data the watch urbane LTE also has a
larger battery seven hundred milliamps
to enable it to last several days while
still being able to work in standby and
also be able to make all those phone
calls i'm scott stein and i'm wearing
the LG watch urbane LTE here on my wrist
and I
kind of don't want to take it off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
