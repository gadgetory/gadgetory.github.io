priority is not saving a few bucks on
gas but mercedes-benz knows luxury
buyers like two other companies so here
they are with an s550 hybrid what are
they going after a luxury buyer who
doesn't necessary to save money but
likes the sophisticated smart
positioning of a hybrid as well as the
environmental responsibility that goes
around it it's a progressive educated
crowd what's happening here is a v6
hybrid that they say will deliver the
torque and horsepower of a v8 with the
efficiency of a four we don't have an
epa rating on the MPG yet so we'll leave
that for now some numbers 436 horsepower
479 pound-feet of torque that'll move
this big beast up to 60 in around five
point two seconds that's going to be
scintillating by the way it gets twenty
miles on pure EV range on a charge and
that should be about a two hour chart
it's not a huge battery it doesn't run
very long on electric last little detail
I want to point out to you is something
called a haptic accelerator pedal and I
haven't driven this car I don't know
exactly what it feels like but they
describe it as giving you a little
little kicks little bumps like any other
haptic system for example one that might
tell you with a double tap it's time to
lay off the gas and Coast because the
cars figured out it's a great time to
regen and not burn fuel it might also
tell you with another bump that it's
going from electric to gas or some other
drive modes we haven't seen that before
look at one of these in as soon as we
can and see really what the merging is
of green and ostentatious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
