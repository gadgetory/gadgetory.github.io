Bridget Carey on cnet com and it's time
to get loaded the AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile
merger may have many hurdles to keep it
from succeeding but 18t isn't throwing
in the towel in fact the New York Times
reports ATT has been trying to cut a
deal with the prepaid provider leap
wireless which sells his phones under
the name Cricket Wireless it can sell a
big chunk of t-mobile to leap like
customer accounts and wireless spectrum
making leap wireless the fourth largest
carrier and by strengthening another
competitor it could appease the
Department of Justice to drop its fight
against the acquisition pretty much
every photo in a magazine these days is
retouched or Photoshop but what if there
was a software that could tell you how
much a photo was edited computer science
students at Dartmouth are proposing a
software tool that can measure how much
a model photo has been changed with
photo editing software and it would use
a scale from one to five the goal of the
creator's is to bring more honesty and
transparency to advertising the research
is being published this week and the
National Academy of Sciences journal and
in other innovation news students at the
University of Tokyo can turn an everyday
object into a computer interface using
projectors and human gestures turn a
pizza box into a laptop turn a banana
into a banana phone it's called invoked
computing and it's the concept that
computers should learn our behaviors and
gestures and respond to us but I don't
think anyone will be trading in their
smartphone for a banana phone anytime
soon the groupon stock continues to fall
since them in public earlier this month
at twenty dollars a share there was a
brief price boost but it's now at about
fifteen dollars and overall has dropped
forty-one percent analysts say the
immediate future doesn't look so bright
for Groupon stock when you look at the
current economy and its business model
some small businesses aren't seeing the
benefits of working with Groupon
customers don't always want to come back
after redeeming their discount Facebook
is getting closer to joining Groupon as
a public stock The Wall Street Journal
reports facebook could have an initial
public offering that would value it at a
hundred billion dollars and it could
come between april and june of next year
if
book is valued at a hundred billion that
would trump tech giants like Cisco worth
96 billion or hewlett-packard worth
fifty two billion those are your
headlines for today I'm Bridget Carey
