on their own self-driving electric car
no one knows for sure if we're when
they'll actually bring a car to market
but it's an exciting thought that said
there are some features the Apple
includes in their products that I really
hope don't make it into their car I'm
Donald Bell and here are the top five
Apple car features you don't want
starting off at number five Siri now
don't get me wrong Siri can be useful in
the car
but maybe this says more about me I
can't use Siri for more than 30 seconds
before I start yelling at her now
imagine if Siri with some default
interface for your entire car and tell
your car where to go and you'd have to
hear her thinly-veiled robotic
condescension coming back at you every
time I'm number four a closed ecosystem
Apple is notorious for this if they had
their way this car would be only
compatible with the iPhone and probably
only the latest model of the iPhone
they'll probably be some special tires
that will use that you can only get from
the Apple Store along with your Johnny I
of air freshener coming in at number 3
Apple Maps Navigation if we're talking
about a self-driving car there's no way
that Apple is gonna risk a car crash by
allowing you to use a navigation of
service that it's not accountable for it
makes sense but it also means the Apple
car owners are going to be stuck using
Apple navigation which still leaves some
room for improvement at number two a
field engine Apple is not such a big fan
of allowing users to peek inside their
products their laptops are sealed tight
and repairing an iPhone is about as easy
as DIY dentistry so if you want to take
a peek at your Apple Cars Apple Motor
expect to make an appointment with your
local Apple car genius now before we get
to the number one feature we don't want
in a hypothetical Apple car let's take a
minute to appreciate what is sure to be
Apple cars best feature its resale value
part of the reason that people
confidently pre-order every product that
Apple makes is that it's just understood
that if you don't like it you can turn
around and sell to some other sucker and
get most of your money back or paint a
gold and turn a profit
and now the number one feature we don't
want in an Apple car a proprietary
charging connector this is the company
that gave us the 30-pin iPod connector
the MagSafe laptop charger the
thunderbolt port the lightning cable the
original iPhone headphone jack that
would only work with Apple headphones
Apple may be forced to use the u.s. evie
charging standard but you know they'll
be gritting their teeth the whole time
so there you go five features that I
hope Apple doesn't include on their
rumored Apple car for more videos like
