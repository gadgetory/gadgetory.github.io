your host eric mack and i'm joined by
steven Beecham Kelsey Adams Bonnie
Burton and Jeff Sparkman at the scene at
studio there in San Francisco and also I
believe in Chile Minnesota I'm assuming
Anthony de Monaco Minnesota chili and
once again I'm here alive from Taos New
Mexico in the offices of the taos news
the top weekly newspaper in the United
States six out of the last eight years
that's crazy and a generous local
institution here that's willing to share
its t1 line with us that was like the
best product placement I've heard in a
while the sweetest-smelling paper in
exactly there you go so today we're
gonna be talking about 2014 it's our
year in review was 2014 the year of the
geek was it the geekiest year yet we're
gonna be looking back on some of our
coverage from the past year in terms of
tech / nerd / geek culture and try to
make the case for that if you want to
join in on the discussion and say yes or
no to 2014 year the geek do so I'm
keeping track of the tweetdeck thing
here at crave and also on our YouTube
page you can go to the cnet YouTube page
and we're also on livestream there's
chat rooms there as well so well if you
want to chime in head there so let's
just go ahead and jump right into it you
know first there were a lot of stories
that we covered at Craven 2014 of some
really some examples of really inspiring
uses of technology kind of going
mainstream and one of them you covered
Bonnie Burton ok at the you know the
largest audience in the world that the
world cup tell us about it oh god ok so
that there was going to be someone who
had never walked before using a robotic
exoskeleton to do so and it was a lot of
there's a lot of hype building up to
this because it never been done before
it's going to be done on live TV is
going to be part of the opening
ceremonies for the world cup and all of
us especially those of us who are really
excited about robotics and exoskeleton
technology were watching this and we
couldn't wait we wanted to see how long
this was good
be how big a you know production it was
going to be sadly so I was on a flight I
think to LA when it was happening so I
was just constantly checking the media
and it hardly it got hardly any airtime
because instead I guess most of the
cameramen were fixated on cheerleaders
are no hot ladies in the audience
because this was you know he didn't
really move that much but he did stand
and kick the ball and so that's what you
see right there that's it that's all
that happened was like three seconds you
can you didn't you didn't get you didn't
get to watch him walk out you didn't get
to watch him walk out what she did you
didn't get to watch on the fanfare for
it if you were there at the world cup
itself then you probably got to see it
but unfortunately if you were watching
online or if you were watching via
television none of the cameras were
focused on it except for I think one
camera and luckily that got online
pretty quickly and international press
of course had it first and then slowly
but surely we got it and I was glued to
this because I've been watching all the
videos and reporting about it of you
know just the development and just I
mean this is amazing technology and this
helps people walk again this is
something that deserves its own you know
fanfare not just world cup soccer goes
soccer but you can see in his face in
that moment that one moment that they
did film yes and also you know I know
this is just you know a few seconds the
beginning the world cup but hopefully at
some point well maybe get to see a whole
soccer game played with exoskeletons
like it would be so great if you know we
get to see stuff like this happening
more and more and more so I was super
excited a lot of people in tech or super
excited unfortunately sports journalist
sport and so we didn't get a lot of
video footage but I'm hoping that when
they do it again it'll get a little bit
more kudos but I was super stoked and
I'm sure that guy was oh heck yeah yeah
so yay and actually Michelle star of
crave Australia has covered a lot of
prostheses mind control
paralyzed people doing things oh yeah
where this year just this year alone so
it seems to be a burgeoning field here
yeah if you do a search on cnet for
exoskeleton you'll see most of our
stories are a lot of the stories are
from 2014 and thank you for bringing
that up because yeah Michelle's been
writing a bunch of stories about it too
we're all pretty excited about the
technology and it's exciting to see
where this is going to go not just
robotics and Android technology but a
nut phone I mean actual Android blade
runner style uh it's gonna be
interesting to see where this goes and
it got to the point where there was just
a couple of months ago there was a story
that I saw some more guy who I Siddhant
and he was engaged to his fiancee and he
really wanted to be able to walk down
the aisle huh and so he used a similar
thing to what was at the world cup and I
remember seeing the story and actually
thinking to myself like should should I
cover this because there's a lot of
these stories out there it's like
because it's me it's because it's so
common an almost isn't news anymore why
don't know that everyone feels that yeah
I don't think it's not necessarily
that's not news I think it's awesome
that we're getting more and more stories
like this and I think the same goes I
mean that will used to be with drones
right we'd right get one drone story and
go oh my god we've the future and now
it's like there's mistletoe drones and
tgif you know attacking people so then
we need this stuff to get more common
otherwise it won't get down to actual I
mean to more people what an experimental
person yes we haven't reached like
exoskeleton hipster status oh god no all
right i'm waiting for the all
exoskeleton band or the exoskeleton
coachella tent or something i don't know
but we have been there with drones for
example there was a lost drone like like
a lost pet fun by my park there's a lost
room yeah my god I had a map of the area
it might've been lost in linstead
probably in here definitely in here oh
come on that's a Pixar movie yeah really
I don't drone another technology I feel
like is getting to that point especially
this past year is with 3d printing I
went to a couple of Maker Faires this
year and it's everyone's got like 3d
printed prosthesis and and you know 3d
printed mechanical hands and then
there's some
there are some really novel examples
this year I don't know if any of us
wrote about these but there was an
example of in a surgery there was a five
year old who needed some specific is the
hot was it was it was it a part of the
heart no we've had something okay we've
had more than one story about surgeon
saving babies with 3d printing yeah
that's the one there that i was thinking
of and i forget the part but you
obviously don't print out a brand new
baby I'm okay with it not yet give that
a few more that's okay okay and there
was a really interesting one where a guy
had had had part of his fingertip cut
off this is back from earlier in the
year and he couldn't get in he couldn't
navigate the insurance or couldn't get
the insurance to pay for having his
fingertip replaced and he actually
figured out how to create his own
prosthetic wow that's a fingertip I'm
surprised he didn't make it out of Lego
cuz we've got a lot of Lego stories that
replacing things so just waiting for the
Lego heart little Lego tips leave in
America right yeah that's amazing that's
that's the ultimate use of a 3d printer
other than 3d printing actual companions
which I'm planning on doing uh ya know
it's funny how 3d printers have gotten
into pop culture to you I was just doing
a Portlandia binge watch on netflix of
the most recent i think it was a most
recent season and the mayor of Portland
that's played by Kyle MacLachlan as you
know from Twin Peaks and dune and
whatever and on agents of shield now
he's character tried to three print us
3d print at school and teachers or
something because the funding got cut
and I think people it's actually a good
commentary though comedic that some
people think you can print anything with
a 3d printer and so it's interesting to
note how much you can print but also I
think people might be a little misled
that they can print anything and
everything kind of like when the 3d gun
3d printed gun thing came about I think
that was last year and it made a law and
order episode or something I think
criminal minds had an episode on it and
it's just it got to be this over hype
thing of oh my god now all these kids
are going to make guns and shoot each
other and it's not quite there yet it
explodes in your hand it's like making
grenades out of
Mentos and cola and saying I'm gonna
attack us goal with this you just can't
do that but anyway I mean shouldn't
anyway but I'm just saying with 3d
printing it's it's interesting to see
how far it's come in how commonplace it
is which I don't think we would have
said that last well they were 3 3d
printed something in space just recently
like yes month right yeah first test of
that so I was slippery Apollo mission I
remember in the movie oh right when when
they have some problem with an air
filter oh yeah all these scientists come
in they say they dumped all the stuff on
the table and they're like okay make an
air filter out of this thing yeah but
nothing in just 3d print I know I fight
people on earth you my oh I'm gonna send
you the special it's kind of sad cuz i
feel like if they redid MacGyver now it
would just be the dude with a 3d printer
it wouldn't be like I can get out I
can't get out of this prison so with a
coffee filter and a rubber band it would
be like I'll just 3d print a key yeah
but where is he gonna keep the printer
all the time I'm sure they'll make
pocket printers he'll get one my pens
the 3d pen yeah exactly you're right it
depends on what channel oh right a key
yeah exactly now I I totally agree with
you it's funny that you can you can 3d
print so many things that's kind of
taking away the DIY if you just have the
specs and you're done yeah it's so I can
find that on the Internet let me google
that 3dp yeah yeah just scrolling down
our list here we've got oh yeah 3d
printed car 3d printed force awakens
crossguard lightsaber oh and I hacked
from her own Museum I have a story
that's going up today about the White
House have first time ever 3d printed
ornaments they did a instructables
contest where they asked the public to
basically submit 3d ornament ideas and
five were chosen and they will be i
think in the East Wing of the White
House on the tree but also they will be
kept at the Smithsonian after the
holidays but a few of the ornaments were
like here's a 3d model of the Library of
Congress reading room and then the other
one was like you know actual star that's
supposed to like signify piece and it's
just very interesting and you can if you
want to make them yourselves all of
these specs are on instructables so you
can actually print out if you have a 3d
printer the same exact ornaments that
will be on the tree at the white house
so I thought that was kind of cool so
and that was put on by instructables
White House and Smithsonian so they all
got together for this challenge and it's
pretty dang cool so so some of the folks
in the YouTube chat room are saying that
you know this was a big year for
smartwatches and I'm just curious do any
of us own smart watches and do we
consider that a geeky I have one I have
to actually send it back such a review
unit but it's been sitting in a drawer
for like two weeks I like forget that I
have it uh I nobody has I can't afford
one I'm a writer well yeah actually have
a pebble that I bought movie six to nine
months ago but it's sitting in a drawer
for it's been sitting in a drawer for
the last three months or so I just got
so sick of wearing it but it's why don't
know I think about it why did you throw
man well I don't know I mean there's
just not really I have my phone with me
at all times I don't need my wrist
buzzing in addition to the phone buzzing
on my desk every time someone says
something to me in an email or on
twitter or something I mean I would I
reviewers say is that it's helpful to
have it on your wrist so you don't have
to look in your pocket for your phone
and I thought that was kind of
ridiculous I don't know I always thought
the phone was kind of like a new version
of a pocket watch where you always had
it in your pocket kind of like you know
in old-timey days when you have a fob
right and you'd put it in your pocket
and that's how you would tell time but I
don't know like with smartwatches I'd
always be worried all my personal
information be available for anyone
looking at my wrist and I don't want
them to know how many steps I take
that's why I don't have the bracelet for
Fitbit I have the pager thing that you
put in your pocket because I don't want
people to know how to out of shape I am
I mean they can already tell looking at
me yeah I already know how many steps
I'm not yeah exactly i don't like a
watch to tell me that I don't think it's
gonna be geeky enough until you can do
video conferencing with your friends or
you're walking around going yeah that's
what it's going to be a super
holographic yeah yeah once we get to
that point once we get to help me Obi
one hologram or we get a food replicator
or something on there that I lazer lazer
bond laser yeah a 3d 2d printer to
printer Finch yeah yeah I mean I know
we're being very needy right now as tech
journal as a citizen it is I just I mean
there are certain things that I still
want that we haven't got my god we have
gotten our personal Stargate we haven't
gotten a target you haven't well oh yeah
I see how it is yeah yeah and I mean I
feel like you know travel is still
cumbersome if there's a way that I can
be you know siren else pocked to
different places if you will then you on
must did he did Elon Musk come out with
his tube transport this year was not
sure Eric you nobody came up with the
idea right it released every time you
say tube transport I think of banks
remember when they used to my room oh
yes the Hyperloop um there was a store
that did that yeah everyone you would go
to banks and you would go to the window
maybe they just had this in the Midwest
but they had that tube suction delivery
system they headed oh yeah the movie
Brazil we still have those body yeah if
we could do that with people just stick
me in there and send me to LA that's
what do you I must wants to do what he
wants Oh hurry up you on Joe so one last
you know bit of inspiring texts in the
last year I think this actually tops the
list at least for me personally like the
geekiest most awesome thing that
happened all year and that's the whole
Rosetta thing you know the European
Space Agency landing on the comment i
should say bouncing three times on the
comment and kind of falling into a
crater but it's still there and then you
know rosetta is still circling the comet
for the next year or so and I you know I
just I just continue to marvel at the
geometry that went into actually making
that happen and actually landing on the
thing even if it wasn't a perfect
landing I mean it still happened I mean
what do you guys think that just kind of
takes the cake the long-term planning
for example it's hard to wrap your head
around it actually yeah and you're what
it was is you know it's difficult like
with the moon landing we had everything
was on TV basically right and we can
watch it and this one was kind of little
different but it's just hard to wrap
your head around what what's happening
with that and just like like just how
how detailed everything had to be is
like yeah it bounced a couple times but
like I have trouble navigating through
doors okay Uhler doors represented some
slack most of us are klutzes why not
this I fell down my stairs the other day
yeah I felt upstairs dares
I've done that yeah so here's the
question though geekier moment more
important and more geeky moment a
curiosity landing or Rosetta Oh what do
you think I'm gonna say curiosity just
because my friends at work at JPL and if
I don't matter they'll kill me but I
think it all is pretty geeky minutes
space it's hard not to it's not like
it's a I don't know I to me it's like
all space related things are pretty
awe-inspiring and geeky and it's hard to
like 10 for the other because they need
each other inspiring there's some hope
the thing might wake up again right when
it gets closer yeah can you imagine how
exciting it be to be the people who see
the telemetry starting battle yeah it's
not dead it's a wake yeah sorry just
what I you know I do have a question
though I think we covered this in past
grave cast when we've done stuff about
space do you think that sci-fi and
movies have made us impatient about the
space program and we're just like a
where's our spaceship battles where's
our alien proof of alien life wars are
that's a good question you know what I
mean and I wonder especially with the
next generation and the next generation
after that if when they watch this stuff
if they're as inspired and and struck by
the wonderment of it because we're from
a generation well I'm pretty old but
most of us are from a generation where
this is pretty rad and this is something
that I chesed rad so that should show
you how old I am of space stuff you're
like oh my god I can't believe this is
happening and then you have a generation
that's like a once they're gonna be a
battle there's no Yoda letest Anthony
hmm I know if they're you the youngest
how do you feel about all this well I
mean I yeah it is a really good question
so I've definitely thought on occasion
like why aren't we on Mars yet why
haven't we gotten there so it's not like
those big things like why aren't we you
know why are we on Tatooine having a
space battle or why aren't we you know
why are we doing all those sorts of
crazy things it's like why aren't we
doing some of these more I mean we're
getting towards a point where we're
going to be on Mars eventually but it
gets really you know I've thought on
many occasions like why are we there yet
yeah that's probably been influenced by
you know Star Trek Star Wars and all the
other crap i watch the kid you know the
funny thing to you is I think the reason
that we had such a space race wasn't
because we were trying to get there
we're trying to get there before russia
like we're trying to get
for other planets are no other plans are
other countries Sorry Sorry spoiler
alert there's not a planet no but and we
don't really have another planet yeah we
don't really have that right now I mean
I know North Korea's really trying but
it's not like we have we have
international space station's where
we're all working together I mean
there's even the lonely little iso robot
up there you know talking to lonely
astronaut so I mean we're all working
together it's not like we're trying to
beat one country out of the other to get
tomorrow no we don't do our best work
when we're cooperative I know I feel
like if we were just cold world paranoid
sugar minor alien aggressor I've been
saying we need we need a watchman ending
like nobody's business i still i mean i
know that's a horrible thing to say
right now but honestly i think humanity
would come together if we had an alien
invasion I'm not saying we should I'm
just saying it could happen but it's not
gonna happen anytime soon cuz we came
and get to Mars yet nyan nyan iguana
neon iguana in the YouTube chat room
wants to know where the fifth element
food pills are I think we should be able
to do that well the Star Trek food
replicator I think we've been all
wanting that but once we find out what
the foods made of we don't really want
it my brother's guys swing that we had
generated a sort of perfect vital thing
yeah we have some Soylent yeah did he
was eating wait what were you saying L
see you were actually seeing real stuff
well I read a while back this guy was
saying he had calculated a kind of
generic food thing with all the vitamins
all right it's not it incredibly
dangerous and frankly I'm surprised he
lived well also sounded really gross
yeah I mean he wasn't excited about food
though like we haven't learned either
reminding I'm not a something that looks
like it's like we have not learned
anything from Willy Wonka did we not we
have that gum that tastes like a fight
anyway we digress don't don't want the
squirrels yeah yeah I'd iris yes the
spirit of a bitchin segue yeah there are
certain things that from you know like
back to the future that we do have now
in fact the hoverboard that I think
Steven did you actually get to scratch
statement one here yeah I was on it you
were a trendsetter how know ok so I
wrote the story about Tony Hawk doing it
and this was weird because before Tony
Hawk was on the faked video that was
remember the back to the females right
yeah yeah and he was on it and then he
had to do a separate youtube video going
sorry you guys thought that was real
you're stupid but you're not like he's
trying to be Tony Hawk's a nice guy so
he wasn't like hey you guys are steep I
can't believe you did that and believed
me but this is real so the hendo this is
a real thing and um you have to be on a
metal surface yeah active surface so how
were you able to do these tricks were
you know no actually I was so scared I
was gonna break it or damage X it's like
$10,000 board yeah I was just being
really careful and you know there's no
inertia there's nothing to stop you so
if you just start spinning you're
spinning forever yeah like a you know
like a plan in yeah Tony Tony Hawk was
showing that and to be seasonal he's
like a dreidel yeah but he's off of it
and he then the board goes boom right
there and you know I'm sure all the guys
in there that work on it we're like
tripping out but at the same time
they're like Tony Hawk just oh yeah I
mean Tony Hawk it's like he's allowed to
do I probably got ten thousand dollars
just in case yeah and I'm sure I'm sure
he has his own of this i'm just the
promotion of this with tony hawk on it
so when i wrote this story i definitely
did the video of him on it and you can
see it there but he also was reporting
with one of his journalist friends who
also wrote it i can't remember the knee
it wasn't vice but i think it was it was
like a skylight as a ride ride this tony
hawk's youtube channel yeah yeah and so
but he also wrote for some it wasn't
Thrasher bros like some skateboard maybe
it was Thrasher I don't know it was some
skateboard pro skateboard magazine and
they said it was kind of like writing us
was it a slide board which I've never
been on but it's like notified it's
something where it's yours you don't
have much control over it so it's not
like a skateboard like walking through a
door yeah it's like a skateboard it
becomes part of your body surf board
becomes you know when you're when you're
an ass when you can do that you can
control it but this was like all over
the place like a slip and slide and so
Tony Hawk was even like I don't I don't
know if like he's not gonna be doing any
sports tricks on this anytime soon but
what he did in the video at least you
did pretty good he did pretty well on
the halfpipe I mean I felt like if you
got really aggressive
you could do cool stuff yeah you know I
mean like you have to like he's being
really aggressive right it's hard to do
and he pulled off some yeah cool he was
my back and forth and it was interesting
it's just you can't be on the board for
too long I and apparently at there's
batteries battery issues it's not solar
powered yet it's not powered through
your awesomeness to ride um but
hopefully you know they'll work out the
kinks and it'll be available to public
but it's not available to public right
now did you see it was a kid well the
DIY do you feel that manda Amanda wrote
about that Amanda Kooser wrote about it
I think he's probably got the story
there Steven there's a DIY one that's
made basically from I think three or
four air blowers that's basically like a
yeah yeah he used for air blowers and
he'd used like a waterskiing he found
like a water-ski on the side of the road
got that kid he's like totally in shock
i love it and he rigged it up with these
for uh you know these four leaf blowers
basically how loud yeah i just think so
loud like every mom who sees us videos
just like I hope my teenage son doesn't
do this I hope my teenage son does it
you actually see leaves blowing in the
back yeah but this one's cool cuz you
can go on any flat surface yeah I mean
and and he's gonna perfect it I mean
this is like a prototype he's not
wearing any protective gear yeah he's
not wearing a helmet but he's working on
making it more the airflow more you know
powerful and he's working on making it
quieter too yeah I hope so I mean look
how DIY that thing yeah you know I can
do on water though if you do a search
might be able to last but you don't have
power yes and if you do is look at those
kids gone all right if you do a search
for DIY hoverboard there's a lot of
people in the community that try to make
things like this and on YouTube there's
plenty of do's and don'ts uh I recommend
you don't put some stranger's kid on one
right away like I like this kid he just
kind of stands on it then he's like okay
I'm gonna jump on he's a future Marvel
hero it falls off that's a mother dude
like just like an origin story waiting
to happen so I think this means does
this mean Robert Zemeckis is like the
new Nostradamus because I mean in Back
to the Future to that was set in 2015
and sterile
off by like six months yeah he's not
usually Scott though cuz I've been
waiting for that blade runner LA to
happen soon that's not yeah aside from
the food carts and then does did oh yeah
I think you're gonna say the same thing
Kelsey this is not the only back to the
future to technology that became real
this year there was also the auto
leasing shoes from that movie are also
now a thing Amanda wrote about that as
well and then she actually did she have
the other shoes the light-up shoes yeah
the later ones yeah these are the
lace-up shoes I watched this video
there's not really anywhere where they
demonstrate how they lace of course not
but there's a lot of people doing
backflips in the shoes which is yeah
well that's what you do when you have
Auto lacing shoes that are available to
all of a sudden parkour and I dance I
gotta get me some of those yeah did you
look cool they do yeah I have auto
leasing shoes are called bands uh yeah
I'm wearing some right now yeah they're
called we gave up someone in the chat
room wants more active hypercolor
t-shirts I i still have junior high
nightmares from when I had a hyper color
color shirt and someone kept patting me
on the button so it looks like I was
being molested by a ghost it was not
good and also if you're a naturally
sweaty person like a giant we're just
hot yeah yeah those areas just never
yeah you're back to their know you're
like a predators dream come true see
what's your they make the panels just
like that in the front yeah instead of
the whole shirt right ya know that has
proper you yeah it's your dad another
another futuristic technology that we
report on this year Anthony you wrote
about there are two jet packs and I
wrote about one it was demoed at the
Smithsonian and that like actually is a
vertical you know flying jet pack but
they and it does it's been around for a
few years actually but yeah it was
demoed at the Smithsonian this year I
want one of these yeah it's pretty
interesting how are the FAA rules on
this thing I guess if you're inside the
Smithsonian thank you
I get that plane out of there wow that's
what we all want my god i don't know if
that's the same guy that did it but add
at star wars celebration of three or
four i think it was they had some guy
dressed exactly like Boba Fett doing
that and he came in and it was so loud
it was like super sonic loud and he came
in his Boba Fett with the jetpack and
landed to start the Star Wars convention
and it was like this big deal but
because it was so loud and deafening
people at yeah we're not doing that
again and apparently FAA aren't too keen
on people jetpacking around without a
lot of permits signed and professional
uh you know people doing it not just
some guy DIYing it so well there's a jet
pack for running though to that Anthony
wrote about what was that one all about
yeah some kind of for running so this
was a it's a it's a prototype by an
engineering student at Arizona State and
so instead of a jetpack like you think
of a normal jetpack that shoots you up
in the air and you fly all around this
one shoots kind of concentrated bursts
of air out of the back and propel
someone forward so that they can move
faster and the goal of this project it's
being developed for military uses to
help you know soldiers who are in combat
situations get in and out of someplace
quickly to keep them safe as they're
doing things like rescue operations or
some kind of battlefield deals were they
you know rescue people I don't know if
they're in trouble on the battlefield
they can just bail if the effort that's
really other gather Rocketeer out of
there yeah I have a dumb question about
jet packs go for it um okay maybe
soldiers on the whole 10 be thinner than
I am but I just feel like having
something pointing straight down from my
back it's not gonna run into your but I
know the Cardassian element yeah yes
okay we'll check it out as he's running
it kind of you know it points away from
him a little bit he leans forward a
little scene but what if he forgets to
lean forward yeah he'll remember really
but actually they're pointed straight
back up yeah it's wrong in his feet yeah
I'd probably cook the back of a shoe a
little bit God could you imagine
tripping and the Smithsonian would
yes actually I can no I'm just thinking
of the klutz factor and this you have to
be really coordinated cuz man skinned
knees have just gone up a notch if you
fall in that so or if you keep
propelling yourself forward I mean you
can't get up oh I didn't even think of
that girl oh man I'd bet for a reboot of
Christmas Story jetpack hoverboard
combination you're on decide with how
you can get across the water yeah get on
it has bro I want a pitbull oh look at
that at least he's wearing a helmet no
knee pads oh alright just a few other
things that became brie I was gonna run
down this list real quick this year so
we're looking at in the very near future
QR codes that actually activate
Holograms that's something that was a
release this year so you scan the code
and then you on your futuristic phone
you get a little hologram of whatever
was embedded in the QR code that was
kind of cool like Aaron code cookie Oh
help me I'll be one year the only one
with the cookies you know somebody's
gonna use it to rickroll somebody its
first day to do I look at immediately we
go to pranking as an soon it's something
worse then you figure out how you're
gonna spawn tell you tin tin ders gonna
get a lot more exciting Oh yikes I can
hologram that Star Trek communicators
you can get one for ninety-nine dollars
i think there was a kickstarter and i'm
totally forgetting the name of it but
it's on it's on the link there and it
basically and it works through bluetooth
and you know it's it's kind of a you
create your own little local network and
but it works exactly like the Star Trek
communicators did those are now 99 bucks
a little bigger right it's a little
bigger in dorkier but it looks like
you're wearing a doorbell on your shop
yeah it is a door there's anything wrong
with that I'm just saying cuz us a Star
Trek fans never have a problem with
looking slightly dorky not mean has a
rocket wait a minute what is it what's
going on that video back up a little bit
no they're doing oh they're doing a
little rocket thing sometimes birthday
it's cute I say what military uses does
this have so that's so you can
communicate with people while you're on
your jetpack and hoverboard combo going
across the water that's like walkie
talkies mm-hmm
it needs to be smaller it's too big yeah
somebody actually either i saw a photo
where they put one right next to a
doorbell and it really is like oh that's
brilliant i love it so Star Wars blaster
bolts scientists actually showed us what
those would look like in real life you
know they're there physically you know
I'm not an actual blast and it's a lot
less impressive it turns out don't mean
look cool is that it's low it's cool
they have it slowed down high school
hallway there we yeah there it is good
what did they used to do this I don't
know I didn't write the story
understanding that guy's gonna get shot
the force hologram not not if they're
stormtroopers yeah stormtroopers can't
hit a bard barn or broadside of a wampa
nothing you know it's interesting though
because like I said before how much is
sci-fi ruined real science for us so
when somebody calls something a Star
Wars yada yada we instantly are like
this is nothing like a Star Wars
whatever and it's good it's frustrating
cuz you shouldn't call something a Star
Trek block or Star Wars block or doctor
who block unless it actually really
looks like it I think we're the ones own
your star wars oh no you guys know I see
so with Oscar was not the actual
scientists calling I don't think it's in
the marketing oh I think that's all yeah
wait saved you really don't want to put
it in the marketing because then they
get you know yeah fancy letters well
it's like we learn it's kind of like
during the 80s when we had the Star Wars
wooden Ronald Reagan use Star Wars oh
yeah and that's like that's not Star
Wars but we've got so excited that it
was said by Tom broke on the week on the
nightly yes that we let it slide but
this time I don't know like you have to
be careful like some of the back to the
future stuff yeah it's very much like
sort of kind of back to the future stuff
but when you say Star Wars i don't know
i think it's like a like a double-edged
sword kind of thing because it's like
these movies are inspiring people to try
to make things yeah that are like the
things that they see in that but using
the actual technology we have right it's
never gonna be quite although if you
told me when I was a kid that i'd be
able to you know watch the Super Friends
on a phone that I could hold in my hand
holy cords or anything that's true we
tend to forget them like the mundane
aspect some of this don't don't even
even jets suck dude even Jetsons had a
guy and it said that that came from me
oh um so I tell you what why don't we
just forget the real stuff cuz we're
almost all the time without even touched
we haven't even touched on like a sci-fi
fantasy Marvel geek outs for the year I
mean just some things I had from the
past year I mean I everything is became
Legos this year 50 year anniversary of
Star Trek new Star Wars trailer Doctor
Who I mean it is guardians the galaxies
so much stuff interstellar so much great
stuff this year and really becoming more
mainstream what was the most exciting
you know um fictional stuff for you guys
this year mmm I've got Sun but I don't
want I'm i think captain merica the
winter soldier was a big deal you know
it upended the whole Marvel Cinematic
Universe it showed that we aren't all
just waiting for another Avengers movie
my chakra which dark Thor to dark world
did not hello 2019 but I think for me
that really the probably the biggest
geek movie thing of this year's it's the
last Hobbit movie I mean I know if you
all remember before the lord the rings
movies it used to be that fantasy movies
were guaranteed trash and and Peter
Jackson changed all that you know I'm
sure we all have differences with how he
adapted them but he really brought in a
new era and that era is now done yeah he
single-handedly me dragons sexy just
recasting Cumberbatch way to go I I you
know I honestly I'm a huge Star Wars fan
obviously morning the Star Wars stuff
right now but I was so excited about
guardians the galaxy because i wanted a
smartass crew of heroes and i love
adventures but guardians just really had
so much heart to it and I loved all the
DIY projects that came out of that I
mean I was writing so many great stories
for crave I think I was on I had to be
sanctioned for over greeting it but my
face yeah it was like I had a
Cumberbatch band and then a group band I
don't know if one can merge into the
other but I would appreciate it I did
the Groot swing for superfans build and
I was so excited
that new web series that started and
someone built a giant Groot swing for
this little kid and all that I just love
any DIY that comes out of sci-fi and
fantasy and any of those movies so thank
you to james gunn and Nicole Perlman who
helped write it in all the special
effects for guardians of galaxies to
actually inspire us to make our own
Groot toys &amp;amp; Rocket Raccoon Lego and
everything so thank you at mixtapes and
mixes yeah brought back mixtapes yeah
thanks now when I play what mixtapes on
my Walkman on the airplane little kids
won't look at me like I'm a weird freak
from history I feel like Ichabod Crane
every time I use a Walkman on a plane
like kids are just like what's that I'm
doing that and that story not yet Oh
will you have you been watching Sleepy
Hollow I don't watch Oh God what about
you guys yeah so Jeff um Batman in the
YouTube um chatroom wants to know if we
heard about the Aquaman movie isn't it
like your dream come true or am i
imagining things um does it have to be a
good dream frame I thought you an
Aquaman famine yeah oh yeah I was that's
okay I mean Aquaman's cool miss tilly
cool he's not my favorite Aquaman what
do you think Stephen I just thought it
was like a we talked about on an
entourage and now oh right I don't
entourage any voucher and then as the
guy who made 300 and the watchman is
directing it right so Zack Snyder header
Zack Snyder yeah it's actually there's
also producing the new Wonder Woman
movie I had to put that in there because
I've been waiting for a Wonder Woman
movie since I was a little kid and I
love Linda Carter but this better be
good does better be good this better be
good what about you Anthony de monica
what did you geek out on this year yeah
there was I mean there was there was a
lot of good stuff this year so we've
we've obviously got star wars force
awakens we've gotten so many gun
trailers we've got leaks we've gotten a
lot of stuff that's getting us excited
for 2015 there as Kelsey said the The
Hobbit series is coming to an end I
think tomorrow or tonight even opening
is an opening on Friday but opening the
door it opens I can it's 7pm tonight and
our local theater here so I think
officially it opens tomorrow some places
it probably opens tonight I've been
coping by posting a lot of live in Lord
of the Rings stuff this week Anthony the
one you're doing today did you do that
already with the cat box number two in
the the series you mentioned Bonnie the
super uh yeah I'm blanking on the name
of it now well we have so many great
geek cat-like krauss and it's like a
litter box that you a cat can poopin in
middle-earth I love it look at that and
that means comfort oh I want it right me
out I swear to God the first thing I
thought of was you shall not piss it was
really disappointed that they didn't use
for them for like marketing I'm really
in the wrong line it's like one cat box
to rule them all yeah it's honestly I
love that I mean we've been doing a lot
of hobbit stories on crave like The
Hobbit places you can rent uh yeah I
think that was a gallery that went up
today yeah um and all that condos that
people are like redoing to look like
inside Hobbit holes and that's that's
actually pretty awesome I know just
smart yeah that takes some real level of
fandom but I love anything with cat so
like the idea that there's a cat box
that look like middle-earth at least
doesn't like Sauron you don't want
burning cat litter mmm that's not that's
not a smell that you want the house but
I will oh but there is a little scratch
calls are scratching post that's even
better pretty awesome that's pretty
great I love break.com with their stuff
they also did they did the group thing
they did the great swing one brick
alright guys so what do you think final
thoughts was was 2014 the geekiest year
ever um no it was for me it was i think
is pretty geeky i can't remember a year
that was kikyo 1977 that's your husband
Star Wars uh I will say that this has
been a really geeky herb I'm hoping 2015
will be even geekier yeah I'm sure
definitely yeah I'm kind of overwhelmed
by all the movies that we were told
about this year that are coming out like
Bonnie you did that post all the
upcoming Marvel movie yeah I mean we are
losing the hobbit series but it's like
we're just jumping into a whole new
future of superhero movies and not not
just that I think we also did a crazy
story on every single reboot that's
being made into a TV
starkey and minority well stargates
gonna be movie but we've got no no
Yahoo's new platforms for video there
was no I mean if you're a gate great no
it's awesome because there's really an
embarrassment of riches of things to
watch and participate in so Eric and
Amanda you guys have been covering the
space program yeah like crazy thing kids
I don't know that anything huge is
planet for 2015 but you know in the next
five years we could I mean there's
almost half a dozen like gigantic
telescopes that are planned that are
like three times as powerful as what we
have now and then you know you've got
the launch of you know we're really
beginning to seriously look at putting
somebody on Mars I will be interesting
to see if Mars one that kind of reality
show Mars thing actually goes anywhere
so I don't know how much is gonna
actually materialize next year but over
the next five to ten years it's just as
literally a whole other universe I will
say though if you're a big fan of sci-fi
and your big fan of sci-fi predicting
future things I highly recommend black
mirror which is a that's amazing it's
kind of like it's been it's been called
it like twilight zone meets futuristic
sci-fi and I know a lot of Twilight Zone
fans right now it's not like that but I
do think it's like that it's there each
episode is its own episode they're not
linked in any way but they have some
really interesting for sight of what
they think technology is going to be
doing to our society as far as how
social media is treated how memories are
going to be implanted so you're going to
be able to rewind your membre see when
you have fights with your girlfriend or
boyfriend you can really show them what
they said stop guessing I'm still not
gonna matter and I guess and interesting
ideas about what happens if you get in
Carson eight incarcerated in prison
could that be like an amusement park or
could you have a reality show where all
the reality contestants might be kind of
like slaves but they're wanting to be
that because they want to be famous
there's a lot of interesting you know
pop culture as well as social commentary
and black mirror it's on Netflix so you
can watch all of first two seasons and
there's a Christmas special with Jon
Hamm coming out which will be very
interesting so I highly recommend it if
you like watching sci fi to see if it
predicts future things for reals I
second that motion and I think we could
we could go on for forever
I suggest taken the conversation over to
Twitter at krave like 10 minutes over
there so I'm gonna say I'm gonna I'm
gonna say goodbye for all of us here at
krave thanks for joining the creative
cast again cnet com / crave for all
these stories and much more I tried
going through them all earlier and I
just couldn't listen Joey thousands so
check it out and check us next month
Happy Holidays Happy New Year and we'll
see you next time
