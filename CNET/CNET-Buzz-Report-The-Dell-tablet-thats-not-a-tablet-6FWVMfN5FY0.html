buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
it's the all new and improved twitter
craigslist clean it up and the benefits
of video games but first it's the gadget
of the week the gadgets a week is dell's
new 10-inch tablet which is totally
going to take on the ipad for sure
touchscreen display dual-core Intel Atom
processor it runs windows 7 and get this
this tablet has a hidden feature wait
for it allow me to introduce you to dual
personality dell inspiron duo that's
right it's a tablet with a keyboard you
flip the screen around you can fold it
up and then your tablet totally has it
oh for the love of God it's a frigging
convertible tablet laptop this is not a
tablet this is to an actual tablet as
clip-on sunglasses that flip up our to
actual sunglasses just come on dell so
you just make a tablet and now for the
news Twitter held a press conference
this week to show off its new and
improved interface now instead of just
seeing tweets there's a second pain in
which you can see more content pictures
geolocation user profiles videos all
kinds of stuff the intent is to keep
people on the main Twitter site which is
great but of course the first thing we
all thought was hey pretty what about
the fail well no not a word about site
stability at that press conference also
not a word about making more money or
about better search but at least there
were pretty pictures some lucky people
have the new interface right now while
others will see it in the coming weeks
along with almost certainly the fail
whale come on you know it's true in
other news this week craigslist says it
is officially out of the pimp game the
company's director of law enforcement
and customer service relations was
called to testify before the house
judiciary committee this week on the
subject of sex trafficking of minors he
told the committee that craigslist has
permanently closed its adult services
section but he also said the section had
actually helped craigslist fight human
trafficking and exploitation which might
have been true when
Craigslist wasn't linking directly to
human trafficking and exploitation see
there have to be better ways speaking of
exploitation Google confirm this week
that it fired an engineer who used his
powers there to get personal information
on several teenagers and harassed them
because google also has tons of your
personal information and we have little
to no idea who is able to access it and
what they do with it and if the
allegations against this engineer are
true I kind of want off the internet
again hey you know how people are always
saying that playing video games rot your
brain well cognitive scientists at the
University of Rochester published a
study showing that people who play fast
action based games actually make quicker
accurate decisions how awesome is that
like Halo Reach could give me split
second cat-like reflexes at flapjacks
and speaking of nerds and throwing
things Apple this week denied reports
that Steve Jobs was busted trying to
smuggle Japanese throwing stars on to
his own private plane apparently he was
fascinated with the throwing stars
because they only work when you hold
them just right but seriously let's be
honest if anyone was going to smuggle
shuriken it would totally be Steve Jobs
badass and that's the buzz report for
this week everyone I'm Mollywood and
thank you for watching
split-second cat-like reflexes just from
the cat-like reflexes that cat-like
reflexes so that I could like get split
second cat-like reflexes from the
flapjacks no dude you got to hit me in
the face okay otherwise it doesn't count</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
