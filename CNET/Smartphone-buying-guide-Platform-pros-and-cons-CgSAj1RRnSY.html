cnet.com and i'm in a Best Buy store and
we're here to talk about CNET's buying
guide for smart phones and come on who
better to help me out then senior editor
Jessica dual court here was seen it and
we know that the smartphone is going to
be the biggest purchasing decision a lot
of you at home are going to make so
there are so many different platforms
and different things we can talk about
but let's start off with Android iOS and
Windows Phone what is the best platform
you know pros and cons for people at
home to decide about Android is on a ton
of different phones right now it has the
best tie-in to Google services it's got
Google now which is really convenient
and it's most customizable if people are
into that one con however is that since
it's on so many different phones the
experience isn't always the same phone
to phone and not every phone will have
the exact same features sometimes you
have to look out for that people think
it's the same everywhere but it's not
but then we have something like iOS
which gives you a consistent one over
all right exactly they're only two
phones to choose from with iOS there's
the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5c right
now those are both really good iOS is
very clean it's very consistent and easy
to use straight out of the box and
they're serious well it also is a
shoo-in if you've got Mac equipment at
home it is the best one to sync with all
of those different devices however it is
not customizable at all so if you're a
person who likes to tweak things you are
out of luck now let's talk about Windows
Phone there they're becoming a new
player now yeah Windows Phone is really
clean there are a lot of really good
nokia phones right now unfortunately it
is going to be the last to get the new
apps and it just isn't quite as
feature-rich right now so that's a
platform that's really good for somebody
who just wants a simple experience and
doesn't want to add on a lot of extra
whistles and bells so design and screen
size let's kind of talk about some of
the sweet spots with phones screen sizes
have changed a lot in the last year five
inches is now almost the norm yeah so we
have something here like the HTC One
this is a hot phone 5-inch screen really
big I mean it's still easy to hold to
perfect example so benefit there is that
you've got a big screen real estate so
you can look at things very comfortably
without having to squint or shove the
phone up to your face then we've got
even larger phones we've got the
phablets and those start at about 5.5
inches go all the way up to six point
one inches this is the Galaxy Note 3
that you're holding it is a lot larger
so it's a lot harder to stick in your
pocket it's a lot harder to use
one-handed but because the screen is
even larger it's even
to watch videos read articles look at
photos things like that and then one
cool thing about this one is that it has
a stylus so you can really interact with
this big screen a lot of different ways
right yeah with the stylus you can draw
you can write I use it a meeting for all
the time and then the old style you know
screen size that's still staple but you
know things have evolved so that would
be under five inches and unfortunately
that's the iPhone family right there
this guy right here yeah so you're gonna
see a lot of mid-range phones also i
phone 5s is the most premium phone at
the size it is incredibly easy to use
one-handed so that is a benefit slips
really easily into pocket so if you're a
person who cares more about ease of use
then this is going to be the size for
you
so we talked about the different sizes
of phones a thing now though is that
this phone here has started to become
people's camera right no longer we know
there's DSLRs we know there's point
issue cameras but by default this is it
so what should people look for in a
camera on their phones these days
looking at megapixels isn't gonna tell
you a lot these days anymore HTC has
something they call ultrapixels Apple
doesn't really tell you much at all and
then you've got of course phones like
Samsung phones that have a 13 megapixel
camera you've got the Nokia Lumia 1020
with a 41 which is huge enormous but
that only resolves to 5 megapixels so I
think what you really need to know is
that any premium phone is going to take
pretty good pictures most of the time
people don't even use photos for
printing anymore putting in photo books
that's when you're going to care about
the quality if you're just going to be
uploading to Facebook or to Instagram
then most of the cameras out there are
going to do the job alright so we've
talked about you know platform design
and camera we also have contract phones
vs. no contract phones what are some of
the benefits you know for that as well
so a lot of people really don't like to
be tethered to a carrier there's also a
problem if you leave your carrier you're
going to get smacked with a penalty so
no contract carriers like t-mobile and
some of the prepaids are good options
for that they generally offer lower
price data plans but you do have to pay
more for your phone upfront or you can
use an installation payment method you
also have the contract carriers that's
really good for people who are on family
plans for people who plan to stay with
their carrier for a while and they get
the subsidized price of the phone so
that's going to be a lot less upfront so
you're talking about $200 for a high-end
smartphone instead
of $600 for a high-end smartphone so
Jessica we've talked about platform
design camera and then contract versus
no contract but really what is your
number one tip for everyone watching
what they should look for when they're
getting a phone before you go and buy
the phone make sure that you go into a
store and get your hands on it because
it doesn't matter how fast the processor
is or how fancy the specs are if you
don't enjoy using that phone every day
if you don't like the way it looks and
feels in your hand then it is not the
phone for you
yeah and we want everyone to go home
happy absolutely phone that they pick
right right all right well there you go
