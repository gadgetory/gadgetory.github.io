CES 2017 how thin LG debuted its OLED w7
TV the W stands for wallpaper because
it's thinner than two dimes put together
ladies and gentlemen that's 1/10 of an
inch the 65 inch model clocks in at only
18 pounds making it light enough to hang
with just magnets kind of what I think
the future of televisions going to be
like you can imagine in five years ten
years all these TVs are going to be so
thin that they seem like they're part of
the wall the TV is so thin wires and
cables plug into a sound bar that
provides Dolby Atmos sound the cinema is
always going to be the place where you
can get the biggest pictures and the
biggest sound but in the living room and
on the go there are lots of
opportunities to make it more immersive
what makes the thin as possible is the
LED technology or organic light-emitting
diodes they really run circles around
LCD in terms of giving you that superb
superb picture quality from every angle
great deep black levels all of that
excellent color OLED skinny screens
allow for a first-of-its-kind television
debuted by Sony which turns the whole
screen into a giant speaker so they have
these little modules behind the TV but
it creates sound through the screen
itself so if you have somebody talking
on the screen the sound actually seems
it's coming out of their mouth TV makers
are also envisioning ways to use the
screens when the television is off both
LG and Samsung showed off frame
television screens that mimic paintings
but you may need a fat wallet to pay for
these skinny screens expect to pay about
$10,000 when the LG wallpaper TV goes on
sale later this spring for the latest
CES coverage go to cnet.com in Las Vegas
