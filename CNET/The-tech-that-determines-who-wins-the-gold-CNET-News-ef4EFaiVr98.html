did blow important 50 tons of equipment
since the Latin games the photo finish
camera became a lot more precise and
accurate the technology we're using now
is a photo finish camera that takes
10,000 pictures per second of the first
5 millimeters of the finish line
previously it was a camera took 2,000
pictures another technology would be the
full star detection system using track
and field
so we place the pressure sensor in the
back of the starting blocks and
calculate the horizontal power of the
athlete this is done during the entire
start procedure so in case of a full
start the judge will immediately
understand what athlete did a full start
touch pads are used in swimming to
determine the finish times are the
athletes it's the only sport where I
hasn't stopped their tan themselves and
they have to push the touch pad between
one and a half and two and a half kilos
this is needed in order to avoid waves
that are produced by the athletes to
stop the time we're using cameras that
film the finish area those cameras are
special cameras and take a hundred
pictures per second it's late to the
timing system and in case of close
finishes it allows judges to identify
clearly what athletes touched the pad
first another new technology will be a
laser detection system in archery that
scans the entire target so we would know
very precisely where the arrow hit the
target and get an instant result out of
that Omega is going to provide all
services which is going to deliver
results to the athletes speaking about
28 sports over in two weeks
