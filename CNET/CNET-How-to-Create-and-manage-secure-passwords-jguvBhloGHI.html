storage cloud every month we log into
dozens of websites using a password but
no way do you want people guessing what
your password is and logging into your
accounts hopefully I don't have to tell
you that using passwords like one two
three four five six QWERTY
or your first name are not okay I'm
Sharon Vaknin frisina and today I will
show you how to create secure passwords
and how to keep track of them all to
start a good password is made of
uppercase and lowercase letters a
variety of punctuation marks and numbers
ideally our passwords would look
something like this but that's not
exactly realistic so try this method
make up a phrase like the Giants should
win the World Series in 2013 then just
take the initials numbers and
punctuation from the phrase to create a
password that looks like this if you
want to see just how secure your
password is head to a website like how
secure is my password net the website
will rate your password based on how
long it would take to crack so if you
enter something weak like 1 2 3 4 5 6
the meter would tell you why your
password is so crappy and how you can
fix it I don't recommend putting
passwords that you actually plan to use
in these websites though
they might not be secure and are only
meant for educational purposes now that
you know how to create super secure
passwords make sure you're using a
different one for almost every service
you use why well because if someone
cracks one password and you use it for
everything else your online life will be
compromised the thing is it's going to
get really hard to remember all those
crazy passwords you made so you have a
few options one memorize all your
passwords ok don't do that to write them
down on a piece of paper and put them
somewhere safe this is the old-school
method but it works the obvious gotcha
here though is that if someone finds
that piece of paper you're in trouble
the third and best option is to use a
password manager like LastPass you can
grab the program for just about any
grading system and browser over on the
scene at download page
LastPass stores and encrypts all of your
passwords for you and auto fills your
account logins and whenever you create a
new online account LastPass can generate
a secure password for you the only scary
part about LastPass is that it's all
kept secure with one master password so
make sure that one's extra hard to crack
trading off greater overall security and
convenience for that flaw will be
completely up to you and just like any
online service LastPass could be
susceptible to security issues of its
own now that you know how to make and
manage secure passwords go give your
security a little makeover and if you
