got
it's the Nintendo switch it comes out
March 3rd for $300 here is the official
unboxing we're gonna take care of that
right now let's see what's inside
what you get for $2.99
in the box of Nintendo switch see the
tablet and those joy con controllers
let's take this out alright we've got an
HDMI cable some power junk here's the
joy con grip I think they call this you
can attach these guys and use it as a
standard controller we've also got the
little bumpers for the controllers for
those joy con controllers to show you
what one of those looks like right there
check that out
it slips on to the side and then you've
got what appears to be the dock this is
where the switch tablet the switch pad
the switch screen whatever you want to
call it this is where it's gonna live
and sit you can see that right there
let's get a closer look at the screen
about that real real light real compact
there you have it there's the screen for
the switch and what I'll do is I've got
a little USB C port under there volume
controls all that stuff looks like a
vent at the top - maybe this baby will
heat up a little bit I'll have to wait
and see I'm gonna attach one of these
controllers here easy enough and I'll
attach this last one so you can see what
the whole tablet assembled looks like
there it is
there you have it pretty cool alright
that was easy I've also got some
accessories I want to show you guys
this looks like a carrying case which
will be really useful because man I'd be
scared to scratch that thing up this is
extra though this doesn't come with
three with the $2.99 package so we got
like a little space here for some games
some other goodies you could fit in that
little mesh pocket
I don't know how am i doing that right
that's that works see this is like
that's pretty substantial in size it's
like one of those like visors or
something I don't know
Sun visors alright also comes with a a
what is this screen protector which you
know makes me a little nervous okay your
your your goat you're leading with that
maybe this screen needs to be protected
that worries me because I worry about
that kind of stuff but there you have it
well let that live in there and then
let's check out so this is where it gets
confusing what comes with the actual kit
is this this is a grip for the joy
controls it doesn't charge them you have
to buy a separate charging grip for them
to charge those two little joy con
controllers when when they're not
plugged in which is you know not the
best but that's that's what we're
dealing with and they're man they're
really identical right so this is what
you get when you pay for the joy con
charging grip that's this guy right here
the one that comes in the box with the
switch console is this one
they look nearly identical but the
difference is the charging one has this
sort of translucent back I don't know if
you can tell it's a little dark but the
translucent back and also has the
charred the USBC charger at the front
whereas the non charging one doesn't
have that if you can make that out there
so yeah if you want this grip to charge
those joy con controllers you need this
guy and that's an extra cost so just put
that out here as well alright so that's
what you get with the joy con
grip and then finally the last accessory
that I feel like everybody is gonna want
just judging on on our sort of preview
stuff is the pro controller this is $70
but it looks like it might be the best
way to play games again we haven't
really had enough time to make that
declaration but that's sort of the vibe
we've been getting also here is what's
inside the box for that it has its own
USB C charger just like everything else
and yeah there you go
here is the pro controller for the
switch real nice translucent sort of
design there got a USB C port at the top
and just a real yeah this feels right
I'm played a lot with this but yeah this
feels like where you want to be maybe
over these guys but again we don't know
just yet big bummer though $70 that's up
that's a lot of money to pay that's
nearly a third of what the whole console
costs but that's the pricing structure
we're left with alright and then this is
this is the game we're gonna look at
it's it's a pretty small case if you
remember the Vita cases that's like the
closest thing I can think of not the
Vita ones the well the Vita or the PSP
ones if you if your memory goes back
that far alright so inside okay not a
whole lot going not a whole lot going on
just this little tiny card that's that's
that's pretty sad that seems like a
little bit of a waste but we're not
gonna point any fingers let's see what
it looks like when you put the game in
the console can we do that oh wow get a
close-up of this little tiny little game
they figured it out modern science is
amazing somehow link is inside here look
at this I'm gonna put this inside the
switch let's see where there's the game
card can you get a close-up of that
there you see that that's where you pop
in the game
cards okay there you go
spring-loaded very nice we're all set to
go but I can't turn it on not yet we're
gonna have a full review in the coming
days and you're gonna find out whether
or not this whole thing is worth it
thanks so much for watching my name is
