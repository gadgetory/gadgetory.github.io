a look at the Alienware 17 of course we
just looked at the Alienware 18 that
model of course has an 18 inch screen
this one has a 17 inch screen even
though it's only a one inch difference
the 17 inch model is actually a much
thinner and much lighter although it's
still obviously very big and heavy by
laptop standards that's because that 18
inch model you can cram in two video
cards in addition to two or three hard
drives and a super high-end processor
here in the 17 inch model it's much more
like other 17-inch gaming laptops you
can still fit a solid-state hard drive
and a regular hard drive you get a good
quad core Core i7 processor but there's
only room for one video card in our case
we've got an upgraded video car the very
good nvidia geforce 780 m that's really
the card you want to get if you're
spending let's say more than $2,000 on a
gaming laptop which we're doing in this
case this configuration comes out to
about 2,600 bucks
give me a lower-end entry-level
Alienware 17 for about 1500 but at that
point you know why bother just get a
regular old 17 inch or even a 15 inch
laptop Gaming scores this thing did
really well not as great as the handful
of super thick gaming laptops we've seen
with 2 cards but for a single card
system it played our Bioshock on a Metro
last light test at high settings very
well I played the brand-new Battlefield
4 in here I set everything to high at
full 1080 P resolution played great on
some of the faster gaming systems I was
however able to make the jump to ultra
settings which of course is what you get
when you go past high if you want to
have a a desktop replacement laptop that
doesn't look all that garish you know
it's got a nice muted matte black design
even though it has the standard
Alienware lights you can get a very
highly configurable system here with the
Alienware 17 and if you're willing to
spend maybe that $2,000 little bit more
you get a really nice configuration for
your money I'm Dan Ackerman and that is
the Alienware 17
