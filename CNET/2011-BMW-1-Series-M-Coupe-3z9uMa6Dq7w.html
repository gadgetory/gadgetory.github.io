image of being a starter BMW adding a
twin-turbo 305 horses and 19's on a help
let's drive the 2011 BMW 1m and check
the tech
the modern m3 is about the size of the
original five and outweighs it by 300
pounds so there's been some class creep
if you want to set the clock back to a
less ponderous time in BMW history look
at the 1-series
it fits into closed the 3-series hasn't
been able to wear in almost 30 years
this M example is called the 1m not the
m1 because that was this car and that's
another video one series especially in
him but anyone is kind of cool in that
it takes you back to what the free
series used to be it was a much smaller
car a lighter car an in blur car it's
grown up a lot since the early 80s what
we're looking at here is once again a
small nimble car feels tighter inside of
course but not dramatically so
everything's a little bit smaller in
scale you've got a little smaller
instrument binnacle the wheel feel
smaller in diameter although I'm
probably imagining that because the damn
thing is so thick on this M car we have
a basic head unit here we don't have the
hotted up one that has the nav screen
the iDrive and all those features as a
result you've got a simple but very
effective system now our sources are
am/fm with HD radio that is standard
interestingly enough but Bluetooth
hands-free is an interesting choice
there by BMW single slot optical disc
also optional right here under the
console we have an aux jack and a USB
paired together which go into a single
cable to be an iOS device very simple
interface for getting around but I've
always been a fan of this one it's
really straightforward you use out of
the menu or the audio buttons and then
the various buttons here become soft
buttons to choose in the submenu here's
what iPod stuff looks like again you
don't have a lot of real estate so how
does it handle it well let's take a look
I'll hit albums now I'll scroll here
aside from there being very little of an
aperture you're looking at at once what
it shows is very clear and notice how it
reads really quickly now the interior
stuff that relates to the drivetrain two
key components and that's critical
m-car one transmission one choice only
it's a 6-speed manual there's no dual
clutch automatic no automatic automatic
just this gearbox very simple low
options on the 1 Series M and then
there's the M dynamics mode button here
on the wheel now on other end cars you
can tune that so that all the various
functions of the car from suspension to
DCT behavior are all kind of tailored to
your way on this car it's real simple
you either press the M button to get
extremely aggressive throttle mapping or
press it again to go back to basically
aggressive throttle mapping
oh here's tech for tech sake the
wireless key fob has to be in the slot
in the dash before you can use the push
button starter that's an inch away some
days you'd just kill for a plain old car
key now of course being an AM the real
story is under the hood not really in
the cabin here is our three litre
inline-six classic BMW stuff twin turbos
on this guy and it's got direct
injection stepless variable valve timing
all the good stuff BMW knows how to do
it's the engine you might know basically
from a 335 but hot it up even more and
twin turbos not a two-stage twin scroll
single turbo not in this application the
numbers 335 horsepower 332 foot-pounds
of torque gets this little 3,300 pound
car up to 60 in 4.7 seconds and with mpg
that's 1926 once again thank you 3,300
pound kerb weight that power by the way
goes out of this engine into a dual disc
clutch to handle what's a lot of wind up
torque and then goes out to a rear wheel
drive only configuration which has a
locking rear differential
the 1m comes in just three colors they
had to send us Valencia orange the
others are black and white
the first thing you get impressed by is
how this car feels light on its feet
because it's a fairly light car at 3,300
pounds it's not in today's mainstream of
what cars are coming in at by several
hundred pounds more than that of course
they sprung it nicely
you've got ample power but the
responsiveness of the power is also
coming on right as well I'd love second
here in this car I can do just about
anything in this car off the freeway in
second gear and it's happy to play ball
let's take a hard turn here and just
stay on it steer with the throttle very
nice oh by the way this car has the rear
subframe the rear running gear rear
differential and such and the tires and
wheels off an m3 more or less nothing
like taking a few hundred pounds off a
car to make it handle the way you want
it to without effort good exhaust notice
ooh I'm not sure much that you can hear
I got the windows up so our microphones
don't get buffeted by too much wind but
it's a nice muted note but Sirians Oh
check it out I'll put it in the M mode
Napa this next series of curves really
kicks up the throttle response you
really notice it when you're in a
performance mode and you've got the road
where you can use it in and around town
is something but a head bobbing it's a
complete pain in the ass for city
driving but it's really nice when you
got a little road you can unwind on
without getting ridiculous
okay let's try some 2011 1 Series M it's
often a story of simplicity as we've
seen that this model base price is
47,000 in any of its simply three colors
I love them now here's where it gets non
simple and kind of tricky it's doing it
up seen that style you've got to grab
too chunky packages and one all a cart
piece the first package is the
convenience package that costs twenty
seven hundred bucks and gets you I drive
hard drive nav live traffic Park
distance control keyless access and an
alarm system then you got to get premium
to get iPod USB bluetooth hands-free
automatic mirrors power seats and lumbar
support and then you go all a cart 250
more to get the BMW apps it's kind of a
lot to add onto a car that's trying to
be an affordable M but the technologies
were solid and I definitely want the
apps package</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
