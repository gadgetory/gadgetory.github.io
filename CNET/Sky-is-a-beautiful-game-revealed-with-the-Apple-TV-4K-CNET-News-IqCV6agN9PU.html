an art form
today many of us play games alone but we
believe games is a medium that can bring
people together and that's exactly what
we are going to do with our new game
stack together with me is my colleague
Mike and like why don't we take off sky
is a romantic social adventure game well
you fly above the clouds to explore the
wonders of a mysterious world the game
is designed to be adaptable to the most
casual players the control is simple and
intuitive everything can be done with
one finger on the Siri remote oh hey
that's Mike's friend Jeff and he's
asking us to follow him let's see what
he has discovered compassion and
generosity are key to unveil hidden
areas of the world as well as growing
your character so by lighting all the
candles Jeff and Mike was able to summon
in the spirit and he's about to teach
Mike the knowledge of how to sever a
magical creature
in sky we really take advantage of the
powerful new hardware with metal to an
Apple TV's a 10x fusion chip we were
able to run the game smoothly even with
these detailed clouds intelligent
creatures and up to eight players from
anywhere around the world and let's see
if we can draft off one of these
creatures
we don't have time to show you
everything so we're gonna skip forward
to the dark tempo ahead light and dark
are important themes of the game in sky
you play as the children of light and
your goal is to bring that light to
where it is needed the most
where's the light Mike was able to free
all the butterflies and together they
can move on to the next part of the
adventure with a live orchestral
soundtrack and a cinematic experiences
you can expect to be immersed in an
ever-expanding world so join hands with
your loved ones and play sky exclusively
on Apple TV I pad and iPhone this winter
