a review of the 1549 dollar Electrolux
30 inch gas freestanding range with IQ
touch controls we actually reviewed an
electric Electrolux range that was very
similar to this model but it had an
overly complicated display panel that
made it very difficult to navigate
fortunately this gas version doesn't
suffer from the same design and
usability concerns and I would say that
this model is a slight step up as a
result but when you stack this model
against some similarly priced gas ranges
it starts to lose some of its appeal for
starters this model has a pretty
inoffensive design which could be what
you're looking for but other models
offer more industrial grade knobs and
other sort of professional features that
make it stand out so if you're looking
for that sort of stand out professional
look this is not the model for you this
model also has a comparatively small
oven capacity so it has 5 cubic feet
which is big enough to cook that turkey
or do double rack baking but it's
definitely smaller than some similarly
priced models on performance this model
did pretty well but it actually was on
the slow side so we broiled six
hamburgers to 145 degrees Fahrenheit and
this model actually took three minutes
longer to reach temperature than the
Samsung model it also took two and a
half minutes longer to boil a small 3
quart pot of water than the Samsung so I
definitely wouldn't count on it for
speed while you can make a decent meal
with ass Electrolux range I would
suggest looking elsewhere first perhaps
at the Samsung
I mentioned earlier it has a larger oven
capacity more features and better
overall performance thanks for watching
this review of the Electrolux 30 inch
gas freestanding range with IQ touch
controls be sure to check out the rest
of our coverage on CNET comm I'm Megan</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
