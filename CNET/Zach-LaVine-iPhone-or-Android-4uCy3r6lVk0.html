Minnesota Timberwolves and a slam dunk
champ yeah still current slam dunk champ
ax are you planning to revisit that or
what do you think are we gonna see a
rematch man I don't even know man house
me arena dunks I feel like so Oh No
maybe if maybe we saw you do a bunch of
dunks here for NBA 2k 17 is this the
first time you've done a motion capture
session or how was that like for you
yeah it was cool
oh I felt like a Power Ranger in the
soup but it was all good getting to see
your body in like different angles and
different cameras and you know like the
skeleton so it was uh it was different
positives of the suit and maybe
negatives of the suit for you positives
um it attracts heat you know so if it's
a cold day you'll stay warm negatives
you know if it's a hot day you're
burning up so it'll issue here with you
inside the suit there um social media
obviously a big thing and it exploded
really um you know to that larger
audience at the dunk fest and how do you
involve yourself a social media whether
it's things like snapchat Twitter
Instagram mostly Instagram I own tweet a
lot on got a lot to say I retweet a lot
of stuff laughs Instagram you know I
post a lot picture a lot of videos I do
a lot of family stuff like just
day-to-day stuff my workouts iPhone or
Android what's your phone a choice I
gotta go i phone man it's just to just
to go to nice to go to I got a couple
but what still go to on the road you
know I know you travel a lot with you
know as a player but are there any other
tech gadgets that you like whether it's
cameras or whatever things that you're
interested in my ps4 man I'm good yeah I
usually bring my ps4 along on the gang
go on road trips to play maybe put a
pair of scissors scissor tech yes is it
a Colin oh man yeah that's a I'm not the
biggest gadget guy but you know I know
that you're a busy guy but with your
phone if there's something that your
phone could do for you today that
doesn't that it doesn't do what do you
wish your phone had or could do it could
be anything a wacky or could just be
actually practical
I mean autocorrect be messing up
sometimes so I wish you could just
always just know exactly what I want to
say and how I want to say it like in my
text but then I use my voice text half
the time anyway so we'll talk to Apple
about that ones right ready to talk to
it they need to fix that out there they
need to know exactly what I want to say
and you know might not be the best
speller but once about the correct way
