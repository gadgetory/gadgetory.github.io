this is wall ways first laptop ever the
mate book X is the 13-inch family's
notebook with the sleek clamshell design
it runs Windows 10 has intel's seventh
generation i7 processor and 2 USB sea
ports similar to one of huawei's phones
the laptops power button doubles as a
fingerprint reader it works well in
conjunction with Windows hello the
laptop looks a lot like the new MacBook
Pro but it's a little lighter and
thinner this tom bin case made for the
13-inch MacBook Pro easily fits the
huawei notebook with a few millimeters
to spare the mate book X is the perfect
size for traveling and commuting and oh
yeah it's a really good-looking laptop
first generation devices typically
aren't as polished and refined Huawei
defies the convention with the notebooks
luxurious aluminum construction and
high-end feel hello the mate book X is
also the first laptop to feature Dolby's
at most sound system Dolby Atmos
technology emulates the way sound
travels in real life for a more
immersive viewing experience but it
usually only works through headphones on
mobile devices the mate book X is the
first laptop to have the technology also
available via its a built-in speaker she
said I was intimidated by his
intelligence they sound great a lot
fuller sounding than most laptops and
they helped make an otherwise small
screen more exciting for watching video
speaking of the screen it has a sharp
and glossy 2k resolution display and
supremely thin bezels to maximize screen
space performance with satisfyingly fast
and smooth however I did have some
unfortunate hiccups streaming Spotify
via the Microsoft edge browser there's
no windows app for Spotify so you have
to use the Web Player fortunately it
worked well on Chrome u.s. pricing is
currently unknown price of course will
really determine if the mate book X is
big competition for the MacBook Pro
while way is still carving a name out
for itself in the US and other markets
the mate book X is a mighty fine laptop
and depending on its price I could see
myself recommending it to someone who
wanted a MacBook
esque windows 10 laptop here's hoping
Huawei does consumers a solid and prices
it competitively</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
