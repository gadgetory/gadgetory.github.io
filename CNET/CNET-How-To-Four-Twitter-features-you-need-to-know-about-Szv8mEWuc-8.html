post pictures of your food and complain
about your job it's a great service for
discovering new things connecting with
others and staying up-to-date on the
latest news but there's more to the
service than meets the eye i'm dan
graziano i'm going to share with you
four twitter features that you need to
know about Twitter recently revamped its
web-based profiles with a design that
closely resembles something you would
find on your Facebook page in addition
to being able to change your profile
pictures and header photos you can now
change your theme color and even pin a
tweet to your home page that you want to
bring extra attention to to pin a tweet
go to your profile page click on the
three I con on the tweet you want to
highlight and select pin to your profile
the color of the profile can be changed
by clicking on the theme color option
inside your profiles edit mode whether
it's a friend co-worker or family member
sometimes we're stuck it into following
people we just don't want to follow I
don't care about the latest Justin
Bieber news my sister's weeding out but
luckily you can mute these annoying
tweeters without them knowing from the
web or either the Android or iOS App
navigate over to the tweeters profile
click on the gear icon and select mute
maybe they aren't such a bad tweeter but
they keep on retweeting annoying things
you can choose to simply disable a
person's retweets what if they're the
world's best tweeter and you want to
know when they tweet if that's the case
you can enable mobile notifications both
these options can be found in the gear
icon on a user's profile page muted
users can still direct message you reply
to your tweets retweet you and still
favorite your tweets which brings me to
my next tip direct messages these are
private messages that can be sent to a
person that you follow and follows you
back direct messages can get us into
trouble as we learn from a few
politicians but did you know that you
can actually unsend a message after
sending a direct message simply click on
the trashcan icon next to the message
you would like to unsend this will
delete the message
from both your inbox and the person you
sent to choose inbox however it should
be noted that if the person has email
notifications enabled they will still be
able to see this message the last thing
you may not have known is that Twitter
gives users the ability to download
their old tweets that's right you can
download an archive of every single
tweet that you have ever sent this can
be done by going to the settings menu
and clicking on request your archive
Twitter will then send you an email with
a link to download your data unzip the
download and click on the index.html
file to view an offline history of your
entire Twitter life for more how tunes
