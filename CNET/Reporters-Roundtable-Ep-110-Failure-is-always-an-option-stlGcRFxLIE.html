roundtable I am Rafe Needleman in San
Francisco and today on the show we are
discussing one of my favorite topics
failure failure as it turns out is
always an option at least it appears
that way for all the if you've been
following technology Apple has its
failures Google Facebook most recently
path had a big failure of communication
where it turns out that they were
absorbing their iphone users address
books into their servers in order to
match path users up with other path
users not necessarily such a bad thing
but path didn't tell its users as they
were doing it and then followed a rather
as a one of my guests called it a supine
apology and further accusations about
what path had been doing in the past but
this kind of thing happens all the time
companies are always making flubs
they're all moving so fast they're going
to make mistakes the question is how do
you prepare for these mistakes and how
do you respond to them once they happen
and what what can we all learn from what
path Facebook Google Twitter Zynga
Netflix have done in the past when
they've fallen on their faces today to
discuss this really interesting topic
I've got two old friends with me first
are both dialing in first from San
Francisco here Owen Thomas who is
founding editor of The Daily Dot you can
follow his great work there Owen it's
great to have you here own gained some
notoriety himself after he worked for me
at red herring by working at valleywag
he was the chief valleywag blogger for a
while very entertaining and insightful
stuff over there and quite controversial
taking it all from you Ray ah shucks
anyway thanks Owen for joining us also
joining us from New York another old
friend Brooke hammerling who is a
communications professional
extraordinaire who has built her own
business doing exactly that a brew is
the founder of brew PR which counts as
its clients big companies like Nets week
NetSuite and one kings lane which is
just exploding Brooke thank you so much
for joining us thanks for having me of
course your companies have never made
any mistakes have a well you know it is
I mean we can talk about it sure they've
made lots of mistakes
it's all how you handle it so let's get
into let's get into this today by
talking about the one that's in the news
right now of course which is path why I
just explained what path did uh is this
a tempest in a teapot or is this really
a big deal Brooke you first what do you
think about the path flap well I think
you know I think Owens alma mater of
Gawker uncovered something pretty
crucial here which if it's true then we
have a problem because it seems that the
founder hasn't told the truth and that
is it looks like he had told valleywag
Gawker whatnot that this had actually
not they did not keep the data and that
they deleted it nothing was kept on on
their servers and that turned out to not
be true so that's the even bigger issue
if they were asked this in the past and
then they've proven in right writing
which they have an email saying
absolutely not i hope you that answered
your question we don't save it and then
boom and a rogue engineer shows that
that's not true that's a real problem so
you lose trust in that but ultimately i
think people have very short memories
and it moves on i do think it's it's a
crack in the the shiny veneer of path
though for sure oh and they've already
weathered a storm so in terms of just
the design it felt for the first round
so the version 2 is this sort of rebirth
and then this sort of you know thing
knocks that that shine off of it Owen
what do you think about what path is
fortunes pastor than what you doing
right now well I think what's
interesting is they they did change so
when they launched they weren't keeping
this information on their servers then
very quietly before they launch path to
point o before everyone loved them again
in march two thousand eleven if I if I
understand it correctly they started
retaining this data on their servers to
develop a new technology they're calling
friend rank which helps you find your
quote-unquote real friends your close
friends the ones you actually want to
share your you know your daily moments
with that's what path lets you do that's
you know what's great about path is it's
this really small tight community the
the thing is though that they didn't
tell anyone that that had changed they
didn't say
hey I know we said in november two
thousand ten that we're not keeping this
on our servers we decided you know it's
now March 2011 we decided we're going to
keep it on our servers now because it
helps us do cool things for you and
you're gonna you're going to have to
click a button when you upload the
latest version or when you download the
latest version and give us permission to
do that that's what they should have
done in march two thousand eleven they
didn't understand I don't understand is
it's so easy right they make and Dave
made this big apology and then they've
now made it opt-in but why when they've
seen the history of how these things
work when they know these things have a
tendency to come out eventually why they
wouldn't have done that in the first
place so that's the other thing is they
do have to do this in they didn't have
to do this in March sorry that's what
you're not your dog was a comment on
this is Ramona is very upset about this
whole fracas considering Owen is the
biggest path user so David say they had
another kid so they could have done this
in March they also could have a two
weeks ago they were preparing a new
version this is her story they said we
have this new version with the opt-in it
was ready to go it's already submitted
to the app store and then this thing
work so why like if they knew that they
were going to do this if they were going
to create this new version why didn't
they announced you know before anyone
caught them hey we made a mistake that's
what their blog has said we're sorry we
made a mistake but they knew they'd made
a mistake already so the moment at which
they realized they made a mistake the
moment at which they realized they had
to they had to revise their software to
make it opt-in that's when they should
have been how do you possibly act fast
enough to stay ahead of the vitriol that
spread so quickly over the web though I
mean I'm sure that when path when Dave
Morin overt CEO path and his whole crew
saw what was going on they said oh you
know we've got a craft a response to
this that is appropriate and has this
right emotional tone etc and yet while
they're working on that you've got
commenters all over the blogosphere
saying i'll never trust these guys are a
bunch of scum they deserve to die i mean
i saw clothes like that pop up
immediately after this thing happened
and immediately after that Gawker story
which by the way was true but at a
different time
at a different time so that's true how
do you Brooke how do you cancel your
companies to prepare for the incredibly
fast and uninformed and emotionally
violent stuff that comes out and I'm
anybody makes even the smallest of
slip-ups right well in that particular
case what I found surprising is that I
started hearing about it that Tuesday
late afternoon early evening in I don't
think it came out they didn't make any
comment until the following day I guess
the new started to spread over night but
I mean that's something that they should
have attacked they should have been no
sleep they should have addressed it
immediately I'm not sure when the timing
of the apology went out but you know
there's there's something to be said for
the speed for which one accepts and
acknowledges a mistake and then then
kind of goes and finesse is it and goes
after the different audiences and
whatnot but I would have done it
immediately I would have done a Mia
culpa and and you know there's certain
levels of crisis this is a big one I
mean there are certain ones that people
are going to get all up in arms about
and we can talk about some of those that
that then the customer the company has
to eventually go and change I think
Netflix is a great example and you know
so they didn't move very fast but then
when they did and when they did change
it and they did make Mia culpa it turned
people's impressions of them for sure
yeah i do think i doing Dave's apology
was absolutely right you know I I teased
him a little I called him the supine
apology but that's what you have to do
you have to roll on your back and just
hundreds but yeah and just say I I
surrender I told total screwup you know
you can't be defensive you can't be even
the slightest bit defensive fiction
slightest bit defensive um people will
just tear you apart again and I think
that's what Airbnb saw is like they were
not they were not fully apologetic
enough they were a little bit defensive
they were entirely defensive yeah I mean
and even even a squidge of defensive
pneus is enough to give your you know
your critics even your fans your fans
who feel betrayed those are even worse
than the critics
something to you know something to latch
on to it sounds like a very interesting
emotional state to be in for a CEO who I
mean the air B&amp;amp;B the CEOs of all these
small companies in order to get to where
they are they have to be extremely
aggressive extremely arrogant to a point
if going to raise a lot of money hire
people based on a promise put a product
out there that's not fully baked or
tested and then say to the world this is
great and I'm great and we're great and
you the users are great and then when
they make a mistake which is going to
happen right they have to go to this
completely different emotional state and
Brooke how do you deal with CEOs who are
there they're alpha in every possible
way and then they've got to roll over as
Owen says which is right about they've
got to roll over and say oh I'm so so so
so very sorry I mean how do you how do
that you get them into that state and
every CEO is different and I don't care
if you're a 25 year old CEO or if you're
a 65 year old CEO it's going to be
difficult to do and there's some that
are better at it than others I will say
you only have one chance certainly in
the in this economy and this sort of you
know fast pace of the internet world you
only have one chance to say I'm sorry or
to make a mistake you can't keep doing
this this isn't like you know when
you're a kid and you screw up and
apologize your parents over and over
again you only get one shot at this and
I think you you know you have to play it
absolutely as Owen says not defensively
but but but incredibly delicately so
where you're you're you're explaining
the situation taking a hit doing a Mia
culpa but also making it clear that
moving forward this will not happen
again the problem is that you get these
situations where you might set precedent
I think that's what happened with Airbnb
they have one person that's complaining
saying they got robbed saying all this
stuff happened and they're saying well
for you if we go after this one work
that means we're going to address every
single person and that's not scalable I
guess is what they're thinking and then
it just blew up and and they should have
addressed it right then and there and
they need to figure out what that means
from from from procedure moving forward
so with Airbnb there were all these
other factors like the you know they
were worried
the bad publicity around this was going
to was going to destroy their upcoming
funding round like you know investors
would walk away if they saw but they
can't becoming a mess but they made it
worse so what has happened with what has
happened with Airbnb I mean I think
we're agreeing here that the Gawker
story notwithstanding that Dave morons
apology while perhaps 24 hours late was
appropriate but the Airbnb CEOs name
slips my mind at the moment forgive me
Francesca Brian yeah Brian's apology
maybe was a little too defensive what
effect has that had on Airbnb me and
Brooke you said that you only get one
chance but if you look at apple and then
tena gate and then Foxconn and you look
at facebook and the ongoing privacy
flaps we in in the in the journalism
world and in the in the commenting world
say you know our apology are being angry
at these companies will tear them down
but then they just keep coming back and
swung up over and over again and why I
clarify i should clarify i think its
size of company matters i mean i think
that apple and whether it's oracle or
facebook or whatnot these guys they have
the ability and the flexibility to make
these mistakes and keep they're not
going to go anywhere after them I'm
talking about the startup world the
startups that are building a base that
is so crucial like an Arab a B&amp;amp;B it's
you can't make those mistakes over and
over again it's just that the people
will stop using the service there will
be such a fear that Seth in but I think
what I've seen from airbnb is that some
people are affected by it truly but
others sort of moved on and are letting
it happen and see if the experience is
good for them then it's gonna be you
know something they continue to use
until it happens to them so I mean we're
all driven by fear and greed right in
almost anything so often we over play as
journalists Rafe you and I overplay the
fear and underestimate the greed and
greet you know by greed I don't I don't
just mean like Wall Street let's make a
lot of money greed greed is I want
something with Facebook for example it's
I want more connectedness with everyone
who's touching my
um and so the fear of like oh I'll be
somehow exposed is much smaller than
that desire for connection on and I
think I think the same thing is true
with half like okay yeah we're we're
abstractly afraid of this idea that you
know a copy of our address book is on
path servers but really we're much more
greedy for that you know for that
ability to share every little moment in
this really beautiful interface on our
you know on our phones with our friends
well what is the CEO to do I mean again
to bounce between these two worlds how
Brooke do you teach a CEO to listen to
the zeitgeist of what's happening it's
really important I mean one of the
things we have to find the balance of is
and I've always called it and I've said
this publicly sort of the under 35 year
old over 35 year old CEO the ones that
are under 35 are reading the comments
well read comments and blogs will read
the tweets will read all these things
and they will and I know not meant to
the grand generalization but I see this
with a lot of our younger CEOs and they
understand it in a rationalize and they
understand even if it's negative they
move and they're incredibly diligent
about responding to each and every
person as much as they can you'll see
like a Daniel Eck will do that when when
talk communicating with people and spoke
via Twitter around Spotify the older
CEOs get very emotional they'll see
those comments they'll get very reactive
they get very emotional response and
that's a more difficult situation so we
have to help them sort of not not react
quickly not do the knee-jerk reaction
not fire off a comment on a blog post
which I'm sure you've seen rave people
do when they get mad at you and they'll
you know flame you out an a in a
comments and that's something we really
need to control because even if somebody
is you know we think they should go
after and say listen I think you're
wrong in this article there's a better
way of doing it and it needs to be a
direct you know less defensive not
emotional reaction speaking of that oh
and I want to throw this riff off of
that and throw the two hour Cathy Brooks
our friend in the chat room is asking
what role does the media have in either
educating or fomenting these issues
what's the responsible take of of any of
our businesses when one of these things
blows up well you know I think I think
that the the interplay between Gawker
and TechCrunch on on the issue of what
did paths say and when did when did they
say it about about address book data uh
that's that is a great example of what
people call it of journalism now a lot
of people rip on this because it means
you make mistakes you correct things as
you go um you know in the media but it
gets more facts on the table and I think
that is the number one duty of of media
is to put new facts out there you've got
to you that's a story but the fact is
kind of a loose phrase at this point but
I mean what's the thing in this in this
day and age as we know I mean a small
little rumor that may never have even
been a problem or a small crisis which
never would have gotten out beyond the
you know the walls of a company now in
social media is out before the person is
even you know hung up the phone and so
that and it's getting out there and
there's so much misinformation and as
you say oh and people are writing and
writing and writing but the thing is
though the right coming once and it may
be wrong and they'll go back and fix it
but those eyeballs may not go back and
read the correct version right so a lot
of work information put out there and it
just becomes you know and that's why
it's so important for the company to get
ahead of it so quickly and and not waste
that opportunity to get in front of
their users not least this as a time to
then step forward and get their
statement out there quickly so the
misinformation stops market ven mockers
who is a former communication pro over
at outcast and now at Andreessen
Horowitz a partner over there has this
great line which she repeats it I don't
think she made it up it's when I was
talking her about that she said never
waste a crisis discuss that what is that
is that something you agree with and how
does a business like a path or Pinterest
which also had a flap this week or
Facebook or any of those guys how do
they not waste the attention that comes
from being in a crisis
well I'll jump in Pinterest is
absolutely wasting a crisis here because
they've just been absolutely silent and
this has been bringing with it in 10
words or less bring us up to speed on
well crisis which pinterest crisis I
mean there's there's the the affiliate
the affiliate links I so that's this
week's scandal and the latest one though
is is accusations of Facebook and email
spam um so the first one pinterest takes
links and and they've not as far as i
know pinterest has not come out and
publicly acknowledges in a new statement
but their partner skin links has said
yes we do this for Pinterest Pinterest
takes links and adds a bit of code so
that they get a cut a kickback from
amazon or other e-commerce sites
whenever someone clicks on a link and
buy some frickin serious business model
is is it's very common and I you know
everyone does I didn't think it was
shocking but they but a lot of people
what was shocking is that they did this
without telling anybody again it's the
under disclosure issue so going back to
the topic how is Pinterest wasting this
opportunity to communicate and and let
me tell you why actually this is more
sensitive than people understand
interest core community is design blogs
it's people in creative industries and a
lot of these people have their own blogs
where they are actually making money off
of affiliate links and that's big you
know that's you know not insignificant
revenue source for them okay so
Pinterest has co-opted them and said
this is actually a better place for you
to do this then your own blog but now
Pinterest is making money the way they
used to make money and no one's really
talked about that and it's it's you know
I I would be very disturbed if I
realized oh this is happening pinterest
has a great way you know you want to
talk about not wasting a crisis I
suggested this in my column pinterest
should say you know what we are cutting
in all of our pinners fifty percent on
affiliate fees anything off of your pins
you get fifty percent of the affiliate
money we make and their business would
explode and they they would get a lot of
goodwill well whether or not they can
do that I I certainly agree in that they
have wasted this opportunity to come out
to connect with their users and to offer
up a statement i mean we're an amazing
space right now where people can connect
where the users consumers feel this this
emotional connection to the companies
for which they are participating and
that's why everybody reacts his way they
do we didn't have the same thing with
you know with a car company or you know
any of the brick-and-mortar companies we
grew up with now we have a faith to CEOs
or we feel this connection we feel we
know Mark Zuckerberg we feel we know
Dave Morin we feel we know these people
and this gives them an opportunity to
connect and when you don't use that
opportunity you lose that connection
with your users that Ben Silbermann is
such a cipher frankly like he needs to
be out there much more and I you know my
senses he might be shy but that's you
know know if you shy in this business
you know can't be shy um finally I want
to ask you guys how many of our viewers
and listeners are starting their own
businesses how do you evaluate your
exposure your risk profile to a blow up
like this how do you know I mean path
should have known pinterest should have
known that they have this exposure how
do you audit your own exposure to this
well from a communication standpoint i
can say that sometimes you know their
communications people if it's a start-up
they may not even have internal people
they won't know so it's not like they're
even advising them to do or not to do I
hope that the companies out there learn
from these mistakes and realize that in
this day and age we have to be
transparent there's I mean something is
going to get uncovered whether it's a
rogue engineer that's like this is
 or whether something
accidentally gets out you just can't
play these tricks in these games I'm
sure you know there's a lot going on
that we don't know everywhere but a lot
of the dirty laundry has a way of
getting out there and you need to be
incredibly transparent these are little
things that may may soon get bigger and
you may think oh it's not a big deal
we're going to roll it out in a couple
weeks its timing is everything so you
have to address it be open be
transparent from the get-go own innate
no words I I think you have to pretend
that you are a you know
bloggers at Gawker or you know whichever
site is your worst nightmare and ask
yourself what would you write about this
company if you knew all of its secrets
and are that's a terrifying phone and
then plan accordingly Jesus I'm gonna
have nightmares at night now just on
that one cocker in my head yeah all
right well on that scary note oh and
