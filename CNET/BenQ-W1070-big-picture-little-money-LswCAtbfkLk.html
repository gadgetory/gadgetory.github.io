by the year but there is still something
about a home theater projector that
can't be beat especially if they comes
cheaply and as talented as this
projector hi I'm ty Pendlebury and this
is a review of the BenQ w 1070 projector
this is a DLP chip 3 model that is a
full high-definition and includes 3d for
a little over a thousand bucks true it
doesn't look like much with a white and
silver color scheme and boxy styling but
you're not going to be looking at it
much anyway it offers a number of
different inputs including two HDMI
ports and several legacy and log
connections as it turns out this is a
really good 3d projector with no
crosstalk and a great sense of depth but
the big problem is that the glasses
aren't included
in fact they're 99 dollars each if you
have to buy two sets of them then a
$1,400 projector like the Epson 3020
with its better design and deeper blacks
is looking more attractive
however the 2d quality of the bank U is
pretty good for while shadow detail is
lacking colors are very natural and well
saturated the only slight downside is
traces of rainbow effect or trailing
rainbows on moving edges which may spoil
this projector for people who are
susceptible to its effects it is subtle
though if you're looking to get into
home cinema and don't want to pay very
much then the banku offers a lot of bang
for the buck it's just the pity the
glasses are so expensive this has been
