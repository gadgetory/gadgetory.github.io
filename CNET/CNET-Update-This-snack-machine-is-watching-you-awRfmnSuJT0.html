body I'm percha carry this is your cnet
update as technology advances to make
our lives cooler it also gives retailers
new ways to gather data on us while we
shop every year in New York the National
Retail Federation puts on a big Expo
where we learn how stores are using new
technology and well just get ready to
have your body scanned and profiled in
seconds Microsoft technology is being
used inside this junk food vending
machine you've seen vending machines
before with interactive touch screens
but this one also comes with two cameras
on top a Kinect sensor and a webcam
which is used to scan your face now why
does the Machine want to scan me if I
just want some candy because companies
are hungry for data they can tell them a
woman in my 30s and what was on the
screen when I walked by and I stopped
and what time of day people buy certain
foods so the next time they can learn me
or someone like me and again with an
animation or game to play these many
machines with eyes are now in several
hundred universities and malls
exploiting your afternoon weakness for
sour patch kids and documenting your
poor eating habits if you want to find
the perfect shoe norstrom is coming out
with a foot scanner that uses Intel's
real sense technology to measure the
width and length of your feet and the
curve of your arch even while you're
wearing socks just roll up your pants
and it takes less than five seconds for
the cameras around the base to create a
3d rendering of your feet they can use
this info to help me find shoes that
could be better for my foot type and
also try and sell me some custom made
shoes Brooks Brothers only needs a few
seconds to scan your body with a tablet
to find you a shirt that's going to be a
perfect fit and you can keep your jacket
on in this demo and HP tablet used Intel
sensors and a 3d scanning app there is a
small margin of error but it is
something you could eventually do at
home while online shopping to know which
size is right for you Intel's retail
sensor platform is being tested in Levi
stores to track where customers are
walking through the store and also it
tracks which genes you're picking up
with the help of RFID chips in the tags
it tells the company what types of
products people approach and which are
being left behind in the dressing room
but who needs a retail store at all when
you can explore a shop and virtual
reality put on a VR headset and you can
visit the high-end shop in New York
called the apartment by the line the
digital creative agency SapientNitro
created this virtual experience where
you can explore the store checking out
items and even buy items by tapping on
the side of your headset imagine if a
website created their own fake VR shop
instead of a real store get ready for
the home virtual shopping network that's
it for this tech news update but there's
always more to sink your teeth into at
cnet com from our studios in New York
