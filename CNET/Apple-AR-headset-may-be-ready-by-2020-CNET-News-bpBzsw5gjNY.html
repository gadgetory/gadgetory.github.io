headset ready to show off in two years
the report comes from Bloomberg which
states that Apple is trying to get it
ready to ship to consumers by 2020 in
hopes of creating a breakthrough product
to succeed the iPhone many virtual
reality headsets today are powered by a
smartphone and use the smartphone as the
screen but Apple's reported device would
have its own screen and it would write
on a new chip and operating system
possibly called
our OS Bloomberg says Apple is currently
testing the technology using the HTC
vive VR system now VR is completely
immersive covering all your vision but
AR is a bit different it overlays
virtual images on top of the real world
so you could be walking around a room
and also see a computer image float in
front of you that's what Google glass
was trying to accomplish and it's also
the focus around microsoft's hololens
Apple has been pushing AR lately Apple's
AR kit allows software developers to
make AR apps for the iPhone and iPad
such as ways to see body parts in front

renders 3d graphics and has a battery
that can last the news comes just a

there has been a loss of interest in its
headset camera glasses the spectacles
snap said it had to eat 40 million
dollars worth of unsold spectacles face
technology is a hard business I'm
