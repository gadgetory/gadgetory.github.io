begun I'm Bridget Carey and this you're
seeing it update the Electronic
Entertainment Expo called III for short
has kicked off it's the big video game
conference of the year and you could say
this is the year of the second screen
both the Wii U and the xbox are showing
of ways to tie tablet screen interaction
with what's on the television creating a
richer game experience Nintendo started
by teasing a look into the updated
design of its next system the wii u the
gamepad now has joystick direction ups
and there's a near field communications
reader if you ever seen the Skylanders
toys this is going to awake in similar
opportunities for nintendo imagine being
able to interact with a toy in the real
world to activate something in the game
world the gamepad will also be a TV
remote control and you can share photos
and content from the gamepad to the TV
screen the gamepad will also be a
portable system for casual games that
don't need a full TV to play and it's
good for just recording a quick way in
on the wii fit but the big focus around
the wii u is that it's more social
players will be more interactive as part
of the miiverse you can see what your
friends are saying and also come across
what players are saying in games that
you don't own you can ask questions for
help with defeating a boss or share your
love about a game in a text chat and you
can even write and draw a comment
instead of just typing a Nintendo is
also showing that it's targeting more
serious gamers as well with a new
controller the Wii U pro controller
notice there's no screen on it it looks
kind of like an Xbox controller we
should be getting a look at gameplay
examples at nintendo's press conference
on Tuesday Microsoft unleash this
concept in full force with a feature it
calls smart glass using at a blur foam
design your own play in Madden by
drawing it on the screen and then it's
sent to the xbox or if you're on HBO GO
watching say Game of Thrones the tablet
will show extra info about the show like
a map of where the scene is taking place
SmartGlass will also let you start
watching a video through the xbox and
take it with you on a mobile device
remembering where you left off these
features will launch sometime this fall
of course many new games
like halo for a new tomb raider and a
southpark game but they also showed off
new features for the kinect motion
sensor there will be a workout program
with Nike and the next madden game will
let you use voice commands to call plays
or snap the ball connect also turns your
TV into a smart TV you can use voice
commands to browse the web microsoft is
really throwing down with apple here now
the big question is if Apple can create
a television product that can compete
