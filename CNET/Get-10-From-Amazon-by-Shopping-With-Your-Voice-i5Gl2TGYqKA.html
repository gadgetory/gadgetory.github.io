you shop with your voice the online
retailer hopes to get more people to
shop with their voice by offering deals
that you can only get by talking to
Amazon's smart assistant through a
device like the echo smart speakers or
the fire TV or Fire tablet the first
time you buy something with your voice
Amazon will give you an extra $10 off to
get the SPECIAL Prime deals though you
need to be a prime member that normally
cost $100 a year for the bundle of perks
but if you don't have Prime and use your
voice to sign up Amazon will give you
$20 off the annual fee there are more
than 100 items now on sale through Alexa
just ask the assistant
what are your deals the sales keep
changing but Amazon announced a few will
include $50 off a bose speakerr $7 off
oh we most SmartPlug 50% off cheesy
popcorn and other random gems like 30%
off the squatty potty prime day for
Amazon is sort of like Black Friday but
it's in the middle of the year for those
that rather still shop by screen like
barbarians you'll have to wait until
next week on Monday afternoon and the
sale lasts all day Tuesday July 11th but
these voice deals go on longer through
July 17th there's often lots of weird
stuff on sale squatty potty's being one
such product so to avoid the nonsense
you may want to use the Amazon app to
plan ahead otherwise enjoy your 12 pack
of gummy bears and duckworth the dog
squeaker toys I'm Bridget Carey you can
