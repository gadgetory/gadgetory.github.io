whiplash it's actually called the neck
strain or a neck sprain but it's one of
the best known of the auto injuries
often one of the most fraudulently
claimed but it's a big business 8.8
billion dollars in insurance claims a
year that's nearly as big a business as
the NFL now the most obvious technology
to prevent whiplash is the headrest but
my Cougars are 67 it doesn't have
headrests by 68 they were getting
popular as an option by 69 required on
new cars in the US what we're looking
for our head restraints that catch the
head quickly what we don't want is for
the head to lag behind the body so that
the neck has to do all the work of
pulling the head along your neck wasn't
built to do that and that's how whiplash
injury can occur
but headrests are pretty crude
protection they basically stop you from
going this way they do nothing for the
forward motion or the side-to-side there
is some racing technology that does a
lot better job things like the hands
technology the head and neck support
that gets you from the back it tethers
the helmet as well tries to immobilize
the head and neck a little more after a
couple of very recent very high-profile
deaths on the track Simpson also has one
called a hybrid that does a
triangulation of tethers to even further
limit movement in various directions but
none of this is coming to production
cars obviously now lateral motion in our
cars on the road is addressed a little
bit by things like center airbags now
from General Motors that are in a few
cars and the side curtain airbags and
fill up that space and can stop your
head from some lateral movement they
help a little they're really about head
impact now of course the airbag that's
right in front of you does a lot to
limit that forward movement but again
it's largely an impact device more than
a neck device put your head and neck are
out there fairly exposed that's why it's
good to know about the headrest
restraint ratings on your car a lot of
folks don't know about these but the IHS
also rates those among their accident
safety ratings go to the IHS rankings
for a car you're considering dig down a
little bit low on the page you'll find
head restraint ratings they are not all
created equal
now most of us are not buying a new car
anytime soon so you're stuck with the
one you've got here's what you can do it
pays to double check how you've got your
headrest adjusted if you have them
anyway first of all the top of the
headrest should meet the top of your
head you're tall like me that's never
gonna happen so get it as far up as you
can second you want the front of the
headrest to be meeting the back of your
head with as little space or none as
possible a lot of cars have a movement
or an adjustment there that'll move the
headrest after four or just tilt the
whole thing roll it forward figure out
how yours works I bet you've never
adjusted it on those criteria remember
it's called a headrest that's not what
it's for it's a neck restraint so make
sure you got it set up right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
