get with your iPad keyboard case I mean
that because the logitech fabric skin
keyboard folio suggests that the ability
to have a water-repellent keyboard case
is a good thing I don't spend a lot of
time with beverages around what I'm
typing I like to keep that stuff
separate but if you do happen to be in a
situation where you feel like you're at
a coffee shop or you might spill stuff
on your iPad well then perhaps that will
add to the value proposition here but
the fabric skin and keyboard folio is
expensive it's $150 $150 for this
admittedly attractive keyboard case it
comes in a variety of bright colors it
is a selection of fabrics on the back
and a soft microfiber II like covering
on the keyboard in the front which again
is totally sealed so in case you happen
to spill sign you could just wipe it
right up and we didn't do a lot of fluid
testing here but the advantages here go
beyond that you also have a magnetic
auto connection with the side here that
snaps into place and also automatically
turns on the keyboard the keyboard feels
great although like recent Logitech
keyboards some of the keys are
compressed if you're a keyboard nerd or
you really pay attention to this stuff
you can see that the caps lock and a key
are combined the shift keys compress the
tab and q are combined it's not a big
deal in fact when you start typing fast
on this after a while it's fine it's not
as compressed as iPad Mini keyboards are
it does feel like a tank and it feels
comfortable and heavy and you're looking
at 2.7 pounds with this combined which
is like the weight of a MacBook Air or
Ultrabook practically so that's the
problem you're carrying around a laptop
weight thing I'd still prefer something
slimmer maybe like the Logitech
ultrathin keyboard cover but if you're
looking for one of the most durable
all-around protective and liquid
repellent keyboard gazes then the fabric
skin keyboard folio could be worth it if
you want to show it 100
two dollars I'm Scott Steinem ETSU quick
look at the bad foreskin keyboard folio</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
