cutting-edge and craziest tech but
sometimes these wild products never
actually see the light of day here's an
update on where our picks of CES 2018
are now let's start with the Sony AIBO
the adorable robot dog companion melted
plenty of Hearts but when it went on
sale in the u.s. in September 2018 it
also melted a lot of wallets it costs an
eye-watering $2,900 and while it won't
make you a cup of coffee or play your
favorite songs like other voice
assistants it will keep your company and
generate a lot of virtual pee one of the
most practical discoveries the neo mano
glove
it's a wearable robot that restores
strength in the hands of people who are
affected by a range of medical
conditions the glove successfully
completed its crowdfunding campaign at
the end of 2018 with an estimated
delivery date of June 2019 for the first
backers LG displays rollable 65 inch
OLED TV was one of the biggest
showstoppers at CES but this is a
prototype rather than something that's
ready to buy for our living rooms we
haven't heard anything yet on when we
might expect this to become an actual
product we can buy but don't be
surprised if you see it again at CES
2019 as the foldable rollable and
bendable screen space heats up something
you can actually put in your home right
now is the whirlpool Wi-Fi microwave you
can scan barcodes on frozen foods to get
the right settings or use a lexer or the
Google assistant to preheat the oven but
at six hundred and forty dollars it's
ten times more expensive than the
amazonbasics microwave that came out in
September which also has Alexa the bitin
electric SUV was another highlight but
it was just a concept at the time now
called the mbyte it's currently being
road tested and it should reach
production in China later in 2019 the
production model will be available in a
rear-wheel or four-wheel drive model
Viton says it will be available in the
US and 2020 with prices starting at
$45,000 our final update on the
products from CES 2018 is the Razr
project blender it's a laptop with a
space for a smartphone to slot right in
underneath a keyboard the idea is the
laptop runs Android from the phone so
you have a physical keyboard and larger
screen but since CES we haven't heard
anything more on whether or not this is
going to become a real product so we're
not holding our breath for more news
about CES 2019 stay tuned to see Netcom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
