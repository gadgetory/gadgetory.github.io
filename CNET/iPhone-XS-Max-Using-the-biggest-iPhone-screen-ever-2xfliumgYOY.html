iPhone 10's max you've heard this
proposition before four years ago when
Apple debuted the iPhone 6 plus there
was a larger phone with a few more
features and a higher price I also have
with the 6s plus and the 7 plus and the
8 plus math 110 came out last year
now there's 6.5 inch iPhone 10's Macs
now the difference between the 10s and
the 10s max is nothing in terms of
features but there's difference in terms
of display here getting 6.5 inches and
it's basically the same size physically
as the iPhone 8 plus now does that make
a difference am i living a tablet life
what does it feel like to have a phone
that's larger again and also more
expensive this thing is $10.99 going up
to 14 49 well I've been living with it
and here's what it's like to be back in
the big phone life the iPhone 10's max
is bigger but it doesn't have anything
new in terms of features in fact it has
the same processor in the same cameras
as the iPhone 10s so what you're looking
at is really just about screen size it's
kind of like the iPad pro models between
the 10.5 inch and the 12 point 9 inch
you're going from a 5.8 inch iPhone to a
6.5 inch iPhone and it's all about the
screen and the extra pixels and battery
life this was supposed to get an hour
more battery life that's not a huge
amount but it's something the 10s max is
expensive starting at 10 99 going up to
14 49 after-tax you'll be well into nice
laptop range it's also harder to one
hand hold and I've come to love the
smaller tens perfect size of screen
balance so why would you need a bigger
screen on the max I mean there was
always the plus before now the iPhone 10
basically has a screen size that's
around the size of what the plus used to
be so it already feels pretty large the
max is better I think for watching
movies which always feel a little too
letterboxed on the 10 also for playing
games maybe if you want something like a
Kindle something you can web browse and
use like a tablet you're paying $100 for
the upgrade to the larger screen which
isn't terrible but it also changes the
size of the phone obviously it's not bad
it's manageable but I think that the 10
really covers a lot more bases in a
smaller form
the biggest reason to go max might be
the fact that it supports splitview apps
now apps that do that very not all of
them take advantage of this but when it
happens it's really nice and it feels a
little more like an iPad and there are
some websites that already are taking
advantage of it like the New York Times
or when you turn into landscape mode the
max will allow you to see something that
looks a lot more like a computer web
browser experience versus a mobile I
always like a lot of battery life in a
phone and I haven't found a point where
it's exceeded my expectations the 10s
max is supposed to last an hour longer
than the 10s about an hour and a half
longer than last year's 10 now we ran a
half of something but it's not something
that's gonna be leaps and bounds beyond
anything else and the 10r which is
coming out in October might even have
better battery life according to Apple's
claims so far using the iPhone 10's max
heavily over the course of the day it's
lasted but I've definitely found a need
to recharge by midday which is something
that I always find using iPhones but I'm
a pretty heavy user or do you want to
wait for the 10r
in October Apple is coming out with the
iPhone 10 R which is going to be a
pretty large 6.1 inch phone that's gonna
cost less than Apple 10 and the 10s max
now it's gonna have a display that's a
little lower resolution but still if you
want something that feels bigger and you
want to be able to watch movies and read
books on it maybe that's your best bet
we haven't reviewed that one yet so stay
tuned but if you really want to buy the
biggest best iPhone no matter what the
price go ahead and get the 10s max but
don't say I didn't tell you to wait
