a lower-end washer to something that's
slightly nicer but don't want to go
crazy spending 1,500 bucks or more this
$900 front load GE washer could be the
right model for you first of all it has
a few more features than your base level
six or $700 unit it has a steam function
and we've seen some GE washers that have
really fiddly frustrating confusing
interfaces this is similar but it's
slightly more streamlined so it isn't
nearly as difficult to use which I love
it also has a 4.3 cubic foot capacity
which is competitive with other models
in this price range and its performance
was actually really quite good it wasn't
as good as the models that are over a
thousand bucks but it was still really
good at removing all of the stains from
our stain strips which include sebum or
skin oil carbon which is like mineral
oil and ash blood wine and cocoa which
is like milk and chocolate mixed
together so if you're in the market for
a simple model that's a little bit
better than entry-level I would
definitely recommend this simple GE
