solution and looking at it you might be
like oh it's just another holder
something that's been available for
years but while it does hold six hero4
black cameras for capturing immersive
360 video it's how it does it that's
important using the connector at the
back of each camera the aluminum rig
actually synchronizes the cameras so
they operate as one turn on the master
camera and the remaining five come to
life press the record and all of them
start recording and if there's a problem
with one camera it will let you know
which one and won't start recording
until it's fixed the cameras can be
powered off their batteries or there's
an external power supply that will run
them for up to three hours all the clips
get stored to micro SD cards in the
cameras which would be a potential
nightmare if the cards got mixed up but
Omni tags each file with its position in
the rig so when you offload your content
using the Omni importer the order is
managed for you the importer gives you a
preview and calibrated stitching but for
editing GoPro includes color auto panel
video editing software in the package
there are plugins for Adobe Premiere too
including one that lets you create a
regular 2d movie out of a 360 clip GoPro
has a free player too with oculus
support so basically for the five
thousand dollar all-inclusive package
you're getting everything you need to
shoot edit view and share immersive
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
