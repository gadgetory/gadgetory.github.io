google issues for everything google that
we can pack inside of a show now we're
back after the long holiday and CES
break and there's plenty to catch you up
on but let's talk the latest in google's
world or you know i guess we might be
able to start saying universe that's
because TechCrunch confirms that google
and fidelity have invested 1 billion
dollars in elon musk's spacex now musk
was one of paypals co-founders and the
current CEO of Tesla Motors and the
investment in space X would be strategic
for both companies you see both Google
and SpaceX are looking to blanket the
world with an internet connection and
that's also big business SpaceX is
exploring new ways to get people
connected by using satellites to beam
low-cost internet around the world their
big pie in the sky goal is to one day
establish a city on Mars you know like
Total Recall but in real life we've
shown you Google's Project loon several
times which is their network of balloons
designed to deliver internet service in
hard-to-reach areas of the world since
two thirds of the world still has no
access at all now musk believes it will
take at least five years and ten billion
dollars to build the satellite network
but these are big idea goals these two
giants will be working on together
moving forward all right now in some
Google News to catch you up on that you
might have missed Google's glass
Explorer program has officially ended
and the glass team along with chief Ivy
Ross will be officially moving from the
experimental google x group to its own
standalone unit under the leadership of
tony fadell the head of nest labs who
will now oversee the direction and
strategy of glass moving forward
according to The Wall Street Journal now
instead of offering public tests of
prototypes and improvements over time
the development will happen in secret
much like Apple and nest have done and
you guys have to remember Fidel is a
former apple employee known as the
father of the ipod google says the new
and final version of glass will be
released sometime this year when it's
ready to go it won't be sold to early
testers and it will be cheaper with a
longer battery life improved sound
quality and Abed
display google plants also tackle its
privacy concerns and its biggest thing
at social stigma by combining it with
more familiar types of eyewear and the
second developer conference for google's
project ara wrapped up last week and
they showed off the second iteration of
their modular phone called spiral to the
conference revealed the hardware for the
prototype is complete but the firmware
still needs work now the reference
device will come with a 1280 x 720
display a Wi-Fi and bluetooth module a 5
megapixel camera module 3G cellular
module a two-by-two battery module and
the option of either going with a Tegra
k1 or a marvel PXA 1928 processor module
again these things can all be swapped
out with the goal being for the consumer
to build the phone they want based on
their needs now spiral 3 will launch
sometime in the second quarter of this
year it will bring the next batch of
improvements across the board for
hardware and software and google
announced that they plan to launch the
device in Puerto Rico for its first
market pilot with the hopes of them
moving to an official launch after
gathering the information they need ok
more samsung galaxy s6 rumors you know
they keep floating around the latest
from the highly credible Sam mobile
reports that the next gen s6 will have a
touched base fingerprint scanner for
improved usage instead of their current
swipe based fingerprint scanners that
were very inconsistent and frustrating
at times no new software features with
the scanner have been planned but it
will function like Apple's touch ID and
it will also be able to detect a user's
fingerprint at different angles now we
also continue to hear about how Samsung
is ditching their current galaxy plastic
body to a design that will be an
all-metal one but a new report from
Korea which you can choose to believe or
not now claims that Samsung is looking
to make the Essex all out of glass on
the front and back side with metal sides
or a rim similar to you know another
phone you might have heard called the
iphone now they also say the Korean
giant will be ditching the user
removable battery one of its staples in
favor of a smoother more consistent
design so we'll see what happens this
could all be a bogus fantasy and we
expect to hear a whole lot more at
Mobile World Congress in March all right
that's going to do for this we show
we're back to
regular weekly schedule and it's great
to see you all in 2015 you can always
email us at Google issues at cnet com or
tweet me up Brian Tom thanks so much
watching we'll see you all next time for
some more of that Google Isha's you
