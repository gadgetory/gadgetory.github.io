2012 thank you tune in to the 404 show
on Sina TV and live stream um Jeff
Bakalar I'm Justin you now Mario nu√±ez
is a show or we spoke in class today
that is correct Arielle the the lyric
from one of the most famous songs of our
generation Justin that's not including
Justin sprayer you're not part of this
magical generation they were thinking
about why do you say that I don't know
you're not a big Pearl Jam fan no yeah
are you but listen but this is a cool
piece of trivia chair right to august
first 1992 today is the 20th anniversary
of that song hitting MTV isn't that
crazy mm-hmm hitting the mtv video waves
yeah i mean i did like the song cuz i'm
not a fan of singers speaking out of the
side of their mouths but that being said
I still remember the music video really
clearly I mean classic video really
terrifying actually I mean it's a
classic video I've seen the uncut
version where you actually show it's
like a clear shot of him putting the gun
in his mouth we're talking to me music
video yeah I think I have yeah there's
like an explicit version yeah uh if we
have a bit of a that song right now for
everyone to enjoy you believe this
song's 20 years old and it's crazy
your single answer what see you sing the
other decided to do it I'm not gonna do
I want to see you do it me yeah wait to
the course all right I want oh it's the
same boy that I always do for every so
does that era Dave Matthews sublime here
we go remains ball girl girl right yeah
it's you're gonna like not move your
mouth it's jeremy spoke in class today
right but it dealt with a really serious
subject matter right like we said and it
just blows me I mean forget that that's
kind of depressing but its twenty years
ago today yeah I really vividly remember
this song being in heavy rotation on MTV
for those younger listeners uh basically
things called music videos we're a band
would actually film a little movie that
would go along with the song that they
made this was really popular and a lot
of movie directors that exist now got
their start making these little films
yeah and for our view is that a little
bit older MTV actually used to air the
entire music video music videos to be
what two two and a half minutes well I'd
like the solar the entire link yet song
yeah they weren't just 30 seconds of the
band playing live no it's um you know I
I mean I I really do enjoy the music
video I think that's like a totally lost
art for sure there's something about
watching you know the band's
interpretation of the song because you
form your own opinions when you would
hear song right now you be like oh I
wonder what they're going through but it
wasn't until you actually saw the music
video that you maybe had more definitive
insight as to what the band was trying
to get across right but it is true charm
doesn't believe us it is true from 19 8
when did MTV start 80 81 82 something
like that up until his recent as 2,000 I
think the channel was in fact playing
music videos God the year 2000 was 12
years ago just like they messed up right
that is crazy just like the history
channel used to put used to have content
about world history right and not like
aliens and stuff like in like
winning World War 2 or something like
that MTV itself actually used to play
music videos it was a weird times weird
time when channels did what they said
they would do you know what's my
favorite music video of all time is uh
Everlong by the foo fighters ha that was
a Michelle gondry right uh music video
yeah do you remember that one then it's
big Henry has a big hands as a whole
fantasy dream sequence with red riding
hood and like all these different fables
coming together in one music video yeah
and at the end like they came up through
the dream and then started playing the
instruments live in bed so cool is class
um I'm a huge fan of that music video if
you go back and you watch the old
Aerosmith videos with alicia silverstone
mmm that's where she got her start right
yeah just looking sexy in those music
videos yeah crying trying amazing all
those logs ended in n ' right back in
the day but uh that's a great video boo
jenkins in the chatroom black hole Sun
oh yeah by soundgarden but of course we
cannot overlook my personal favorite
music video ever made what is it Justin
yeah let me just read your mom I
definitely have been vocal about this I
vocalized my pick for the best music
video ever made I don't know you don't
remember no I don't remember what is it
um it's closer by nine inch nails oh
that is my fav you seen that re abusing
that bad as a twisted but is a great
great music video for sure what about
you what's your favorite music I just
said it's got to be the ever oh that's
right I'm sorry and URL do you have one
um I'm sure have one but you donate but
you can already so my video you know the
like the worst one is I think what's at
California it was like by Tupac and dr.
what's in it when you're dreamin is that
what it was analysis California was calf
we love love treeman that's like beach
boys yeah that like it's like a
post-apocalyptic California in like the
desert or something and everyone's like
in my cage matches or something like
that yeah the worst music
in the history and i only had
million-dollar budgets from yeah for
sure they just blew it all like looking
like a burning man recreation something
when out when I was in high school I had
this teacher who gave us a presentation
about malnutrition in sub-saharan Africa
what yeah and he had a mixed CD that he
was playing of like really emotional
songs I went along with the slideshow of
what we were talking about so they were
talking you know they were showing uh
young African kids with distended
bellies you know from malnutrition and I
guess a song accidentally got put on to
that mixtape because at the end of it
all of a sudden it kind of paused for a
second still showing those images on the
screen and all you here with oh my god i
dying go steady go no it's not good at
California hey oh you can easily hate it
yeah you know it's not a good stone like
everything about like the digitizer
voice it just makes me feel gross yup
company whenever I'm in a club and the
DJ like throws that on I I immediately
like I probably yeah get out of it
that's not that's a bad song yeah too
bad look for those guys does not hold up
yeah no you're right there's a lot of
songs that don't hold up including men
Oh mmm-mmm-mmm song they're all there
they're like very uh timely you know
what I mean when when the real Slim
Shady song came out it was all about
like mid-2000 pop culture and now it's
totally irrelevant you know it's like
Britney Spears has her craft together
again right so it's not cool to make fun
of her anymore it's it just seems out of
place he should have had the foresight
yeah right um all right we got a great
show today we've got a few stories we're
going to get to in just a bit a few
emails and possibly a calls from the
public twenty years ago man that is
crazy I just can't get over how all the
video is um there's a crazy this is
crazy website that we can thank our own
gems Peterson for linking
us too it is a series of photographs of
how divers look mid-jump do yourself a
favor a head on over to the fw calm is
not pulling up for you there oh maybe
you're not running our special program
let's see are you yeah looks like it's
running on it's not showing up there for
you guys let me reload this really quick
I was had all day weekend my firewall
has blocked access to these would fit
back there and you know l song really
sucks is a that gangsters paradise whoa
cool yeah and that was a huge hit and
even back then I didn't understand it I
hate how did that go didn't spend and no
it's good the new dal version is better
oh yeah the Amish birthday that's a
better song from start to finish who
gave coolio a microphone was like you're
famous now you know what killed that
song is karaoke I feel like every idiot
things that they can do that karaoke
it's pretty weak oh ok so here we go
back to the Olympic divers is borderline
NSFW it's amazing look at these dudes
and ladies these images are flipped
upside down on the right mate well yeah
or it's when they're flipping yeah um so
obviously you know I'm blown away by not
taking anything away from the athletic
skill of these people if you scroll down
there's a few that are just ridiculous
the third one in Oh keep going thank you
this one I don't even understand like I
don't know either way these people are
insane athletes yeah ah but the faces
they make mid plunge are just priceless
yeah there we go this guy and and then
someone so you know obviously what the
internet did with this the next logical
evolution of these photographs would be
to put these people on toilets yeah and
they actually did do that as well and
that's on that's on red
everyone in it look at this guy these
look so pain they they look like they're
about to die yeah it that this is that's
a good one this is that don't worry just
relax it'll come it'll come out a lot of
them look like Oh faces yeah yeah
there's there you go now now of course
like we said here all these people Thank
You internet like I said that's the next
logical evolution but thanks to james
peterson our own james person but nose
up in the rundown appreciated i'm jim
nasa's in the news they're making
headlines they are going to broadcast
the Mars uh rover mission as it land as
the the rover lands on Mars they're
going to broadcast this in Times Square
on the toshiba vision screen it'll be
the largest East Coast location for the
public to see the live mission coverage
of curiosity that is the planetary rover
that is scheduled to land on the Martian
service service surface august six at
one thirty in the morning with so uh
yeah that's local Martian time how are
people gonna be able to hear what's
going on here's what I couns like when I
listening to hear like Martian you know
chatter yeah I'm gonna be anything well
no there's gonna be coverage of it and
right pal subhajit to a radio station
yeah thing so that's pretty cool um yeah
we keep going back to Mars you know why
not I don't know but then go see the
enterprise landing at the gym nod I
didn't do that did you I did you did
yeah it was really cool are you
impressed by that um no I mean I was
impressed by it obviously but was weird
is that there are a bunch of costume
superheroes walking your oh that's
that's appropriate yeah it was really
bizarre but if you can go check out the
intrepid museum in new york you should
so it's pretty cool to see all those jet
fighters and stuff ya know it's a sight
to be seen absolutely there's really no
other excuse to go to Times Square
rather than to see this is Mars landing
right yeah I mean it's one of those
places where tourists can't get enough
of it and locals just want it eliminated
yes arguably the worst place not just in
Manhattan but on I'm gonna I want to say
on earth yeah that's how bad it is if I
have a meeting I go to the MTV building
a lot because EA
office is there right 15 15 I dread it
man it's like you have to give to
prepare for 40 minutes before you get
there sometimes it's appropriate there
like a last time i was there was for uh
the day that obama got elected four
years ago okay and right after it
happened me my friend spiked up to Times
Square and people were just like I've
never high-fives and hugs so many people
that I didn't know right ever it was
really cool then we're all watching it
on that big screen in Times Square yeah
and you could hear like the news
broadcast through the radio station
speakers coming out of like cat taxicabs
and stuff sure really awesome I mean
I've seen one too many disaster movies
that's the last place you want to be
yeah yeah that's right the fireballs
that's where the asteroid will hit that
is ground zero for all that stuff yeah
so stay away um and if you are visiting
don't leave the area because I don't
want I don't you know you don't wander
out of that um this is uh this is an
interesting story about the FCC's ruling
against verizon uh everyone knows that
tethering apps are very popular but
verizon has basically not allowed that
technology to be used on their phones
because they don't want people hogging
up all the bandwidth tethering apps
allow you to make your phone like a
mobile hotspot you can use your your 4G
connection with your iPad or with your
laptop or any device that can sense
Wi-Fi right uh the FCC has come down and
said look you guys can no longer charge
extra for tethering on a non unlimited
data plan so I mean I guess they're
really saying that you know it's just
something you really should not be able
to block and there are providers and I
do believe that Verizon can't physically
block all of these things someone was
telling me that there is an app that
sort of circumvented that entire
blocking process either way the FCC does
concede the fact that Verizon can charge
can in fact charge 20 hours per month
for customers who retain that
grandfathered unlimited data plan but
for the rest of the people with concrete
data limits you you're not going to get
away with blocking their their tethering
apps right so I don't have you ever used
something like that they don't allow
that on on a knife you're not anyways
all right then I totally would yeah is
is it be grandfathered in though
yeah I'm not on a UH I'm not on an
unlimited plan and so I wouldn't be able
to take advantage of this if you have a
data limit anyway there's only so much
that you can tether and serve at the
same time before you not be surprised
really yeah I mean do something you do
on your phone no like I have a four
gigabyte streaming limit that's a lot of
that's a lot of data for just streaming
you know what I mean I'm you're not
downloading like HD video you know you
might be streaming video that's pretty
has a high bitrate but you're not going
to really unless you're just doing
non-stop you know you're not going to
really come close to that right now when
is this gonna affect all the other
networks like I mean I understand
surprising right now but what about 18
ter like I don't know double it doesn't
say apparently it won't apply to the
other ones because the ruling is based
on a different spectrum that only
verizon occupies I don't know that I'm a
doctor you know that means call a doctor
I've known i think it's just like the
the range spectrum mmm you know every
provider may be like occupy certain
ranges of spec this is all literally can
you hear coming out of my head and uh
yeah so apparently it will only affect
verizon because they use and this is a
quote from what we have here in front of
us apparently they only use the upper
700 megahertz c-block open access /
vision right yeah of course yeah of
course so uh that's the ruling they're
all right surf away then yeah I mean
that I you know FCC finally going to bat
for the good guys yeah I like that I do
like that uh what else man this is
something I'm really excited about and I
didn't realize that you guys both hated
this series growing up but uh he man
masters of the universe and right now
we're talking about the movie and not
the cartoon the movie is getting a
reboot which I'm really excited about
because this is one of my favorite
movies from when I was growing up this
is like the dolph lundgren classic
live-action version 1987 yeah did you
watch the movie with Frank Langella as I
can't say that I saw I can't I don't
remember I probably would recognize it
if I saw it yeah
but I don't I can't recall it ever I
mean there are a lot of big-name actors
oh it sounds terrible just sound corny
cog is it only boxes in ya corny Cox
plays the love interest okay um but yet
you know interesting enough is one of
the first movies where you now nowadays
every Marvel movie has an end scene
after the credits right that kind of
give a preview of the next one yeah
masters of the universe was one of the
first uh like to be R movies to do this
like if you watch at the after the
credits uh the villain comes up Skeletor
and he pray anyway he didn't say that he
goes that he comes up and says like I'll
be back in there very terminator a
square right so like you know this has
been a long time coming spent like 30
years so apparently um the guy from GI
Joe to director John shoe I think he
also did uh I'd aunt those dance movies
yeah this guy's got a great resume yeah
let's go through these films shall we
step up to step up do is great I'm sure
it was you big weirdo 3d was great too
oh great I'm you saw step up 3d I saw
all of them and you haven't seen any of
em I get into that that's for another
time another place step up to step up 3d
yeah but hold the FN phone here my boy
Jon Chu also was behind the camera for
the Justin Bieber documentary I'll never
say never you saw that too also sauna
slap you need a 3d teared up low so this
guy's like what 047 yeah let's let him
direct the Masters of the Universe movie
because I think they're just one what I
mean we'll explain this what I'd rather
Mick G direct then and this guy what's
that would come on it's not going to be
a sequel to the original movie no no um
yeah this is just going to be a real
revision of the you of the original
story which apparently was based on the
the toys remember we talked about that
with batman forever how hasbro option
the first the third movie sure in a
batman forever series yeah this is the
same thing so back in the 80s it was
mattel i believe that did the first
he-man toys and they base the movie look
off those toys which is why everyone
liked it so much probably why i like
that i had all of those toys yeah that
makes sense to me make sense you are
and he prized and I mean you know what
maybe that video is the reason the guy
who's directing all those dance movie
directing his message the University of
movie right I hope there's a head nod to
that in the movie I just they really all
of a sudden the all that would be the
perfect end of credits gag reel video
right he man Skeletor maybe doing like a
little synchronized soref dance yeah
four Non Blondes share right you don't
really what's going on about he-man that
he was not only underwear outside of his
pants which all superheroes do but his
underwears furry did you ever notice
that it is very like check it out he's
got furry underwear he made magic boots
too is pretty stylish is it me or is the
logo on his chest not cool is that you
mean what it's like that independent
logo all right as like a borderline
white supremacist like an Iron Cross
yeah he's yeah I think he's part of the
Aryan red hands a freakin bigot yeah
look at this guy what do you need that
sword for he's like well I have a sword
and just to be safe a huge ass on the
back of my body do to keep minorities at
bay yeah having or bending them from
crossing the border line he's a minute
man this guy screw he-man his stupid
outfit I'm sorry dude I don't like
he-man unlike Superman yeah what is what
is he man's deal what do you mean like
why do you like him so much he's an
alien and he had a cool sword he man's
an alien yeah there we go cat what I
don't like aliens that look like humans
that's when I like Superman what
Superman's an alien he's the last Son of
Krypton right it looks like you and me
what is that as make any sense yeah
right at least have like eyes separate
you know you know I'm saying yeah I
guess so it looks exactly like all of us
right I get that doesn't make sense
there are other you want to like look
like et or like some no i'm not saying
like the cliched alien yeah but maybe a
little different i don't want to look
like Cloverfield either but I'm just
saying you know all right I'll tell my
boy John shoe then that is your buddy
I'll tweet him you'll tweet him out uh
yeah so Ariane exciting of sci-fi movies
are you excited to see the new Total
Recall no no I've been
a lot of the advertisers for the triple
boob girl around the city whatever
you've seen those right like a bus cops
and stuff I'm looking for I want to see
it yeah call I like Colin Farrell yeah I
do I think he's attractive and he's a
good actor reverse that and I just think
it's I think it's like a really cool
sort of uh you know futuristic movie you
know like no one I I haven't been
impressed with the way films have
depicted the future recently you mean
like it's not dystopian enough for your
taste no no I just I just think some I
always go back to the fifth element
because i love how they sort of looked
you know all those hundred years into
the future total recal kind of has that
vibe to it too I didn't realize it was
the story was written by philip k dick
yeah did you know that the original
short story yeah that taught the
original Total Recall was oh ok i
thought this was saying that he wrote
the screenplay well no he's been dead
for very long yeah but he but he's
behind Minority Report as well mr. mr.
dick have you read any no highly
recommended yeah highly recommended ok
um alright let's let's move along before
we get to emails and voicemails we have
another story hitting the rundown uh dig
is back in the news remember dig d igg
recall ever happen to that well dig has
relaunched and they're concentrating on
nothing that they used to be
concentrating on the new front page of
digg is actually now a curated almost
like a newspaper and it's kind of like
Flipboard where Flipboard presents sort
of it's not showing up as now it's down
for me too we'll just tell you what it
looks like um it's basically a way that
story stories get to this front page
they are curated by some sort of
editorial overseeing I hmm but at the
same time these stories do get voted up
so there's this sort of hybrid it's not
all up to the users anymore it's sort of
like this give-and-take between editors
and people submitting the stories right
and they also take other social network
linkage to consideration too so I guess
it'll have like a score that's a
comprised of three different numbers
which will be like the number of
exit gets on the actual home page how
many Facebook likes and shares it has
yeah and then how many times people have
tweeted out the story and all those
three things are tallied together to
give an overall score I kind of like
that it's not a bad idea but for better
or worse I mean just recall some of the
things that wind up trending on Twitter
yeah you know what I mean that's not
really news you know what I mean I
member at the end of digs previous life
cycle like it was filled with all the
top dig stories were like 50 crazy
images from like Mars surface landings
are like it was like you'll never
believe this photo shopping right so it
start to become junk yeah I mean and
that's why everyone went to read it f I
was just going to say reddit reddit has
turned into what digg used to have and
I'm sure there's a lot of people be like
oh well rid it was around first or
whatever it was I don't I don't know who
is first yeah but uh there's no denying
that a lot of people jumped ship on digg
and went over to read it and read it for
the most part has gone on changed for
all these years and so you can attribute
some of their success to that they keep
it real but um I think look if it was
either dig which is going to go away or
they were going to reboot again and this
new iteration I kind of dig it I don't
know it go in there every day but it'll
be uh definitely interesting to see
where they go from here kind of weird
though because i remember i had an old
dig log in now if you want to sign up
for the site again you gotta do so with
your facebook yeah which I don't know I
is it just me or do I never want it I do
you never want to use a service online
that requires you to enter your facebook
password I just I'm totally read as into
that that's a big turnoff way whenever I
see that at the bottom like a comments
thing I'm very hesitant to do it and I'm
kinda sure I've never done it yet and
then every time you want to dig
something too it'll yet to ballgame yes
but I don't know about guys are all
right let's get to some emails from the
public are rich from Cleveland writes in
and says hello gentlemen as uh you two
both have ink how do you determine what
you want to get tattooed he's got no
problem with the idea of getting a
tattoo but he has a feeling that he
would hate the one he chooses in like
two years I think back about what i
would have liked when i was 18 or even
25 and now i cringe
the choices that I would have made how
did the process go for us uh in getting
and and what did you know work for us I
think uh you and I both did it right and
we waited until later on in life you
actually decide what sure tattoos were
and rich from clearly makes a good point
I mean I'm were in high school one like
band tattoos which is always I think a
bad idea unless you're in the band
unless you even if you're in the band
like I would do I don't know that's a
good idea nothing lasts forever man
nothing lasts forever I'm not I know a
lot of friends that have had band
tattoos covered up like right I have a
friend that has the alkaline trio heart
yeah and a logo me and I think the
meaning of that logo extends transcends
beyond just the band sure but at the
same time me personally I wouldn't get a
band logo tattoo right and I've been
pretty involved in bands like certain
bands that have logos that I could
probably have done and like had enough
like credit get away with doing it right
still wouldn't do it though yeah i won
yeah it has like a sweet you know that
that ban screeching weasel sure I would
like the collar yeah well as economic
got that yeah he's got that like on his
arm man like if you didn't know what
screeching weasel was that looks like a
fast-food logo or like you have some
cartoon yeah yeah it is what it is I
think the big thing is is this I think
what you have to do is you have to
really really be sure you want it I know
it's cliche to say it doesn't really go
away if you want it gone you can get it
gone okay it's that's yes it's so don't
look at it like it's the end all yeah
but at the same time I highly highly
highly recommend you so let's say you
know January first you have an idea for
a tattoo and you want to get it wait
wait till the middle of the summer yes
still want it okay start investigating
use a sharpie and draw on your skin
where you wanted every day that's not a
terrible i look at it but that's not a
terrible idea either um but then after
you know even when you've decided to
start making the effort to look around
for an artist that you like wait even
when you find the artist wait another
three months yeah okay I would always
say what basically what I'm getting at
is wait
an entire year after you've decided that
you want the one you want ideally usual
want that in the year yeah go for ideal
you'd want an artist that has a weight
i'm of at least three disick rights
right you don't want just walk into
sista can walk like a guy who's doing a
Tasmanian devil on some walk-in job and
then get some from him I think on the
other side to you know like even if you
do have a tattoo from back in the day
that maybe you wouldn't get now if you
have to go back you know that's like a
sign of a time in your life where you
thought it was a good idea so in that
type of thinking fine you know like it's
kind of more reminiscent of like a very
specific time period yeah and you know
like I wouldn't be ashamed of it unless
it's on your face for sure something
really terrible you're right that's a
great point after you're 25 yeah I would
hope that we all make the right sort of
decision share and and or at least we
wouldn't be ashamed of anything we've
thought of back then so maybe like 25 s
that nice cut off were like you should
be out of college by then if you went
and you know maybe you can make those
right decisions you're you're on your
own maybe perhaps yeah and yeah I'm into
that also nothing's worse than just one
single floating bad tattoos if you have
that and you regret it just get the rest
of that limb or body appendage of Paula
to get the whole thing that you don't
just have this like floating amoeba yeah
you know you know I mean it's kind of I
maybe if you're a little bit older now
you can you get a cover yet by something
you should see like man tattoo artists
are really good at covering up amazing
some amazing work you have no idea
there's anything underneath it's a great
point when I was getting our work done I
remember um what's watching someone
across the aisle getting a cover-up and
it was just like blown away I was like
man I could get anything does not worry
about it right they don't encourage that
you know what's sad to me is uh you know
girls that get the lower back tattoo
which I honestly I don't have a problem
it's sexy for four months though like
that's it you know I mean yeah I guess
so it's it's two ladies don't do that no
I don't care how slam in your body is
don't do it do whatever you want ah i
know i really like the thigh ones no
okay wait let me finish this thought
about the lower back okay so uh i always
liked the one thing I hate more than a
lower back tattoo is a lower back cover
up tattoo because and they'll get
something huge lower back that or like
extend the leaf pattern till I
go up all those tires man that's I mean
I'm looks like I said whatever you want
just if you got it whatever if you got
it flaunt it is what you're saying now
don't want its put a shirt over arm and
then you know who commits we can really
ask about this who who's got a bunch of
tattoos very visible tattoos who are
buddy Peter ha alright and he'll be here
tomorrow oh he's gonna get ya sold so
we'll ask we'll ask him about what he
thinks yet about all that stuff stop it
with the Pepsi logo that was a joke it
was not a Joe was a joke oh I buddy
Peter Hall has the Korean flag the South
Korean the good one the good career on
his arm you know it's like the kind of
almost like a circle with like a union
describe it Justin it looks like a Pepsi
load doesn't look like the Pepsi look
here I'm gonna bring this up it's dude
and Jeff you watch and he's like oh you
must really like Pepsi that is first of
all that is not how went down yeah I
know I knew Peter lineage was Curt South
Korean okay I knew that the tattoo
represented that do you really think I
came in here was like how cold pepsi
tattoo yeah Peter you must really like
that song so this is the Pepsi logo here
this is the South Korean flag I'm sorry
dude Pepsi Lego great bread is even on
commentary yeah i mean i know because i
ran it by him before I'm like doing
gonna make fun of your tattoo yeah yeah
it's good that it's a he's got great
tattoos can I buried in Korea know so
well asking about that and there was one
other thing I wanted to mention about
the tattoo and I can't oh I also
recommend maybe you can attest to this I
recommend getting it done in the fall or
winter yes yes I really agree last July
I got maybe 10 hours of work done in two
weeks and yeah I'm sweater yeah I'm
sweater you know I I look at that I
think about the Sun I start getting you
know disgusting so you don't sweat and
tattoos are not fun at all especially
while they're healing so if you can
avoid doing that wait till wait till the
the weather gets nicer yeah along the
same lines if you are going to get a
tattoo my advice is
too I take care of it that's the most
part I mean like people don't really
think about that are they gay there's
like oh sweet imma take the Saran
remember how much and then put on these
like jeans are going to the ocean yeah
no don't do never a good idea make sure
you follow the instructions the artists
for sure for sure alright we could go on
for days about tattoos but we will not
instead we'll talk to Anne and writes in
and says I'm really surprised that you
guys are bothered by Bains voice of
course she's talking about the dark
knight rises a lot but not bad although
I did enjoy your impressions of his
voice I had more trouble trying to be
convinced that Batman's voice was real
in the dark knight and in dark knight
rises I get that Christians bales vote
Christian Bale's voice needed to be a
lot deeper but it sounded so fake yeah
all right well here's uh what we have to
say about that I think I mean we
obviously talked about this in a very uh
big you know capacity but I don't know I
feel like the jury sort out on it some P
its people are divided some people like
it some people hate it yet none of the
other Batman's in the series have had
such a gravelly voice right if you watch
that always wasn't like that no not at
all if you watch batman begins his voice
is so much better the batman voice is
bettering begin i don't know if it's
different than what the theatrical
release contained right but the the
dvd/blu-ray that that's a much more
satisfying batman voice he just you can
just taste like hey now and then in Dark
Knight he's like wherever and they'll
dark knight rises it yes he also has a
lot more speaking lines in dark knight
rises than the other two more also as
Christian as Bruce we need right right
but I mean like in the Batman voice sure
more dialogue yeah which maybe is why
people don't like it as much I think he
should just stick to like one-liners you
know like don't talk or maybe Batman
should have just held up little signs
okay whiteboard around whatever is just
like hold on hold on it's just like
where is he I yea sorry I'm speaking
like a crazy guy all right let's get to
some calls from the public right about
now here we go time to show the love
for scenic voice melts Batman I believe
you have a voicemail Batman so
ridiculous um let me just pull up my
notes here real quick I think you know a
lot of people still have problems
hearing Bane and I and I can sympathize
with that I think that you know it's
it's something that they clearly had a
lot of issues going through because as
everyone's heard right the the test runs
that took the sort of test screenings
that was everyone's number one complaint
that all I can't understand what he's
saying right so you know take it for
what it's worth even a break yes to wear
a mask on his face it ain't easy man how
does the guy eat by the way you've met
office once he takes it off he dies
right or it's very uncomfortable for him
you're totally right house eating
anything the entire time that sucks our
first call references trilogies
obviously appropriate since we're
talking about Batman so 12 for this is
princeton from eric i just wanted to get
in on the greatest trilogy discussing
you guys have been having I have this
really long list so I'm just going to
condense it to the top three that I
think should be in consideration first
off the naked gun I mean those are some
of the funniest movies ever they still
hold up today the george romero dead
series not a living dead dawn of the
dead and day of the dead I know the
groundbreaking yeah they look cheesy but
without them we don't have the walking
dead today and lastly Jeff as a fellow
hockey fan the mighty ducks dude all
right guys peace he's right Mighty Ducks
is is got a sketch sketch up now well
not third Mighty Ducks about today time
travel third was always about time
travel now that's ninja turtle all right
and you know what if ninja turtles three
was not a time-traveling all those like
it was like uh what uh what was like
Japan a feudal Japan what the hell have
you watched that recently no man i don't
think i've ever seen that front to back
no not even in the news initially I
that's the only time I've ever watched
it we should get back together and watch
I don't think so but uh yeah naked guns
pretty good maybe four
comedies yeah overall as a as a movie
it's tough to say make a gun in the same
breath as Godfather in Nolan's Batman
right what else did he oh and then the
mighty ducks no in Mighty Ducks three
wasn't time travel it was wasn't the
Olympics or something uh I don't
remember III yeah what do you remember
arielle even you know you actually
remember the first one first one is
clear we know what happens is there's
one where they they they play iceland
and that was the big deal i get that one
and though is that the one where they
put on the real mighty ducks jerseys
yeah he's gay in the real one yeah the
third one what the hell is the third one
about they go back in time they'd all go
back in time they go back in time and
prevent hockey from ever being but it
often plays this game anymore you know
they're really good trilogy though is
the Air Bud trilogy have you ever seen
any of these movies before air bud Air
Bud to golden receiver I hate you so
much and then Air Bud three uh Air Bud
spikes back I think psych for and the
challenge says that d3 is about high
school is ice or is it I don't know I
remember I don't know yeah always the
prep school why am I know I'm not
remembering it oh I remember d1 and d2
but d3 excuse me Gordon Bombay has to go
bail out his reject brother yeah I don't
you guys save his brother reason brother
he was spiraling out of control and you
gotta come back and they play hockey to
raise money to save it yeah um alright

friend i think it's a it's a lady which

lady and you want to call us up you

University in Houston and just yesterday

community member but he was totally just
propped up in our
library on campus is watching porn
hanging out watching bored Senate and
they got a picture of him like it looked
like the dudes like voluntarily posed
for this picture and they sent it to
everybody every student on campus as
like a warning that if she's fear no
other campus police officer know it's so
embarrassing yeah I would I don't know
