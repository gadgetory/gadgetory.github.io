cnet this is the Samsung at Eve s neo
for sprint it's a windows phone and I'm
going to be honest with you it is very
much a middle-of-the-road performer it
looks good I find it pretty attractive
and the stark blue color was sort of a
patterning on the back it's pretty big
too and kind of shaped like the samsung
galaxy s4 series maybe that's why
there's the s in its name so it has sort
of these square camera modules on the
back square LED rounded corners silvery
accents alongside the back and along
this physical home button on the front
so I think it looks really nice it's
very heavy though about 5 ounces which I
find a little bit unnecessary and a
little heavier the most of Samsung
smartphones are there's a nice large
four point eight inch 720p HD screen on
here pretty bright and easy to read so
that's nice camera quality was actually
a little bit disappointing there's an
eight megapixel camera on the back
autofocus LED flash 1.9 megapixel camera
on the front and 1080p HD video capture
the problem was that photos came out a
little bit less crisp detailed and
colorful than they usually do with this
kind of Samsung camera I did however
like that there were a lot more options
and features inside the native camera
app and it comes with an extra Samsung
camera app lens called shooting modes
and that will come with HDR and
continuous shot when it comes to
performance I found the phone a little
bit laggy both with internals and also
the data network so it does support 4G
but i only found 4G in my area once or
twice most of the time I was stuck
surfing on 3G speeds really slowed
things down it also has a 1.4 gigahertz
dual-core processor but it seems a
little bit slower than some other phones
that have just about the same processor
as well now the S neo costs 149 99 at
full retail price on contract with
sprint it's fifty dollars more expensive
than the HTC 8xt but it also has doubled
storage that 16 gigabytes internal
memory instead of 8 gigabytes and
there's a microSD card slot behind the
back cover
overall it's an okay mid-tier choice I
don't think it's really going to
disappoint you unless great photos are a
priority for you I'm delicate all court
from CNN this is the Samsung at es mio
