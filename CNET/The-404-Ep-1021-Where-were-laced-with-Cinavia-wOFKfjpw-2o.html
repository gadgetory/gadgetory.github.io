to the 404 show streaming live from New
York I'm Jeff Bakalar and I'm Justin you
and this is the show where we're laced
with cinavia this is a little ribbon
catch every once in a while when we I
think we're having a good show this
isn't a landmark episode or anything
like that way is that it eats trees
confetti know that idea it's the day
after Tony Hawk day yes it is and what
better way to follow up a mega superstar
tony hawk on mega mega super with a mega
mega mega superstar andrew stupid
hendler xin the studio today it's never
been referred to like that people but i
don't like it this is this is like
stupidest my middle name yeah correct
you are there's a first for everything
what's up do you thanks for coming on no
problem yeah good to see you how you
been I've been pretty good so
comfortable are you with having your
middle name be stupid on the internet I
mean have you gotten that because I feel
like every time you come on we make a
reference to how stupid you are and but
it's ironic because you're one of those
that I now I don't know what about the
layman that just types in Andrew hendler
online and just sees stupid everywhere I
don't change that potentially because
stupid such a popular word making it
helps my google pagerank i think it does
i think it improves SEO for mr. handler
i also think i had a website if you had
a website yeah i also think the skewed
the second i tweeted out today shows
gonna be extra stupid yes with the 00 is
very crib we got a dozen we got a dozen
freaking @ replies like oh my god and
people have completely like change their
entire schedule around today yeah just
to kind of sit listen to the show and do
absolutely nothing else of course
concentrate on every word they're
dropping what they're doing they're
tuning in to hear what you have to say
yeah first thing we're going to cover
with you look what's it that crap eating
grin you've got on right let's talk
about your little macbook air well I had
this last time I was yeah between really
get into the nitty-gritty so show the
cow is really about
they're you're running windows on your
mac book a package it's funny that you
ask Jeff actually as triple booting its
triple be so sensitive on what is those
your gmail want you want you hide some
things there they go explain to me okay
so you're running windows on your
macbook air I'm if you spent spent 20
hours running windows mr. president can
I call you out on this desktop by the
way you have a what is this but that's
not I know yes are you an a usual file
are you a secret yellow fever having son
of a bitch look that what are we looking
at here I thought you would have like I
don't know like import car girls or
something on your desktop you have like
a weird pagoda they know there's there's
as I mentioned previously it's a triple
booting situation okay there's different
themes for each of the operating system
so you got OSX obviously you a ton of
yeah what is your pointer not a regular
pointer and some sort of animated
droplet okay so we're getting to the
windows things which is 15 so okay very
everyone I can't see the vision I edler
changed his he changed his uh what is
that that's winter pointer to a drain
drop what is wrong sir 1995 I did that
stuff when I was in Middle sitting the
only good thing about windows that you
can't do if you look at the entire theme
as a whole yeah it's supposed to be sort
of a Zen relaxer themed video great
Explorer backgrounds are made of
parchment yeah we're see-through weight
that you can kind of see the building
behind yeah yeah you are a sick sick man
do you also have winamp installed on
this computer as well is it really yeah
what version a real player you gotta
know this its Windows ME all right give
it back to windows however is because
i'll show you what about i mean the
other cool this really is funny sort of
seeing how how you love personalization
in your window he's a tinkerer well i do
but i want to show you something pretty
interesting alright from a technology
standpoint that's your opinion you know
the shows about technology it's yeah i
want you to just see the boot screen
okay yeah cuz i show off my boo
skreened everyone I me too yeah okay so
you got uh uh I really different on
Isaac's as i mentioned that windows
seven and you've got a Linux option as
well it's booting into windows right now
without your permission I think it is
the robe the robots are taking over but
i got i got some linux mint on here 20
minutes how much of a pain in the ass it
was to have a triple boot like that and
how it's not even worth the effort did i
tell you that didn't weren't you like
i'm at that was some other person you
were upset with the with how long it
took i think of course okay it takes a
while on a macintosh computer to triple
boot sure much easier on a PC Brett if
you got all the EF I'd type stuff yeah
once you do it's it's it's pretty
fantastic I think now that i have three
operating systems 250 gigabyte salad
state now on this little tiny computer
cool where I SAT school I I feel like
I'm river phoenix from sneakers that is
references that's screen how it makes me
feel great movie I regret asking you
this question Andrew but why do you need
to have three operating systems on one
computer you have different software
programs that require those like dr
required linux vs mac person even though
why do you find your sis why just
switching between linux in line although
just to do it it's to do it may it's not
just to do it the change protects a kiss
it's the thrill the case for you i know
i mean you know in terms of how I set up
without going into incredible detail and
share what applications i used sure you
know there's benefits and Linux's you
know it's it's good to have it's a tool
most everything is free if you want to
do something you know you got a software
repository able to grab it yeah like if
you like board in the afternoon you're
like i wanna you know compile the
android colonel that's what i want to do
my you're near in the native operating
system you know like the mac laptops are
obviously built to run OSX do so
fantastic and it's like a fantastic
experience but you also want windows on
there for a couple reasons one you
should run office I get it I can skin it
yeah with water droplets exactly which
makes it all worth it chat room thinks
you're effing crazy by the way to each
his own that's all I can definitely to
your
own I want to talk about the show title
why we are laced with cinavia why are we
laced with explain to me you I had no
idea what's a navy was until a couple
weeks ago when you SAT me down and said
Jeff I need to explain to you what this
insane audio watermark drm technology is
known as cinavia its peak it's it's one
of the most brilliant and maniacal at
the same that's a great way to describe
the type of DRM it's like that's
available and it basically evolved from
the type of copy protection they used
for high definition audio yeah dvda yes
sacd right that era and the idea is that
there's two parts the one you have an
audio watermark on the media to you have
a detector built into a blu-ray player
so it's a two-way system it's got to be
on the media itself and on the player
exactly okay and what happens is is it's
it's in the audible range on the audio
yeah you but you can't hear that humans
can't hear you can't remove you can't
just do a filter spread you you play it
it contains the data payload you play it
on your blu-ray player if and in the
blu-ray player the detector basically
you know reads the data and the data
says what medium this movie or this
audio right be all right so they can
change so it says like you know for
instance this movie should be on an aacs
encrypted blu-ray gotcha if it's not
then it kicks in and shuts at all red
flags reason did you make backup copies
of your blu rays it'll be unencrypted
this case you're playing it from a file
it'll be like this shouldn't be in a
file yeah this should be the basic
definition it's confusing but it's it's
really interesting if you're like an
audio guy like me in terms of how they
go in and you know cuz it's an echo
right like the echoes only I think like
50 milliseconds that it repeats right
after the originally decipherable to
human ear but it's so it's echoes in
phase cancellation and a number of other
things we don't know about yet but the
brilliance of it is the fact that it has
to be in the audible spectrum yeah but
you can't hear it because otherwise
could just remove the inaudible
frequency and be gone right but that the
uproar that it creates is because you
know it's typically blu-rays and it's
typically on the high definition audio
channel is that you know audio files who
buy that and have these high-end systems
they can't hear it but they're like well
this isn't really the master recording
right getting some type of effect
against it even though I can't detect it
you know I can't that you know it's
always like a feeling they're within
their right to berea and you can still
play it's this easy of of blu-rays sure
yeah i still play unprotect I'm sorry
you can still play place in a via
protected disks on a media player that
doesn't have the UH the watermark
detector what's right basically the ACS
so you can bypass it really easily as I
just don't have a layer that however the
ACS has mandated all blu-ray players
manufacture a be right will contain that
now that we've dozen that does and they
need to do that o otherwise it won't
pass that yeah they won't pass through
the but I things like fresh it's like a
WD live for a media streamer yeah don't
have a blu-ray drive they're not bound
by that right so the other thing about
this that we should bring up because
feeling for getting a little too
technical for someone uh it's also you
can't write you can't back it up you
can't rip it you can't do anything with
it besides only one thing and that's
play it in a regulated blu-ray player
right and there's like you know from
from the standpoint of using your media
in like a legal fashion like you want to
rip a disc and you know potentially put
it on your your ps3 sure sure and then
be able to stream it it won't let you do
that you know even if you bought it well
there's there's concerns for people that
are like enthusiasts and have right you
know these media libraries and things of
that nature it's seen and and I think
the biggest footnote about this entire
technology also that we haven't brought
up is the fact that nobody's figured it
out yet and every other drm sort of
technology that's hit the market has
been cracked or hacked and you know
turned upside down cinavia is for the
most part completely foolproof you know
they get around for a bunch of year it's
also not something that was implemented
by the dr
protectors themselves it's made by a
company called ver ants yeah and they're
making money off this by mincing that
technology out like discs replicators
distributors if the licensor's also pay
I think it's like five cents per disc
have the tsunami of Technology put onto
it when users can just bypass that
anyway it's really the its current area
money it's a little scary for period but
you know if you an old blu-ray player
that doesn't have a cinavia detector you
know at a certain point in order to play
new blu rays because of you know bd+ or
BTW java your need going to need to
update your firmware right they're going
to put it in so it can be implemented
through software yes huh even more scary
I mean it's not completely that's what
Sony did with the ps3 because it didn't
exist in they released with a firmware
update and people weren't sure if you
know had some type of hardware element
which allowed it to do that right all
right that leads us into another
conversation let's get right into it a
playstation the next playstation is for
ps4 whatever the hell they're going to
call it a lot of rumors hit in the
internet yesterday uh kotaku got their
hands on a leak quote unquote I'm just
sorry I've become so numb and
desensitized to all these
next-generation console rumors it's
tough to take any of them seriously but
again this one comes out says that the
next PlayStation will hit the market in
2013 I don't think that'll happen
personally supposedly it's named Orbis
codename Orbis which just doesn't mean
anything to anybody either because it's
going to be co playstation 4 whatever
but the real details are what sort of uh
I guess you know making people talk it
will supposedly only lock games into a
single PlayStation Network account there
will be no backwards compatibility so
any PlayStation 3 game that you have on
a disc doesn't sound like it'll be able
to be played on the PlayStation 4 and
the most shocking of all it will have
some sort of technology built into it
that will prevent you from playing a
used video game ok so the ramifications
of that final detail are endless not
only does it in one fell swoop just
completely eliminate
things like gamefly yea and things like
uh gamestop ever hear that multi-billion
dollar chain so I don't know I think
what I what do you think and there what
do you think that this is really sort of
I don't know knows if it's all confirmed
or true Sony's not confirming or denying
well what do you think this sort of
means for the future of gaming I mean I
think the reason behind it goes to the
conversation we're having for is largely
because you know Sony is is always like
a leader in terms of DRM yeah you know
they have the most prolific blu-ray
player would share his three implements
navy amongst other things first when the
ps3 was hacked i think that that you
know that scared them and that's why
that they with the ps4 with these
particular rumors they want to make it
as lockdown as possible but i think the
ramifications are you know it's really
really bad it's getting to the point
where it's so much more strict than what
we would consider you know with movies
or blu rays and they've always sort of
been on par you know when blockbuster
you know when going to the store and
renting a movie was probably you always
go in you know rent a game yeah and do
that now you're at the point where well
you can rent movies or you can do this
or do that but you can't do that with
games of course so i think i think
that's a concern yeah especially with
the cost of games because it you know a
movie is cheaper you know you might be
able to see in the theater first or do
some of it when you buy a game and the
reason think investing is like gamefly
it's a big investment you want to be
able to play it exactly if you like it
and it's not like necessarily a movie
where you watch it once you might if you
really like you might watch it a couple
times but the game has a ton of replay
value to or sure so it's not like by
allowing people to rent games you know
people are not going to then go and buy
it it's a totally different dynamic
don't you think that by preventing and
pretty much ending all kinds of used
games and sharing and stuff like that i
mean i don't think i think they are
severely under estimating how much of an
impact this will have on people's
decision to buy games at all if i'm
buying a sixty-dollar game a part of me
is saying hey worst case scenario
finally like this thing i'm just going
to trade it back in and get half my
money back at the very least or sell
on eBay maybe get back ninety percent of
my money that mentality is such a
contributing factor to somebody buying a
video game from the get-go that I feel
like that you know decision workflow has
not been considered by the people
potentially making these decisions yet
to the point where it ends of it yeah
it's it the best advertising for the
game is renting it I mean that's you get
to basically try it you you'd play it
for a couple days then you get to figure
out if you want to buy it right same
thing you're saying in terms of resale
value or selling there's a lot of little
markets or lots of little things that
people do before they buy game that
you're completely eliminating and
price-wise I mean you know with with iOS
or Android you know you can buy games
for significantly cheaper granted it's
not like on a console right but keep
that I think that moves you know
people's mentality on what the dollar
value of getting to be for you're seeing
it a little bit with like Vita too
obvious so lockdown well in terms of
price and the price those games versus
I'll go to the App Store buy this for
this price so it's interesting I bring
that up with the lockdown think as the
Vita is super lockdown transferring a
movie file from the computer to it is
brain surgery I mean it's easy enough
but it's just tedious and the workflow
takes a lot of time um but also think
about it like growing up right when you
were playing Nintendo or say or say
whatever it was and you're like okay
dude i'll come over and I'll bring my
copy of Sun it can go plate like that is
a huge part of your you're growing up
and your childhood with gaming like this
sort of sees that coming to an end yeah
you know like that's a big deal like I'm
sure you were you did stuff like that
growing up like hey man bring over your
copy of jet motor will race to be sick
but you know you gotta be able to do
that why don't you know I'll see no you
won't bring your game over to some know
it does only work in the player that
yeah it does it cuz that's technically a
used game is to basically matches I
guess with one particular console it'll
like solidify Adam now on your console
there's also over or maybe they'll have
some sort of thing where you can sign in
on someone else's console and then you
know pop that out yet maybe that already
I mean do you really think they'll just
eliminate that you know pure
or sort of experience of sharing against
i mean i think that the bigger question
and we're talking about this a little
bit before is why why are they doing
this is it is it do they feel like it's
going to generate more revenue in terms
of that or is it strictly you know a
means to further lock it down because i
don't want it to be hacked I think it's
the latter because as we've discussed
you don't generate more revenue this way
it what yeah and that's that's the
perplexing thing about it's like why are
why are they doing it can't be there
they've clearly cannot think they cannot
rationally think that this will equal
more money they can't think that way I
just I can't see that happening well
yeah and I thinking because even with
used games and stuff right the way it's
set up now if i buy a used game from
gamestop and I go home and I want to
play online and it's a used game that's
like an EA game that requires a pass to
play online I gotta pay another ten
bucks that's money money being generated
right there dlc stuff like that i don't
think that you know piracy is definitely
a problem but i think it's much more so
in terms of music and movies and games
it's out there but you the level of
sophistication you need in order to be
able to do that is much greater so I I
can't imagine that that's particularly
hurting Sony in the video game
developers enough to you know limit
ordinary consumers into kind of doing
some of the behaviors we discuss yeah
it's really scary i feel like the second
and it's not just games its books it's
movies it's it's music I don't know what
it was like the second when that you
were able to buy something that wasn't
tangible that wasn't in your hand right
the second like this CD is gone and it's
just zeros and ones on a drive somewhere
we lost of right we lost like a
possession already sort of thing like
it's all rented now and it's all sort of
virtual at me personally I think the
future of games right now is like
subscription-based stuff I think like
what call of duty does now they have
like the elite membership where it's
like 50 bucks a year and you're a call
of duty player for 50 bucks a year
you're going to get all this continued
follow up digital content you're going
to get all that but it's for
price of a year and that sort of just
eliminates used games cuz no one like
wants to give away game once they
remember right you know I feel like
that's where we're going whether or not
that's the right way you know I mean
what do you think about that I don't
think that's completely unreasonable
actually the worst thing especially if
you're you're you're signing up with the
expectation that you're going to get new
content it's going to be in hand it's
going to be a map for sure I think that
I think that subscription sort of thing
that's probably the lesser of two evils
yeah I mean there's development time
that has to go into making those
modifications so I don't have a problem
with that especially if you could sign
in on your home console or and then go
to a friend's house and be able to do it
there yeah i mean that's reasonable it's
interesting tell us what you think 866
for for CNN will take a quick break when
we come back more with not so stupid
Andy and then while calls from the
public and a lot more fun keep it here
we'll be right back this is the 404 mr
effers the show where we all sing songs
you
welcome back to the 404 man i want i
want an elephant I just want to hang out
with an elephant you guys wanna hang out
with elf I don't think I've ever oh no
no I don't know how much fun it would be
but it sounds like something well that
should be video made me just want to
chill out with an elephant this is that
elephant playing with a samsung galaxy
note by pressing its trunk against the
screen yeah what's interesting you know
it's like the galaxy no it's so big that
even an elephant can you know like sweet
all the elephants are like you swayed
finally I want to see an elephant play
draw something with no no what would you
do with it if you hung out with Alvin
what would you do I don't know crap
myself I'd be like oh my god you a 40
tons rooms are smarter than you think
that yeah have you seen those videos I
know elephants entirely draw their own
portrait whoever they draw the picture
yet yeah he's all set up in front of the
elephants and they paint brush and then
draw a self portrait that's amazing yeah
it's incredible never hurt anything like
that I just think the fact that they
have a trunk that's basically a hand
like they can do everything a hand can
do more or less right that's kind of
cool that they just they're so cool like
that it'd be cooled they also hands but
so that's not nobody won think about how
terrifying of a creature that would be
you used to it like this and the
freaking strunk I'd be like I got so
much done I know they would be super
productive that would be the elephants
thing rather than like never forgetting
it would be productivity yeah good leave
it alone feeling moving right along oh
that's nice snuck up right on me now it
happens that's a that is how it happens
it's a story that happened a few days
ago we're gonna get a little serious
real quick um it happened a few days ago
and we've been pressured to cover it by
people emailing and tweeting what do we
think of this so I guess we'll we'll try
and cover this the best way we can of
course you know the news going on with
Spike Lee ah he incorrectly tweeted the
wrong address yeah for the UH you know
the George Zimmerman um schmuck down
there who apparently you know uh killed
this kid yes we were gonna cover the
whole right we're gonna talk /
you know Trayvon Martin story right but
now it's become like a tech element it
has a tech element that's come out of it
and now it's when keeping it real goes
wrong Twitter edition when keeping it
real goes wrong uh-huh did you go over
that no that's a Chapelle show skit come
on all right okay anyway so uh when
laughing it real goes wrong last
Wednesday this guy name is marcos de von
Hagens he sent out a tweet uh claiming
he had discovered the address of George
Zimmerman the guy who write you know
shocked when he clearly just went to a
phone book and looked up any old George
Zimmerman not only that but he also
posted on Facebook yeah sent it out to
his four thousand Twitter followers and
even made a sign here I'll show a
picture to you guys I'm scared it's a
sign that he made that he brought to
protests that featured the address and
the phone number of who he thought was
George W Zimmerman turns out uh well
there's three things that went wrong
after this number one that's the wrong
George Zimmerman that's actually an
address belonging to a guy named william
george zimmerman hmm who i will now call
w gz brevity's sake sure second of all w
gz doesn't live at that location anymore
it's now populated by his two parents
both over 70 years old he hasn't lived
there for seven years so ours wrong
George Zimmerman yeah there isn't live
there there are so I love how we like
continue to show this poor person's
address there there are so many things
wrong with this the third thing that
went wrong with it though is that since
last Wednesday he's been making such a
stink about it that Spike Lee actually
actually retweeted the original tweet
with the wrong address in it right to
his 240 thousand followers right and
said didn't he say something like why
don't you go out and reach out and touch
them or something that was the original
tweet from Marcus Higgins that said go
out reach out touch him since then
apparently uh the couple uh Elena claims
like this poor elderly couple were like
what the hell is he wit er yeah did no
idea what what was going on people sent
uh envelopes i guess the radio with the
skittles thing is the whole thing's
becoming a bigger the type of fallout
from from this particular thing well
these neighborhood
right I I there was no way I mean I
would you know sue the pearl I think I
think people like the original guy and
and uh spike lee are totally liable
right without a doubt they're gonna mean
it's and i watch an interview with the
elderly couple this morning they're like
we don't want them we don't want to you
know get any money out of this you just
want people to stop being more whores
and that's that's a huge deal and I feel
like still I don't care how famous you
are I don't care how you know silly or
stupid you are Twitter's freaking
powerful man right I think that would it
old tomato check your sources check your
crap I mean this is Daisy that's the
whole idea behind and winter yeah you
know the fact that you that instant
gratification and you can kind of put
anything out there it's it's it's it's
just basically run by and the power
holders are people that are famous and
lots of fires and you can say whatever
you want without verifying and things
like this happen it's just for sinuses
go all this is not the first it'll not
be the last what I don't understand is
what goes through the mind of someone
like Spike Lee and just says like okay
I'm gonna write this okay cuz you're
either way you're probably gonna get in
trouble okay but even if no one touches
this you're going to get into right
address even Atlanta action were you in
Sakai no idea right well we're
discussing well when Spike Lee looks at
his Twitter account on his computer
monitor he sees 204,000 people right
right but the followers doesn't match up
with your mentality when you actually
see 204 that like if there were a room
full of 204th I don't think it's that
one say let go and uh you know I mean
it's a good point but it's also it goes
back to the instant gratification yeah
it's just the idea that what is going
through his head it's a manga nothing he
can do that within three seconds right
you know and it's so can anybody out the
heat of the moment exactly it's like a
in the moment of passion but the problem
is is that dude someone ok out of
200,000 people I'm willing to bet
there's 0 a dozen people who are maybe
millions
okay so even so now you're giving out an
address and let's say someone goes over
and kill the real George Benoit dude
that's called accessory to murder maybe
I would be a hundred percent case come
on your purse anything about liability
do you think in this particular case or
in cases similar that like Twitter is
actually liable no no I don't because
Twitter's Terms of Service explicit
state you cannot post card intial or
personal information about someone's
address which is why I'm advocating for
spike lee's Twitter account to be taken
that he needs to be yes to be
recommended there's no doubt about our
nightly now newest movies are and they
are greater i loves me he's an amazing
artist he's a great guy there you go
right they do the right he's an amazing
filmmakers amazing artist but this was a
bonehead move yeah and that's that's
what it is yeah i mean he's already
apologized on twitter for it but that's
not over this couple the damage has been
done i can't go back into that house
he's gotta gotta buy them a new house in
an undisclosed location is what he's got
to do just to start i'm all for you know
freedom of speech but there's obviously
a limit when it creates you know such a
negative situation for innocent people
yeah how do you please something like
this i did how do you how do you prevent
things like this oh you can't you cannot
prevent it the second we all got online
that was it it's over okay so you all
you can do is educate and you you know
people uh you know it's the same old
thing of like don't take don't take
candy from strangers you know i mean
it's like that mentality like protect
yourself yeah and it extends to the
online world that we all live in now it
is really scary that these celebrities
wield so much power right with work
great followers comes great
responsibility that's true yeah i mean
like we're putting essentially this
power in the hands of people that are
just like us you know they can make
mistakes now scarce interesting it is
we'll move along just because it just
gets me so mad a bonehead well I like I
loves and I really want is best about a
maneuver effing stupid of you to do that
I no way mad no one's happy about what
hi saw this dude this is like loosely
connected and I get to real quick but
saw this Facebook documentary the other
day
yeah and basically was called there
wasn't no social no no it was have you
seen it there was there was a technology
teacher to particular school that had
certain privacy settings with facebook
which he went on to just vent about all
the parents yeah and then she got fired
yeah I found out and she blamed Facebook
right and I'm like well why you know she
thought her privacy was fun but I'm like
you're a tech teacher can't you you know
think hey if I rail on the parents of
the kids I'm teaching in online forum
yeah you know can that possibly get back
to someone maybe I could just do it with
my family and friends in private oh so
it's it's just like even people that are
apparently like very well educated like
obviously it's not a great story you
hate to see stuff like that ever
happened but it's just like people who
are supposedly very you know it's Peck
is her profession sure she goes you know
online and just does a bad mouth people
in people so it just doesn't register
with some people i think uh i mean if
you're blaming facebook you might as
well blame taco taco bell mcdonald for
making you fat yeah you might as well
blame Marlboro cigarettes for giving you
lung cancer I mean it's like you know
what I mean it's this it's just the same
thing might as well they do it keyboard
manufactures for making car referral
that allows you to go to those words
exactly I met it you know it's like
really let's get ridiculous yeah don't
do responsibility take responsibility
for so stop eating cheeseburgers will
you all right I want to get into this
story uh let's talk about Kanye West
before I would've liked a lighter note
okay but uh you know it teaches the same
lesson that tech journalists need to
verify their information before blowing
things up on the internet so yesterday
Evan was kind of freaking about it out
about this website who dat dot biz hmm
right this is a website claiming to be
like one of the first sight offsprings
of Kanye West tech startup that he
announced earlier this year in January
called dhanda but the idea is that if
you went to who dat dot biz they claim
to be the facebook for websites
essentially giving you the same tools as
who is reka that's like a IPO goes
coughing who ownership stirred and who
owns a website right um so yeah
basically all these different tech
journalists pundits reported
it was in The Washington Post is in
Business Insider on Twitter um Kanye
West has not made a comment about it but
uh his moto BuzzFeed both did their due
diligent research i found out that it's
fake and uh you know we've been duped by
stories like this before fucking stunts
commercials etcetera course uh you know
this is something that could potentially
hurt Kanye West brand uh not a huge fan
of the guy but it turns out that is a
prank by two guys from a digital agency
called okay focus uh and they decided a
prank uh Kanye West to show how easy it
is to pull something like this and I I
think that wish this would spark a
conversation between us about how
transparent the Internet is and how easy
it is come up with this kind of thing in
fool people what's not even that it just
make news for you so it's the game of
telephone you know uh in in our world of
like first to market and first to break
scoops and and and and stories like that
right people do it everyone's like I'll
check your facts check your should know
right I think that's the real villain
here is the desire to be first the fur
everything for sure and this exploited
that desire for sure what so it's to be
first but it's also the idea that in
order to be first especially in like the
digital age you have to be so fast yeah
i'll for sure to be second you had so
fast that it is impossible for you to
have checked your sources because you're
so fast right i mean the desire to be
first isn't something new it was
something you could do you know when
people receive their news primarily from
television news and newspapers and not
the internet um there was some due
diligence that you know just that that
could be done because you know you can't
update that in seconds right you know
time to show that goes on a particular
time right it you know you you publish
your paper every morning right which is
why which is why the future of human
existence there will be no news channels
it'll just be like a collective hybrid
hive minded existence right where there
is no reporting there is just life right
and that's and you know i'm just of
digital virtual representation of that
well how do you find out what's accurate
just the question will most of the way
most abysm of the crap that's what
that's how it is now that's how it is
now that it's it's small it's in it's
sort of infantile stage but that's how
it is now that's that's how I get all my
news on Twitter this is the collective
mass is all sort of yet agreeing on
Spike Lee tweeted it then it must be
true it's that sort of thing is it's
kind of ridiculous because all gizmodo
had to do it's not like they had to you
know spend hours on the phone or find
the sources they literally just plugged
huda who dat dot is into a Google
Analytics ID and found that the tumblr
was created yesterday so there's no way
that Kanye would have okay then that's
that in one day and that's all they had
to do which led to a phone call with the
the advertising firm that made the
original prank yeah that's it that's
what any other news organization would
have done it took maybe ten more minutes
I don't know man the future of news hey
I love it just don't trust anything you
read on these websites that I logs on in
five seconds there you go a new survey
out makes me feel a hell of a lot better
about what happened me this last weekend
well according to the Jane Doe new
survey out says 33 is now the best age
you can possibly be right I don't
believe that this is according to a
survey of 33 year olds yeah I think I'm
closest in the room to them what are you
oh I'm going to be 32 in three weeks
reach to the countdown the 33 starts
yeah based on the survey I'm just filled
with excitement I don't know if you can
tell because you have literally an
entire year leading up to the best age
you could possibly be I know it's
awesome I don't know what I'm gonna do
like do they suggest any like things
that are really awesome at 33 yeah you
know I like it this is gonna be bad for
you uh this is a survey from friends
United they say that seventy percent of
people over the age of 40 said their
happiest at their age um and then six
percent they said they were happiest in
their college years sixteen percent said
they were happiest during their
childhood years but one in three that
said they were happy over the age of 30
attributed that to children so you have
a lot of work to do in the next year my
friend you gotta get busy bro let's get
busy now yeah so the
they're saying that uh you know by the
age of 30 most of their innocence is
lost they know more about the world
they've met somebody which attributed to
their happiness fana clauses in real
they defecate stuff yeah after the age
of 30 which also attributed more to
their hats sure so I don't know none of
us have kids in this room so I have I
don't stop I don't have kids in a year
I'm gonna be my Serbian just be
depressed there's no other reasons
around 33 like you know the peak of your
physical strength and areas yeah it
can't be you the peak of your physical
strength they're not your physical
strength your sexual prowess form a
cording to men and women in the study
four minutes later than women for men I
think I thought women it's later than my
exact all correct right especially right
I thought it was like literally like the
age 19 for men and 48 for Ivan or
something like that well I think there's
a difference between sexual peak yeah
and is a cool prize exact right sure
absolute so this is what the survey is
saying is that people were talking about
how they've hit their sexual stride
because they know more they have more
experience right they you know without
getting into more details they can
attract younger guys or girls if you
want to you know absolutely so you might
a man have some hope left for you I'm
feeling good at 30 now tell you that no
I know III can't imagine having kids by
33 I don't see any way possible for that
to happen yes I unless it's an accident
that's all done every day then hey man
mistakes are made you know people have
to change it yeah we're not drinking
tonight who knows what I'll who knows
the possibilities are endless let's get
to a few calls and poke before we have
to go time to show the love eight
hoorah for Xena yeah she seemed like I
said new that's awesome well I haven't
heard I owe you get out of here I don't
know maybe we just don't do them when
you're here oh no I me to watch the show
too but I like I was gonna say what the
f man I watch every time I clearly ah
this one is a girl calling up she's a
little upset with us that we didn't know
a certain soccer player hey 404 this is
Portland from Judea and I'm calling
because I was out of town on business on
business and I'm a little bit behind on
episodes but while listening to episode
10 11 I almost had a heart attack when I
realized neither one of you guys knows
who Lionel Messi is and seriously you
guys come on he's like one of the best
soccer or football players of all time
and he just became the top goal scorer
for Barcelona Football Club so please
tell me that ever since that episode
aired you guys went to youtube and
search for his video he's nasty Lionel
Messi did you know who that was I only
know the name messy cuz i play fifa
right so like you play as all the good
teams and you get you know you you know
him it's the best way to get acclimated
with any sports anchors video game it's
like how I know rooney &amp;amp; ronaldo and all
those dudes judges soccer video games
are amazing i'm reading this right now
turns out he was also on the cover of
pro evolution soccer oh nine and love it
yeah that's that's I feel that's the
lesser of the two in terms of popularity
right of the video game world but still
yeah I don't you know I'm sorry look I
like soccer you know it's it's it's a
it's an American phenomenon that it's
not popular here I used to be fantastic
at soccer I don't know if you could tell
I was actually going to say you come off
as one as a very skilled soccer player I
you know that's not one of the things
that that first learn about me yeah but
it's not the last thing either if you
know what I mean I I guess I'm not sure
I dunno there's no matter what I mean
so we can listen um this is what is this
such a sneaky everybody I'm on the phone
whose voice yelling this and that sound
people play that again yeah it is what
it sounds like a teenager in the
Simpsons hi everybody I'm on the car
what's the lasting say I'm on the floor
for a manga manga something about a
million a million i don't know maybe I
maybe I just love people losing their
minds that is that like a sound clip now
no I we could kind of probably make
whenever there's just that drunk dial or
hi everybody I'm on the great you need
you need that and use that in ideal
circumstances when I was listening to
make this I'm I was like what like it's
pretty good finally like she might make
it my boot up sound on my macbook every
time you minimize a window how do you
get that but you customize your sense to
you by Derek a lot of Muppet talk lately
