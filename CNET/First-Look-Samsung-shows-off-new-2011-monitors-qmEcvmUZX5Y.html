San Francisco checking out Samsung's
monitor preview for 2011 we have a few
monitors here so we should just get
right to them first up is the syncmaster
t20 7 8 9 50 this is Samsung's HD TV
monitor with 3d capability is actually
using Samsung's own proprietary
community technology not videos and it
comes with its own 3d glasses which
which are active shutter which is great
has an ultra clear panel technology that
makes images look really really awesome
he's using a TN panel but choosing
Samsung's highest quality TN panel and
as you can see it looks really cool this
monitor actually has an appt feature so
you can download and use apps on the
monitor like little games and stuff like
that a facebook you can do facebook from
monitor you don't need a computer to do
this stuff monitor has a CPU inside of
it does 2d the 3d conversion as well
it's pretty great pretty awesome this is
a syncmaster s27 8 850 it's Samsung's
professional monitor you know being
geared towards professional graphic
artists it has a pls which is a new
technology of pls panel as professional
monitors go this is actually a really
thin professional monitor you don't
usually see them looking this then that
think that's an advantage of the pls
technology it also has a little place
for your power adapter brick if you want
to wall mount your monitor you can have
the power adapter brick out of the way
looks a little better if your wall
mounted so you know Samsung really
thought about the design you know you
don't get that a lot with professional
monitors usually it's just like function
/ design but I at least appreciate you
know this push to have a really well
design professional monitor as well as
hopefully we'll see well before me right
now we're looking at the s 23 a 750 and
the s 27 a 950 750 is kind of a lower
footprint version with the same panel
technology as the 950 before it's same
quality panel kind of a lower price
version of that
they both are samsung's like premiere 3d
gaming monitors one of the great things
about Samsung's proprietary 3d
technologies and you can use either
Nvidia or AMD graphics cards and run 3d
the 950 right here it follows the same
design as a TA 950 this is a SI 950 with
a few less ports but some some innards
were changed to make it more optimized
for 3d gaming so that Samsung's very
impressive 2011 monitor lineup stay
tuned to see net for more coverage as
well as reviews in the coming weeks and
months</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
