top-of-the-line Yankee reader cobos gone
big the ro1 sports a seven-point eight
inch screen that's significantly larger
than the six inch screens found on all
of Amazon's Kindle e-readers
however at 230 grams or 8.1 ounces this
is thinner and a touch lighter than
Cobos earlier Ora h2o which has a
smaller 6.8 inch screen so you're
basically getting more screen without
adding any weight
I also liked how the back of the device
has a rubberized textured finish which
makes it a little easier to grip like
the h2o this one's also waterproof and
even more so it's got a higher ipx8
rating which means it can be submerged
in up to 2 meters of water for up to 60
minutes
no Kindle is currently waterproof
although Barnes &amp;amp; Noble's latest Nook is
other upgrades include an ultra-high
resolution 1872 by 1404 300 pixel per
inch display 8 gigabytes of on-board
storage instead of 4 gigabytes an
improved
integrated lighting system allows you to
adjust not only brightness but color
temperature which is kind of cool
battery life is rated up to a month and
there's Wi-Fi connectivity but no
cellular option as you'd expect from a
Kobo e-reader you can shop for ebooks
using the Kobo ebook store but in the US
Canada the UK Australia and New Zealand
you could also check out library ebooks
via overdrive which Kobo now owns other
supported formats include ePub PDF and
mobi as well as various image file
formats HTML and comic-book file formats
at $230 the Oro one is fairly pricey but
the value proposition here is that
you're getting a so-called open e reader
that has a large crisp eye ink display
and for those who like to read in the
bathtub or any other body of water it's
also fully waterproof I'm David Carney
for cnet.com that's the Kobo aura one
eReader thanks for watching
