Firefly what really sets the fire phone
apart from all other smartphones arts
gestures with them you can navigate the
phone with the flick or twist of your
wrist here are some of the most useful
ones to get you started the first
gesture and the one you will most often
activate unintentionally is the swivel
with it a flick to the right reveals the
quick action menu and it turned to the
left shows you your notifications and
weather plus in apps that support the
gesture you have other options like site
links and settings in the browser or in
the weather app you can view locations
or the daily forecast auto scroll is
really useful for those times when you
need to navigate down the page of the
article you're reading it's excellent
for when you're commuting and all you
have to do is tilt your phone back to
make it scroll the further back you tilt
the faster it'll go and if you need to
reverse just tilt your phone toward you
and if at any point it gets out of
control and you need to stop scrolling
just tap the screen have you noticed
that something is missing from the home
screen yep the status bar which normally
shows you the time and the battery
percentage is absent well it's there you
just have to peek in order to see it
just tilt the phone slightly to the left
or right to make it appear if you would
rather just see your status bar at all
times you can enable that in the phone's
display settings these gestures do take
some getting used to at first but after
some time they will become second nature
and you can also remember that if at any
time you want to keep it old-school you
can always just use your finger to
perform the same actions if you have any
questions or tips of your own hit me up

to form or Amazon fire phone tips for
