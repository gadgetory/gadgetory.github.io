sitcom and I'm here with the kobo mini
five its claim to fame is that is the
smallest EA creador with a 5-inch screen
and a weight of only four point seven
ounces the plusses for this ereader are
that it is indeed small I can fit in a
lot of pockets it also has a touchscreen
and its price point at $79 is affordable
that said it does have a slightly slower
processor than some of the step-up
models like the Kobo Glo which has a
built-in light and some of the kindle
and nook models this has an 800
megahertz processor so it isn't quite a
zippy the page turns aren't quite as
fast but it's certainly an acceptable
ereader and while the e-ink screen isn't
the latest generation and isn't super
contrast e you can fiddle with the fonts
on these kobo's and get a pretty nice
clear font with these this has an 800 x
600 display so certainly on a smaller
display this is going to be fine for
most people again this is not one of the
more premium Erie ders and the only
reason I can see you getting it is that
you want a smaller ereader that does fit
in a pocket it is certainly cute it
comes in a couple different colors and
you can interchange the backs a couple
other small things worth matching this
does come with two gigabytes of built-in
memory some of that's used up for the
operating system but does store around a
thousand books and it does get about a
month of battery life if you turn the
Wi-Fi off this is a Wi-Fi only ereader
and there is no expansion slot for more
memory so nothing terribly exciting
about the cedar except its size and if
you like its size it is worth
considering otherwise there are
certainly other options at this price
range including models from amazon and
barnes and noble i'm david carr know and
that's the Kobo mini 5-inch thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
