winning and losing and when you get down
to it that goal can be determined by
mere inches for instance the balls here
not a goal you know if any part of the
ball is still touching the line it's not
you've got to be able to see the green
on the other side and with the linemen
so far away it can be really hard to
tell if that ball actually crosses the
line especially if it's in the air to
eliminate any guesswork for referees for
the first time at the World Cup FIFA
will be using goal line technology at
each match there's been so many times
over the past handful of years that
balls you know have been called in and
they're not completely over the line and
vice versa
balls that you know they've called no
goal and it's it's actually gone in
here's how gold controls 4d system works
14 cameras are mounted above the field
seven at each goal they track the ball
as it flies through the air in real time
if it crosses the goal line the software
program transmits a signal to the
referees watched within a second it
claims to be accurate down to five
millimeters and it's encrypted to
prevent hacking as a forward it kind of
kind of against it because I mean it
could take away from some goals that may
or may not have been in but I think
overall for the game I think it's a good
it's a good thing that's the biggest
stage and there's just so much on the
line that you know just clear up those
decisions soccer enthusiasts hope the
technology doesn't change the spirit of
the game I think that the argument is is
just affecting the purity of the game
and the flow of the game there's so much
at stake especially at the highest
levels but accuracy comes at a price
goal control system costs around four
hundred thousand dollars to install in
each Stadium in San Francisco I'm Kara
