latest premium tablet entry well that
depends on your definition of premium it
has a 10.1 inch IPS screen with a 1920 x
1200 resolution however unlike the
previous xperia tablet which had smooth
metal backsides the Z's body is plastic
which kind of takes a few premium points
away also I'm not a huge fan of the edge
design just doesn't feel that
comfortable however the corners are nice
and smoothly rounded the tablet is also
really light for a 10 incher and is the
thinnest 10 incher I've yet seen allow
me to do things like this and the tablet
Z's waterproofing allows me to do stuff
like this what do you think of that you
can submerge the tablet v and up to
three feet of water for up to 30 minutes
or you know you could just run water
over it for fun this is really fun there
are three ports on the Z and as long as
a door to each is snap shut water
shouldn't be able to get in the three
Doors cover ports for the headphone jack
a microSD slot and an image el
connection which is kind of like a micro
USB mixed with an HDMI connection
there's a front-facing 2-megapixel
camera and a rear 8 megapixel camera
each camera includes exmor r tech that
is supposed to allow them to take better
pictures in low-light while low-light
pictures technically do capture more
light the quality of the shots and all
that great pictures taken at normal
lighting conditions however look fine
the Z runs android 4.1 point2 and
includes sony's usual tablet software
suite including video and music
unlimited it's also a PlayStation
Certified giving you access to
PlayStation mobile games games format is
a bit better than the nexus 10 with
slightly higher frame rates in polygonum
games but game levels don't load it as
fast also the D doesn't
be kind of app downloading horsepower
the Nexus 10 dozen large apps to notice
me longer to get to the system over
Wi-Fi profounder bucks to Z get you 16
gigabytes of storage to good cameras and
good performance if you feel
waterproofing would come in handy and
are willing to pay five hundred dollars
for an Android tablet you'll probably
find it difficult to be disappointed by
the Xperia tablet Z i'm eric franklin
and this has been a first look at the
sony xperia tablet z</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
