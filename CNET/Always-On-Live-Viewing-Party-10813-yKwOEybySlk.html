party every week it's been a pleasure
and it's gonna be sad to see always on
ghost was such a massive production and
it brought all these new people in New
really cool people that will probably
stay in touch with you know yeah no I
know I I feel that's the best part about
it was like this whole fun new audience
of people who were just like so excited
so young so international like it was
just a blast um anyway I'm there's a
huge show man like look at the depth of
the show like you went saw spaceships
launching uh drives through it's crazy
how much stuff you guys that one should
have gone to my blog post I was trying
to make this I was like trying to
remember you know I'm like man I jumped
out of a helicopter I ran a half
marathon I like loaded in the air at the
gravity what is that oh yeah when indoor
skydiving and I wrote on an America's
Cup catamaran saw rocket launch like
really yeah I mean it was definitely the
the breath is the perfect way to put it
like it's just we got to do things that
we've never gotten to do before and it
was unbelievable it's been unbelievable
yeah listening to the planning meetings
for your show was painful I mean you'd
be like maybe we could go to Hawaii and
go scuba diving and I'm like I want to
go to Hawaii go scuba Don well yes there
was a little bit of leg good you get on
the download right you just cannot talk
about Hawaii in the office like that's
not cool
uh yeah so there was definitely some of
that and my apologies to everybody who

I'm gone hope it's probably free up a
ton of budget so yeah regulo business

this week's show is awesome I know
you're gonna love it get your tissues
for the end because I me did them um
this is ironically for the like I've had
this amazing outpouring of love and
support today but now this one's gonna
reignite the rage of the Windows Phone
people because it's cut the nokia lumia
1020 blog torture test in it however i
do want to mention that right after this
show or this thing on thursday the blog
post will go up because that is our next
giveaway the nokia lumia 1020 so you
could win it and give it a better home
it deserves it it's a wine themed
episode it also included like another
bucket list thing for me i got to stomp
grapes which i've always wanted to do
always wanted to do was delightful
little behind the scenes by the way you
will notice in this in this shot that
there's a gopro inside the bucket of
grapes that I was stopping because we
were like well maybe we'll get some cool
shots from there and then south so came
in and he was like I just I want you to
know I deleted the footage what because
it was totally like upskirt so maybe
that one is actually lurking out there
somewhere I don't know but it was
hilarious he's like uh ya know we can I
use any of that into the chat room yeah
you know I I'm totally cool if somebody
else wants to do always on I I would
love to be else what else did I know
be replaced at our back you're
absolutely right is the perfect farewell
show with wine it just needs chocolate I
should have brought some wine but yeah
you know what I have my green tea ah go
get some Kleenex waltz playing please
enjoy I'll be back after the show to
save Myka pies all right here we go this
week on always on Oh is really painful
it is
get in there phone 1020 vintage
hi I'm Hollywood and welcome to always
on the show where we take tech into the
real world this week we're in Napa
Valley one of the world's premier wine
destinations there are more than 450
wineries here and as you might imagine
hi tech is having quite an impact we got
to look at some of the tools that are
helping vintners ensure quality in the
fields and in the Box in the hills and
valleys of Northern California's wine
country vintners are using new tech
tools to help them in the winemaking
process
at Donna estates in the Napa Valley head
winemaker Cameron water is using a
technology from oakland-based fruition
sciences it can essentially measure a
binds heartbeat using sensors we're
basically measuring the sap that is
flowing from the roots all the way up
through the vine and out the leaves and
by measuring this app and the flow of
that SAP we can get an idea whether the
vine is under stress and limiting itself
or whether it's essentially running just
fine and so using that we can make
decisions about whether we add
irrigation or whether we withhold
irrigation underneath this foam right
here is this device right here which
measures the flow of the sap through the
vine and the way that it works is that
we have two temperature sensors one at
the beginning one at the end and then we
have a heating element here in the
middle okay so by measuring the
difference for the SAP going in to the
SAP going out we can tell how much sap
is flowing through the run the data is
gathered from the vine and displayed on
this software app it shows on a detailed
graph how much water is needed by the
month by the day even by the minute how
much of a competitive advantage is this
so how much of a difference does it make
in the quality of the line it can make a
huge difference in the quality of the
wine working with this technology we
started dry farming a lot of our
vineyards and I have vineyards today
that I still to this day of not
irrigated this year in 2013 is a very
dry vintage in the Napa Valley and
especially here at Donna estates and so
it can make a real difference
so that's how you make great grapes but
making great grapes doesn't necessarily
guarantee great wine so we visited
palma's winery where they're developing
new tech to keep an eye on the grapes
once they get inside fermentation tanks
to do that Christian Paul math and his
family have built a fermentation dome
that stands as the world's largest
underground reinforced structure or the
equivalent of an 18-story building it's
basically like a giant wine bat case
inside there are 24 fermenters each of
which represents the unique flavors or
terroirs of their vineyards so when you
have 24 tanks and the complexity of
course goes up so we decided to build a
system that helps them make decisions
algorithmically in a general sense we
believe fermentation should be a
constant rate of change over time so
that information goes into what we call
the fermentation schedule because you
plug this in the computer takes this
information and built a trend graph so
we can control things like supply
temperature mixing temperatures and what
do you think is the result I mean so if
you were trying to manage 24 tanks with
no help would you have four great wines
and 20s okay whines you think I think
what would happen is we'd have more
mistakes all of the tanks are also
connected to iPads or iPhones so those
winemakers can be mobile while
monitoring their product 24-7 so using
the iPads at the at the tank means you
don't have to walk back to your
laboratory to get the information you
need it's all there on screen you make
the decision while you have you know the
sample in your hand
for example there are 220 valves behind
all these tanks and they fail sometimes
so from home you get the alert and you
just come here you pull up the valve and
you manually close it we can go back we
can learn from potential mistakes that
we committed in the past and the system
can help in a way help predict problems
before they occur which in the end is
really the whole idea time for us to
take a quick break when we come back it
is crushed time perfectly ripe for our
nokia 1020 torture test welcome back now
you may remember that earlier in the
season we rode tested the Nokia Lumia
1020 that's the smartphone with a 41
megapixel camera it is very attractive
for photographers but I wanted to see
how it can hold up to a crush season and
torture test time for our torture test
of the Nokia Lumia 1020 now the test I
have in mind today isn't the most likely
occurrence but given that it's crushed
season and given the theme of this
week's show I thought we would conduct
our pressure and moisture test with
something special a little crush of my
own I want you to know does it's kind of
a lifelong dream of mine the lifelong
dream didn't involve the phone
squishy but it's pretty awesome anyway
okay get in there phone pic I need to
just come you know what cheat a little
bit in buried put that down in there
okay I hope it isn't like crack this is
super squishy guys I'm making windows
phone wine 1020 vintage it's kind of
slippery phones getting a little
slippery it sees splashing all right
I'm just gonna let it marinate for a
minute grape juice on my hands okay
let's rescue it all right it's pretty
wet I can't do anything with his phone
until I rinse it so sorry dude you're
getting a double dunking huh okay right
work okay let me just remind you again
that I know perfectly well that I'm not
supposed to try to turn the phone on at
this point but here I go okay I felt a
vibration but I'm not seeing much in
terms of the screen definitely does not
want to come back on so I'm gonna try to
dry it out well oh wait it's restarting
you can do it little nokia don't worry
i'll try you out i'll try you later just
show us what you got buddy windows phone
and I'm look at that I'm gonna go to the
gallery I want to see if it was
recording okay it looks like we may have
done some damage to the camera which is
kind of a tragedy although to be honest
I think I'm gonna do more damage to the
camera because you'd think I was gonna
leave out the drop test did you so now
my phone is all sticky and it's starting
to attract bees so I feel like I need to
get rid of it
oh no my phone fell
some water splashed out all around it
and grape juice got a little dirty dirt
snout earnings mud otherwise I don't
really see much damage at all I think we
should try that again a lot of water
came out that time
no physical damage but I can see a
little bit of a den right here but
listen the great thing about these nokia
phones is that they're made like
absolute tanks i really believe that if
something's going to take it out it's
going to be the water well the wine hmm
and that's it but we are going to try to
dry it out and we'll check back in I'm
pulling for this little guy I like the
yellow so here is the bag of rice which
the 1020 has been marinating in for
several weeks now I took it out though
earlier today and I've been charging it
all day so let's see if I can get it to
come on first let's see if I can
remember which one of these buttons that
are totally unlabeled is the power
button I think it's the middle one seems
like that button doesn't even depressed
anymore okay there we go nothing let's
try the bottom button nothing there now
while it was charging the little windows
light was blinking at one point it sort
of restarted itself and gave me the
windows phone logo and then said that
the battery was dead but I think what it
really meant unfortunately was that the
entire phone it's dead it was a valiant
effort but even the thrifty tough nokia
lumia 1020 cannot survive being made
into one alright moving on it is time
for this week's unboxing
inside this box I have a unicorn I know
this box doesn't look unicorn size but
it might as well have one inside it is
the gold iPhone 5s I wear my gold shirt
for the occasion this phone has been so
hard to find that we actually had to
borrow one from a friend to unbox so
it's not totally the unboxing experience
but we went ahead and taped it up just
so that we could feel the vibe all right
let's get this thing out of here and see
if it's all it's cracked up to be okay
already you can see you're getting a
premium experience because look there's
a little shiny gold edge around the
picture on the box it's like I can't
help but make fun of it because it
became such a big deal all right we have
a gold Apple right there gold iPhone 5s
they are going all out
it is Oh actually huh it's like a lot
more gold than I thought it was gonna be
that's not very champagne at all in fact
no is really pimp look how cool it is it
sparkles so the back is Matt as you can
see so it's not quite as sparkly as the
edges but I really like how the bezel
and then the Apple right here are in
fact kind of shiny gold I'm not gonna
lie somewhat premium even though I am
convinced that the scarcity is
artificial still pretty cool okay that's
the goal now before I get totally
mesmerized let's see what else is in the
box not expecting any surprises we have
our usual power brick I actually think
Apple could stop shipping these by now
and just go with the cable cuz really i
got like about 15 of these our little
lightning cable and of course the
earpods in there nice little box and
that is it ok back to the phone alright
let's fire it up I don't care I still
wish it out a bigger screen don't be
trying to seduce me with your shiny gold
prettiness when you're still just the
four-inch screen alright so you know
we'll get to the specs while I fire it
up and go through the configuration and
to see if there's any other gold secrets
looking inside the new iphone 5s comes
with a four-inch screen and three color
options silver space grey or gold it
runs iOS 7 apples graphically overhauled
operating system which includes the
Android like control center and
air-dropped file transfers it has a
motion tracking m7 coprocessor and a new
a7 processor capable of 64-bit computing
apple says the iPhone 5s is at least
twice as fast as the five
in terms of ports the headphone jack
stays on the bottom with the iphone 5s
and then you have a lightning port for
charging it is available in either 16
gigs 32 gigs or 64 gig capacity the
iphone 5s camera stays at eight
megapixels but apple claims major boosts
to the sensor it says the sensor itself
is fifteen percent larger and that the
pixels themselves are physically bigger
one point five microns even if they are
the same number of them the cameras
aperture is larger at F 2.2 and
basically all of this adds up to better
low light exposure to three jump plus
the camera has a new burst mode that
takes full resolution photos at 10 pics
per second that's better than most DSLRs
the iphone 5s records video at 1080p
with more digital stabilization and 3x
digital zoom and the big fun feature
you'll find in the camera is something
called slow-mo mode where you can take a
video in slow motion and set the in and
out points and be a filmmaker in an
instant
in the u.s. sprint AT&amp;amp;T and verizon are
the three carriers offering the iphone
5s under contract while t-mobile sells
it unlocked for six hundred forty nine
dollars for 16 gigs 749 for 32 and 849
for 64 gigs the price with a new
contract is a hundred ninety nine
dollars and ninety-nine cents then of
course the headline feature for the 5s
is the fingerprint sensor which I've
already set up when I turn it on I just
use my thumbprint to unlock the phone
now so far the touch sensor touch ID as
Apple's calling it only works with Apple
apps hopefully there will be an SDK in
the future so that you can use it for
banking apps or any other app that
requires a password it's promising right
now it's probably not the reason to
upgrade although I have to admit it's
kind of growing on me I like to unlock
my phone that way I have to say I did
not expect to be won over by the Gold's
pneus of the gold iPhone 5s but it is
kind of winning me over if you have an
iPhone 4s then do not get in line for
this save your dignity and wait for more
supply but I gotta say for me I think
the gold one is the one to get MC
and now it's time to answer some of your
mail today's email comes from Ben who
writes the LGP 925 might not be the
world's most popular Android cell phone
I personally have never heard of it but
as far as I'm concerned it is the most
durable mine has been dropped several
dozen times it has fallen from a
second-story balcony onto concrete it's
even been run over by a car the only
damage to it thus far it's a chip in the
battery cover which resulted from
freezing it in liquid nitrogen and
throwing it against the wall I decided
to postpone trying to kill it and
luckily so since now my note 2 has
failed the USB connector broke during
normal use but as soon as I get the note
fixed this thing is going through the
ultimate test the 24 hour nitrogen fries
and a 26-story fall let me know if you
want the video then I want that video
that's pretty much all i have to say
about that other than i think i also
need to go buy that phone and i have
some good news for all of you the
always-on torture test sweepstakes is
back go to our blog cnet com / always on
to find out what we're given away and
how you can win it and of course keep
the feedback coming email me always on

facebook or google+ that's it for this
week everyone and i'm sorry to say that
that is also a wrap for always on i have
had an amazing time working on this show
and i could not be more grateful to the
people who worked on it and to all of
you for watching it next week we'll have
the highlights from season five
including some of our amazing torture
tests from this past season and i hope

such a vowel they're free to welcome
back everybody now you remain you remain
what the hell this is Lulu solid 32
oh good one good one
I just really want to point out that
Chris now is just a mean bastard with
that well I editor Krista with the lake
with the the like dramatic sad music oh
yeah I saw that yesterday and I was just
like Oliver Stephen just reminded me
that in virtually every single episode
of always on I have shrieked into light
this is the best day yeah she's dumping
in the grapes they ever I'm sorry I I
know you said it when you were skydiving
yep definitely know I've said it yeah I
mean you're totally right i would say
that on eighty percent of the episodes
there's been some point where I was like
this is best i ever because it was just
that kind of show it's just that kind of
show this makes me feel like a crazy
person but i am with or back who says i
feel more happy than I feel sad because
he's excited for what's next for me and
I really really appreciate that
sentiment because I too am excited about
what's next yeah you're walking out the
door but you're opening 100 other doors
yeah so I'm think I'm watching movies
are endless a forest of doors yeah and
if I totally Biff it and I suck out
there in the world and pretty sure that
scene they'll take me back oh of course
mad I did that once before and I came
crawling back crawling back like what
why um so for those of you in the chat
room who have asked about always on
always on is is really my baby I mean
that's a show that I developed and
executive produced and budgeted and all
of that stuff so I don't think I
suggested it actually I said you know
what's cool with me if you want to find
another host for always on but that did
not fly they don't want to do that and
and I think that's understandable like
it's you know it's kind of Intel ibly my
show um so that that particular product
is ending I trust that cnet is going to
find somebody wonderful to come in here
and develop a new show and they're
committed to video and great content and
hope I have some pretty girl to look a
soon um I don't know but I
you know that I am excited I'm extremely
excited about what's next I hope you
