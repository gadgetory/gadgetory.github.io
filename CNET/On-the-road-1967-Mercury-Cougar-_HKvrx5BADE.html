lincoln-mercury pronounces Mustang we
drive the all-new Mercury Cougar I
checked the tech well Mercury's finally
got their pony car and yes based very
much on the mechanicals of the Mustang
but you're never gonna mistake the two
on the road in fact the Cougar and the
Mustangs share no sheetmetal they have a
different wheelbase as well this guy's
111 inch axle two axle the Mustang is
three inches shorter Cougar devotes its
extra length to longer more compliant
leaf springs and a little more room for
the legs in the back other unique
identifiers are of course that cougar
face with what people are already
calling the electric shaver front end
with standard hidden headlights
sequential taillights in the back are
standard as well
and Ford's offering an electric sunroof
on Cougars the first I've ever installed
from the factory inside all Cougars is a
sporting european-style cockpit you've
got a three spoke sport wheel this by
the way has collapsible impact
technology as well as a padded center
hub for safety on the left is your
speedometer in the main pod on the right
the other main pod has not only a fuel
gauge but also a temperature gauge and
an oil pressure and amp light the center
clock is optional climate control
includes heaters standard you can delete
that if you like air conditioning is
optional the turn signal if you order a
speed control is going to have a knob on
the end of it to actuate and disable it
now the entertainment options your entry
level rig is going to be an AM radio
with full transistorized chassis and
five preset buttons step up from there
with an AM stereo tape all integral or
go-to AM and FM radio but then you lose
the table
clever little storage bin down here with
a rollup kind of chrome piano top
now most Cougars are going to ship with
a c3 automatic it's a three-speed
automatic plus reverse with a chrome
t-handle shifter right here there's also
a three on the tree manual it's gonna be
pretty rare in the middle is going to be
the four-speed four on the floor manual
gearbox now the xr7 which we don't have
here would add gauges across the center
of the dash here you'll also get some
toggle switches a roof console leather
and vinyl upholstery we have all vinyl
in this vehicle now speaking of safety
the 67 cougar also has a full padded -
padded pillar over here and a breakaway
rear view mirror headrests remain
optional however in that same place you
might instead choose to hang a
television from the dealer you can get a
9 inch black and white fill code TV with
custom-made hooks that hang right over
the back of the seat for your rear seat
passengers seat belt includes a tongue
side retractor standard on all four
positions around the car
another big differentiator between
Cougar and Mustang lies under the hood
these guys do not come with any kind of
a6 they're all v8 the most popular is
gonna be this one here the 289 two
barrel
good for 200 horsepower 282 foot-pounds
of torque zero to 60 a coin to Motor
Trend is about 11 seconds for a car that
weighs a tick over 3,000 pounds observed
mpg just under 16 you can also get this
engine with dual exhaust a four-barrel
carb and a nine point eight to one
compression ratio and that gives you 225
horsepower or just go all the way with a
390 cubic inch engine in the cougar GT
that's good for 320 horse
lincoln-mercury is not kidding when they
say this car has some of that Lincoln
fine car touch maybe good marketing copy
but it's actually relatively true and
then quite a bit quieter car in general
it comes out to be a more sedate
sounding and a little less hotly sprung
Mustang that also means high marks for
the base engine this 289 2 barrel is a
willing runner you really feel that
hefty biased toward torque at 282 pounds
and because we have the optionally added
dealer-installed Shelby style exhaust we
get a good note
the only sour note in our car is the
fact that we do not have the optional
power disc brakes
we have unassisted four-wheel drums
there adequate but coming down a road of
uneven pavement and having to make a
relatively hard stop you need to hang on
and try and guess which way it's gonna
pull
okay let's price our cougar the base car
as I mentioned has a v8 the 289 two
barrel and configured thusly or just
under three thousand dollars now come a
number of options emission controls are
50 dollars and 64 cents our automatic
transmission just under two hundred and
seven dollars power steering 95 that
sports consoles fifty seven dollars we
have the AM radio at sixty bucks but I'm
intrigued by the AM stereo sonic tape at
one eighty eight fifty more of that
European sports car look for just eighty
four dollars that gets you the vinyl
Oxford roof all in our test car was some
of those features but not all of them is
36 fifty and change the Cougar lies
somewhere between Mustang and
Thunderbird it brings a more compliant
ride and also a quieter ride thanks to
over a hundred pounds more sound
deadening than a Mustang it fits
somewhere in the range of the person who
wants more of a GT than a sports car
with that European touch
