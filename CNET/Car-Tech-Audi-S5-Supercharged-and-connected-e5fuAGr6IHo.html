director vice-president I would get the
Audi s5 this car is really beautiful has
brilliant handling and just excellent
cabin electronics the audi s5 is the
sport version of Audi a5 coupe as a
coupe it's only got two doors but it
does have four seats although the rear
seats are pretty small pretty cramped I
wouldn't want to spend a lot of time
back there this is a premium level car
fairly expensive of course for cabin
tech we have an older generation of
audi's MMI Multimedia Interface that's
this dial with some buttons on the
console here which controls content on
the screen in newer generation Audi z--
we have a touchpad which is a little
easier to use for entering alphanumeric
information when I go to navigation here
I get this really cool thing out he's
been doing for a little while
integrating Google Earth with navigation
system so what I'm looking at is
satellite imagery of my immediate
surroundings that's brought in through a
3G data connection in newer Audi's you
actually get 4G we also have Google
search integrators the navigation system
and a few data services which are pretty
cool like fuel prices and weather now
for audio we have an onboard hard drive
HD radio satellite radio bluetooth
streaming and also these SD card slots
in the dashboard here and in the glove
compartment we have the Audi music
interface which is a proprietary port
with these various adapter cables for
iPhones and USB drives it's not very
convenient and I just wish he would use
a standard USB port for all devices that
you plug into the car for the audio
system we have 10 speakers 180 watt
amplifier that's standard but for $850
we can upgrade to a Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen
system with 14 speakers 505 watts of
amplification that's a great deal and I
would definitely recommend it
first I want to talk about a couple of
unique features in this car one it's got
all-wheel drive
that's Audi's Quattro all-wheel drive
system now this particular car also has
the optional sport differential that
actually shifts torque across the rear
wheels it is just so much fun it does
such a good job what it does is it over
drives the outside rear wheel and a turn
and that leads to what engineers call a
yaw moment pushing the back end around
and just giving you just this excellent
turning character the other unique thing
about this car is the engine has a
supercharger this is an Eaton
supercharger that's how we get 333
horsepower out of this three liter v6
engine
now that engine power is going to all
four wheels through a six-speed manual
transmission
I wouldn't scoff at anybody for getting
that dual clutch transmission because it
works really well it's out ease S tronic
transmission daddy doesn't have a sport
mode per se what they have is called
dynamic mode what I don't have in this
car is the adaptive suspension so right
now because of the compromised fixed
suspension it's pretty good it's
comfortable enough for everyday driving
but it really seems to keep the car nice
and flat in the turn so I'm really
really enjoying how this suspension
feels that something could actually
really bring the trackdays you wouldn't
be the fastest car on the track but you
do all right base price for the 2015
audi s5 is $52,500
now there's two options you're deathly
gonna want is the sport differential for
$1100 and the adaptive suspension for
$1,000
throw in the tech package for $2,900
that gets you that navigation system
$850 get you the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen audio
system that's a total of fifty thousand
three hundred fifty dollars</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
