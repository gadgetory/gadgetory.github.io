I'm about to have a conversation with a
robot because that's what you do at Tech
West right
I'm here with Softbank robotics and they
make the pepper robot now people might
be familiar to you but what we're going
to do today is simulate what it would be
like to walk into a retail store and
pick up an online order from a robot now
I've ordered a t-shirt I've taken a
photo of my face and that's how pepper
is going to recognize me when I get into
the store now let's go in and I'll pick
up my shirt hi pepper hi Claire I
presume you're here to pick up your
online order do I have that right yes
great I thought so here is what I have
on file for you does everything look
right we can order yes okay great I'll
let the team know you're here for your
order while we wait other users who
bought this t-shirt also bought these
items would you like to add any of these
items to your order please click on any
products that enjoy SKU you have two
options for purchase you can have it
brought up with your order by instant
checkout or I can give you in storage
directions to the item which would you
prefer give me directions directions it
is you can find that item in the section
of the store to my left it will be
located on the fifth round the second
item from the right okay thanks pepper
I'm gonna take my t-shirt and because I
bought some activewear peppers actually
recommended that I get some deodorant
which is probably a good idea for CES
anyway so it's actually spoken to this
robot here which is called tally and
this is a robot that's able to
intelligently scan shelves like you'd
have at a supermarket say and pick up
how many items are on the Shelf now this
is really important for fast moving
consumer goods like deodorants or things
you might buy in a supermarket in fact
they're already using RFID chips on
products in stores to be able to scan
those and tell how many items are on the
shelf now tally is really intelligent
we'll just continue to scan the shelves
but won't knock me over if I get in its
way soldier
well excuse me tally I'm just gonna walk
through and get my deodorant that pepper
so helpfully recommended I probably need
and she said you go coconut all right
that's me so this robot here Tully is
communicating with pepper and giving
information to retailers in real time so
saying things like this is how much
consumers are spending this is what
they're buying and this is their average
cart size now a retailer can use that
information to feed it back and get a
sense of what products are going well
and maybe say all right well we're
really not moving much of this coconut
deodorant maybe we should put a deal on
that these kinds of robots are in stores
now but they're going to become much
more common so they're in banks like
HSBC they're being used for education
purposes for kids and they're also being
used in as I said earlier hospitality
situations retail stores anywhere you
might have an easy customer service
interaction that can be replaced by a
robot you may see pepper soon so don't
be surprised if you pick up your order
from a robot and it tells you to buy
some deodorant because that's what Cs is
all about right all right thanks guys
it's been really fun we've got plenty
more to come from Tech West so make sure
you stay tuned to see that and we'll
have plenty more from the show floor ok
thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
