product spotlight and what is our
favorite TV of the year this is the
Panasonic ST 50 series I'm sitting next
to the 55 inch version this series also
comes in a 50 a 60 and a 65 inch version
so if you're looking for a small TV this
isn't it but if you're in that great
sweet spot for the living room or larger
then this is a quite an excellent choice
the SD 50 is a plasma TV we consider
plasma a better choice for picture
quality in general than LED or LCD TVs
we'll get to some of the picture quality
bits in a little bit but first let's
start off with the styling here this set
for plasma is a pretty slim bezel around
the edge of the screen there's also this
sort of acrylic border oxy through the
stand swivels the base is also a silver
color to offset the black around the
edge all told the styling is pretty
slick on this set Panasonic's smart TV
includes Netflix Amazon video on-demand
and Hulu Plus it also has Rhapsody for
subscription music and Pandora for
people who just want the free radio
action of course plenty of other apps
are available on the smart tv suite we
also like the organization of Smart TV
it's got great big tiles that you can
move around and adjust to your liking
what we didn't like is the prevalent
advertising within Smart TV you can
actually disable some of the pop-up ads
but some of them you can't get rid of
and that's kind of a downside of
Panasonic's system
other features include 3d but Panasonic
doesn't throw in any 3d glasses you'll
have to purchase active 3d glasses on
the upside this TV is compatible with
Samsung's glasses which are as
inexpensive as $20 of course the main
reason we really like this set is its
picture quality to price ratio this TV
scored a nine and our picture quality
evaluations which is right up there with
the very best TVs of the year and better
than any LED we've reviewed this year
the sets deep black levels and extremely
accurate color as well as its excellent
screen uniformity is something that LED
TVs cannot boast our rut helped put it
over the top it also has a very good
bright room performance which puts it a
little bit above Panasonic step down
less expensive model so again the
picture is universally better in a lot
of lighting conditions of course if it's
a very bright room that you might want
to go with LED but on the flip side this
TV will outperform pretty much any LED
on the market the SD 50 also has plenty
of connectivity including three HDMI
inputs a pair of USB ports and a SD card
slot which really sets the SD 50 apart
however it
performance compared to the other
excellent tvs that cost a lot more it's
a lot less expensive than Panasonic's
flagship models it's also a little bit
less than the equivalent Samsung TVs
although those TVs also perform
extremely well the SD 50 is our overall
value champ it's scored a 10 in that
category so you do get such great
picture quality for a relatively
inexpensive price that's a quick look at
Panasonic's TCPS t 50 series our
editor's choice and favorite TV of the
year on David Katz my receipt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
