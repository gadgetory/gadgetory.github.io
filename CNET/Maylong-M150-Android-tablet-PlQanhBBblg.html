a first look at the May long m150
Android tablet also known as the $99
Walgreens tablet in full disclosure we
paid closer to one hundred and thirty
dollars but really this thing is a bad
value no matter what you pay for it
it may look like an offspring of the
iPad and the Galaxy Tab but this
unfortunate thing is a bait-and-switch
in every possible way the button on the
front looks like a home button but it's
actually a back key the app market on
the menu takes you to a clearinghouse of
free apps that no one wants the clunky
resistive display on the front is
covered with a worthed plastic and if
you want to get anything done you're
best off using the included stylus all
of the icons for the stock Android 1.6
apps have been given a pointless
makeover just - ugh things up and if you
want to sync this back to your computer
good luck the port on the bottom here
that looks like a dock connector is
actually there to work with this
included adapter which adds two USB
ports and a feature we've all been
asking for an Ethernet port that's right
you can Ethernet port but you don't
actually have a way to USB sync this
over to your computer and transfer
content instead the best you get is a
micro SD card slot that allows you to
add media also on the bottom you'll find
speakers a headphone jack and the power
adapter socket that works with the
included wall wart just don't lose it
because we'll be recharging this every
few hours even if you're just doing some
light web browsing the bottom line is
that this thing's more trouble than it's
worth and it's also a case study and how
these kinds of budget Android tablets
can be disappointing if you're shopping
around is $100 to $200 price range a
newer used iPod Touch is going to
deliver an infinitely better experience
though with a smaller screen so there
you go that's the Walgreens tablet
demystified if you spot one in the wild
or something like it
I would steer clear no matter how good a
bargain see
serious calm on bail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
