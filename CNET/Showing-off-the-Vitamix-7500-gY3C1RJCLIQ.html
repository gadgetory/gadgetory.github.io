got the Vitamix 7500 it is a very very
powerful blender as you probably know
Vitamix makes high-end machines this
one's no different it's got a 2.2
horsepower motor and the 64 ounce jar
can hold a lot of different things and
pulverize the crap out of them it's
actually a very simple machine you've
got this variable dial that will give
you precise control from 1 to 10 you can
pulse over here or turn it on full speed
for as long as you want over here
but man it's tempting I really want to
put everything in this blender and just
destroy it and demolish it and make
soups out of everything this blender can
do it our tests were very conclusive
it's a very powerful blender we put
blocks of cheese in it we put pesto in
it we put nuts in to make butter it did
everything it never failed us so this is
a great blender but very expensive the
big question with the Vitamix here is is
it worth it because it costs five
hundred and twenty-nine dollars this is
a very expensive household appliance and
there are very good blenders that cost a
lot less we solve the Breville
hemisphere control do very well in our
tests the ninja ultimate was very
successful kitchenaid diamond blender
was great so those all cost at least
three hundred dollars less if not more
why should you pay that much more for
the Vitamix seventy five hundred I'm not
convinced that you should i do think
Vitamix a--'s are good blenders and if
you have one the chances are that you
love it and use it every day but Vitamix
has blenders that don't cost quite as
much as this one that are still very
good the vitamix 6200 is about eight
dollars cheaper and it's basically the
same machine it's a little taller the
jar is a little narrower it has the same
volume it's it's the same amount of
things it has the same motor basically
two it's two horsepower versus this
one's 2.2 horsepower I just don't know
that this has enough unique features or
an edge over the other Vitamix models to
justify upgrading or getting this one so
I'd probably go the less expensive one
if you wanted a Vitamix or you can go
with one like the Ninja or the Breville
that's going to cost a lot less if
you're a foodie that wants to cook every
day and make smoothies and soups and
really get a lot of use out of your
blender it might be a worthwhile
investment it can do a lot of other
things like kneading dough so it can be
a very versatile piece of equipment for
your kitchen and if you're going to use
it like that might be worth the cost but
if you just want a good blender there
are a lot of good ones out there that
don't cost as much so take a look at
those as well we've seen it I'm right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
