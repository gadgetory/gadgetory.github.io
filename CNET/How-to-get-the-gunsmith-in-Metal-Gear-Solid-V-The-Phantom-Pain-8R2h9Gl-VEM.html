solid 5 the phantom pain you're still
fairly early into the game there's an
unlockable feature that you probably
want to rush towards it's the gunsmith
weapon customization and I wish I knew
about it earlier so seriously consider
putting down those side quests and
unlock the gunsmith ASAP without
spoiling too much to unlock this feature
you'll need to complete mission 13 pitch
dark and then completing the 3 legendary
gunsmith side ops 107 to 109 finish
these and you my friend are ready to
lose hours to gun sniffing at this point
in time I hope you saved some GMP
because if you haven't bought many
weapon upgrades already you're going to
have a tough time using the gunsmiths
full potential the key here is to
purchase upgrades in one type of weapon
category ie the more assault rifle
upgrades you buy the more custom options
you have for that weapon class so
ideally you can serve GMP to unlock
weapon upgrades for classes you wish to
gunsmith and those are your early stages
to gunsmith and right there try your
best to focus on two or more weapon
classes here I focused on sniper an
assault rifle and create two iterations
of each short and long ranged here we
have an Mrs for base with an S barrel
for high firing speed and extended
banana mad clip now pair this puppy up
with the long ranged m2000 d sniper
rifle base and it ran off HP barrel for
that extra long range and then a 22 a
time scope oh now we're talking but
here's another scenario say you want to
carry a rocket launcher or tranq sniper
in that second primary slot but still
want to retain long distance sniping
meet both ways by customizing a longer
range to stall class rifle start off
with the longer range un arc base
attached of bamboo Toph barrel for some
additional range and then tech on a 2 x
booster optic with a red dot closing the
gap between range and Close Encounters
those are just two examples of loadouts
you can customize and that's only at
twenty-four percent game completion
meaning down the road you're going to
find yourself continually shaping and
customizing your weapon layouts if you
have any hot combos of your own put them
in the car
section below thanks for watching and be
careful down there soldier
