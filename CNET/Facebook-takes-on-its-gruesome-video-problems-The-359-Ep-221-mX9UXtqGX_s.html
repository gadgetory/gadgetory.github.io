the 359 podcast last time I checked it's
episode 221 and in the House today is
Alfred Inge and Ben Fox Rubin and it's
going to be a bit of a dour episode yeah
my understanding it's gonna be a tough
one guys so if you want to click out you
don't want to talk about Facebook's
grisly video problem you know we wanted
to make that very clear in the headline
that this is what we're going to discuss
because we do think it's important and
something that has been getting a lot of
attention a lot of conversation in the
tech world I realize that we do talk a
lot about gadgets devices newest you
know fun technologies that kind of thing
a lot on the podcast but today we do
want to focus on this more serious issue
about murders and suicides that do get
posted on Facebook and Facebook live but
to lighten up the episode a little bit
more later on we will talk about Apple's
earnings which were also reported on
last night yeah I'm gonna throw
something in while I'm saying if I'm you
know for everyone that loves to make fun
of Apple in our chats yes a love you can
still do that but you will get also it
will happen Murdoch yeah we got to be
serious for a bit yeah all right let's
do it
so on that note we'll be back we look
forward to discussing with you this
rather serious topic a little out of
character for us but hey once in a while
you got to get real so here we go we're
going to record the podcast be back
seeing the chat send in your comments
and questions in 3 minutes and 59
seconds from 3 to
sorry welcome to the 359
phox Ruben I'm Alfred Aang Mark
Zuckerberg has been getting harsh
criticism for Facebook's slow response
to taking down grizzly videos of murders
and suicides on the social site in
response he said this morning that the
company will be hiring an additional
3,000 people to monitor and remove
gruesome videos hate speech and child
exploitation on Facebook thoughts well
they already they've already had a team
4500 people but you know obviously it
wasn't enough you take a look at the
last month of you know just gruesome
videos that have popped up on Facebook a
man in Cleveland was murdered a man in
Thailand like committed suicide and
killed a killed a child like before and
you know Facebook's been catching a lot
of flak for this even though things like
this happen on Twitter and on YouTube as
well right but the issue is you know
with Facebook there they've got you know
1.1 billion users and when you have that
kind of space you know and it's being
broadcasted live you know give people a
platform they're attracted to this kind
of thing where you know they get an
audience like this well not only that
too but I think that in certain
instances YouTube has been better at
taking down some of these videos whereas
Facebook was seen as being a little too
slow to respond which is why I think
that they probably decided to beef up
their operations and hire this many more
people and I think the important thing
in here is that they're not just hiring
you know more people to watch and take
the videos down but they're also
proactively taking action you know in
real life so that Mark Zuckerberg talked
about a situation where last week
somebody had you know went on Facebook
live and told the world that he was
going to kill himself and it was
reported in time luckily and Facebook
was able to contact the authorities
based off of you know where this
person's like Facebook account was
logged in from where the phone was at
and they were able to contact law
enforcement and they were able to stop
him before anything worse happened you
know that's a lucky situation there's so
many more scenarios where you know it's
been seen and broadcasted live where
it's been especially gruesome so face
yeah bad thing has already happened yes
so Facebook is beefing up you know
reporting tools people watching over the
reports which they say they get millions
of reports of
and also making it easier for them to
contact law enforcement based off of
that so how much do you think this is
actually hurting Facebook's brand and
making it more difficult or less likely
for people to want to go on Facebook
because they feel like it's not a good
space for them to spend their time I
don't know so much that it's hurting
Facebook's brand so much as it's hurting
Facebook lives brand because they're
trying to encourage people to go on this
you know they think Facebook live for
them is supposed to be a platform I'll
watch this watermelon explode or watch
the rock you know
roast Kevin Hart for some reason and now
it's becoming this thing was like I
don't want to go on this because like I
don't want to randomly stumble across
something really nasty yeah yeah all
right next up lighten it up a little bit
to end the show the iPhone 7 is helping
Apple Reba rebound its iPhone sales
after it's all weaker demand last year
for its latest quarterly earnings
reported last night Apple reported
stronger results thanks to more people
buying the pricier iPhone 7 plus I mean
all of us are still really interested in
what's going to happen in September so
does this really matter or are we gonna
hold our breath I will say I hope that
this doesn't make it kind of like a set
set a trend for Apple wears oh well we
can just make our phones more expensive
and people will still buy them and we'll
still make more money and sell less
phones because but exactly what happens
yeah that's exactly what happened and I
hope it doesn't lead to a future trend
where all these phones are just getting
more expensive because you know if they
can sell less and make more money like
wouldn't that make way more sense just
keep doing that I think that might be
what's going to end up happening I mean
like there are rumors that they're gonna
create this like super top high-end
anniversary edition phone in September
that could be like $1,000 and I just
hope that they still have a low market
phone because I personally hate that
like when companies do that great well
that's about it if you want to read more
about these stories check us out on CNN
I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm alfred Aang thanks
for listening
all right so elephant in the room this
is going to be a tough one to garner
chatter from but hopefully we can get a
bit of a dialogue going this is truly
become kind of a horrifying issue and I
don't want to undersell it in any way
shape or form but how the hell did we
get here you know it's it's a situation
where you give somebody a platform and
they abuse it but this is next level you
know you didn't see this when public
access TV came out because it was vetted
and monitored and managed and programmed
how did they put that into place with
these 3,000 employees of Facebook that's
a really good question I think Alfred
pointed to the fact that when you have a
platform that's this big it just results
in people wanting to broadcast this kind
of stuff unfortunately I mean and on top
of that there are you know it's it's
close to two billion people I think
they'd go on Facebook monthly which it
just means that even if you get point
zero zero one percent of the videos that
get posted on there being these types of
grizzly videos well it's going to happen
and it's also going to garner a lot of
attention when it does happen because
it's it's like shocking it's unavoidable
stuff the thing is with a lot of
criminals is that they aim for notoriety
where they want to be you know the next
like big name kind of thing so with the
situation in Cleveland I mean even when
he was broadcasting alive he was kind of
advertising for the next one where he
was saying you know I'm going to keep
killing and broadcasting it live it's
not a matter of you know being a
criminal and saying I like being on the
lam where they don't want to be caught
it's is they want people to know their
names and know who they are and then
when you have a platform like Facebook
where you know the entire world can see
what you're doing I mean that's very
enticing for somebody who wants their
names like out there and this has just
been a thing that then going on with
like criminal psychology that's been
going on for a really long time like it
goes all the way back to like Jack the
Ripper who would like leave notes son of
Sam who would send his letters to the
you know newspapers this is pretty much
just the evolution of that man that is
messed up I mean like but that's that's
like really being pushed into hyperdrive
because it's not regionalised or
nationalized this is something where
like the Cleveland situation
was international and it was
international very quickly so that's
really unfortunate that we have gotten
to this point just to affirm Assad in
the chat is asking if we're referring to
the killing situation on Facebook
recorded live and yes that is
unfortunately what we are talking about
today
Josh extends on your thought alfred
where the crimes come from people
looking to go down for the infamy of
their crimes yeah it's absolutely the
case but how do we not how is this not
further punished against you know
somebody is essentially broadcasting
their location
you know everybody's phone is traceable
how are these people not immediately
brought to justice uh in certain well
I'll let you take that one well it's
very difficult to report it to law
enforcement like immediately when it
happens
that's what Facebook is having a lot of
trouble with right now and then it's you
know to report it like that quickly and
then to reach Facebook's desk like
before like anything bad happens it's
it's very difficult for law enforcement
for that to work for that you know
Facebook would like need their own like
police force or something like that to
be able to dispatch on their own like in
every state or right wherever Facebook
is used which again is very difficult
and that that's the problem here I mean
the most they can do is hire like more
people to moderate these so they can get
you know they can at least respond fast
they can get to these reports faster
they can get the reports to the police
in the corresponding state faster but
the the unfortunate issue as far as like
punishment goes like somebody most of
the times people don't get arrested for
this like in the case of the Cleveland
guy while police were like searching for
him he ended up just like killing
himself to in a standoff the situation
in Thailand was similar where that was a
murder-suicide so it's really like
notoriety any of these sick people who
go in and shoot up a school right sound
so crass they're not looking to get out
this the other side yeah yeah
unfortunately which means that like when
you have a platform like this it's a way
for them as we've been talking about you
get the immediacy of that notoriety and
you're not really looking to get away
you know yeah that's that's what
happened two years ago in Virginia too
but this one was on periscope instead
right where the
the two reporters were shot live on air
oh yeah both when they were live on TV
and his own like periscope right yeah
man that was really that was a tough one
to know let's not pretend that there
aren't always going to be sick people
out there doing sick things it's just
disturbing how easy that it becomes part
of our front page anymore you know I
think what's interesting or unfortunate
about it is is that Zuckerberg and you
know the other Facebook folks go and
they present concepts like Facebook live
as like isn't this fun isn't this
interesting and it like when was it
introduced just last year no we like
longer than that probably like two years
ago
so either way - yeah we're still we're
still very much in the early days of
this and it's already like turned into a
pretty unfortunate Pandora's box I've
certainly wondered like would they ever
get rid of Facebook live I really don't
see that as a possibility but let's be
honest here it's not Facebook's fault
you know it's simply as long as there is
an avenue for someone to broadcast and
there always will be from this point on
forward till forever and ever it's not
Facebook's fault if Twitter beat them to
the live video thing to be Twitter's
problem and like you said periscope I
mean he'll live stream there's a
thousand different platforms out there
this could be happening on of course it
the volume is there due to the sheer
size of Facebook mm-hmm that's all it
really whittles down - right so are they
also on top of the monitoring I also do
wonder if they're going to try to create
a few more hoops - for folks to jump
through if they actually do want to go
live like I know that's the thing you
know the smart thing to do would to be
basically be able to monitor it on
Facebook life before it's broadcasted
but then one that's not exactly live
anymore and it's the purpose and -
everyone can lie on that you know it's
not like somebody's gonna fill out like
some kind of form saying what they're
going on for right Facebook will no
that's not perhaps there should just
simply be more restrictions as far as
what accounts are allowed to broadcast
live maybe just the average user
especially something like perhaps a
throwaway account that could be created
just for instances like this there needs
to be some kind of they're like more in
pensive verification process and I got
that blue check
yeah but then let that goes into that
dig digs into a deeper issue of
basically like censorship on Facebook's
and there's a lot of scenarios where
there's like police brutality I don't
move on that like it it gets outed on
Facebook live and then in one scenario I
can't remember like where exactly to
happen but I know what happened last
July where a man was shot by a police
officer and it was on Facebook live and
Facebook took it down and everyone rail
rallied against Facebook saying like why
are you censoring this kind of like and
it fit oh it fit the bill for the other
situation its brutality yeah but I no
matter how you spin it
yes who really needs to butter Manning
to see it
that's a newish it was actually West it
was it was in that particular case that
was deemed as newsworthy and I think
Facebook did actually end up putting
that back on they did um so the the I
mean like but that really just presents
how complicated this is is we're
literally a shooting or a killing isn't
the baseline where you say if it's a
shooting or killing it should never go
on Facebook apparently not so that just
shows how hard and how complicated the
problem is for yeah Facebook or as you
said you know Twitter Google you know
with YouTube any of these guys and even
it is certainly not a question I would
want you have to answer mm-hmm and even
even things that aren't like as gruesome
as like a suicide or a murder like there
was a video last year this mother like
basically beating her teen daughter like
on Facebook life as like a punishment
yep and she did it on the girls account
so all her friends saw which like wow
just multiple levels of off use and
Facebook kept that video up for like a
really long time until it had been
reported and that's that's the other
issue too like it's parenting and it
goes on in the home and it's awful but
at the same time it's like this is abuse
you know and people really shouldn't
have to see this on on Facebook and I
think ultimately a lot of people really
just had the problem of Facebook slow
response it wasn't so much as it because
I appreciate what you're saying as far
as like how how much should really be
blaming Facebook for this but at the
same time we should blame Facebook hey
I'm not here trying to over defend
anything no not at all I'm just
we should rest something oh so
horrifying right my argument is we
should blame them if they're not
responding to it appropriately they're
too slow to respond to it and Zuckerberg
has obviously shown the point that we
don't have enough resources that's why
we're going to hire an additional 3,000
people and right
the problem with this is you know unlike
videos that are already just just
normally uploaded to Facebook or photos
that are normally uploaded to Facebook
they can't do algorithms that scrub like
videos while their life and being
broadcasted like they have you know BOTS
that you know can track down like any
kind of like child pornography or like
graphic images that if they see if the
bot spots it it'll automatically like
take it down yeah but they can't do that
for live so that's why they need to hire
like all these like thousands of more
people right it's just sad that we've
gotten to this point and for the record
I do applaud Facebook for this effort
we'll have to come back and redress the
question whether this will be enough and
how it will actually pan out in the long
run but let's jump into the chat because
we're getting some really good feedback
uh Scott points out that no matter what
platform unfortunately this will happen
but surely Facebook has rolled us out
quick surely they should have rolled out
Facebook live country-by-country and
scaled up slowly that's a fair argument
and maybe they should have - great point
a better trial process to kind of see
where people help you yet their original
trial process was we're only giving it
to select celebrities that like the rock
was like one of the first people on and
they did it from a red carpet then their
second stage was we're only giving it to
verified users so journalists all these
people could use it and then it was it's
going to be available to everybody which
makes no sense because there you can't
get a gauge of the public by we're only
giving it to news organizations and
celebrities because they're not gonna
there they don't have the same mindset
that you know the entire world has
totally it makes no sense is it to have
that like kind of roll out
yeah yeah just uh to be fair though
let's let's be honest and take a bit of
a light air on this for a second most
people suck at it yeah at Facebook live
it live yeah I mean that is a very good
point that we're talking about present
company possibly included
but we are talking about an extremely
small percentage like an infinite bit
like like a really really tiny
percentage of the actual Facebook live
videos but you know if they're it's
creating a problem regardless like
obviously one or two of these is too
much yeah this is the problems like live
in general I I don't see the Internet's
like insatiable demand like and like why
they want everything to be live
currently is it just doesn't make that
much sense it's just a trend right yeah
it's it remember just even a couple of
years ago live was almost a dirty word
everybody wanted on-demand and now live
it's become kind of fun then right now
we've already ruined it because yeah
it's unfortunately you like it's very
hard to moderate things that are going
on live like even like professional like
teams on like Saturday Night Live or
like during the Grammys or anything like
that if something goes wrong like that's
it like you can't do anything to kind of
take that back
so you know giving that kind of ability
for everyone or broadcast it is weird
it's very short-sighted on on Facebook's
and to do something like this where you
know we have all these millions billions
of people that are using it that anybody
can see at any time and we're going live
with it what could possibly go wrong
yeah I just like the comment from Yasu
says you can't blame the internet for
all things people are doing and
expanding on that don't worry comments
are the gun manufacturers at fault for a
shooter no but they do have major
regulations as an excellent point to
bring up it's not you know what's that
what's the phrase cuz guns don't kill
people people kill people yeah sure so
how how is it exactly is this Facebook
initiative 3000 3000 more moderate
moderators going to pan out I'm very
eager to see because it's very very
disturbing I mean chances are they're
probably going to hire even more people
after that like adding 3,000 there will
be 7,500 I still don't think that's
enough right global population millions
of reports a week yeah for like 7,500
people there's no way that being said it
seems like a fairly robust number maybe
it isn't as far as like one could make
the argument that it's just a band-aid
or it's not nearly enough and we'll just
have to follow up and
say no and now solution is you know
what's wrong with the human race I guess
so but like it goes back to my point of
understand that video is where a lot of
the money is being made these days and
this is this is what a lot of the
audience once and if 99.99% of people
are actually doing it reasonably why get
rid of it entirely however that very
very small segment is is causing
enormous problems and is really I think
is creating a lot of harm for Facebook
if not just Facebook live so I've got a
little more input from land of fire says
charge them for it when charging them
monitor them honestly that's a noble
thought but I do not think that I'm
imposing any kind of fee to use Facebook
live would stop somebody who ultimately
thinks like well I'm going to end my own
life well it would it would stop the
hordes of reports coming in I think is a
thing so instead of like them having to
deal with oh why is this birthday party
being reported for Facebook live oh it's
just like a false flag I think would
like severely reduce the number of false
flags if that were they so they actually
focus on the right-half that's a good
point yeah
excellent point it's it's an impossible
but like getting Pete like starting to
charge people on Facebook for that kind
of stuff I think would really turn
people off I mean like yeah that's yeah
by reducing the amount of false flags
would also be like no one is using
Facebook live which is much I would be
ok with yeah all right just cuz we gotta
lighten up a little bit before we hit
the road just so we can palate cleanser
little bit if we if we would let's just
talk about Apple real quick are we
getting Apple questions by the way we
have one good comment from a imagine
soggy are good longtime friend he just
says if Apple keeps on raising that
price people might just start keeping
their phones longer they already are
yeah yeah I mean we're already seeing
the replacement cycle extend for phones
you you've got essentially two segments
of the population at least in the United
States where people either upgrade every
year because they want the latest and
the greatest or they upgrade every three
to four to five years so if Apple just
keeps raising its price you're gonna see
more people just pushing out that RIM
citation they're lowering the the
quality of the phone so you don't have a
choice maybe mine mine took a little bit
of a Seltzer bath the other day and it's
been dead yeah it's gone it's a
they definitely want you to keep buying
it but you you know you can't make it so
crappy that people want to move on to a
different companies I mean that sounds
like the dilemma though where like if
they're making this like super high-end
phone that's like is the best phone ever
it is it's incredible
and then like and then you have to pay
like a thousand dollars for and it just
gets to a point like well why would I
ever buy like an another phone well I'll
give you an excuse she's just like the
next one is gonna have just slightly
better something yeah but then if like
the next one is like oh this one's a
thousand and two hundred dollars like
why no I'm not this is like I already
spent $1,000 on this I know they're not
gonna do this but I would really
appreciate it if they made you know of
the three iPhones that we here are going
to be coming out I would like it if they
made just a fourth one that had a
headphone jack in it that would be
really nice just out of spite
just know just that that's the one that
I would despite themselves I know that I
I know that I know that Rogers the kind
of dude that replaces his phone at the
drop of a hat but my personal rule is I
don't upgrade anything until it starts a
belching fire right as well you drop it
in try out sir Andromeda and seltzer
yeah all right that's been a really good
discussion I'm glad that didn't get too
heavy too depressing yeah thanks
everybody so very much for joining us
for that Asad right before we leave he's
asking about the surface laptop we
