but it's anything but a standard desktop
I'm going to take you inside the case
and show you why I'm Bill Detweiler and
this is cracking open the Samsung built
series three chrome box is Google's
first attempt at bringing its Chrome OS
to the desktop and given the operating
systems web-centric nature where all the
heavy lifting is done in the cloud the
machine doesn't need a lot of high-end
hardware and luckily getting to its
hardware is a snap just pop off the
bottom cover once you're inside you can
remove individual components either by
hand or with a small Phillips
screwdriver the power supply is located
along the side of the case and below it
is a small circuit board with the
developer mode switch more about that
later
there's a single cooling fan small IO
board with two USB ports and the
recovery button and of course the
motherboard as for individual components
the chrome box has a 1.9 gigahertz Intel
Celeron processor integrated Intel HD
graphics one thousand four gigs of ddr3
sdram a sixteen gig SSD and both
Ethernet and Wi-Fi support given the
machines three hundred and twenty nine
dollar price tag
the chromeboxes processor and RAM are on
par with other budget pcs the 16 gigs of
storage is another matter and it's the
first way in which the chrome box isn't
your average desktop and to be fair
Google doesn't expect users to store
much data on the chrome box
thus the small SSD and if you're
wondering if you can swap out the
factory SSD for a larger one the answer
is maybe I've read of people trying it
but with different levels of success
depending on the make and model of the
replacement drive whether they replace
the RAM or not and if they were trying
to run Chrome on the new drive or
replace it with Linux
speaking of RAM that's the second way
the machine is different from your
average PC the chips are removable and
you could conceivably replace them with
larger 8gig ones
but I haven't tried it and I've read
conflicting reports of Chrome OS
actually being able to support that much
memory another interesting feature on
the motherboard is the empty mini PCIe
slot next to the M SATA slot used by the
SSD I've read of people trying without
much success to put a second SSD drive
in this slot thus the theory it's a mini
PCIe slot and not a second M SATA one
it's possible that this slot was
intended for use with a cellular modem
card but that's just wild speculation
the last interesting hardware
characteristic is the developer mode
switch now flipping it allows you to
modify the existing Chrome OS or even
replace it with a different one and if
you make a mistake
during all your tinkering you can use
the recovery mode button and a recovery
USB Drive to return the machine to a
factory fresh state now at this point
the Chrome OS and chromebox are really
just still experiments and that fact
comes through when you look inside the
machine now for more information on the
series three chrome box including
real-world use and performance tests
