meaningful breakthroughs and these days
we essentially live on our phones right
our screens are the windows to our
worlds but despite all the progress
we've made the size of our screens is
still fundamentally limited by the size
of our devices until now with the Galaxy
fold we're creating a new dimension for
your phone and your life we're giving
you a device that doesn't just define a
new category it defies category with the
Galaxy fold you get a powerful
smartphone and a revolutionary tablet
all in a single premium package what is
folded it has a 4.6 inch display it's
compact and perfectly portable but when
the device opens up your world does too
with a massive 7.3 inch Infinity flex
display that transforms the fold into a
tablet thank you thank you it's gorgeous
now in order to create a brand new type
of smartphone we had to develop brand
new ways to design engineer and
manufacture from the screen to the frame
to every element you can see in touch we
left no stone unturned
one of the biggest challenges was
building the backbone of the device
something that could hold strong even
after hundreds of thousands of folds and
unfolds so we invented a sophisticated
hinge system that allows you to open and
close the galaxy fold smoothly and
naturally and the beauty of it is you
don't even see it the hinges multiple
interlocking gears are hidden giving the
device a seamless elegant look and
that's just one of the ways we carefully
consider the design of the fold we also
gave you four Galactic colors to choose
from cosmos black space silver Martian
green or Astro blue thank you
and depending on the color you choose
you can make it your own by
personalizing the hinge color to all
right they like it the Galaxy fold is a
one-of-a-kind luxury device and there
are limitless ways use it with two
different screens it's perfect for any
situation when closed it fits right in
the palm of your hand so you can send a
message to a friend or make a call with
one hand while you're on the go of
course sometimes you want a larger
screen and the galaxy folds infinity
flex display gives you a powerful
multimedia experience with immersive
visuals and sound buy AKG your favorite
movies come to life in vivid color and
rich audio and the interior screen is so
large that it powers a truly
next-generation experience one never
Bhasin never before seen on a smartphone
three app multi testing yeah thank you
so you can watch a YouTube video of
Hawaii text your friend about it and
browse travel options all at the same
time each screen works perfectly on its
own but the fold is more than two
separate screens
it's a unified device these displays
work together to give you a singular
seamless multi-screen experience and the
key to making this possible is called
app continuity and what that means is
that you can switch between the screens
without missing a beat so when you
stumble across an interesting Facebook
post on the front display you can simply
unfold your phone to see all the details
on the bigger screen it's amazing thank
you
the beauty of three app multitasking and
app continuity is that they let you use
the most important apps to you the way
you want and that's because we worked
with Google and the Android developer
community to optimize apps like whatsapp
and Microsoft Office for the Fuld's
unique dual displays we also worked with
YouTube to give galaxy users access to
YouTube premium thank you
now to ensure that all these apps run
smoothly the Galaxy fold needs
unprecedented unparalleled performance
so that's what we gave it the fold has a
state-of-the-art seven nanometer
processor and 12 gigabytes of RAM making
it one of the most powerful smartphones
on the market
there's more there's 512 gigs of onboard
memory and for the first time on a
mobile device support for universal
flash storage 3l which means they know
what it means this means you'll be able
to read data twice as fast as most other
smartphones making it incredibly
responsive now you may be sitting there
asking yourself how did we build a
battery into a phone that folds right
down the middle well the answer is we
built two of them one on each side of
the device our engineers have developed
special technology to combine energy
from both batteries into a single power
source now that is a whole lot of power
thank you the Galaxy fold is incredibly
versatile it's a smartphone a tablet and
a camera that fits in your pocket and
the camera is just as flexible as the
rest of the device in fact it's actually
a system of six cameras three on the
back two on the inside and one on the
front the phone will always be ready to
capture the moment no matter which way
you hold it or you fold it now that's
one thing to hear about all the folds
incredible capabilities for me but it's
another to see them for yourselves
let's take a look hey Josh can you help
me out hey Justin everybody this is Josh
Kim please welcome thank you thank you
I'm really excited to show everyone what
the fall can do as you can see if fits
perfectly in my hand first let's unlock
it all I have to do is place my thumb on
the side and I'm ready to go it's really
quick we have all the usual suspects
here here are my messages here's my
email and my playlist on Spotify pretty
much everything that I already do on my
phone exactly I find it especially
useful folded when I'm on the go hey
Josh can we show them how to navigate
with Google Maps sure I can easily pull
up Google Maps but here but here's where
things get really cool I can unfold it
and instantly see the map on the big
screen
that's amazing
that is amazing as you can see the same
map that Josh was just looking out in
the front display is already inside
waiting for him everything is just like
he left it that is the power of app
continuity and now he can see so much
more the street names the restaurants
all in greater detail okay so how about
we check out another app on the big
screen
how about Netflix sure I'm a huge fan of
Netflix I usually watch it on my tablet
but now I can watch it right on the
fault Wow that is a gorgeous display so
I see what you mean the fold is perfect
for watching videos reading your
favorite books or taking a video call
and you can do all three at once oh well
we have to see that so let's say Josh
wants to watch YouTube and chat with his
friend on whatsapp at the same time and
you never know when he might need to
Google something there you have it
that is three at multitasking in action
on the left the YouTube videos playing
on the right he's messaging a friend and
if it needs to browse the web it's right
there in the third window and if he
wants to browse in the bigger window he
can do that too
all you have to do is just drag the
browser over to the larger display it's
so simple it's simple and seamless and
the screen is big enough to fit all
three apps now that was great thank you
for all your help Josh Josh Kim everyone
thank you
so whether it's open or closed the fold
let you use your favorite apps in
completely new ways that's the magic of
the galaxy fold it's unlike anything
you've ever seen the fold comes in both
an LTE and a 5g version starting from
nineteen hundred and eighty dollars
depending on your region and carrier and
you can get your very own galaxy fold
starting on April 26th
