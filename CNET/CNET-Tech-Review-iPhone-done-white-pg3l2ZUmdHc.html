white iphone 4 is here finally Samsung
infuses the 4g smartphone market with
style it's a battle of the ultra
portables and an all-new prize fight and
molly's top gift picks for Mother's Day
it's all coming up right now
hi everyone i'm brian Tong and welcome
to the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech and offer some unique tech
wisdom in the form of the bottom line
let's start with the good if you're a
good son like me well you already knew
that this Sunday is Mother's Day now I
do realize that it's only a couple of
days away but there's still time to find
a great gift especially if your mama
likes tech now I'm only maybe on
vacation but she took some time out to
run down her favorite gift for moms
before she left
Mother's Day this year is may 8th
everyone don't miss it and don't go with
the same old collection of flowers and
candy you send every year I'm Molly
wooden for Brian Cooley with a scene at
top five the top five tech gifts for mom
coming in at number five it's the Amazon
Kindle if she doesn't have a kindle yet
people now is the time I mean the
ad-supported model is only 114 bucks
just make sure you pair it with an
amazon gift card for book buying and
some sort of certificate for several
hours of alone time for reading
preferably by a pool somewhere in at
number four get her a smartphone we have
a lot of favorites in this category from
the obvious iphone 4 to the HTC
Thunderbolt to the shift 4g on sprint
the main goal though is getting mom a
gift that will help her take pictures
get on facebook text with you when you
don't have time to talk get her email
and play games on the go if she doesn't
have a smartphone yet this is the year
to make it happen coming in at number
three the Microsoft Xbox Kinect every
mom I know right now is loving the
kinect for one reason dance central it
is an awesomely fun workout and the kids
love it too if you don't have an xbox
it's a great bundle and if you do the
Kinect add-on makes it less of a boy's
toy and more of a family console of
course if your mom is anything like me
you can get her connect and the new
Mortal Kombat game I'm not trying to
stereotype here much at a very strong
number two the ipad 2 I got my mom and
iPad and we've never been better
Facebook friends it's the perfect email
web and video watching device for mom
especially if the dude in her life hogs
the remote plus hello angry birds rio
and i can tell you from personal
experience the ipad is the best kid
entertainment and education tool you
will ever own kid airplane iPad she will
thank you and finally my number one tech
gift idea for mom this year is my number
one tech gifts idea always a roku
streaming media box the Roku is the
perfect gift it's as cheap as 59 bucks
now with no monthly fee plus it's dead
simple to set up and you'll be watching
streaming movies
that video and don't forget that every
episode of Mad Men is coming to netflix
instant streaming and if there's one
constant in the universe it's this we
ladies love to watch Don Draper ok now
I'm stereotyping but don't try to
pretend that it's not true because it is
true and that's it for this edition of
seen at top 5 i'm molly wood and you can
find all the rest of our top 5 videos
over at cnet TV com of course if you're
watching this after mate there's never
really a bad time to tell your mama how
much you love her so don't be afraid to
hook her up with any of these great gift
ideas any time of the year for example
the Samsung Infuse 4G for ATT won't be
out until later this month but I'll bet
your mom will let it slide for a couple
weeks if this is a smart phone you
picked out for her hey everyone I'm
Bonnie Todd senior editor at cnet com
and I'm here bringing you a first look
at the Samsung Infuse 4G samsung and ATT
have finally announced a release date
for this phone it's going to be
available starting May fifteenth we
actually saw this a little while ago but
wanted to give you a refresher because
it has been a while first looking at the
design that you can see that it's kind
of big and that's due to the 4.5 inch
super amoled plus display it's really
gorgeous though it offers more clarity
and better outdoor visibility than their
Super AMOLED screens and I just compared
it to the captivate and you can tell the
difference the colors are really vibrant
and pop off the screen and watching
videos and pictures on here look really
great so it is big but it is thin as
well it's eight point nine millimeters
thin and Samsung is saying it's the
thinnest smartphone available in the US
it's also got this little texture ice
back on here which I really like because
I've complained before that Samsung's
phones have been kind of plastic e so
this does a nice job of adding a little
bit more of a premium feel to it feature
wise is offering a 1.2 gigahertz
processor belts look at an 8 megapixel
camera as well as a front facing camera
it is a 4d device and running android
2.2 point one a couple of special things
it's shipping with a 2 gigabyte microSD
card with a couple of movie
oilers on here and a special edition of
angry birds where there's a golden egg
and if you get through the levels you
can go to website and get some Samsung
prizes so little motivation to play
Angry Birds here if you need it AT&amp;amp;T is
still finalizing pricing for the phone
but you can check our blog post at cnet
com for more information and more first
impressions I'm Bonnie town this has
been your first look at the same stuff
infuse 4g and while we're on the subject
of Mother's Day what mom doesn't enjoy
taking snapshots of her adorable
children like me here's Josh Goldman
with a pair of pointed shoot cameras
that take great photos while keeping
things simple hey I'm Josh Goldman
senior editor we've seen it and this is
a look at the sony cybershot w 570 now
the W 570 replaces the cyber-shot w350
which was a popular camera with our
readers and one of my favorite ultra
compacts from 2010 on the upside nothing
much changes from that model to this
there's a resolution bump from 14 to 16
megapixels and the lens is a little
brighter wider and longer but the body
remains very small what you should know
is that the increased resolution doesn't
improve photo quality so it doesn't
really add anything and the increase
seems to be slowing down shooting speed
at least from shot to shot and while the
lens specs are nice the edges and
corners of photos appear soft so unless
your subjects are in the center of your
shot they might not be all that sharp
still for its size and price it takes
very good photos and movie clips too for
that matter in 720p HD the camera is
easy to use and Sony's embedded a full
user manual if you need help along the
way plus it has Sony's sweep panorama
feature for quick ultra wide shots so
even though it's not a huge jump forward
from the w350 it's worth checking out if
you're looking for a good camera that
you won't hesitate to take with you I'm
Josh Goldman and that's the sony
cybershot w 570
hi there I'm Josh Goldman senior editor
with cnet and this is a look at the
canon powershot 830 300 is this is the
top of canons a series lineup for 2011
also known as it's easy and fun cameras
the most part that just means that
cannon did its best to make the camera
simple enough for anyone to pick up and
use and it is really if you never want
to leave it's smart auto mode you're
pretty much in good shape to shoot a
wide variety of subjects without
touching a thing the controls and menus
are straight forward to so no problems
there well almost no problems anyway the
buttons are flat and flush with the body
making them a little difficult to press
but otherwise the design is fine and as
the top model in the line it's still
less than one hundred and eighty dollars
by the way you get some better than
basic features that includes optical
image stabilization for the 5x zoom
wide-angle lens a nice 3-inch LCD on
back and 720p HD movie capture no use of
the optical zoom while recording though
and if you want to do a little
experimenting with your photos can it
includes its new live view control mode
and that lets you play with brightness
color and tone and gives you some
sliders so it's really easy to do and
there's also creative filters like toy
camera poster effect and super vivid
photo and video quality are quite good
for the money and really other than the
flat buttons the only issue I had with
it is it's shot to shot speed which is
close to four seconds and five seconds
with the flash but if that doesn't
bother you this is a fine choice for an
ultra compact camera I'm Josh Goldman
and that's the Canon 830 300 is now if
your mom likes your gadgets to look a
little more girly the canon powershot is
also available in other colors including
pink and red otherwise both are also
available in stylish silver or basic
black okay guys it's time to take a
quick break but we'll be right
back with more tech review right after
this
welcome back to the scene attack review
our weekly video digest of all things
good and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
now continuing on in the good the time
has come for more of what you've all
been waiting for more of me that's right
it's time for this week's prize fight
and this one's a doozy in this battle of
ultra portables the new Samsung 9 series
takes on the reigning champ the macbook
air which one will come out on top oh
there's only one way to find out what's
up prize 5 fans i'm brian Tong and this
is a blockbuster battle between two of
the thinnest 13 inch laptops it's a
prized by a Throwdown showdown between
samsung's nine series and apple's
macbook air our judges for this fight
our senior editor dan I think I can
ackerman senior associate editor Scott
the bottom line Stein and Bryan can't go
wrong tom now will take all three judges
blind scores and average them out to the
nearest tenth each round the final prize
fight score will be an average of all
rounds using the same decimal system
this is going to be a classic so who's
in it to win it round one is designed
Samsung's 9 series looks like a piece of
Modern Art with its gorgeous rap sheet
metal design its plastic bezel is a
fingerprint magnet but its thinnest
point is point zero two inches thinner
than the airs thickest point for those
you that Karen come on we know who you
are now there's still nothing on this
planet that can match the superior
design of apple's unibody macbook air
its blade design is super thin
lightweight and sturdy this is just
another iconic stud in apple stable both
laptops are amazing and should be
praised for raising the bar in ultrathin
design but Apple is still a cut above
the rest it gets a perfect five and the
9 series gets a 4.3 next round is
features Samsung's 9 series just brings
it when it comes to features with a core
i5 processor double the RAM at four gigs
and a backlit keyboard yes it maxes out
with a 128 gig solid-state drive and
there's flip out ports for an Ethernet
dongle HDMI out two USBs audio out and a
microSD card slot now the macbook air
improves from its predecessor with two
USB ports and an SD card slot there's
also a mini DisplayPort for video out
and audio out on the other side but it's
Ethernet dongle takes up a USB port when
used a differentiator is its multi-touch
trackpad with gestures but you'll have
no backlit keyboard the biggest option
is the ability to double the storage to
256 gigs but that's more of an option
and not a feature the nine series takes
this round with the four and the macbook
air gets a three so after averaging two
rounds Samsung leads by two tenths of a
point with plenty of fight left round
three is performance these two laptops
are surprisingly evenly matched you
might think Samsung's 1.4 gigahertz core
i5 would destroy the air but it's low
voltage processor has similar
performance with the airs 1.8 or 2 duo
now here's some of our benchmark tests
where Apple did score faster in two of
the three tests but neither of these
thinnies were able to separate
themselves in graphic performance
Apple's wake up from sleep is almost an
instant on but this one is too close to
call and we're calling this round even
at four points apiece next round is
battery life with ultra portables the
amount of juice you have to go the
distance is key Samsung was able to
squeeze out five hours and 22 minutes of
life from our battery drain tests while
Apple's MacBook Air was just under five
at four hours and 58 minutes the nine
Series was almost 30 minutes better and
that's top of the class for this laptop
category it takes this round with the
4.3 and Apple gets up for after
averaging four rounds Samsung still
holds on to its two tenths of a point
lead but anything can happen here the
final round that decides it all is value
these are ultra portables not netbooks
but a premium class of laptops using
solid state drives with a premium price
to match Samsung's 9 series will cost
you get ready for this one 1649 dollars
which makes Apple's pricing look like a
bargain it'll scare consumers initially
but there's more to it now I purchase
the coverage plan for all my laptops and
the Samsung price includes three years
of warranty now Apple's MacBook Air at
one thousand two hundred ninety nine
dollars isn't the cheapest for a 13-inch
but again that's not why you're paying
attention to this you can double the
hard drive to 256 gigs and you'll still
be cheaper than the nine series at 1599
but the air only comes with a one-year
warranty and it's $249 to get
applicators three-year coverage that
puts these two in the same ballpark but
1649 still scares people Apple takes
this final round with the poor and
Samsung gets a 3 so let's average out
all five rounds and enterprise fight
that was neck and neck without any room
to budge Apple takes the final round
pushing it just over the top 4.0 to 3.9
and is your prize fight winner this is a
prize fight where you really can't go
wrong but in the end the macbook air
prevails i'm brian song thanks for
watching and we'll catch you guys next
time on another prize fight
though some might just call the 9 series
a macbook rip off there's no denying
that it has a lot going for it beyond
the super slim design but for my money
you can't go wrong with the macbook air
and hey I host the Apple bite what else
you expect me to say alright let's take
a look at what we've got in the bag this
week earlier in the show we saw the new
and few smartphone and Bonnie choc
couldn't say enough good things about it
that's hardly the case with the nokia e7
take a look hey everyone I'm Bonnie Todd
senior editor at cnet com and I'm here
to bring you a first look at the nokia
e7 this is the latest flagship device in
their a series of business smartphones
and it's available now unlocked but it
cost a pretty penny 650 dollars to be
exact so is it worth it let's take a
look the phone actually resembles the
nokia n8 in a lot of ways which isn't
bad because the n8 had a pretty great
design what I like about it is the high
quality construction and it has an
aluminum casing and glass display so it
feels like a premium device and not
plastic be like a lot of the other
devices out there slightly bigger and
heavier than the n8 but it's really not
that bulky especially when you consider
that Nokia packed in a full keyboard you
can access it by pushing the screen to
the right or up depending on how you're
holding it the sliding mechanism is
smooth and the hinge feel strong and I
also like that it props the screen at a
slight angle so it's easier to read
while you're typing the keyboard is one
of the highlights of the phone the
buttons are good size and there's a nice
amount of spacing between them plus the
way out is really roomy so it felt very
comfortable to use and I could type
pretty quickly on it without too many
miss presses unfortunately that's about
where my love fest for the e7 ends the
device has a good number features for
business users including Exchange
ActiveSync support the Quick Office
suite and security features plus it's
got a pretty great 8 megapixel camera
and HDMI port but like the n8 the
symbian operating system just brings the
device down it's running symbian3 so at
least you get some improvements like the
simpler one touch user interface and
better multimedia options but it's still
clunky and lacks some functionality
compared to other platforms like
iOS Android and Windows Phone with a 6
180 megahertz processor it also feels
pretty underpowered and the smartphone
actually froze on me once well is trying
to play a video so with all these
performance and software issues it's
really hard for me to recommend this
phone especially with its 650 dollar
price tag if you really love Simeon it
might be worth it but otherwise I'd say
if you want a business smartphone with a
qwerty keyboard go with something like
the t-mobile g2 or HTC arrived I'm
Bonnie Tom this has been your first look
at the nokia e7 so basically if you're
thinking of a smartphone for your mom
this weekend and you had your eye on the
nokia e7 here's my advice don't not if
you expect your mom to ever do your
laundry for you ever again not that she
does it for me okay there's nothing left
to do but dive right into this week's
bottom line it's been almost a year now
since the iphone 4 was announced and
after a series of delays the white
version finally started shipping just
this week so was it worth the wait let's
check in with kent german to see what he
thinks hi I'm Kent Sherman section
editor for cnet.com and it's a big day
here in the studio because we actually
have the white iphone yes it's the white
iphone 4 we've waited so long for it
months and months and months and well
you probably waited so long that you
might not even care at this point but
we're going to show it to you nave just
because it has been so talked about and
we still don't know why it took Apple so
long to reduce this device we've heard
that it could have been the proximity
sensor we also have a rumor on the 3gs
there was some discoloration on the
white iphone so we never know but this
device is finally here we're going to
show it to you of course it is exactly
the same we are showing a verizon phone
here and AT&amp;amp;T verizon will both offer
the white iphone of course the only
differences will be what network it runs
on features are exactly the same on the
black iphone 4 so it's going to have the
camera it's going to have itunes
connectivity it's going to have the ipod
player it's going to have the browser
everything that you'd expect on that
phone is going to be there and there are
no cosmetic differences except for the
white color you will notice a line up
here and actually when i first saw it I
thought that maybe oh this is something
new it's actually not the black iphone
hatch has that as well you just can't
see it because
like the skin of the phone it's also
black you have to hold it up so the
light to really see that line but that's
the only thing that's different this is
the verizon iphone so of course there is
that extra line here in the antenna but
again that's the only difference is
you're going to see starting with the
earlier iPhones I've never been such a
fan of the white models but I know a lot
of people have been so it's great that
you can now have the option to buy it of
course it doesn't have a unicorn horn on
it you might be waiting for that because
a lot of people call this attack unicorn
but it does just doesn't have that
unicorn horn on the back I thought the
back looked a little cheaper than the
black iphone it's just a real subjective
thing that I saw you may not agree but
just didn't like the skin quite as much
the upside though is the back won't show
fingerprints as easily as the black
iphone get smudgy really quickly and
you're not going to see that here now
there's been a lot of controversy over
whether the I white iphone is actually
thicker than the black model some blogs
have posted photos they do see a
difference even though it's maybe point
2 millimeters which is hardly anything
and other blogs and news reports have
said as no difference check the video
where we actually take the phone down to
a place in San Francisco they can
measure things really really accurately
down to even smaller than a millimeter
so we'll see if that's actually true but
for right now I don't see any difference
we also heard that the white iphone
doesn't accommodate the standard cases
or bumpers that Apple's actually put out
well app was good enough to send us a
white bumper or she can use any bumper
you'd like and you know when I snapped
it on I didn't think it went on any more
difficult than on the black iphone I
also didn't see a difference when I
tried using this other case that I
currently use on a black iphone 4 it
snapped on just as easily as well so I
think even if it is a little bit bigger
I don't think it's a big deal and be
honest with you I'm sure that when you
make a bunch of products like that
sometimes there are very very slight
differences to come out of the
production line but overall the white
iphone exactly the same as I said may
not be your cup of tea but it's finally
finally here and if you don't care and
I'm sure there's a lot of you out there
that don't well its here anyway for you
i'm kent german and this is the white
iphone 4
the bottom line this week yep it's white
I mean what else can I say it's still
the same phone which is great and now
you're really cool now look you've got
the white iphone no one else has it okay
I admit it is kind of pretty okay folks
that's our show but Molly will be back
next week with a brand new scene at tech
review until then there are tons of
great videos available every day at cnet
TV com see you next time and thanks for
