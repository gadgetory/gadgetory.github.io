phablet I'm Jessica doll court for Cena
this is the huawei ascend mate it is a
6.1 inch screen smartphone it's unlocked
here I've got it running on AT&amp;amp;T network
and I'm going to tell you a little bit
about this phone first of all the size
which is just completely unintelligible
of my head it's really big I think it's
a little awkward to hold in my hands
mostly because these edges here are
really sharp so although there's a
little bit of a curve to the back
gripping it I definitely feel besides
when I'm holding it I think it makes it
a little awkward when I'm trying to
focus on a photo and when I'm trying to
type there are however options in here
so you can select one handed operation
say if you're on a bus or something
holding on with one hand you can
technically use the phone and the
keyboard with one hand the screen has a
720p HD resolution that's a little
surprising because for this size I'd
expect 1080p HD looks bright and fine
but it definitely won't be as crisp as
may be other phones of this size android
4.1 jelly bean is the OS here and on top
of that you've got Huawei's emotion UI
sort of a new one that they unveiled at
CES I actually really liked it one thing
that's interesting about it that you've
got these main icons down below you've
got your static icons that you don't
have an app tray instead it's more like
iOS you have to scroll to get your apps
I really like some of the features I do
like the default look you've got a lot
of tools grouped into folders all ready
for you one thing that's a little
surprising though is when you download a
new app that will populate on another
page not below so if you're not
expecting that you might be a little bit
surprised wondering where your apps went
themes are another great part of the
interface it really lets you customize
by choosing from among any number of
displays I think that it makes using
this device a lot of fun the phone has
an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera it's
got a front facing camera to that
captures 720p HD rear camera captures
1080p HD video thought the camera
quality really left a lot to be desired
there is a flash so that helped but it's
not as good as other
the huawei ascend mate is an unlocked
global device so prices and availability
are going to vary by market my favorite
part of this phone is definitely the
emotion UI that I think that there are
better huawei phones out there and
frankly there are better phablets too
again I'm just get all court for cnet
