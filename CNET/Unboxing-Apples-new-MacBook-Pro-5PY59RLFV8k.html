MacBook Pro the 13 inch and the 15 inch
I have got one right here just arrived
I'll tell ya I don't even know what's in
this box I don't know if it's a 13 to 15
a high end low end let's find out got my
handy box cutter I'm cutting the seal
writing it out and there we go get it on
this side nice and clean and let's pop
this box open inside oh nice
MacBook Pro box still filled in plastic
you don't always get the review units
sealed in plastic don't need that
anymore
this is I'm looking at the back 15-inch
Space Gray good good six core processor
32 gigs of RAM
Radeon pro 562 terabyte solid-state hard
drive so it's not the highest highest
highest end model possible but it's
pretty far up there considering the 15
start at like $23.99 get the plastic off
of that it's always nice to rip the
plastic off a new gadget and if you're
looking at this saying this kind of
looks like the bat put pro boxes and the
MacBook Pros I saw in the Apple store
and I went there the other week oh
you're right there's not really anything
physically different from the outside
about these all the changes are really
on the inside
ooh Space Gray can't go wrong with that
a classic so here's the laptop itself in
the box of course got this nice little
Apple minimalism going here USB C cable
because everything is USB see right now
power brick as usual USB C power brick
so you can't use it for your other stuff
unless you have an adapter minimalist
Apple paperwork and that's it that's the
whole box right there and then the
system itself let's take a quick peek at
we are going to flip it open right here
paper inside look at that gigantic touch
and big 15-inch screen and of course the
touch bar which is right above the
keyboard right here that's a secondary
OLED screen touch screen you can use to
control stuff and that is our that is
our new more than $2,300 15-inch MacBook
Pro right out of the box and ready for
us to start testing for our review so
stay tuned for that and thanks for
watching me unbox the new 15 inch apple
macbook pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
