video podcast I'm running to belmont and
I'm James Cameron this is where we take
a look at the hottest sexiest and the
coolest gadgets that hit the street this
week yeah we're finally at episode
number three which me know that we have
tons of content on the crank blog to
look at you can see the blog at krave
cnet com okay shuffle alert yes shuffle
is actually shipping now I had craved
all that pressure you put on I thinks
exactly a caved under your pressure you
know what this shuffle would make a
really good item for what a little tie
clip I know it's it's wearable it's like
totally different the stocking stuffer
oh you know what you can get me for
stocking stuffer ah what is it how about
130,000 dollar television that's one big
stocking yeah so there's the yellows LCD
diamond it's called it has 160 diamonds
actually built into the border there's a
white gold trim a white gold okay right
but the deal rose gold version know the
deal breaker here is that it's only 40
inches as if the hundred thirty thousand
dollars wasn't the deal breaker right
only 40 inches long so um I'm holding
this weird knob thing I'm really into
knob oh yes and IDK this is the creative
xmod a product that we reviewed already
but I just saw on the create blog the
mp3 player knob from red ferret you just
kind of stick the knob ever anywhere you
want on your bag on your desk and this
thing looks pretty cool it's designed
for music so awesome yes well some
people like music and some people like
video games and I like both of course
one of the problems with playing hours
and hours of video games is a sweaty
palm syndrome Oh
but anyway there's any optical USB mouse
from trust and they have a rubberized
gripping on the top so even if you're
playing for six hours and you're like
totally intense and sweating profusely
and disgusting oh your hand won't slip
off the mouse is it actually absorbing
your sweat or is it what is it doing
with sweat-wicking it away it's like you
know like when you're in the shower and
you've got the ok adding on the ground
so you're gonna get one of these things
yeah lateline gaming for you know what
it would be really good for if they use
the same rubberized coating on the Wii
Remote what is good about the rubberized
gripping that it should have that when
you're playing tennis yes don't fling
out the window and breathe wasn't there
this crazy commercial from South America
about the week yeah there was almost a
two minute long commercial and it shows
a bunch of different people playing wii
games but the problem is it proves my
theory that you can't play the wii
without looking like an idiot I gotta
how fun it is you're always like yeah I
think you can if you're really into like
the glow stick oh I'm driving along
yesterday in my car and I almost slipped
off the world wasn't even raining but VW
seems to have a some kind of technology
it's called countersteering technology
that basically takes over once you start
to like slip off the road you know the
thing is like all these people are going
to start losing control of their cars
because tech is trying to take control
what you're saying if this counteracts
people not paying attention to the road
by listening to theirs I don't know I
things in their mp3 I think so because
fiddling with all their GPS gear y'all
come on driving up the wall Veronica
speaking of fiddling with phones while
you're driving maybe not necessarily
driving but in Japan NTT DoCoMo has a
new phone designed for women that's
orange and nice and pink that's that's
not new yeah but it's designed to let
women know exactly when they're
ovulating yeah so it'll give them the
optimal time when they can get pregnant
how does it know I think you have to
pre-program it with vital stats i don't
i'm not really sure of what this means
but this phone by the way you can also
load up there's a recipe database in
there what it is I know I know this is
Japan you know and I believe like Japan
like 50 years in the past and i believe
for equal rights there is it gonna go me
i can't vote
I don't know there's also gonna be a
men's version too okay when like when
the next time the T up for your golf
game is no no no to let them know when
they're a hardener is ovulating you know
be funnier what's funny if they had
phones for guys so that when they were
around a woman ovulating it would be
like a tamagotchi meet soon yeah exactly
social networking yeah it also has a
button that you can fake incoming calls
speaking so you can get out of like a
bad date yes oh that is awesome my whole
opinion of this phone just didn't want
to do you want that and said for for the
holidays well as long as it lets um I'll
get you one anyway if there's something
like this or any other tech gadget that
you are interested in seeing on our blog
or on our show email us at crave at cnet
com I'll see you next time i watch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
