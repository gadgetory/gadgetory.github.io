live coverage of apple's education event
in chicago my name is Jeff Bakalar and
I'm coming to you
from our studios in New York along with
Bridget Carey and Dan Ackerman thanks
guys for being here with me it's
exciting it's very exciting for the next
two hours or so we'll be taking calls
from our team on the ground at the event
in Chicago and we'll be following along
as the event happens because guess what
there's no video coming out of Apple
this time it's just us look at you now
this isn't a typical Apple event it's
lower and profile compared to the fall
keynotes that happen every year and it's
focused primarily on Apple's involvement
in education the last time Apple held an
education focused event was six years
ago in New York when they launched
digital textbooks I was there for that
event
what was that like it was no hardware it
was just them making a way for you to
make interactive textbooks using Apple
tools so I almost have no memory of it
whatsoever
do you remember I just remember the the
giant paper textbooks that I would buy
for about a billion dollars and sell
back for for 35 cents at the end of the
semester right I'd be all in on
electronic textbook so they haven't
really talked about education focus
stuff for a while it's really it's been
a while as the point we're trying to
make now if you want to be a part of the
conversation
hop on Twitter and use the hashtag seen
it live so what do we think is going to
happen today some hints may be given
with the invitation logos look at the
logo right woody bridge it what can you
extract from that we have we have
writing let's take a field trip this is
clearly something that you might write
with a pencil or pen on a stylus if you
will okay so you're saying that this
will be some sort of writing thing well
this was a good good read because I I
looked at this invitation a million
times that I didn't get that yeah like
oh my god that's it the light bulb just
went off because you have the Apple
pencil which is that $99 stylus
accessory that only works with the iPad
pro right of course is very expensive
it's actually a great stylist you ever
use one it's got really good drag to it
it's like the
realistic I think tablet writing you can
get but it doesn't work with the regular
inexpensive iPad which starts at 329 but
you can usually get for about 300 bucks
that's the nine point seven inch from
last year and it's really good and if
you're in school and using an iPad
that's probably the one you're using so
maybe just maybe they're gonna add
pencil support to that because it just
plugs into the same lightning connector
at the bottom so I guess you could do it
would it be a number two pencil pencil -
no but I mean if they were gonna make an
a second pencil yea I would have to have
maybe be the same pencil or maybe the
same pencil even maybe they'll have them
with an eraser who knows well so I guess
like the thing that we should really be
focused on is maybe perhaps that this is
not an event where a lot of consumer
stuff would be announced or maybe it was
like a byproduct of their education
initiative so doesn't that mean usually
when you know things get introduced for
the educational sector we're talking
about a budget or a lower price thing so
that you know everyone hopefully in
theory in the country could make use of
it I think I think it's true in theory
and iPads were first touted as being
great for schools because they were so
much less expensive than laptops at the
time right so you could give every kid
in the school or in the district an iPad
even because they were only $500 but
since then I've talked to a lot of
people I know in the education business
that people who are teachers people who
are principals here in New York and they
say that their schools and I fir this
over and over again have moved away from
iPads and moved to Chromebooks
that's right inexpensive laptops running
Google's Chrome operating system because
they are frankly just less expensive
than iPads but more flexible in a lot of
ways because they're basically just web
browsers you can't install you know the
same games on them that you can on on an
iPad they have very little you know cost
to keep updated because they're
essentially just cloud devices like what
200 bucks you could do 200 you could do
3 4 500 you could do a whole big range
of prices but the key thing is the
school can just give everyone a
Chromebook and then
whenever they want just collect them
wipe them hand them out again it's
really easy to do the same on the cloud
it's interesting you bring that up in
2017 survey was done every three out of
five tablets used in classrooms in
America ran Chrome OS oh yeah and
another way of putting that like 60% if
you look at all the schools that you
know are buying devices 60% are saying
that they're using Chromebooks look K
through 12 schools only 17% are using
Apple products and 22% of K through 12
schools are using Windows so apples in
last place so this is a way for them to
go hey pay attention to us again they're
gonna have to show something software
cheaper hardware to make it more
enticing when your school's already
invested in a Chromebook yeah it may be
just that nine point seven inch iPad
that they updated last year that frankly
we call the best bang for your buck iPad
unless you really need a pro you should
just get this basic model that they have
been selling for 329 if they cut that by
75 you know they make it 250 or 275 or
something like that I I could see that
being more of a competitor for a
Chromebook but you still have to get a
keyboard and maybe a stylist if you want
to if you want to use it like that so
should we do some arithmetic then all
right so you said you can get him to
about 250 because you know that's what
it was during Black Friday they were
selling them for 250 and nobody was
crying too much about that right and
then you also talked about the
accessories I get the adults yeah so
you've got you you want a keyboard
that's gonna be what about 130 if you
get the official Apple one when you get
cheaper one yes are you gonna for 60 to
get them off-brand
and then the pencil and if there was
another hundred unless they lower the
price if it even works on this device
which it currently does not that was a
problem with the Microsoft Surface
tablet uh you had you it was a
reasonable price for what you got but
you had to buy the hundred and $29 clip
on keyboard otherwise it really was not
that useful yeah and I think for school
you need a keyboard selfishly I'm
interested to see if whatever it is they
do announce today kind of trickles down
in the rest of the product line like you
know I can't imagine them saying hey
this hundred dollar pencil is now
available to every student I mean that
is not a reasonable thing to sort of
yeah that's that's one and that'd be
great but what I'm saying is I would
like this sort of new pricing structure
or whatever it is there's this budget
thing again it's all speculation you
know to trickle down to their consumer
product line because I mean selfishly I
just wanted it's been a while I want to
do iPad you know well if you look at
history Apple has in the past made a
product just for schools it was during
the iMac phase where remember those
colorful big ol yeah yeah I had them in
my school yeah but there's something
called the eMac that was a cheaper
version for school so really for
something in between and they eventually
did bring it to the consumer market but
other you know upgrades kind of overtook
it very quickly but it makes me wonder
yeah would they make something that is
like hey here's an iPad for everyone in
a school extra cheap iPad I don't know
right I don't know if they'll even
bother doing that but I would be
interested to see that cuz I think when
it comes to helping kids just making it
something super cheap the accessibility
that will that will help them take that
next leap it'll help kids it'll help
hook the kids for when you know they're
they're used to using Apple products
more when they want to be consumers
later and go to go to college and I
think we've exposed a little bit of the
generation gap right here you had Emacs
in school I had Apple to C's I don't
think I had any Apple computers in my
school that's because Apple always made
deals usually to get like you know with
the school could buy them for cheaper
and that was the mentality you know get
the kids used to Mac's but then we all
had pcs at home so there was a
disconnect now kids are all having
mobile devices and so they are more used
to using Apple products anyways and if
you get them young if they're used to
using whether it's a MacBook Air or an
iPad in the school when they're you know
in grade school in high school then
they'll graduate and go to college I
want to get like a MacBook Pro or or an
airhead and then they're customers for
life if you hug them young so maybe
we'll be an entire generation of Chrome
OS users because these kids are used to
using Chromebooks and they go oh that's
what a computer is
and maybe everyone will just be you know
Chromebook people in five or ten years
we're all good people well let's
get the live blog if you want to follow
along also we have several scene that
reporters there at the scene right now
of the event it's it's taking place in
Chicago at a high school called Lane
technical prep school and what why are
there no kids in school today I'm maybe
they're just in a separate section of
the school for this event I'm serious
homeschooling them all today Genius Bar
people to their homes to teach them
stuff okay well I I think it's
interesting that they picked this this
school to you know kind of really dumb
first off they're good at demonstrating
right in a presentation so they want to
really make you feel like this is a
realistic you know thing for a school
they are picking though a technical
school
so obviously the kids here already have
a lot of access to more to more tech
then than most you know public high
schools would have but I would say
looking at the makeup of the school this
is a magnet school you have about 60% of
the students here or they are
economically challenged at home they are
available there they're able to get
government funding maybe free and
reduced lunches you know so like money's
on their mind every day yeah when it
comes to stuff but they're also
exceptional students who you know are
high achievers because they're at this
specific technical school so they're
probably gonna see a lot of stories on
what they're doing in technology to you
know kind of what the future is for them
and and how Apple devices can impact
their their studies so I'm interested to
see why they they just picked this
particular school they're definitely
doing their best to make it very school
like I saw a tweet from our buddy Scott
Stein where they had given him Apple had
given him a class schedule for the day
oh yeah and they were set up like you
know can't o'clock this 11 o'clock this
and then this missile at the end of the
day yeah a little PTSD for a few people
out there in the audience imagine you
walk into high school somebody hands you
a class schedule
yeah just like freak out man I just have
a terrible kind of flashback patient
General Assembly a creative lab coding
lab oh so after the assembly he's gonna
go into coding so that okay what does
that tell you these are some clues right
this is giving me this is giving me
Bronk science flashbacks right no you're
right the it stuff there's simply stuff
there you know I think it's just it
sounds like there's gonna be hands-on
with something well I mean Apple already
what do they do in education they have
the the Swift programming courses they
have a lot of iTunes you obviously we
already talked before about their last
thing there are interactive textbooks so
but the coding lab that tells you that
they're going to be doing a lot to show
what ever and software wise you can do
with to learn coding on on these
machines to help students and then
teaching kids to code is such a huge you
know thing right now yeah even you know
super young kids four five six years old
or already learning that yeah maybe
there'll be some sort of introduction of
a program that they're kind of
spearheading I'm hearing that Scott
Stein is live with us on skype right now
let's go to Scott on the ground in
Chicago what's going on Scott hey Steven
if you're gonna be able to your senior
year be honest yeah we nearly really
know we very gratefully and slowly I'm
sitting down at Wayne Tech's auditorium
here in Chicago we are super crammed in
these are these are students teats
they're not meant for covering
precedents they do have outlets which is
nice and I'm sitting here with Connie
who's over here
and go on espanol and go Santa and we
also have Lexi we have Shara over here
that's about the the general range of my
movement right now that's about it
that's pretty good he's got a nice
little comfy and tight hanging in there
okay Scott would weep have you heard
anything since you got there do you have
a more clear idea of what exactly is
going to be going down in the next
couple of minutes sure this has been a
lot like an immersive theater event I
came in we got a class schedule set it
up so we've got some stations and rooms
and presentations we all got
first day of school weird feeling filing
in into a very classic Ivy League
looking sort of a school environment
saying how you do other people in the
tech press and feeling awkward as we
always do but even more so because we're
in school and then we came in there was
some breakfast items we sat down in this
big space here and I think what we're
expecting to see I mean there's not been
a structure like this before so there's
a presentation but we also know coming
up that there's going to be a classroom
saying there's going to be some sort of
coding station or other classroom spot
I think we're here until 1:00 so but
it's very you know broken down into
groups and we're gonna have to see you
know how that feels move the station was
April I'm not gonna be coding later and
I am I making robotics I have no idea so
so what's the vibe I mean you've been to
a bunch of Apple events what would you
say the vibe of this one is compared to
the other ones that you've been able to
check out I know this is more lower
profile so a lot of the same event staff
people we know you know from Apple
events or here and the vibe is I mean
this is a real school so probably a
little more quiet respectful trying to
figure out our way around this different
space the the vibe is very much like
here's the next place you have to report
so we went down these school hallways
other people went on other hallways I
don't know where they were going you
know we got put in our our zone I think
the the vibe is curious about why this
school and what you know what what the
pitch what the explanation is with that
how that how that feels different I mean
outside and we super-cold there were a
lot of pop up registration tents
buildings so now like other Apple events
actually the one on campus down in
Cupertino was a bit like that and in
kind of the same people but you know
this is such a recent event if you let's
get popped up
that everyone just heals pace you know
quickly assembled for for this and we
didn't know this was coming even more so
than normal it looks really hairy
pottery out there it's a if you look at
those pictures inside it's pretty
relaxed and in chill but you know I see
full shoulders like you know a couple of
cents a head I mean so he's over there
we've got all the familiar faces at
Apple that I've seen so we're sitting
pretty close to the front and then again
we know that some of us are not going to
the same place later on so we already
know that our pads are diverging well a
nice cool
yeah but clicking you it is a total high
school I went to the bathroom so you
know it was like the faculty bathroom oh
you needed in an elevator pad hey hey
Scott where where'd they put the
students it's spring break is it spring
break is that where all the kids are I
don't know what the kids are maybe it's
probably spring break right I I guess we
here it's next week yeah I guess it's
different throughout the countries but
that was like what we were wondering
where the hell are the kids they're
working not to mess up their stuff right
you know don't mess up with stuff be
respectful maybe they're gonna appear at
the end and say surprise ha ha here for
us hey guys so I don't know where the
seats are really cramped these are you
know like so actually i'm i've been ipad
now opened up which is much better for
my legroom
then it's an ipad thank most likely so
i'm working on an ipad that's
appropriate and also because the my live
blog tool wasn't working on the laptop
hey hey scott so like selfishly is there
something that you personally want to
see i mean i know like we're kind of all
anticipating some sort of you know
budget ii ipad situation or
you know a pro educational kind of
program that they might roll out but is
there something you specifically if it's
selfishly at all like wanna see Apple
talk about or or release today well
there's just been this has been a split
forever between the iPad and Mac books
and I've said this for years I want them
to combine I mean I just want some way
that those two can feel joins and I
don't think that's going to happen here
but maybe maybe it is building out the
iPad plans more I do like the idea of
putting pencil sorry I'm drifting a bit
pencil into entry-level iPads so that
people could use them to to draw and I
also think who's there oh by the way
we're guys Gore's here yeah Wow what's
he doing is right there along with
Angela what's he doing there what's he
doing I don't know he's coming to be
with us
and he does come to a number of Apple
events Bay Area is just three rows in
front of us so that's that's pretty cool
so that's pretty cool maybe they'll be
other appearances and surprises yeah
I'll just turn around and email so I
also think I'll just turn it that way
and talk I also think that yeah pencil
is a big deal because for art for other
functions like that better keyboard
support if you're gonna use these things
to compete with Chromebooks which have
made a lot of headway in schools pricing
and again I just think if you know my
wish list I don't think will happen here
is just to make these iPads and work
like laptops for what what kids and
anybody else leads them for to close
that gap because it's not closed well
and iPads have advantages in being a
little more closed off and for education
that can be helpful but also it's not
great for running especially the browser
environments to run certain types of
tools I find it frustrating
I can't file
where he's easily on iPad so that's I
want the trackpad I want the full
wonderful laptop transfer moving so
going back to the whole educational
angle we were just talking here before
we went to you live in Chicago that most
schools in the US if they do have some
kind of tablet they're using a Chrome OS
based tablet three out of five tablets
in the US are Chrome OS tablets used for
education what what can Apple do to sort
of make a dent in that disparity well
maybe they can start by making one thing
that I feel is that Chrome OS is out
there and there are a lot of chrome
tools maybe iPads could work butter with
with chrome tools I think that's I think
that's feasible it seemed so because
you're not going to not going to get rid
of that market I mean and I think it's a
very distinct landscape than Apple and
the app ecosystem I think some way to
address that defuse it I think Apple
will just keep building most likely on
on the apps and advantages there that
they have already died and maybe it has
to do with creating a better way we were
just talking about this before and
Charlotte Shar had written about this
about resale value for iPads maybe
there's a user acquisition system for
installing these and schools and trading
them out for other models I don't know
but I know that my kid uses an iPad and
I know that my kid also uses a ton of
chrome tools and wants a Chromebook so
you know and that's something that feels
more like a regular computer because it
has the normal web tools and a trackpad
so yeah and it runs the different free
apps and software so I think that's a
thing all right we'll let you get back
unless you get something else you want
to talk to me all right we're gonna let
you get back to getting ready for the
event which is set to start in about
five minutes or so Scott thanks so much
we'll we'll look to get in touch with
you after the event buddy hey you guys
are great good job I'll see you again
all right tell Al Gore we said what's up
no cutting class Scott
all right we thank Scott Stein that's
not an easy thing to do in that seat
waiting for the live the show to start
great job and there was a woman right
over her shoulder giving him side eye
most of the time yeah she's skyping from
the seat yeah she was sort of giving him
just the stink eye every couple seconds
to go
that was interesting Al Gore's showing
up currently he's on Apple's board yeah
okay we're just informed by others
laughs that cool just so you guys know
the Apple event that's about to happen
five minutes from now it's not going to
be streamed at all this is really the
only way you can follow along live you
know with the combination of this video
stream and the live blog that you've got
below our player so you're going to want
to keep it here for the next hour or so
while this goes down I know that's a lot
to ask but you're gonna get the latest
and greatest right here by sticking with
us so we look forward to that event
starting in about four minutes we'll be
re-enacting the live blog yeah you'll be
playing the party nine uh Dan will be an
iPad iPad so we look forward to that
getting off the ground in just a few
minutes so yeah I mean I'm pretty you
know I've got like a lot of things
swirling my head about what exactly is
gonna go down but you know I I'm not
expecting to be surprised in any sort of
way I think like you know Apple has a
lot of like Scott said has a lot of work
to do sort of catching up to to what you
know the Google platform has been able
to do with education in the country so
there there are a few rumors and little
leaks here and there from the iOS 11.3
now beta okay you know something I
believe it was called class KITT kind of
wish was shown inside the code props
something to help manage apps that were
designed specifically for teachers using
them in the classroom so we could hear
about that maybe and also there have
been reports of iBooks getting a
facelift of sorts and just being called
books because in the beta version the
app is just called books so that's what
we talked about back in 2012 right like
they have iBooks electronic textbooks
maybe that's getting a refresh and just
something that kind of matches a little
bit more with what iTunes looks like I
mean that's something I see today as a
as a parent walking to school every day
is these kids even though it's 2018
still have these gigantic backpacks on
full of all these books and it's such an
archaic concept that you have to carry
these big textbooks to and from school
every day we're almost way overdue for
for electronic textbooks to take over
not just in colleges where people are
definitely starting to use them more but
also in you know middle school and high
school yeah I mean that is something
that I cannot believe we're at a point
at where that is not completely
eradicated how that cost a lot I mean
and then you have the issue of like kids
losing their you still need some
physical book and look in the you know
to like go fall back on right but do you
need to take them back home all the time
yeah I mean well that I mean I remember
there were there were initiatives to
sort of like leave the books at the
school and not have them be you know
lugging back and forth but that's right
2018 how are we still carrying around I
mean I'd like a 25 pound backpack
definitely what I was like was that Mary
who like heads my books were so heavy I
was ordered to not wear in the backpack
because I was gonna get scroll hostess
and I had to have total nerd alert here
that's not hurt that is protected it's
fine no no I haven't little dolly
rolling I mean like rolling the class
and my braces will say I do see today a
lot of kids when they go to school
they're double strapping it with a
backpack and in my day you would never
ever ever do that nobody goes wonderful
once bad yes why don't you permanent
irreparable damage my god I already kind
of look like this when I stand up
straight I know if I don't correct for
it this shoulder is like three inches
lower than this shelter we got to get
out in front of these textbooks they
need to be more than just I mean it
sounds silly text because the whole
point of the physical learning like
everyone learns differently you learn
physically you learn what audibly I like
to see what they're gonna do to make it
more interactive to make you actually
want to engage with the iPad more so
than just like and now it's words on a
screen so I can carry less because
I'm a highlighter I like I like
interacting with them yeah I don't know
there's something about this whole sort
of thing that I kind of struggle with
from you know I mean I understand like
where Apple's coming from where they
want to kind of indoctrinate an entire
generation of students to become
customers when they when they're old
enough to afford their own you know
Apple products but you know I'm always
curious how they had they walked that
line of not getting you know to sort of
like you know commercially in front of
students and I'm always curious to see
like how that balance shakes out I got
it got some interaction on Twitter right
now hashtag seen it live if you want to
drop your thoughts in a tom rule over
here you know he's saying oops like this
profile instead tons of reasons why text
won't go away students learn different
paper versus screen retention is key
paper rocks but also his schools looked
at Chromebooks he says and they found
that like really too much damage and
iPads are harder to break in his schools
research so maybe for some schools that
that is something to consider too
because you have to obviously replace
them when the kids are lugging them back
or not around interesting sounds like
he's in the pocket of big papers he's in
Georgia I guess it's it's easier to get
repaired with the knife I mean he says
in his tweet so you know everyone's got
a different viewpoint right remember
this is not the only tech company that's
really focused on schools in education
and trying to get their product in front
of students yeah last year I think it
was last year Microsoft did a big
education event here in New York where
they talked about two things that are
very similar to what Apple is doing
number one I think that's where they
introduced Windows 10s which was the
limited version of Windows 10 that was
initially meant for education Windows
laptops that again worth 250 $300 but
secondly they took the surface tablet
they're basically their version of an
iPad and showed off a lot of new
education software that used a are for
classroom purposes like looking at like
a moon landing or or or other kinds of
stuff like that I love that style yeah
yeah and it was a mix of virtual reality
and augmented reality using a surface
tablet but experiences designed for
students presented by teachers at this
Microsoft event that
we went to probably about a year ago hmm
yeah it's just a cheap way for the kids
to like pop on some cardboard do you
think or not even that they would just
hold the surface up and like like the
moon like the Mars rover would be right
there and you'd be all like looking
around it oh right right like as an AR -
yeah so it sounds like the event has
kicked off they're being treated right
now to a video of children playing we
know exactly where they where they're
focused on out of the gate Shara's
basically transcribing what exactly is
happening slow-mo emotional music which
I think you can just imagine in your
head just fine
and then she said there's some some
voice over a child says imagination is
the key because you're using knowledge
but you know to make something no one's
made before so we're getting real heady
out of the gate at times heartstrings of
course so yeah I mean you know they're
obviously really ramping up to maybe you
know inspire some creativity from
children are we gonna see a not okay
we're talking all this time about about
the cheaper iPad I mean we guys seen
iPad pro upgrade maybe - I'm sure I mean
maybe you know this isn't the venue for
that or maybe you say that later and
that gets sort of you know announced
quietly it's a wild card I'll throw out
okay which is this guy right here at the
classic MacBook Air which is used by a
ton of high school students and college
students still one of the most popular
laptops on college campuses especially
sure because it's the least expensive
Apple laptop it's built like a tank it
can last you know years and years and
years about $1000 its 939 you can
usually get him for about a hundred
bucks off you know it's kind of dated
it's got this giant bezel here around
the screen the screen is low res I still
got the classic I won't take it
personally you know what people still
love them even though they haven't
really updated the design significantly
in years and years they give it a very
very very tiny CPU spec bump last year
staying within the same two or three
generation old CPUs but that's just
shows you the longevity of this machine
if there is a way to get the price
this down a little bit because frankly
it's been 999 for years and years and
years why not do that and give every
maybe not from middle school kids but
for high school kids and college kids
give them a $700 MacBook Air why not
right this is a prep school he's talking
college stuff - yeah so Tim Cook is take
took the stage there in New York in
Chicago rather and you know he's talking
about being inspired by children
obviously over the weekend with the
March for your lives protests that
happened across the country sort of
playing into you know the future of our
country is are these children for sure
so so yeah they're talking about some
sort of partnerships that they've
recently done
sharra says that Tim Cook is quoting the
CPS collaboration that Apple partnered
up with and they're going to be teaching
coding to more than 375 and 70,000 kids
across the district and now getting into
more about the specifics of Lane Tech
and its efforts to to sort of be a part
of that Lane Tech is the number five
school in all of Illinois in terms of US
News and World Report rankings I got
there a little okay there top schools
for sure
and they say Chicago is the third
largest public school district in the
u.s. more more more PhDs come from Lane
than any school in the country huh
interesting
go Lane all right so yeah you know I
mean kind of makes sense now why they
chose this high school yeah
you know all this context definitely
like it's very diverse they're trying to
tell ya it's a very diverse school to
also have students playing music in this
video behind Tim Cook now where's photo
we know our products can help bring out
the creative genius in every can of
course creativity they're gonna focus on
it that's their bread and butter so
Scott is talking about how now they're
going back 40 years and they're going to
teach a history lesson that starts a 19
seventy-eight and now here's where
everyone starts to feel a little old
this is getting a little nostalgic for
me III see the old computers we used to
we if we had floppy 5 inch worth but we
learned basic em you know I'm gonna say
56 seventh grade at my public school in
the Bronx we had a computer lab full of
Apple two-season Apple two E's maybe and
we used them to make our own like text
adventure games and like little uh you
know math games and stuff and and
obviously like different from the coding
kids learn today was that your first
exposure to max it must have been
although I think I had a computer in
about the same time that first computer
is a famous one it was the Tandy trs-80
color computer ok also known as the by
computer aficionados as the trash eighty
the trs-80 which is it had a cassette
drive so if you wanted to play a program
usually a game you'd put an audio
cassette in something that looked like
an old audio cassette player that was
hooked up to the computer you'd press
play and when I have to play for like
seven or eight minutes to load up the
program yeah and then you were playing
dungeons of dagger a Thor something and
basically this is ready player one right
here all the references I'm giving you
are getting ready later on is the first
chapter that maybe including that game I
just mentioned that I played and it is
very prominent in in that book because
we had a very similar Ernest Cline and I
must have had a very second experience
look at that nice Wow
it looks like it's a de Gattaca or
something yeah I want to see my first
exposure to a Mac computer I don't
remember the exact model but it was like
using hyper card remember HyperCard
hyper studio no it might have been I was
like a sort of like almost like a slide
maker yeah I had one hyper studio sort
of like Mac very basic like page
connection sort of software it allowed
you to like create some sort of like
interactive deck if that makes sense
I know exciting well like we my first is
big floppy and putting in number
munchers and and you know Oregon Trail
and any sort of like big program like
that but yeah all right back to the
event Tim Cook is talking about the
everyone can code initiative you know
really going over the educational
initiatives that they have under they've
been undertaking for the last decade or
so these these events are we start off
with a lot of like humble bragging
totally a lot of back padding yeah like
oh check out all we've done just wait
till you hear what's coming a lot of
like done don't pay attention to the
fact that you know more people use
Chrome in schools that's not what we're
worried about right now but again like
this is the preparation for the you know
sort of push that they're going to be
making during during the event here now
anyone in the audience in the auditorium
writing up their live longer stories
about this event on a Chromebook if so
will will Apple agents rappel down from
this feeling yeah just sort of like
silently take them out you know oh there
wasn't anyone sitting here
oh got a woman on stage Shara says the
fastest she's seen Apple put a woman on
stage she is Kathleen Richardson who
works with connected for Apple she's
talking about using Apple products so
basically classroom experiences using
Apple products all right we're gonna
wait to see what she has to say I will
say lane Technical College Prep high
school in Chicago it's most notable
alumni appear to be Edgar Bergen the
classic ventriloquist who created
Charlie McCarthy oh yeah and then and
then the next most famous alumni I see
here is is actor Adrian's Ahmet from of
course what's the triple to movie with
the high school grease - I believe in
grease - also hosted dance fever
- grease - he's replaced John Travolta
in grease - Adrian - Ned oh brother
grease oh he was also on TJ Hooker with
now you talking my language
I'm having these factoids gaping gums
but it's not a bad that's about the
phd's yeah it's not about these guys how
about grease okay so she
it's not saying anything new on stage
but just about how schools of used iPads
you know it's it's expensive to have
every student have an iPad so you
haven't had a lot of I haven't seen a
lot of big major success stories of
schools why to keep investing in them
and it's not just the hardware cost
it's the upkeep and maintenance and
mighty cost involved very often they
have a giant cart that they collect all
the whether it's an iPad tablet or
whether it's a Chromebook whether it's a
Windows laptop they collect them all and
put them all these big custom cards and
each one gets a like a USB input and a
power in fact allows them to be charged
allows them to roll out you know like a
blanket update to do to do remote system
management for them so there's a lot
more involved in just giving a kid a box
and saying go set it up and you handle
any any third party cost there that's
interesting I mean you know maybe
there's a way to like you know
streamline that and not have it be like
this you know handout and gather sort of
process but you know don't you know get
mistake and there are definitely
inherent challenges with rolling out
something like this to students across
the country it's not you know it's
easiest for us to just be like yeah
textbooks are heavy and cumbersome and
stupid but the logistical role out of
everything is not as cut and dry as you
know standard books would be they
currently have a program called
classroom that lists teachers manage all
those iPads - in case you're wondering
about like you can't just like browse
whatever you want or download whatever
you want there are permissions yeah that
are limited on these machines and school
laptops for years had programs people
come and pitch us on stories on these
programs where the teacher could then
pop in and see what was on everyone's
screen right or take over every screen
in the classroom because they had their
master laptop at the front and all the
kids had student laptops and the master
one could control what happened there
wow they're really dragging this intro
out okay so Tim Cook's back putting a
quote up on from Horace Mann education
then beyond all other devices of human
origin is the great equalizer of the
conditions of men now okay so look now
that that's all all these are
handwritten again just like the
invitation which goes back to your
observations
that maybe there is an Apple pencil no
you're right Houseman you're right then
they're just gonna be teaching
calligraphy is what is going down here
like you said before these kids are all
going into the wedding invite business
and that's what you need there is a
dearth going on that was 150 years ago
yeah you know I think like they're also
trying to sell the idea to it's not just
like use our stuff it's like you know
you need tablets in schools you need
this kind of you know drastic kind of
educational reform so how do you guys
use styluses a lot with either tablets
or touchscreen laptops or hybrids
convertibles two-in-one services there
is something to be said about what you
learn in grade school is how your brain
I mean you can always really learn new
things but like I physically like typing
more when I'm writing although I'm sure
a lot of people who are younger or even
used to dictating more oh you know
they're their entire you know paragraphs
that's a lot you know you know texting
is dictating now yeah yeah my text me is
dictated by Hatter fine I don't think
that far to do a whole like five
paragraph essay with you know supporting
evidence I don't like to do that but
take you through they've run to the bank
of payphones in the courthouse can we
rewrite dictate the story right right
over the phone and combat and also I
write down with pen and paper still in a
calendar because I'm a dork like that
but I remember it better so but then but
but but then if you write down on a
tablet those kids will learn that way
it's all about how you're wired there's
a muscle memory involved with writing
something yes so they're pivoting into
iPad chat right now talking about how
students love the iPad because it's so
versatile and how it's become sort of a
staple learning device so you know we're
we're getting ready for something you
know whether or not it's a new product
well we'll have to wait and see but it
could just be something more focused on
the apps than anything else that's I
feel like it may not be a whole new
piece of hardware it may be new apps for
the current nine point seven inch iPad
which again is a great deal at 3:29 but
you can usually get it for a little less
and
maybe some sort of extra price break on
that Apple already offers educational
pricing a lot of their products well
it's pretty good it's 20 bucks off for
iPads 50 bucks off so but educational
pricing that that's for individually if
you walk into an Apple store and say I'm
a student I don't know about the pricing
and for like buying in bulk if you are a
school like that
I'm sure that's better if you buy in
bulk yeah I mean maybe I'm
misremembering but I want to save
perhaps maybe when I was in college the
the discount the dot e-d-u discount was
a hefty sort of thing and I remember
holding on to that for at least two to
three years after I had graduated when
my email would still inexplicably work
I'm sorry Scott we didn't have dot e-d-u
I was in college oh you did I ate a UNIX
account a VAX account and that was about
it and they all started with like my
social security number
Oh ro that sounds secure yeah we played
muds okay all right we're leaning into
like the app stuff now they're saying
that nearly 200,000 apps are made in the
App Store for education it's probably
something we knew already but
nevertheless man they really are beating
around the bush I don't know it's only
been 15 minutes but like that may be why
they're not televising this could be
because just like hey we make a lot of
education apps all right Tom Railsback
on Twitter chiming in what we just
talked about I he works at a school and
he says they get the same pricing $20
off but he's not buying a gazillion just
a few hundred that's a lot boo yeah so
dad's up adds up the discount but yeah
yeah they're you know obviously a lot of
you know visual stuff they're really
trying to glamorize the iPad learning
experience but I don't know maybe like
haven't a lot of there there are a lot
of good educational apps on dal-su we've
got kids about the same age you could
use an iPad not yet he's sort of like
his first exposure was just watching a
video on it but he's never he's never
really like there's a teacher on stage
now
Casey Williams she's a teacher from
Woodberry down primary school she's now
talking about how her students use Apple
devices yeah I mean I know that you can
really tell the funny understands like
you know you're not even three he'll be
three in a couple weeks but he gets it
and I and I think it's you know alone I
will say this though I think a lot of
the learning that he is currently going
on with him
it's actually from TV I think like you
know and we grew up with Sesame Street
and that was educational for sure but he
there are shows that he his memory is
just like completely exercised with some
of this stuff to the point where he you
know in the and the instantaneous
application of that stuff he sees and
applying it to the real world it's just
sort of like wow do you maybe you don't
even need to go to school we'll just
watch curlers a lot from Daniel Tiger
it's a shocking moment and tell me it'll
happen to you someday if it has not
happened yet when when you're when your
child picks up either your iPhone or
your iPad and knows your passcode and
you haven't told them haven't done dad
figured that out right away yeah he got
control he has an old iPad too I think
in like a big rubber bumper he's and
he's used that for years he forgot I had
a search for videos by voice I'm like
yeah I'm like YouTube for kids so he
just hits the microphone he goes like
marble runs making fly but but there are
tons of games that have you know math
components and reading components and
basic shape stuff so there's a lot of
interesting stuff there I think he's
more into that than TV that well here's
okay so here's some examples of how her
students are using it they're not only
researching collecting and presenting
their work but they're doing it by
making videos so the presenting all the
work that they've done in a class
project using video and iPad so being
able to see their learning in video
helps the teacher better assess what
they know and you know it's I mean that
was kind of joke like oh my gosh you're
putting a camera on this big hunking I
pie like who's using the
well you know I feel it all the time a
student project and that's an important
point of differentiation between an iPad
or an iPhone and a Chromebook yes you
could possibly shoot some video on a
Chromebook and maybe you could edit it
if you had a good online editing tool
but it's not as easy as shooting it on
an iPad and editing it in iMovie or just
trimming it in your camera rolling but
even titles on it yeah that's one of the
things that an iOS device can do that
frankly a Chromebook or other Chrome OS
device would really struggle with so a
new iPad is coming they talked about how
the nine point seven inch iPad is
available to schools for $2.99 and a new
iPad is about to take things even
further showing the Apple pencil stylus
is being showcased here and that's kind
of the big announcement is the ID is
that this new Apple iPad will work with
the pencil and we're just waiting to
hear exactly what it is Scott says it
looks like it's going to be a nine point
seven five
I paired pro Oh interesting he said it
looks like okay maybe it's it's it's
boasting similar specs nine point seven
is the standard iPad non-pro size that
they've had since you know the beginning
the quote on stage is the new nine point
seven inch I think it's just an iPad not
a pro right it's adding pencil support
now the question is do you still charge
and sync the pencil by awkwardly
plugging it into the Lightning jack at
the bottom of it which is one of the
single most ridiculous I think Apple
design decisions I've ever seen that in
the mouse that gets recharged by oh that
too yes yes so so I helped me understand
in the iPad the 9.7 current iPad what
what like what separates that and the
pro here's an interesting thing Apple
had the iPad for many years then they
had the iPad air and air too and then
they ditched the air too and said last
year now it's just called the iPad again
that was essentially in iPad air
one in terms of body size and shape and
features they added a touch ID
it's got Apple fans oh yeah yes everyone
has that one so but it didn't support
the pencil it didn't have the same type
of screen as the pro it didn't have some
of the other high-end features that the
pro has the pros ten point five inch
there's also the larger 12 inch version
you could still get to the pro but
that's not as updated as the 10.5 inch
which is the current one we're seeing
one of Scott's all the videos of the new
iPad there's the pro and I think we have
the video of the 9.7 I've had from last
year which probably is what this new one
looks like these pro features in a
non-pro body which is an interesting
combination I like that yes oh so if so
here here's a good sort of layout of
what exactly is around aha so you turn
that 9.7 into a pro what essentially
happens I think that you add the
pressure they're talking about some
pressure sensitivity for the for the
stylus okay stick in the side charging
continuous says yes
let's see dimensions the bezels look the
same as the current iPad it looks like
the same body frankly it doesn't look
any thinner they haven't said anything
about spec changes so that seems like
it's software related they found a way
to get the pencil to work with with the
screen there's gonna be updates to these
working apps here okay you know but
that's not just for numbers that would
be for every writer every iOS device so
so yeah so you were not looking at any
kind of hardware update I mean it would
happen with all that yeah sure I don't
know that's a good question so that
might be the difference here because
because the screen in the previous iPad
I think I lost a layer of land they had
like a one-piece screen design to save
some money okay so here's a smart
annotation you see normally when you
turning your papers electronically your
teachers have to still mark them up and
so they have to print them out and this
is something where maybe a teacher can
you know actually you know make little
comments on how little Johnny's doing on
this assignment look at that that's
collaboration but the same thing we do
in Google Docs and we mark something up
but that's super important especially if
you're a school stuff and we do it here
all the time it's tomorrow annotation
your words will stay anchored to the
words they were added to so I guess you
can yeah it's like it's like
that's kind of cool but a pencil the
same exact kind of stuff but you'll
probably have a little more freedom a
little more flexibility to we see that a
lot in the Microsoft edge browser which
came with Windows 10 if you use that
with let's say a surface tablet or any
other kind of tablet or two and one with
style support it's very easy to take a
web page and mark it up and then save it
and share it and that's one of the
things people liked about edge and
Windows 10 that you could do that
they're talking about digital books
again up let's see we have an example on
here with it with a laptop a MacBook on
screen talking about their interactive
textbooks being able to customize it to
what your kids are exactly learning
about in class you can see in that
example there's a video they can click
there's you notice they're showing a
MacBook Pro not a not an iPad yeah
because it says they're bringing digital
book creation to the iPad and they're
putting it right inside the Pages app so
it has the Pages app will have
everything you need to make a digital
book all right well that seems pretty
cool on pardon the pun on paper because
it's essentially saying all right well
we're going to have allow teachers to me
we design curriculums or some sort of
interactivity customize that for their
classrooms is what I'm sort of
extracting from that kind of
announcement which i think is pretty
cool and with emphasis you can
personalize the book with your own
illustrations which actually this is
yours Bridgette honestly what are you
doing classes especially things like
chemistry you're saying they're copying
the teacher you know drawing things out
it's more than just here's a little
doodle right right so a teacher might
have their own doodle that they want to
put on a lesson yeah so yeah I guess
there's so what the takeaway is right
now is obviously how pencil is this sort
of educational key that they're a lock
that they're about to really lock the
pencil after just the pro and it is
expensive not everyone who bought a pro
bought the pencil so it's been a very
kind of niche product so maybe this is
the way to get the pencil in a lot of
different hands
is it still $99 and they have not said
yet well all this stuff we're talking
about the iWork suite of apps they're
all gonna be free into every iPad so
right out of the gate you buy an iPad
you're gonna have all this all this
power okay so now we're talking about
the specs Oh most affordable iPad but
they haven't said the price yet it's
gonna have a ten-hour battery with an
a-10 chip okay eight that's good doesn't
the old one have the a9 gyroscope so
it'll no tilt touch ID they solve that
oh yeah there's still a fingerprint
scanner on there which could be
important for schools in terms of
authentication and logging in yeah cuz
right yeah if you're going to share an
iPad and with new face idea it's a bit
much and expensive I mean just weighs
just a pound I mean I like what I'm
hearing
dan does this sort of on paper feel like
it's mostly a clone of that it is not
radically different than the than the
iPad from last year I think I'll have to
get a closer look at it to see but I
don't feel like they re machined a new a
new physical chassis for it they might
have changed the display technology to
work better with the pencil sharpener
pencil support seems software based this
is interesting
they are going to before we get there
Shar said with the a10 fusion chip this
iPad is now more powerful than most PC
laptops and virtually every Chromebook
Chromebook a little big right there yeah
by sharra we're getting to exactly what
you said about what Microsoft was doing
many realities you're gonna be pointing
this iPad at things and you're gonna be
seeing live things on your classroom
table you can already do some of this
with the regular iPads obviously with
the latest phones they've been very big
into this show so I don't think this is
a huge a huge leap I don't think this
has you know I guess like a the advanced
camera setup that the iPhone 10 has for
example that really does help with
augmented reality but you owe an
attorney history app is an example right
now I've also seen this girl with her
you know it's the classic science
project of I need to make Planet
yeah I'm like mom dad tomorrow I'm
supposed to have plants and you run to
Michael's your football yeah
and so now here's a girl like making it
to the future with her always it's
augmented reality planets Microsoft
showed off with with the surface doing
an AR solar system yeah for what it's
worth the Apple store is currently being
updated so perhaps these are something
here it could be you know consumer focus
consumer facing there's something called
AR Boulevard that will that is almost
like a art history related app and you
can kind of imagine art hanging on the
walls says I mean another one being
talked about called free rivers by the
World Wildlife Fund so it's not just
reading about science quote onstage it's
experiencing it yeah and I feel like
this new iPad isn't it's not going to be
only available to people in schools
they're just gonna put on everyone will
be able to buy it and maybe I'll get
your twenty hours off right you get you
with your account with your with your
Education discount it was interesting to
hear that that schools don't get
preferential pricing even though they
buy eight balls if they can get the iPad
down to two hundred and fifty four
holiday sales school should be able to
have access to that price they're not
made the schools aren't out to do
anything except to teach children and
help the next generation become better
than us if I were Tim Cook dare to say I
would want a free iPad and every
student's hands in the country because
you're making a lifetime customers
totally this is a almost a trillion
dollar company if they could like it it
schools yeah with g5 that's an
investment yeah I mean I then you'll buy
a mac book air and then later you buy a
MacBook Pro buying an iPhone and you're
buying apps don't schools have to now
invest though in cloud storage to be
able to have all the students save all
this work to I don't know I guess we're
not educational experts or even highly
educated right of course I mean look at
this but you know I think that some
details being left out where it's like
why is the discount so insignificant I
mean in in major major bulk sure that it
adds up but
is it not easier to get these tools in
students hands so I feel like they're
still doing a lot of app demos a you
know dissect a frog and all the solar
system now dissecting frogs what else is
vegetable cliche in the book can I can i
record my school play yeah yeah I know
maybe we could watch the school play
with augmented reality and see like cool
sets and costumes and special effects oh
I think I got an idea here let me
let's kick started it yeah you know it's
pretty cool I think like if I had a tool
like this I would be way more into
possibly opening up a fake frog yeah
kind of I don't want to smell that
formaldehyde yeah you know that was like
the worst thing I have such awful
traumatic memories of that day in
science and if I could just open up one
of these things through my iPad idea
yeah so the starting price for this new
iPad 9.7 is 329 and the school price so
you know what that does follow the Apple
model which is the following year or the
next update keep the price the same but
make the product better they're not
really big into cutting prices for the
most part there have been exceptions but
generally speaking the next version of
our product keeps the same price
improved suspect so you feel like you're
getting more for your money
but they don't have to lower prices
overall which is something I think we
all know Apple is loath to do to to
lower prices in general right if you
have an iPad right now you can download
these Iwerks updates today and right now
they're talking about GarageBand updates
for kids sounds so it was a kid sound
pack I guess to be a little silly goofy
GarageBand is pretty awesome for kids
back yeah so so Dan as a consumer you
see the new layout you see the new
updated specs on the 9.7 is is this a
good buy
it's the one that we had last year the
nine point seven inch iPad which weekend
was 329 really stood out as not super
exciting but just a great value if you
wanted a high-end have an experience
because the only other step
was getting the pro which is just so
much more expensive think it starts like
$600 something like that so the fact
that they've added pencil support and a
bunch of other things yeah it seems a
little bit better than last year's at
the same price which is the Apple model
if you're gonna buy an iPad and let you
really need something the pro has which
used to be pencil support you know I
feel like this is this is the one to get
that said there are other tablets that
are less expensive and do a lot of the
you know same stuff I think the Amazon
Fire HD 10 is a great alternative if you
just want to basically watch movies and
play some games on your tablet it's
usually 150 maybe I forget phone sales
on that it's not as good as an iPad 100%
but pretty darn good and it's half the
price they're not talking about what
they do for when students are sharing an
iPad because you know not every school
is gonna have one iPad per kid you know
that's a little bit so it depends on the
school you go to right you know but they
have something called Apple school
manager where an Apple ID can be
creative in bulk you can create IDs for
you know a school of 1,500 kids in less
than a minute um my graduating class was
2,000 so for me like I went to a big
school so I my school would definitely
have needed to share iPads this was
actually a banner moment here this is a
feature people been asking for for years
and years and years the ability to have
different accounts on an iOS device and
a lot of people in and out to get your
preferences and your information and
your apps and stuff the fact that
they're using schools I'm used to have
this is actually pretty awesome if
everybody can get this yeah that's what
I was about to say they're sneaking it
in under the guise of school management
but at the end of the day it is profile
swapping an account and an Apple ID
swapping on a single device I hope so
Danny really apparently though they had
had this for school users for why okay
as part of an Apple classroom app but
clearly it not it's not widely spread we
just asked I was asking about storage
schools get for free 200 gigabytes of
iCloud I don't know George I don't know
if that's purse or yeah that's per their
iPad
opposed to the five missing five pigs
that you get now which consumers I think
still only get the five so Logitech
they're talking about logitech's
new kid iPad case and a $49 ago
Lamar called crayon nice I don't know if
it has the exact same features why not
but I mean if it's half the price of the
pence but the fact that they're opening
up the stylus games the to third party
companies is really interesting who
knows how many knockoff pencils we'll
see now and whatever you plug in a ten
dollar one within you know two months
I'm not seeing any new features in that
pencil you there is just the current
that's the same pendulum that's really
good that III made my little yeah
because I know that it's been so much
time since Microsoft's pen has had an
eraser and I always wonder like why but
is it around I mean there's a button in
the app yeah the tip eraser but we've
had comic book artists in here we've had
animators in here designers and have
them test drive
the iPad pro with the pencil the
Microsoft Surface pro with the Microsoft
pen things like Microsoft's big giant
surface that looks like a drafting table
and a few other things and and they're
all good but definitely the pencil had
it's fans it has a certain the tip of
the pencil and the screen of the iPad
pro and I don't know if this would be
the same with the screen on the regular
iPad there's a certain drag to it that
really does feel like a pencil
I found the Microsoft pen to be very
usable in a lot of ways in terms of very
fine control and that rubbery tip that
really gives you a nice and a nice
ability to really control the strokes
but the pencil had this realistic kind
of like graphite on paper drag that I
don't think anyone else has matched
because if you look at the pencil I wish
we have one right here I could show you
it's just a plain plant there's no
little rubber end on the tip so it's a
different feel from 99% of the other
styluses styli that I've tried yeah I
wonder if Scott will be able to confirm
whether or not
that's the case after he's heads he will
be elbowing his way through the demo
room and to compare with the crayon now
no now they got a pencil my god I kind
of dig this so they're pivoting to
talking about having tools for teachers
now and you know this was something we
sort of predicted a few minutes ago
where we're saying all right we'll you
know creating syllabuses and curriculum
for teachers it seems like they're
getting serviced with a classroom app
that will allow teachers to sort of keep
their students focused and kind of track
progress and that's a lot like we were
talking about before where the Windows
school laptops had a teacher program and
the suit and saw the student program and
the teacher could either see what was on
the screen take over the student screen
take any student screen and share it to
the rest of the classroom that's sort of
that sort of systemic control within
like a 20 or 30% classroom setting the
classroom has existed but the news here
is that the classroom is now available
on the Mac so if you're the teacher with
your Mac you can you can kind of tap
into it and not just be using an iPad
yourself that's right the brand new app
that they are debuting is called school
work and that is a free cloud-based app
that makes it easy to assign handouts
and to tap into the power of the apps
that make that are able to track sort of
each student's progress that sounds fun
let's make an apple called schoolwork
yeah your schoolwork download schoolwork
why don't they just call it homework
homework like check your school work out
for your homework yeah so that you know
look this is definitely educationally
empowering so that's pretty cool it's
literally as easy as sending an email
let's go so that's how most
communication is now so they're just
trying to like you know give you it's
almost like slack for kids world you
create future bridges or stop thinking
about slack for kids you know I you know
to me it's just funny how it's just
basically like the digitized
of all the analogues that we we had when
we were in school like the xeroxed you
know worksheets and whatnot and yeah the
copy of copies that is like faded yeah
you know especially public schools
they're so caught in the middle right
now between the digital world you know
the transition vintage retro paper world
so you could be in one class one year
and the teacher has a great email list
and sends out stuff or has some sort of
cloud sharing account that that
everybody can get their materials from
and then the kid next classroom over
could have a teacher who has no idea how
to do any of that stuff and they don't
get and they just get mimeograph yeah
off-center pages sent home crammed in a
backpack every day or if you go to the
school office you still have to like
write down a note on a scrap of paper
and leave it in like a metal mail tin
somewhere next to the timecard clock
that they still punch in and out of the
digital divide is real and and all and
your opportunities are what tools are in
front of you you know even students who
like required that this homework to take
home if they don't have an iPad or to
take home there and have no computer at
home what are they going they're going
to the library which is also underfunded
it closes in two hours and then whatever
you can do there so yeah like all these
things like like it's fantastic it's
great but you have to also hope that
that it can be in their lives throughout
their day and when they'd have homework
to take home to and that's why I think
there's 200 gigs of iCloud storage is so
important because one of the big
advantages that Chromebooks and Chrome
OS has is even if you're not taking that
unit home with you at night you can
access all of your stuff from any
computer just by logging into your gmail
account rather that's out of library
whether that's at home whether it's your
parents work computer their home
computer a PC Mac even a phone really
anything you can get to your stuff and
it's all there in the cloud so what
Apple really is pitching is basically a
transformation of the entire classroom
teacher student experience I mean they
they seem to have you know designed a
workflow that would essentially replace
all analog elements of everyday school
life and once we had robot teachers let
me tell you now we're talking
and then that's when they bring out the
new Robo to do I want Carrie I want an
emoji teachers no I do not want that I
do not want that and thank god they're
not leading with an emoji teachers we're
talking about class kid now that's what
we thought we saw in the beta version of
11.3 this is the API that allows all
these hook ins to the school work system
so all these apps can like connect into
the main school work hub I guess it
seems that school work is the hub if I'm
reading this right it does look a little
bit layered so it's hard if you know
code until June right so sweet work will
be available in June the same time as
the classroom oh you just said robot
teacher there's something called Apple
teacher
it's our free and self-paced online
professional learning program okay for
teachers tread lightly school work yeah
so he showers a scoring available in
June and then Scott adds that
essentially this is their Apple's big
answer to Chrome and it's sort of
software ecosystem sure and remember
Apple had an Early Head Start in this
market starting frankly eight years ago
in 2010 with the first iPad everyone
said Oh a $500 computer like device we
can put in schools that's great but then
over the years they were totally
eclipsed first bite see Windows laptops
then buy Chromebooks which ran the
Chrome OS system is it too late to go
back now our school districts so
invested in these other products that
they get through gallery HP or Lenovo or
whoever else all of who make education
Chromebooks that are frankly often
ruggedized yeah which these kids really
need this does not look like it you'd
have to get like a big rubber bumper
cover or something
is it too late Apple often gets into
markets years after everyone else
because they're waiting for the right
time you know we're adding a big-screen
phone now we're adding this feature
we're adding uh you know facial
recognition years after everybody else
but it's still the best version and if
it goes oh that's great for schools is
it too late our schools already over
invested in Chromebooks and and
reluctant to switch you know and you've
done to me now you've created a
future this is the blood is where we
enter the black for an episode no no so
we got slack for kids an emoji teachers
and now we're when you're shut when
you're looking for to buy a new home in
a school district you'll want to see if
that school is IO s or Android I why is
this house there chief the school
district it's a Windows 10 it's a school
that Black Bear house for the insurance
money now Oh sad comment from Laura
seeing that all this has me thinking
schoolwork hanging on the fridge at home
is gonna be a thing of the past
you know our new smart fridge we're fine
that's a Samsung oh no oh no it's what
Billy your schoolwork can't show up on
the fridge you used to be Oh easier
can't do it now I'm sorry dude I did
years ago get get four of those cheap
but at 3m double plastic hooks yeah but
they're with the Atlanta but the elastic
thing you've pullin it pops off stick -
down here - up here on your refrigerator
you slide the iPad right in that was the
first iPad wall mount I think I I hacked
many many many you know seven or eight
years ago I just put some of these
little hooks up plastic hooks I got it
Lowe's and just slid my iPad and I was
like look I made a wall mount what else
is happening here Bridge you look like
something's caught your attention well
I'm just kind of poking around when
people are saying on Twitter but in
general back in the in the live show we
got another woman on stage she's from a
school in Baton Rouge talking about how
Apple teacher and her experience using
Apple teacher so it looks like some
folks have been able to use it already
and it's changing how they're kind of
doing their curriculums it sounds like
you know the learning is more
student-centered because they're all
like around the computer and creating
things I think that's fun I think one of
them earned a badge four pages in iPads
by doing the Apple teacher training oh
yeah yeah we've added gamification to
educational iPad teacher training yeah
the teacher side it did say
has badges and so you can see how other
tea you can get examples though from
other teachers you know so you're not
like alone in your quest for more badges
you can kind of get examples from what
others are doing and we're not knocking
badges in school I mean stickers and
check pluses to teachers need some
stickers too they need a little that's
great that's great but I don't see here
is something that's an interesting topic
that I think people are talking about
more and more which is remote learning
like actually conducting classes
remotely there were ton of startups that
are very invested in that there's a Khan
Academy yeah obviously very big in that
there's a little different were you
talking about with iTunes U though right
like like like I mean that is in one
wave remotely but it's not necessarily
live I don't you know could you use your
iPad to tune into the class if you're
homesick for the day or something yeah
yeah I mean you know that's something I
guess surprisingly absent you would
think in a classroom exchange with like
you know like students in another
country or another city yeah I'm
surprised there I'm really surprised
that's not something they're considering
I mean that to me that sounds like a
feature that they would have to run by
the school and well I see a lot of
students and teachers make their own
verses of that and I'll just use Skype
to like you know make that happen on
their own but yeah as far as the program
make it easy right that is not that
doesn't dam a guest teacher guest
lecturer and it just pops up and
everyone's iPads of the class that
sounds pretty awesome better than than a
substitute who doesn't know the material
today's special guest Jeff Bakalar
coming to you live from New Jersey and
we talked about learning a teaching kids
how to code the Swift app and they they
definitely have been doing a lot here
already you know with Swift playgrounds
you know making it easy with the
programming language and of course get
more kids to program on that Apple
devices makes make mix more future Apple
product things start um yeah like we're
getting a real flavor of the event here
even though Apple is not actually
streaming it yeah definitely I mean
you know I think I understand why they
didn't choose the stream it but you know
it is sort of like a very it's it to me
it's it's it they're pitching the
country where it's like hey this is this
is what we want to do to change the way
you teach or at least aid the way you
teach it's not the most action-packed
Erhard world or feature filled appaled
event ever but i kind of like the crayon
the the third party Apple pencil for
like 50 bucks or so I'm really into that
that's half the price so maybe they
didn't cut their price but somebody in
it but someone did yeah cuz honestly
there's you but there will be some catch
to that crayon it doesn't do this yeah
well there will be something I don't
want to tech products though at least
get the job done that sounds like a
that's gonna be an ad by next week gets
the job done okay so yeah again you know
the they're they're they're teaching to
code initiative isn't necessarily new
but it seems like it's becoming more
sort of fleshed out I think this is the
class that Scott's taking after
presentation based on his on his
schedule of it's got gonna learn Swift
programming but will it work with lab oh
oh yeah okay when I've been at like WWDC
and they start talking about remember
they introduced with you before last
year maybe that's where I just I've been
doing this for a long time but even I
was just like what I mean I placed over
Tim Stevens who sit next to me was
apparently a big code was ago he was
super into this so oh they're taking any
swift questions who have asked him on
swift there's an AR KITT module so now
the students are learning how to program
pendler and a program with some 3d and
AR and that's like that'll have fun
they're awesome Scott says it sounds
fascinating
I think I think being there you could
just your imagination kind of starts to
run you get to see like wow what if what
if what would life have been like if I
learned this and it how would have you
change things yeah I mean I'm I'm a big
believer that learning to code is
similar to like learning how to play
instrument or you know there's certain
sort of non vocal languages that are
that can really kind of like aid your
developing mind as you as you become an
adult and I remember the first time I
learned to code just very very basic
stuff that at a day camp you you sort of
realized they're like oh I can speak and
express myself in a way that is not just
junk coming out of my mouth you know and
I think you know pairing this sort of
stuff with with math theory and music
theory and stuff like that is really an
important thing to consider in the
well-rounded education of the next
generation so why did you I'm all good
was it a game was it it was like I don't
remember the language but it was some
sort of like shape creation this is a
lot of like vector based kind of stuff
where you would like just um it was more
like just plotting points on a graph and
like using language like it was a lot of
like ent ext stuff like that if I
remember I mean we're going back almost
30 years that's more advanced than what
I've ever done yeah in my middle school
we had violent it was basic we have to
save our stuff on floppies yeah and the
only mission we had to do was like draw
up thing and have it animate and I
decided to draw an intro to a new video
game I created based off Sailor Moon
so I called her Nina Wilder and it
basically took seven floppies to make
the whole school and so I was a bit of
an over treatment what could have
happened if I had this just stuck with
me in a while next he's not the CW this
is my production in six weeks let me
make some calls do somebody pointed out
I say you've seen a couple you mention
this and this this is important to
mention even though a $329 or $2.99 for
education iPad is less expensive than
let's say the original $500 iPad you
still take that you have to add if it
adds even this less expensive stylus
that's another 50 bucks and frankly any
of the halfway decent nine point seven
inch iPad keyboards or $100
so $2.99 399 so 450 you're looking at
450 is that include a case did not even
include although the keyboard could be a
keyboard cover case so let's say 450
that's just so much more expensive than
a lot of run-of-the-mill Chrome OS
systems and and that still could be a
deal killer for a lot of people out of
school districts I see some vintage
speaking of the original $500 iPad oh my
god there it is this is 2010 whoa Dan
and his giant sideburns comparing it to
I guess a Kindle DX I'm going to say I
think I still have that tie am I still
wearing that watch a lot of other
changes since that I took my shirts in
now this is amazing so why were you
comparing it to an e-reader original
iPad no one had ever seen an iPad before
and we were talking about we got one a
couple of days before they went on sale
which is rare for an Apple product and
we all got a chance to make some videos
and stuff and play with it I did one on
eBook readers I think I did one on
watching like Netflix and one on playing
games and before this Jeff you and I
talked about this we had looked at the
iPad all the specs and stuff and all the
controversy right never lie god this
sounds stupid no but it did and then
when we went when I got one I got to
play with it for like literally two
hours maybe like two or three days
before they were on sale I said to
myself at the end of this little taping
experience was like dammit
now I've got to go buy one of these
things because it was actually awesome
yeah I remember having that epiphany as
well I can't I will be the first to
admit I talked so much junk on that oh
yeah for months what the hell that's not
a computer there's no USB ports on it
anyone who bought our USB ports on it
yeah that's still a big issue but and
man I did a 180 like 30 I was at Best
Buy that morning day one buying my own
I'm gonna buy one it's one of those
things that and it's rare that you see
this it's a product that is better in
person than on paper right and I think a
lot of that the magic there was like it
was a product that everybody needed but
didn't know until you had to use it in
person and see it you know what else was
like that
switch yeah it's a terrible idea on
paper awesome in person yeah sorry about
like okay the Chromebooks but they're
not touchscreen necessarily you know
what a lot of them are and a lot of them
for under $300 are touchscreen with a
with a 360 hinge okay yeah I mean you
know I'm just think about the creation I
get the phone the pen in your hand the
making something that connecting to the
you know but 450 per student versus 250
per student right that's a big defeating
look through the lens of a Board of
Education you know no one's going to
argue that Apple has made a much more
sexier compelling case but I think when
it comes down to the the dollars and
cents of it you know I just don't know
how this permeates in the way that they
were breaking news more expensive
product is cooler than cheap product
yeah I mean that's that's just always
going to be the case so yeah so we've
been chatting a little bit about dads
man and the soul patch don't forget the
soul patch guy that's so amazing you
tell me about that so they're pivoting
into some other kind of stuff about the
creativity the music the video drawing
so that's why I was kind of bringing up
the whole touchscreen and the pen like
we yeah you know maybe there is
something to to the layout of the device
and what it can do for the extra price
but depends on the teachers able to you
know create a curriculum on it or
they're all stuck in this curriculum in
some schools where they have to get the
testing done and they don't have time to
have you spend all this time creating
and going really outside the box what I
find students I mean because I I hang
out with a lot of grade school students
because I there's a ton of kids in my
building and they're so creative and
even if it's not an assignment they're
always making stuff they're all makers
now and they're all creators and they're
doing they're recording their own music
and GarageBand on their on their iPads
they're making their own YouTube videos
they're doing their own experiments that
usually making slime but that's still an
experiment totally you know and the
ability to take an iPad like this and
let's say record some video and then do
some drawing over it - you know animated
annotation and even adding a voiceover
easily which some of these creation
tools let you do I mean that's really
cool and frankly then
is really hard to do on a Chromebook
making these multimedia projects right
now yeah this stuff sounds pretty cool
the more you can play with the more you
more you can just you know experiment
right yeah I mean you know the tools are
definitely here I think we we've seen
evidence of that the last thing they
were finishing up talking about sort of
creating these interactive narrative
experiences explaining you know science
and you know sort of allowing students
to express themselves in the way that
you know is something that other
students could possibly relate to what
they're everyone can create initiative
it sounds pretty cool they're previewing
it today it says that seems like an got
a bunch of stuff in it called everyone
can create yeah right yeah so I kind of
dig that too and it looks like it'll
allow people to sort of create like
little you know president okay here's
one we missed the shoebox diorama
because that that's a picture they have
on screen and there's a student taking a
photo of the shoebox diorama with their
iPad so we had the solar system the
dissected frog my shoebox dive I never
understood the diorama like what better
way to explain your comprehension by
getting a little depth of field by like
building a small representation of what
you just learned
I don't it's just to make the parents go
crazy having to buy materials
oh I mean like only one person in the
history of the world benefited from
diorama and that's Wes Anderson
and cardboard box companies that's the
glue stick people you're the pocket a
big glue stick they have 300 teachers
from across the country and around the
world with us using using this okay
everyone can create a flute so that's
okay opening up now that that means that
means in the fall the teachers will be
ready to start actually beginning using
it with this preview now they're playing
a video of what it's like to be a
teacher from the perspective of a child
I'm sure that's all kinds of adorable
yeah dan they do they do no that's the
one shame about not having a live stream
of this event is Apple does these nice
promotional videos that they usually
open with and close with yeah and the
cool one they give you a different
perspective don't have all the stuff on
line I think they're gonna we're gonna
have Clips pretty soon and they're all
Apple is gonna post the entire event
front to back if you want to sit there
and watch the hour-long thing and I'm
sure we'll have the link up for where
you can watch that and you're right
there looks like they are wrapping up
Tim Cook is now back on stage will there
be it one more thing
I don't think so yeah everyone in
attendance has homework everyone's
getting a sack lunch
yeah scratch-and-sniff Apple Snickers
I'd be okay with that
yeah apple a day everyone yeah yeah well
any one more things we're gonna keep an
eye on keeping an eye on all the
livestream blogs live blogs but well I
guess we're not getting our less
expensive MacBook Air right or more
education of the MacBook Air which is a
shame but you know there's still there's
still two minutes left so maybe though
maybe they'll whip it out Scott's
analysis in the live chat is that
Apple's like his big thing was that how
Apple is expanding pencils support and
betting that it's gonna help with
creative schoolwork and that new iPad
looks like it's the best one for the
price like we said we know that you can
get a regular iPad that works with Apple
pencil there's almost no reason to get
an iPad pro they're not gonna they're
gonna sell the one that's already 2017
cheap or there's gonna get rid of it I
think that's this just replaces that yes
essentially that's not gonna be adding
pencils it's not like there's gonna be
like yeah yeah this it's crazy
you're right uh Scott brought up a good
point the iPad pro debuted late in 2015
and it's only until now that pencil is
getting into more iPads and and having
other iPad support the platform which is
I mean the pro it's bigger screens it
has I think it has more powerful
processor graphics it's got the ability
to display more frames it's got a higher
shrade screen those are really the main
differences and of course the
accessories that Apple makes that work
with it are very nice like the super
fancy keyboard and stuff what does Scott
mean by this doesn't it those new iPad
have a smart connector not sure Wow
might be like a dongle so that that's
you know people have complained that the
the iPad pros were frankly not and what
people are still buying the regular iPad
it was tough to make a compelling case
to get the iPad pro especially because
you still couldn't get like full like
real photoshop on it or right or real it
was straight even though they've been
greatly improved and do a lot of extra
stuff now this was almost in a way if I
may make a controversial prediction this
is basically throwing the iPad pro into
the bus you know that kind of countable
under the school bus oh whoa came to me
whoa you know you're totally right like
now if you're choosing between that 10
inch 10 and a half and half Pro 9.7 I
mean the main thing I mean higher
resolution definitely cool high refresh
rate definitely cool right is it worth
you know 600 bucks or more maybe that's
what wEDC will hear I don't know I
usually it's software related but maybe
they'll have like something they have a
lot of hardware last year they had like
every Matt got refresh at WWDC last year
will be will be logitech cray not work
with the iPad pro I want to say yes
random questions here so Scott says that
the iPad is really the lower-priced
model that should have always been there
but what this means for the rest of the
landscape in terms of price and storage
configurations that's still something we
don't know well apples have this problem
where they used to have a very compact
product line and everyone said that's
the way you do it you don't make 500
different models do you know the
consumer and the the low end of the high
end that this side some of that size and
you have like this quadrant four types
of things for computers that worked for
the iPad it was the iPad but then you
had the air and you had the mini then
you have the pro then you're the second
size of the pro then you have the ten
point five inch pro will they will they
read our
the spigot of iPad products and when the
Apple store goes back up here's my
thousand dollar question will the iPad
Mini still be there hmm
or will it be quietly escorted off
school grounds is that because it's more
expensive or it's not more expensive
it's like the same price it's it's like
this guy they basically stopped updating
it and just kept it up there as a legacy
product mm-hmm but the focus screen is
so close to that mini screen now it's
tough to judge Narada yeah so those
little tablets are the ones that have
really lost out not just from Apple from
other people that's why nobody makes
fancy android tablets anymore
because the big screen phones have taken
that place on the low end and the
touchscreen laptops and two ones at
hybrids have taken that place on the
high end right shouldn't essentially
replaced you know what they were really
the sort of void they were filling so
everyone keep an eye on the lower the
price I don't know they ever were they
ever oh I like to prices go down over
time the original MacBook Air from ten
years this January was the I believe the
10th anniversary of the MacBook Air and
if I want to see a great vintage seen
that video go look up my video of that
but that was originally I think like
1699 for the first version of this and
now it's $9.99 so that's a product that
has that has come way down in price over
the years not something you can always
say about about Apple products Oh Apple
stores back up iPad Mini 4 I still see
it although I don't see the new iPad on
here let me see iPad Mini 4 still there
I'm gonna go to buy so maybe when they
finish that refresh the Mini 4 may be
gone or maybe not so one of Scott's big
wishes and dreams making that I've had
more laptop like did not come true today
this was not the day I just don't know
if he's ever gonna get that yeah
unless you have a big like laptop base
that you just collect the but so what's
the hands-on session that press is going
to so what imagine you know they'll be
playing around with some of the
educational tools trying the pencil on
the iPad crayon right begin to the
crayon I'm team crayon your team Korea
if the ground can do everything the
pencil can do I'm on board
mm-hmm but I'm more curious to see if it
sort of recreates that pencil feel that
you were or how is it charged yeah they
like have a separate thing for that have
anything at the bottom the other one did
so Tim Cook is now back on stage he
seems like he is closing it out lots of
thinking teachers there's a public event
at an Apple store nearby where people
can try out the everybody can create
apps yeah I got imagine like that will
be kind of the focus because of the you
know it doesn't seem like there's a lot
of restriction on that where you would
need to like assume the role of a
teacher we're like the everyone can
create its seems like a more of like a
sandbox yeah yeah playground for anyone
to just mess around and now they're
going to the demo room so that's it
thank you for tuber there you go a live
narrated Apple event which may be more
fun than than just watching these guys
do their demos on stage when you're
really only just watching for the demo
fails yeah exactly
so hopefully we're gonna get to talk to
someone out there very soon want to see
how that shakes out but I think you know
there's a lot this kind of extrapolate
and take away from from the event I mean
D do you guys think they've done or at
least made enough of a compelling
argument I know we kind of like beat
that to death during the actual event as
it was going on but do you think the
argument was made that this is the sort
of platform that needs to be in
classrooms if your if your school
district can't afford it that's that
that's important that that software
looks super cool adding pencils
reporters often same old iPad but that's
ok but how do you make
case that that you should take your
limited education dollars and spend it
on on this ecosystem rather than
something like the chrome ecosystem or
in some districts windows ecosystem and
how do you convince a school district to
switch horses if they're already using
something else and that's the thing and
that's one you know major components of
this entire issue
I wasn't even mentioned I mean I don't
know again like I said we're not sort of
like these these experts that can
comment on a sensitive topic like that
but that is the elephant in the room
it's real it's real talk yeah you know I
mean of course you're a high-end product
great for our utopian society and and
that's what they always build war it's
always been magical just works beautiful
life is better with our products because
you're in that walled garden where your
phone and your tablet and your computer
all operate off the same system and you
can only accept on the computer you can
only install pre-approved apps and and
everything you know message so nicely
together which is great but it also
limits a lot of what I think students
and kids are interested in which is
basically like hacking around with stuff
and matching it and finding new ways to
use it and basically breaking the rules
as they use these devices yeah well I
mean that's actually what what is the
selling point right like hey you know
we're not gonna lower our price but just
look at how much different a lesson can
be if you really get to tinker and just
create and draw and make these
multimedia projects so if your school
right has that budget you'll go oh man
you know like like you can really have
an immersive experience more and yes
there are schools that will be able to
do this and is it Sarah dangling is that
what they're doing yeah I think so I
think we are a unique panel to talk
about this since we all have young
children some of whom are already in
school so so if there's anybody who's
thinking about these issues I'm worried
about them it's probably us I think the
kids are so bombarded with high-tech
high-touch high design interactive
experiences all day long whether it's on
their tablets at home or video game
consoles or augmented reality on the
phones or just pokemons go on the phones
you have to somehow match that level of
excitement in school right from what
I've seen there's still very analog in
especially public schools so so you need
tools like this to keep the kids engaged
and help them keep up yeah just the
heads up the store is live
oh let's see what's there yeah we can
pull up maybe at Bridget's screen ok
iPad new iPad Mini 4 still there yep but
there is the new when I see it says new
indicator under the iPad and there it is
so you're you're going from what it was
before still 399 ok regular iPad new
iPad so that's two years in a row of
small upgrade that don't really change
the look and feel or were now supports
Apple pencil great ok let's see silver
32 gigs 329 128 gigs 429 that's crazy
now let's look at the accessories what's
in the box
ok lightning cable USB man now what's
happening by that 128 oh that's and
there's nothing in between yeah I mean I
the one to get for the schools is
obviously the 329 but it just I don't
know Apple pencil is still $99 I wonder
if there's an education price that had
many for be more expensive what's their
reasoning there it's just it's an old
legacy product and that's just what it
was and what it will continue to be but
I don't think a lot of people are buying
that right but I mean is there something
inside that makes it a more powerful
iPad like I feel like it's an older
design and yeah I don't know we all
expected it to be frankly gone by this
point or at least I guess they don't
want to lower the price because they
want to make this this right the whole
talking point today was that this is the
cheaper they don't really sunset old
products in a big way they just kind of
quietly like you just go to the eyes go
to the website one day and the 11 inch
MacBook Airs is gone right and you're
like what happened to that what do you
mean there was never an 11 inch
MacBook Air because of me it goes in the
memory hole mm-hmm yeah if you you know
this definitely makes the case for
staying within the standard iPad
universe right because now that ten
point five inch iPad pro upgrade it's
gonna bring you up to six forty nine at
the least so you know which is why the
clouds were just so because you're
probably getting a 32 gig version where
and most iOS apps are pretty light in
terms of memory which is great but if
you download a couple of videos on there
you're eating up a lot of that space or
if you create a lot of video on it
you're gonna eat up a lot of space
you're gonna need that 200 gigs of
iCloud space to to store that for sure
so still $99 for the pencil $49 for the
logitech crayon which I don't see any
material about yet I just went to
logitech's website to look for it but I
don't see it yet I don't have it in here
no I didn't see it on the Apple Store
yet but I didn't do like a deep dive
search so again if you want to be a part
of the conversation before we hopefully
get someone in through Skype over the
internet if you'd like to reach out to
us on Twitter please do using the
hashtag seen at live tell us what you
think about the announcements that were
just disclosed about what this new iPad
is going to look like and what it means
for the educational system
Josh Clark on Twitter made a good point
that that iPad discount is now $30
actually okay it's not the same as the
$20 before because obviously 329 goes to
99 um so hey there you go but you could
get that iPad last Christmas from about
Thanksgiving on different stores at
different times for even less than that
mm-hmm so that's not even that great at
price and frankly the 329 won some
stores just regularly have for $2.99
it's it's it's it's rare that you see
Apple discounts but there were some
Apple products big-box stores just
generally have a little bit off on
mmm-hmm
yeah so it'll be interesting to see the
the response I mean you know someone and
maybe you know someone is working on
that piece that sort of analyzes what
the you know the budgetary constraints
of introducing something like this mean
to real-world school districts I would
love to read a story about that so you
know perhaps you know there's a little
bit of digging that will get done once
the dust sort of settles here Lexi is on
the line with us what's going on in a
room surrounded with a bunch of
different apps on I've had I'm literally
just walking guys so I'm still getting
acquainted with it myself sir maybe you
can come with me for trying and see what
we can find here so let's take base I
got ya apples doing it on a school
normally the school just trying to see
state using Apple pencil to draw on the
iPad sorry guys just coming in to look
at this footage right here so that's the
new iPod and using a pencil support for
that doing a little bit of coloring in
okay let's see what else we can find
signals are dropping in a little bit
sorry bear with me okay let's walk over
here there's some musical mutation and
Composition that they are we doing with
the iPads here some customization
templates we can do things like garage
back yes
is this the keys is this the school's
band room like look where are you yeah
sorry it feels like a bad it's got a
couple of computer
up top it's about a lot of you know
musical iconography on the walls here
you can see like a bunch of bands up
there screen printed there's something
that says this Chicago music exchange
being inspired so this very much looks
like a music room there isn't a space
fine just walked in the room as well
they have a couple of costumes here I'm
not sure what's going on here guys
what's going on here down here this is a
Creative Writing Center where students
are tasked with oh that's why you're
dressed up as Romeo we're taking and
quickly adding professional features
such as picture and picture news
authentic-looking news titles and even
petal eggs to create that dynamic effect
whenever analog pretty cool yeah that's
pretty cool that's like you can see like
a lot of questioning here some period
costumes just kind of cool kind of close
it's a little photo booth happening up
here too as you can see don't quite know
what's going on but that you think I've
been told they're using pages and the
presenter March so oh I see they're
using it as a teleprompter so they're
reading lines to each other in costume
very nice and dude I like that that's
cool so then the idea is that students
are going to be making films using pages
and I'm really so that's what this ring
is all about it's very much about media
and creating content over here you can
see some of the projects created on iPad
that's something that they wanted to
show us here all right
so this is the this is the room there
are a bunch of other rooms but I'm not
sure if I can actually go into any of
the other ones you know because we've
all being given you this kind of class
schedule that was emailed to us so mine
actions everyone hope for so dude's got
Sian I know a bunch of us who brought up
in two different rooms everyone else
here like Shara and Connie have got into
different rooms
all right this is just a little bit
about that but it's a long walk between
rooms this is like long school corridor
it's a long way so I don't know if you
want a couple of minute as I walk and
try and get into another room or not but
I knew some rings they've definitely
told us that we can't film inside so I
think if I walk in with the point might
be you know there might be a little bit
suspicious
so it shows was tensions in other rooms
she feels like she's in a math class
because there's a lot of you know
they've got a lot of maps going on a
little bit of geometry probably in there
too definitely feels like I'm back at
school I'm kind of getting a little bit
of a you know when you have like those
weird school dreams about there's a test
today you guys it doesn't look all that
different from the other nine point
seven inch but let's have a look right
here is is taking taking a little bit of
a hands-on with it now and you know what
we'd like to see if you can find it we'd
like to see the logitech crayon if
anybody has that there I I would love to
find that myself as well and I don't
know if this in his rooms but you can
see that's the existing Apple pencil and
the new iPod asked Scott if the pencil
feels the same way it does on the iPad
pro that was something I just got
shooting his own video while he's on
this video for us Wow multitasking right
there he's actually recording a video
right now you should distract it get up
behind them he goes back to you while
he's doing that
yeah just see Nate well it's also its
filming environment run about cameraman
filming so I don't want to interrupt
each other so we're filming someone else
filming Scott go because other videos of
the eyes we're our own worst enemy is
what's happening I know my conception
but usually the pencil
very very similar to the previous
version I'm just gonna try and try and
see if I can get my hands on yeah we're
interested to hear what the feel of the
pencil on the iPad screen versus the I
had pro screen the pencil on the pro had
a great realistic graphite on paper drag
that really felt like you were really
writing and I'm interested to hear what
it feels like on the regular non Pro
iPad yeah absolutely I think that's the
big question as well so I want to see if
the responsiveness is there I want to
see you know if all of the tracking is
started there too
we didn't see any in the announcement
any kind of they sort of just touched on
the pencil really quickly just to talk
me about how it is compatible with the
new iPad but just talking about low
latency things like that but there
wasn't really a big section on it there
wasn't very kind of like with bang here
we go iPad itself though I noticed that
when they did their actual announcement
it was it was just pretty much a video
they came back and they quickly touched
on specs but overall this much of it has
been really really focused on the
teacher experience the student
experience as well which is definitely
kind of a little different to how we've
seen other Apple events in the past you
know we haven't talked much about the
product so I'd say probably took up
about five minutes overall there's a bit
out of time I think the rest of the time
was talking about you asked ways that
students and teachers are going to be
using the iPad and Apple software in the
classroom and a little bit about how you
know some of these cases and studies
from teachers around the world as well
still waiting on that Apple pencil guys
so let's you get it
lexy for you was there something that
really kind of like stood out for you
that you know we're really looking to
kind of get your hands on maybe
something that or something you're
seeing there that maybe they didn't
touch on during the during the
presentation yeah the thing that I
really enjoyed from the presentation I
think the one that's got a lot of
reaction from the crowd as well was
talking about augmented reality you know
obviously a our kid is a huge push from
Apple we've done a platform and they
they did make
that is actually really interesting demo
was only the video unfortunately it
wasn't actually live on stage but they
did it school dissection of a frog on an
iPad like they it'll show up like that
all that it was just it was crazy that
the crowd gasps you know people were
kind of like really shocked that they
were showing the frog dissection yeah it
was actually really cool to watch like
you weren't actually you're going to
have to they were talked about like
reasons why you want to do that on your
iPad versus actually like you know in
real life sure that was kind of cool I
wish they'd start a little bit Oh
actually I want it straight actually
helium tablet tablet
all right see if we can actually this is
the pencil I'm trying to get in a little
bit while they're filming I don't know
if this is going to work guys yeah can
we show us some of I grabbed annotate
using the pencil absolutely I'll select
the new tuna the keynote app it was
upgraded today and select photosynthesis
that's a lesson we're doing and we
believe that observational drawing
within a science class is crucial for
students learning so our students have
already done some research on
photosystem site and they might normally
select they might normally do it on the
Internet now you can actually draw what
they all right let's see if I can also
reach into this I'm gonna draw some
rates in okay phase don't really look
like routes guys I don't know if you can
see what I'm actually doing this little
air it's a little bit about didn't even
know that you're doing this you're not
only reading the trawling you're also
created an animation
and so that students can animate their
work and done they can animate their
work and present it to the students so
hey so what the enemy all right so I'm
actually now going to animate the little
roots that I drew dude the enemy enemy
all right I got it that's what building
on the web yep and then lines wrong and
we're gonna hit options and just slow it
down a little bit take it over to about
five seconds or more so student to do a
voiceover or put in text and talk about
photosynthesis what's going on so that
was my little animation with the Apple
pencil okay I definitely noticed a
difference using the screen versus the
iPad bird I'm Steven I know I wasn't
fully resting on it but it definitely
did have a little bit different tactile
response I need to obviously have some
more time with it to kind of give you an
idea of what the real differences are
but yeah even in my like very limited
interaction just there it did feel
different they didn't feel as you
respond trium but that was just in this
in this app so I would definitely want
to do a little bit more if there is
another area that's really sketchy
something like that I want to have a bit
more of a place wanted not just like
doing annotations sure you could see
other than arthritis that I was like
having a little bit of a trouble kind of
selecting that option yeah like the
annotation in yes sorry it could be used
era hard Alec would be paradise because
I do not want that pass to me but you
know even if this isn't that little
limited interactions like that I had to
go back and do it again you know it
might be some indication but again I
want to make sure that I have this in a
controlled environment to be able to
it's crazy in the demo rooms as you know
like everyone's kind of jostling
composition they kind of only want to
show you you know the demos that they're
running rather than you necessarily kind
of going oh yeah let's just play around
with this totally completely myself yeah
and you have some good time in it but I
do think that we will be getting access
to one shortly so stay tuned
possibly the other date somewhere
impressions on that set all right Lexi
thank you so much for for calling us we
really appreciate you getting in touch
and showing us that live demo that was
awesome
great thanks so much guys enjoy the rest
and start all right thank you so much to
Lexie for calling in we've got some
interaction on Twitter that rule maybe
get two before we say goodbye what are
you saying okay well a lot of people are
chiming in on their thoughts after after
this whole presentation we got Ben Hill
saying his Pistons Apple supporting
pencil in their productivity suite will
help education educators save
significant money because they're
avoiding that 365 office subscription
cost there are free you can use the free
cloud-based version of Office or frankly
Google Docs they show use I know a lot
of schools do use Google Docs and Google
Drive for chair a lot of negativity to
Mike
saying that unless Apple gives away this
hall for free there's no way it's gonna
make a dent because they so he was P was
pretty like when I got Declan Flynn
didn't live up to the hype to him pretty
much the same as before if you couldn't
have a for iPad yesterday you can't
afford them tomorrow another one saying
that for homeschoolers pretty
interesting that you know obviously
because I don't know it's it's always
that's a whole different you know
conversation yeah Gabriel which wonder
what the iPad for many it's coming with
more built-in memory 164 gigs that's why
it's gonna be more expensive and
Stephane also jumped in and said that to
that because the new iPad is 128
gigabytes it's four hundred and twenty
nine dollars so yeah like it's about the
more more onboard storage there mark was
saying I plan to get a new iPad but for
my kids Chicago Public Schools is a
Google Apps District which is where
their eye and also switching costs is
gonna be prohibitive so as impressed as
you can be with like man the dream is
awesome to have kids be that creative
because that's what you always want
sometimes money does come to the end of
it and the folks like Zachary were you
know giving it just wash out you got it
if I catch annotate tweet I'm gonna give
a plug to our old friend Johanna Stern
who tweeted a very good point she said
is it just me or did today's Apple event
make you just want a MacBook with a
touchscreen more than ever yeah maybe a
little bit I mean you know again like
that seems to be there are a few
configurations like Scott's sort of like
you know dream hybrid we're getting one
of these Mac books to support
touchscreens where you know we had a
clip-on device last year that we tested
where you plug it into the USB port on a
MacBook Air and you put this little bar
right at the bottom of the screen it
shoots up a little light field and you
break it with your fingers like I did
look up some prices okay well while we
were talking to to Lexi and you can go
to Best Buy right now and get the iPad
Mini 4 with a hundred twenty eight gigs
of storage for $2.99 so that's why often
is one of the only suppose that has
actual everyday discounts on Apple
products and if you go to B&amp;amp;H right now
they've got the last year's the 2017 9.7
inch iPad 32 gigs the one that was 329
until today when fer was replaced by the
new 329 they're doing it for 289 and I
know for a while support your sure but
if they get the new model and maybe that
would be the same price yeah interested
to see you know Lexi sort of gave us her
initial impressions about the pencil but
she didn't seem super psyched out of the
gate again super early but will be
interesting to see what she thinks down
the road and what Scott things as they
get the player I wanted to give you a
feeling today yes wanted it make you
think back to your own childhood people
on Twitter right now we're talking about
their first computers we were talking a
little bit about during the show and I
mean it made you have that wishful
thinking of how life would be different
if you could quickly create and make all
these things and not just be reliant on
whatever was the power point shared
computer that you can do your
presentation on and and so it's it's
really a wonderful thought yeah how
practical right like you know like we
said how practical that's gonna be will
sort of have to wait and see I don't
think that the MacBook needs to have a
touchscreen big unless you can totally
take that keyboard off and we're talking
about the pro again you know
yeah well this has been great guys I
hope I hope everyone learned a lot today
I know I did thank you so much for being
here where that will do it for us we
appreciate you for staying around with
us and tuning in for these two
educational hours be sure to stay here
right at CNET for all the latest video
and pictures that's going to come out of
this Apple event in Chicago don't forget
we have a full crew on the ground
reporting and filming and writing down
their impressions so make sure you stick
on the website so you know just what the
latest is out of there Apple's gonna be
posting the entire show later on today
so we're gonna let you know where to
find it on CNET so stick out over there
and again thank you so much for joining
us today we'll see you next
you
imagination is the key because you're
using your knowledge but you know to
make something that no one's made before
if you're creative that other people
will be inspired by you and then they'll
keep pushing forward so if you you'll
spread it to your friends and then your
fun spread to their friends and then all
over the world everyone will have a
happy life its life a whole land of
imagination where you feel like you can
make anything or invent anything you
want and you make something that nobody
has ever synced of
you girl what you're gonna be a pro so
you better get creative right now so you
can remember those things what you did
from the past carry those things brings
them to the future
you can make anything you want and you
can make that change the world one small
thing could change the world like one
person can change the world
you
