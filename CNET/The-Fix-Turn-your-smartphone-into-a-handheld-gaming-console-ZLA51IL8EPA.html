probably do most of your gaming on your
mobile device well now there are ways to
make it feel a lot more like a handheld
console I've got two devices to show you
one for iPhone and another for Android
for the iPhone your best bet is the
Logitech PowerShell the phone just slips
right in here and connects through the
Lightning port and what's great about it
is that it actually provides your phone
with an entire additional charge so you
don't have to worry about it dying while
you're gaming now the best part about it
is that it requires zero setup once it's
in there you're good to go I already
have across ages 2 downloaded the
Logitech website has a full list of
games that'll work with the device I'll
launch it and now I can use the d-pad to
direct my character and these action
buttons to do different things like pull
out a weapon or launch a menu
the PowerShell is really sleek and
comfortable especially when you're
playing games for a long period of time
the downside is that it's a hundred
bucks kind of costly but for you avid
gamers it might just be worth it
if you're an Android owner check out
Mogis controllers here I've got the hero
power and it's small compact and it
won't weigh down your bag the only
downside is that the controls are a
little smaller and do take some getting
used to to set it up your phone slides
right into here first you're gonna
download the Moga pivot app it'll take
you through a short walk through make
sure the controller is connected to the
device and that you have all the
settings correct from there you'll see a
library of games that are compatible
with the controller because like the
PowerShell the game developers need to
integrate this into their software when
you're all set up just launch a
compatible game like Grand Theft Auto or
soulcraft
and the controller works just like any
other you've got your d-pad for
controlling your character and these
action buttons which of course will vary
depending on what game you're playing
what's great about the Moga devices is
that they feel like real gaming
controllers this one is 60 bucks so not
too shabby for the gamer who wants a
little bit of action on the go if you
have any questions or favorites of your
own hit me up on Twitter and check out
