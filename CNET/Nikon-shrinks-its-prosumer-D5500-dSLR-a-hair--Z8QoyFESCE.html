body that's a hair smaller and the
camera also has a few new features
including it now has touch on its flip
and twist LCD overall though it remains
a great choice for typical family
photography I'm Lori Bruneian for CNET
and this is the nikon d50 500 although
it's not as compact as canons old SL 1
the d50 500 is still quite small and
lightweight part of the design tweaks
however is a grip with the same drawback
as the SL ones it has a pronounced
overhang that now forces your hand down
the grip more it's not a problem for
someone with medium sized hands like
mine but big handed folks will find
their hands uncomfortably overshooting
the grip on the bottom otherwise the
rest of the body is quite
straightforward to use and very similar
to its cheaper sibling the D 3300 it
does have a couple extra buttons and
switches though the camera still
delivers excellent performance for both
still and continuous shooting it also
has some of the best battery life in its
price class the feature set isn't quite
as novel as it was when the d50 300
shipped but it still covers all the
bases for its target user new over the
d50 300 are super vivid pop and photo
illustration filters it also has nice
perks like interval shooting though it
doesn't have any in-camera time-lapse
movie creation and it has in-camera HDR
2 shots but also is Wi-Fi
but nikons app remains lame finally if
you plan to shoot video using autofocus
don't buy the collapsible kit lens it's
one of the noisiest lenses I've ever
tried to shoot video with if you can
find the d50 300 for less money
there aren't enough differences to
justify paying more for the G 5500 and
you're better off spending the
difference on a better lens
however the DC 5500 is still an
excellent camera I do recommend that you
grip it first before you buy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
