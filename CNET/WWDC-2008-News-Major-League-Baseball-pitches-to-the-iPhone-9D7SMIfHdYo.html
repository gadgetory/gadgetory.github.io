application that we've developed
exclusively for the iPhone
it's called mlb.com at bat and it has
some features that we're not offering
anywhere else
so let's just jump right in right away
you have all today's games live ones on
top if you want to get more information
just tap on one let's check out the
Yankees game great now what you have on
the bottom you get a little more detail
about the game see who's on base who's
batting pitching in the line score this
data updates all the time so you're
never behind what's going on so the next
thing I want to talk about what we're
really excited about this is what you
can't find anywhere else we decided to
take advantage of the iPhones media
player and add real-time video
highlights at mlb.com we edit video when
real time for every game to make sure
our fans don't miss a thing and when you
see the quality on the iPhone you
understand why I was an easy decision
for us to make the iPhone the very first
mobile device on which we've offered an
application to feature video highlights
these clips come two minutes after the
play it's not after the game it's right
after it happens in the field we also
create reference movies on the fly to
make sure you get the best possible
video experience whether you're on a
Wi-Fi or edge with the iPhone SDK we
were given great tools and a wonderful
platform to create something we think
baseball fans are gonna love really
quickly you won't find this application
anywhere else
you couldn't find better device to
experience it on we'll be in the app
store when it launches and thank you so
much we're so excited to be part of this
event thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
