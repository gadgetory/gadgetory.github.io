that matter right now we've had some
hands-on time with the Nintendo switch
game console that only officially
debuted late this week the new tablet
features two detachable controllers that
flank the screen and can be used
separately or attached to another piece
called the grip the switch comes with a
lot of new hardware in the box the games
seem fun there's definitely a lack of
launch titles out of the gate which is
likely reason enough to put off a
purchase we don't know much about
Nintendo's plan for the switches online
service but we're hearing that a paid
subscription will get players one free
retro game per month but they'll expire
after that month is over and if you're
looking for some specs on that switch
screen it's a 6.2 inch 720p capacitive
touchscreen with 32 gigabytes of storage
and finally PC peripheral maker razor is
still trying to recover two prototype
laptops that were stolen from the
company's booth at CES they're offering
$25,000 towards information that could
lead to the identification or arrest
those involved the triple fork a screen
laptops called Project Valerie for one
of the notable hits of the show as razor
is known to invent new concept items
specifically for CES
