happy four got its most basic as a tool
designed to help you eat more slowly and
what so I like to eat fast man look at
look you can you tell look at this look
at this figure I eat fast a lot of
people would like to look as as good as
you do unfortunately some people have to
work really really hard so you're
touching my arm you're straining my eyes
and you're hitting on me on stage I'm
just doing the best I can you just say
you know where we really want to be like
you and you know and and for some people
that cannot get there as easily as you
do we're hoping that the happy for is
going to build am I the only one that's
feeling comfortable right now this is
this is this is good okay so um this is
this fourth like you said it tells you
when you're eating too fast and how does
it do that so we capture well the four
captures the whole bunch of data
specifically the times of they you eat
when you start eating when you finish
eating and for us and there for the
duration of the meal and for us the
number of fork servings you have the
time elapsed / fork serving as well as
the median time elapsed / fork serving
across the entire meal and as we kept
all of that data gets uploaded it gets
ink and you know really why is it
important because one of the things that
happens immediately when you start
slowing down is that you realize that
just food spends a lot more time in your
mouth then it usually does which means
that all of the energy is happening at
this level as opposed to in your stomach
you stare directly into my soul when you
say that like wow this is just I don't
know what's wrong with me have you been
through this I have not well I have an
it was not very fun experience you know
I was personally / wait until the age of
30 and it look pretty good man you just
check my ass no i did not i was just
looking at your overall physique your
overall physique you learn a lot about
someone just from the 360 view okay
let's get back to the broad yeah let's
let's let's check no let's get serious
is what i heard in my ear probably
should do that okay so let's show off
the technology and will i be able to
feel the haptic feedback okay so tell me

actually give you this microphone to
talk as I'm eating okay okay so oh here

that okay mmm and I'd like you to very
quickly man banana bread from catering

horrible TV ok I'm back to my series my
finger my face just to news yeah okay
seriously now I'm okay let's take a deep
breath together i get on three okay one
two three I'll be back in mode okay
we're good okay I'm serious so we just
did something really really important
which is what we want to be happy we
want to have fun doing this stuff but
we're dealing with a really really
serious issue that affects at least one
person we know close to us definitely
within our friends network millions of
people
wyd this is something let me just put it
this way if I went to a government and
it's not exactly like a government
doesn't have resources to do stuff and I
tell them look I'd like to run a study
on 30,000 people for three months for
three meals per day they're going to
look at me and say how much do you want
150 million dollars I go that's about as
much as you need here if we can get the
help of the community to join us in this
happy revolution to buy thirty thousand
forks at a hundred dollars apiece we're
talking about only three million dollars
invested that is going to give us more
information and help millions of people
out there that even a government with
150 million dollars could not do so
that's part of what we're trying to do
and that's the serious portion of what I
had to say you know that's great because
we know how obesity is affecting youth
across the nation in you know multiple
countries and so you know we did have a
lot of fun but I really really like that
message and I could tell that you're
passionate about it being someone who
had to go through some of these things
right you know what's what's great about
this is that every single person of the
full partners on the team has a very
very personal and deep story they're all
different but we're doing this because
you know of course we came to the show
wanted to demo the product the response
has been so overwhelming that really you
know we're leaving the show very humbled
and we also leaving the show with a huge
responsibility on our shoulders to say
we have to do something about this today
is the day that we start a happy
revolution and we're hoping that a lot
of people are going to join us to make
this really finding the solutions here
from the bottoms up as opposed to
waiting for somebody else's for they SAT
for us all right in a price and release
date ninety-nine dollars this year for
sure and we're working super hard to
bring to market as soon as possible
excellent okay thank you alright guys
well it's time to wrap this up I still
have my eaten food in my hand but I'm
not gonna show you what that looks like
like I held it the entire segment just
think about that okay okay time to wrap
this up thanks to all my guess you got
just give him a round of applause for
everyone who came up on the stage to
show off their products I mean CS is a
great opportunity for everyone here I
come here every year I'm so passionate i
love just the you know enthusiasm and
the innovative stuff that we see here so
