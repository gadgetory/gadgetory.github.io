Apple spends a lot of energy on its
iPhone which makes a lot of sense since
it makes the company lots and lots of
money apple also just updated its
macbook pro line of laptops with the
addition of a touch bar however its line
of desktop seemed to be on the back
burner TechCrunch obtained a post
written by Tim Cook on an Apple employee
message board cook wrote some folks in
the media have raised a question whether
we're committed to desktops if there's
any doubt about that with our teams let
me be very clear we have great desktops
in our roadmap nobody should worry about
that Cook's post was actually in
response to the question what do you
consider to be apples biggest
differentiator and what can employees do
to foster and advance those efforts
Apple CEO said the company's greatest
differentiator is its culture and its
people cook also wrote I think it's that
change the world attitude and boldness
that's deeply embedded in our culture
that good isn't good enough all of this
is the fuel for everything else we do
we'll see if that changed the world
attitude comes back to the mac apples
all-in-one pc the imac was last updated
in october 2015 the Mac Mini has not
seen an update since October 2014
Apple's most powerful desktop the Mac
Pro got a huge redesign but that little
cylinder was introduced back in December
of 2013 and it has not been updated
since for more information check out
