Trekkie if I can't speak Klingon well
today is a good day to learn because now
duolingo offers free Klingon lessons
duolingo is a free language learning app
you can also use it on your desktop
through a web portal I've used duolingo
to brush up on my Spanish but now anyone
can test their tongue with the
complicated sounds of Klingon like and
the duolingo system is interactive
quizzing you with images and helping the
vocab stick with repetition making you
speak and type out answers the course
was designed by five Klingon speaking
superfan volunteers and it has the
official license and seal of approval
from CBS which owns the rights to Star
Trek so how do you design a course for a
fantasy language to answer that I spoke
to the Klingon leave course contributor
Felix Melman Beck hi all right I gotta
start off with how does one become an
expert in Klingon that's that is a good
question I'm not quite sure how I got
here myself I originally you know
browsed various sites on the internet
and then eventually ended up getting
let's hear if I can find the Klingon
dictionary by Marc Okrand looks like
this and that is pretty much how you get
started this book is like a really
comprehensive guide to the grammar if
you enjoy it then it makes for you know
like three or four nights worth of
pleasant night reading there are real
grammar rules for Klingon it was created
by a linguist Marc Okrand for the Star
Trek franchise the Klingon speaking
community is sort of or at least most
active Klingon speakers have this Canon
policy that only Marc Okrand is allowed
to make up new words and grammar rules
he actually didn't Institute that rule
himself it's actually like just us
thinking
if we if we spread this out too much
it's going to start the language is
going to start getting too nice to us
essentially it's going to be conformed
too much to our expectations and also
we're going to have we might get these
like different schools of thought about
how clean are should be spoken the
course development started in 2015 and
since then nearly a hundred and seventy
thousand duolingo users have shown
interest in signing up for clay on my
goal has been to gradually introduce
grammar and then hit people with lots of
vocabulary and try to make the sentences
earthlies occasionally a bit fun to help
them just sort of encourage them to get
over that first barrier to entry when
you're learning a language I feel like
it's a little bit of a mean language
like the some of the examples were like
he's young and stupid yes because I mean
it is a tough culture I would say but
like I saw we are big you are small yes
I I gotta learn the pronunciation here I
guess that is our thing about duolingo
you can actually hear it right so you
know Matlin sooo much you know I'm
probably probably not doing it right
though you were close but it's a mock
pin too much duolingo needed special
programming to handle Klingon no earth
language uses apostrophes in the middle
of words and Klingon has case
sensitivity so a word can take on a
different meaning if it is capitalized
or lowercase is there a reason why some
letters are capitalized their rule for
capitalization or is it depend on the
word with the with the consonants a sort
of general rule is that if it's
capitalized then it's not pronounced the
way it is in English so for instance the
capital H isn't a huh but rather it's a
and the capital S is not us but rather
off what's a good starter Klingon phrase
or two or even word a good starter would
be for instance
qapla is the classic it means success
and it's you with in all sorts of
situations it can mean good luck well
done
Godspeed you didn't fail completely
alright yes because if I read it I want
to say qapla but it's it yes as you say
like a lot of people they say car plow
but what you want to do is actually cup
la cop blah yes very good
how tough is the app gonna be on my show
really practice yeah it's it's
definitely I currently have quite a lot
of trouble with the sound I have a bit
of a cold actually so don't take my my
sound too seriously although actually
yeah might actually help a bit I guess -
all you language warriors looking for a
good challenge good luck and comply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
