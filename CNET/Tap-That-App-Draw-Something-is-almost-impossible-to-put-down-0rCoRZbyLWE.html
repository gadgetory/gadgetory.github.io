Jason Parker and this is the show where
we show off the hottest apps in the
mobile space there's a hot new game
that's made its way to the top of the
iTunes App Store the challenges both
your drawing ability and your ability to
identify bad drawings
it's called draw something it's very
similar to that old board game
pictionary where you would draw for
someone and they would have to identify
what you were drawing and draw something
there's no time limits on your drawing
because it's a turn-based game kind of
like words with friends where you can
take your time draw your picture and
then you send it off and then your
friend who will get the notification
will then have their turn to guess your
drawing and then draw a picture of their
own to get started you sign up within
the game or you can sign in through
Facebook or Twitter to find friends once
you have a game set up a screen comes up
asking you to choose an easy medium or
hard word so a word like Sun would be
relatively easy to draw with you know
just to yellow circle but then a word
like rapture would be much harder to
draw requiring a lot more work once
you've selected your word you can start
drawing right away or you can use the
included tools like line width eraser
with and you also have a limited number
of colors that are up here in the top
but you can buy more with sets using the
coins that you earn within the game once
you're satisfied with your drawing you
can send it off to your friend and then
your friend gets a chance to figure out
what your drawing is and then draw a
picture of his own for you to guess when
it comes back your way each time you
guess the drawing correctly you're
awarded coins based on the difficulty of
the word that was chosen so an easy word
would get one coin where a hard word
would get three coins you'll want to
earn coins too because you use coins to
buy more colors and you're only given a
limited number of colors to start off
this becomes extremely important when
you have to draw plants and you have no
green unfortunately color packs are
pretty expensive so you're gonna have to
play a lot of games to earn enough coins
to get the green for those plants the
interesting thing about this game is
that you're not competing against your
friend the object instead is to go for
as many rounds as possible so it's like
a team game you're working together to
try to
get past as many drawings as you can I
should note the game is very addictive
and I already have a few games going
even though I've only played over the
past few days draw something is on sale
right now for $0.99 at the iTunes App
Store but may move back to $1.99 soon so
you better grab it while you care
I'm Jason Parker from CNET and this has
been tap that up thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
