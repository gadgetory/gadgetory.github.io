issues new tablet lineup we've got a
smaller model a larger model what is
more fun and one is a little more
serious because it's meant for school
this is Asia is more premium tablet the
Iconia 1/8 it's got an IPS display and
also it looks good from pretty much any
angle it's an empowered Intel Atom
what's interesting is this is not the
first time we've ever seen this but the
first time we've seen this amaze there
it's got a touch screen that you can use
with they say a pencil but I suspect any
object with any sort of have like
content to it will work so you can use
the pencil just like this obviously for
drawing you could just open up a
sketching program and do some drawing
with a pencil as a vote for a stylus or
your finger it's there's other new
tablet that the Iconia Tab 10 it's not
quite as fancy looking but it's aimed at
an education market so it's a little bit
more understated and it's got a full HD
screen though with Gorilla Glass that
doesn't get scratched up and if students
will appreciate that and it has the same
technology that let you use a pencil to
actually draw on the screen you know you
could use your finger or stylus as well
but I do like the extra precision of
having a pencil and then of course you
click the blue erase tab you can erase
it so for note-taking in class this
works you know as well as any kind of I
suppose note-taking thing that I've seen
and once again I'm not leaving pencil
marks on it the 8-inch model is going to
be available in July starting at about a
hundred and fifty dollars while the
tenant's version is coming in May and
that's going to be three hundred I'm Dan
Ackerman with patience updated tablet
lineup
