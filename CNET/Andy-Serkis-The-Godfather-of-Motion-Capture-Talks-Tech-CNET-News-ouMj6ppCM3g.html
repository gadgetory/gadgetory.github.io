five-acre set you can see behind me this
is their prison set really combining
practical set design with CG backgrounds
filling this whole world for war for the
plan of the effort we know people have
called you really the godfather of
motion capture how have you really seen
the technology of all it's just such a
brilliant technology and I've embraced
it and of course now you know I have my
own studio and own company so I can
understand that I suppose I've spent you
know the last 15 years working on
characters using this technology so
actively thought that on myself I mean I
want to push the boundaries over 15
years ago when circus was working on
Lord of the Rings they weren't able to
shoot on live-action sets they were just
limited to accede the environment that
was basically a giant green screen room
today every aspect of the technology has
evolved to capture everything as it
happens the big jumps have been really
over the last 15 years have been have
been from motion capture being in a
volume a CG environment to shoot it on
set and also facial capture and the way
that these head mounted cameras are are
incredibly subtle and pick up every
single movement all these marks on my
face are basically assigned to muscle
groups which are then assigned to the
muscle groups of the digital masks here
alongside all of that actually is a
growing understanding and a growing
perception of performance capture and
the animators who then take this data
and and interpolate the performance and
watch what the actors are doing and
particularly wetter who have vast
experience in this now who have a great
kind of army of people who can who can
then take what we do on set and
interpret it and put it onto the the 8
character that you're playing
Oh bad humans circus has defined and
continues to elevate motion capture
performances and after all these years
he still experiences those moments of
WoW for just something directing the
jungle book and creating characters
which are not humanoid a Christian Bale
playing a panther for instance you know
that that's a whole new level of
performance capture and that's really
becoming very interesting and exciting
so yeah when I see those things coming
to life it's it's incredibly thrilling
there you have it for cnet.com I'm Brian
Tom for war for the
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
