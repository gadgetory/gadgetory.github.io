brought a car like this to American
showrooms in what 25 years and that was
the Reata and nobody wants to talk about
that this is the cascada it is a sibling
to an Opel and Vauxhall model that are
sold in Europe and the UK respectively
but of course it's been Americanized
very clearly the Buick interior were
there styling cues and switchgear under
the hood of a 1.6 liter turbo for good
for 200 horsepower should be ample for
this car but of course the big deal here
is the fact that it's a cleanly executed
convertible which by the way is also
quick they say it'll cycle one way or
the other in 17 seconds that's
definitely below average for most cars
so it'll do so up to 31 miles an hour as
well which is be surprised on important
nuance in convertibles now the question
is volume and space if you look inside
you'll see it's a 2+2 things get a
little narrower in the back so we do not
have three across seating the key here
is to make sure this doesn't read into
VW EOS category where it's too much of a
one-note tune not utilitarian enough and
not a good enough driver to be more than
just a convertible fun car we'll see if
we get one of these on the road with us
how the packaging works up what kind of
storage space it's got and what the ride
and sport quality are like but this is
definitely part of Buicks march to make
you think otherwise about them here's a
key reason for that only a third people
who buy Buicks are under 55 compare that
to 50% of people who buy Chrysler's and
60% who buy Acuras so the real mission
here is up to drop the top but to drop
the average age</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
