experience that is more accessible more
personal and more usable than really
anything in music but in order to do
that the new Spotify has been built to
deliver really three key elements first
even better more relevant music
programming's you can easily find that
perfect soundtrack for any part of your
day second new types of content
including non music content - deeper
than our users engagement with Spotify
and third innovation to dramatically
enhance the way music improves existing
experiences but going beyond the
conventional formats we're making it
very intuitive and easy for you to move
among all your favorite music as well as
videos and podcasts and they're all
living in the same place so there's a
lot to choose from here like this video
capsule from vice which also has an
audio-only version if you're on the go
muse has been talking to people around
the world about the big issues and if
that's not your thing maybe you'll like
this I'm Chris Hardwick I founded
Nerdist industries or maybe you're up
for a little comedy break and this clip
from Comedy Central's broad city does
the trick
so whether you're looking at video in
the New York Times app or BuzzFeed on
Facebook new content is really
everywhere but what is really cool about
what we're doing is the way our new
content both complements and extends the
core music experience so we believe it
will keep users happy and engaged with
Spotify throughout the day but also that
they'll listen to more music as a result</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
