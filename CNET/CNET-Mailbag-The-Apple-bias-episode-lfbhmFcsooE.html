the cnet mailbag this is the show where
we take your feedback and answer your
questions about all the stuff we're
doing here at seen it now in the mailbag
spotlight today I want to show off some
of the brand new features we just
launched at seen at tv.com if you have
sharp eyes you may have noticed that the
video player is actually larger because
we're all about video also there are a
few design changes but the big deal is
this new subscribe button here which
makes it way easier for you to subscribe
to our shows as podcasts if you're
watching a show or a first look and you
want to get the podcast version just
click the subscribe button then you can
choose podcast HD podcast or RSS feed if
you choose podcast or HD podcast it'll
launch itunes and download the latest
episode plus there's this little
drop-down menu so you can actually
choose any show or any category that you
want to subscribe to right here boom
super easy nice right let me know what
you think all right onto the mail many
of you wondered what happened to mailbag
last week matt said just wondering why
mailbag wasn't on this week has it been
canceled or are you just taking a break
hope to see it soon smiley it was not
cancelled don't panic we just took a
week off because Sarah who produces and
edits the show was on vacation judging
from the total panic in your emails I
probably should have warned you sorry
about that another mail this week Brian
tongs prize fight between the iphone and
the t-mobile g1 android phone cause some
heated emotions this guy wrote in to say
the t-mobile g1 totally beats the
overrated over publicized iPhone haven't
we had enough already the stupid apple
lovers and the iphone lovers now I like
Apple do I have a macbook running a boot
to ubuntu is better than mac anyway sure
Apple is cool but totally overrated
point but I love cnet but Brian tongue
is an apple fanboy most royally annoyed
cnet fan someone who does not to have
his name featured on mailbag although he
wants this message on mailbag and Robert
the Soviet said now that brian Tong has
his own show the apple byte he
inevitably has a mental association with
apple with this said why does he still
host prize fight with the last show
being about the g one vs iphone i felt
as if he didn't look to the iphones
falsin nearly as much as he did with the
g1 and
he even admitted it himself in the video
he wasn't trying to bash the device but
he was and then when he goes to the flip
side and talks about the iphone I hear
nothing negative is the tongue stir
still a viable judge for prizefight it
just bothers me I guess and that's a
valid point folks so I thought this
would be a good time to let you guys
know that the prize fight matches are
written in conjunction with our review
editors in fact most of them show up as
text and not just video in this case the
iphone vs g one prize fight was judged
by bonnie cha not an apple fan girl
nicole lee not an apple fan girl and
brian Tong who is a mild apple fanboy
but Brian's not the only judge for prize
fight so even if he is biased and I
still think he's more professional than
that he's bound to get overruled by his
fellow judges happy ok cool now let's
counterpoint with a little lover mail
for prize fight I just wanted to let you
know that the cnet prize fight over the
browsers was amazing great work someone
deserves a raise nerd 97 someone always
deserves a raise around here nerd 97 but
yes that was some nice work next some
concern from Emily who writes I come to
you with a serious question our females
being discriminated against on cnet
evidence shows that in many of Dan
Ackerman's video laptop reviews he
refers to the laptop as this guy which
is of course now a part of Dell now
don't confuse this guy with the recent n
17 X now as a fun casual little gesture
could you please ask Dan to call one of
the laptops that he's reviewing this
girl or at least please tell him to stop
implying that the laptops are male this
favor is not asked for me but for
females everywhere because every laptop
shouldn't be a male what if every human
were male oh Emily stop being so
sensitive everyone knows that cars and
boats are girls and laptops are dudes
it's just a thing and finally Alan from
Taiwan rides in with a mystery I saw
something weird in the background when I
was watching 2008 november 11 loaded
when Natalie said when the ticket as
supposed to free and about 335 minute
into show I think I saw something flew
across the window it's dark and blurry
what is it Alan PS i hope no one go
thrown off the scene
building that would be horrible the
tickets are supposed to be free and just
Alan do you really think we wouldn't
stop down if a person got thrown off the
building but yes I saw that too it was
totally weird I think it was a bird
pigeons creepy all right that'll do it
for this week everyone keep that
feedback coming mailbag at cnet com or
send me a postcard to 35 second street
san francisco california 94 105 see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
