Jimmy das joining us is executive editor
of cnet news Charles Cooper Charles it
sounds so official can I just call you
coupe you may alright so news today a
bit of a surprise Larry Ellison is
stepping down from the CEO position at
Oracle do we know why uh because I think
it's time yeah he's been running this
show since 1977 he's done 70 years old
he doesn't look it plastic surgery
really helps look he's done almost
everything that you could imagine you
know it's a storybook career he's built
a start-up over four decades into a
multi-billion dollar enterprise right
he's taken the stock price to it is he's
done well he's done well for
shareholders although of late the
company has not been hitting on all
cylinders so perhaps that's part of the
decision to get younger managers in
place both safra catz and marker they're
very can do people the very very
experienced and for Ellison you know he
owns most of the island of Lanai he
races in the America's Cup lots of yacht
he's cut a Bella Figura I think he has
other interests besides just clocking in
at the office and after four decades
yeah why not at age 70 he might just
want to enjoy those things I think so
okay so you mentioned the names of the
two CEOs which I'm hearing that Oracle
is intentionally not calling them
co-ceos they're both CEOs tell us about
these two people well it's it's a bit of
an odd arrangement of safra catz has
been there longer she's a very
experienced number crunching executive
very strongly to very competent nice to
see a woman at the helm absolutely and
you know she's one of the best out there
mark hurd as you may recall was the CEO
of hewlett-packard he left scandal hits
under a cloud but he's been there now
for the last few years and a word of any
scandal he's a very competent executive
as well so now it's maybe jump all see
who who works out there's some you know
question how long this can last you know
back in the days of the Roman Empire at
one point I think
during the time of diocletian that had
four emperors simultaneously it worked
out although the end result wasn't so
great the folks at research in motion
had a dual CEO arrangement that too
didn't work out ultimately but
historically it's not a popular way to
kind of manage company is in the end I
think they need one boss but we'll see
we'll see how things shake out so how is
the public front of reacting to this
news we know that the stock price has
been a little bit anyway in After Hours
the stock price has been down but again
that's probably just the reaction Wall
Street doesn't like surprises they'll
get over this ultimately it's all about
sales and earnings and whether or not
they can continue to meet and beat Wall
Street's expectations okay do you think
the tech community is going to miss
Larry Ellison he was such a
controversial at times figure and just a
presence right I think headline writers
around the world are going to probably
bow their heads and cry tonight because
Ellison going back in decades that you
know in the early i believe around 2000
when the Microsoft antitrust case was
going on you know Oracle basically it
was called the dumpster diving scandal
Ellison said he had no personal
knowledge of it but he did confirm that
Oracle had paid investigators to look
into companies which were funded by
microsoft in opposition to the
government's you know plan to break up
the company you know he's got a pretty
much of a big mouth he he can back it up
and he talks to talk and he's walked the
walk and you know it's it's delightful
to see somebody who's very comfortable
in his own skin who says it like it is
we're in a very scripted world now
unfortunately and people reserve their
their true sentiments for behind closed
doors with Ellison for the most part
what you saw was what there was yeah it
was honest he was you could say that
about him alright coupe Charlie Cooper
to lose if you want to be more formal
