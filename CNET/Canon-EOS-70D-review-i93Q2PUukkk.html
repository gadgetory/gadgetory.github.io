canon eos 70d the big update for the 70d
is the new 18 megapixel dual pixel CMOS
sensor based autofocus system which
really is responsive and reasonably
accurate combined with its 7 frame per
second burst rate quick designed for
changing auto focus area settings and a
decent viewfinder the 7d d is really
quite nice for action shooting it's not
pro class but it's not too shabby for a
$1200 body in video the touch focus
works well for racking it snaps
decisively but not unattractively fast
from subject to subject the camera has
roughly the same body design as the 60d
with some important tweaks the mode dial
is more streamlined with fewer auto
options the articulated LCD has canons
very nice touchscreen with its excellent
interface and the lock button for the
multi controller is better my one
complaint is about the multi controller
it's smaller than before and even harder
to precisely manipulate also the 70d
still has only a single SD card slot
compared to the dual slots in the Nikon
d70 100 it does have a reasonable if not
stellar Wi-Fi implementation though the
only significant issue with the cameras
in the image quality part of that stems
from canons default color settings which
I've never liked you certainly have the
ability to change them to something more
natural-looking and less crunchy though
JPEGs look fine through ISO 1600 though
overall I think the photos are soft
without the detail resolution of the d70
100 in Raw's there doesn't seem to be a
lot of preserved highlight detail in
high contrast shots and I couldn't bring
up shadows without introducing more
noise than I liked video displays edged
artifacts ringing aliasing Moray and
crawling edges which has as common get
worse as ISO sensitivity Rises it looks
a little better than the t5i they're not
obviously and most casual users probably
won't see a big difference low-light
video has a nice tone ality and a
reasonable dynamic range but there's
still quite a bit of color noise it's
unfortunate that the image quality falls
short because the rest of the package
excellent autofocus system Street
shooting design an appropriate feature
set for the price that's up to a camera
I really like I'm Laurie grinning and
this is the cannon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
