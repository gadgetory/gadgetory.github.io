Android was Google Wallet and it never
quite caught on but it did teach us a
few things about what makes a mobile
payments platform successful it needs
support from the carriers it also needs
credit card issuers onboard like Visa
banks and a solid security system and
most importantly you need places that
actually accept mobile payments
now to payment platforms are joining
Apple in the race to digitize your
wallet Android pay and Samsung pay in
practice Android pay and Samsung pay are
a lot alike
tap the phone on the terminal scan your
fingerprint or enter a pin and you're
set
both platforms use tokenization which
means that an alias is used in place of
your real credit-card number during a
transaction that's a win for everyone
because if there's ever a data breach it
means that your real credit card number
will never be revealed to hackers but
here's where Samsung pay wins for
starters thanks to something called
magnetic secure transmission you can use
it with old-school credit card terminals
that don't have built-in NFC with the
exception of push-pull credit card
swipes like the ones you see at gas
stations it pretty much works everywhere
and even those transactions use
tokenization so it's infinitely more
secure than using a plastic credit card
Android pay has its own strengths it
works with all NFC enabled Android
KitKat and newer devices Samsung pay
only works with the phones the company
released this year but not all banks and
credit card issuers support mobile
payments so in the end the better
platform might just be the one you can
actually use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
