fundamental to avoiding a collision than
stopping before you have one but too
often humans are well human and don't
brake in time or at all
that's where forward collision avoidance
technology comes in and ideally appears
in cars we really buy not just as a
pricey option on pricey ones the
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety
has been watching forward collision
technology come down to earth in three
flavors there's the warning warning you
of a forward collision pre charging the
brakes before a collision to increase
their effectiveness when you do get on
them if it detects a high risk of impact
the system will prime the brakes to help
you stop more quickly and automatic
braking so the car will pull itself
partially or fully to a stop even if you
drop the ball and there's the auto brake
vehicle stop by itself just two years
ago nearly three-quarters of new cars
didn't offer any kind of forward
collision tech just two model years
later the number lacking it is down to
under half though just four percent of
models offer it standard of a variety of
cars that offer this tech ten models
from Acura BMW Mazda and Chrysler earned
a superior rating with five or six out
of six points a separate study by the
highway loss data Institute found that
two models of Volvo's from 2010 to 2012
with automatic braking had insurance
claim rates that were 15 to 16 percent
lower and the latest Volvo's offer the
first automatic braking that will
intervene if you're about to make a very
ill-advised left turn against traffic it
pays to double check if your next car
offers forward collision tech what if
any degree of self braking it includes
and how well the whole system is rated
to actually work it's a fundamental
feature that could pay for itself pretty
easily the first time you don't rear-end
someone
