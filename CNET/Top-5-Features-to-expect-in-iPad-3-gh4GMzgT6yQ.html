tablets but way down from the ninety
percent market share it once enjoyed
clearly apples not going to rule the
tablet market like it did the mp3 player
biz but what does it do to at least keep
iPad at number one I'm Brian Cooley with
the top five things to expect in ipad 3
number five a thinner faster longer
sounds at the Six Million Dollar man's
resume for a porn movie but i'm
referring to thinner size faster cpu and
longer battery life incremental
improvements on most or all of these
counts that's virtually a given number
four is siri the world's best-known
digital parlor trick it'll finally come
to the ipad partly because that will now
have the hotter cpu i just mentioned and
that's an important part of being able
to get Siri to understand you and do her
voodoo thing I don't understand now Siri
has huge halo value to Apple it's a real
set them apart kind of technology though
it's not that different from the voice
command tech found on Android and in
cars number three is a better camera
correction a decent camera I've always
been shocked how bad the camera is on
the iPad 2 especially since the one in
the iphone 4s is so good if you're gonna
ask folks to hold up an ipad as a camera
and look that stupid they better get a
good photo out of it number two is a
better display now the ipad 2 is
currently 1024 x 768 resolution and a 43
kind of squarish aspect ratio both are
kind of pedestrian by modern standards
so look for the resolution to climb to
full HD or a thousand 80 or more lines
measured vertically but still remaining
at a 43 aspect ratio you see apple's
always believed that a widescreen 16-9
display while good for movie viewing is
weird for reading or browsing plus it
would raise hell with all those ipad
apps already written for 43 ratio before
i take into the number one thing to look
for an ipad 3 here's a tantalizing rumor
that
doesn't make the list a smaller iPad The
Wall Street Journal recently reported
that Apple is shopping for a supplier of
8 inch LCD screens hmm that's either for
one really big iphone one really small
iMac or one very tasty kindle killer but
there's no indication such an iPad will
arrive anywhere near the March 2012 date
we're looking for her iPad 3 the number
one thing I'm looking for and ipad 3
virtually a lock is 4G introducing a
mobile wireless device today without 4G
is like offering one with a small screen
well that describes the iphone 4s and it
seems to be selling okay but anyway 4
g's the kind of technology that almost
makes more sense on a tablet than a
phone since the tablet begs for more
high res full screen data like streaming
video so consider this a virtual
certainty but of course a Wi-Fi only
version will also still be available for
more top fives like this go to top 5
