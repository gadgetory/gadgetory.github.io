personal devices I've ever owned other
smartwatches let you swap bands and some
even come in multiple colors and sizes
but motorola's moto maker software lets
you design the watch for you want to
watch that's two toned no problem maybe
one with the textured bezel why not all
of this is possible with the new Moto
360 the biggest physical change is the
addition of traditional watch lugs these
look great make it easier to swap out
the strap for a new one and make the
watch more flexible which means it's a
lot more comfortable to wear the crown
has also been relocated to the top right
but make no mistake it's still just a
button do you use to dim the display and
access the app menu it doesn't spin like
the digital crown on the Apple watch
many of the changes in the new Moto 360
are the ones you can't see the processor
has received significant boost which has
improved many of the performance issues
users experience in the original model
one thing that hasn't changed is the
display the resolution is a bit better
but it's not as high as the Huawei watch
or second gen LG watch urbane it also
has that same unsightly black bar at the
bottom so it's not a complete circle
this is where the ambient light sensor
is located for adjusting brightness
automatically and while it's convenient
I'm not sure it's worth having the black
bar it's just the one thing I really
can't stand battery life will last you
about a day and a half with the
always-on screen feature or more than
two days with it turned off for the most
part this is in line with other Android
wear watches and the Apple watch on the
software side Motorola added some custom
watch faces and a fitness tracking app
known as moto body but it's just Android
wear which still feels like a work in
progress especially when compared to the
OS on the Apple watch and samsung's new
gear s2 it also feels like Motorola
hasn't done enough to help the 360 stand
out the Huawei watch has a high res
display that's protected by sapphire
crystal the customization of the 360 is
a nice touch but aside from the design
the Moto 360 is pretty much the same as
every other Android wear device there's
a lot more to be said about the Moto
360 for more information be sure to
