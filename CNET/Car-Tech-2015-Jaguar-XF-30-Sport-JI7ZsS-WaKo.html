days you've got XE XF XJ XK f-type let's
drive the best seller of them although
this is the XF 3 litre supercharged v6
on the Sport trim and check the 10 XF
scum in this kind of dizzying array of
configurations there's a 2 liter inline
turbo 4 then you've got these 3 litre
supercharged v6 s in all-wheel drive our
front-wheel drive then above this you've
got 3 variants of 5 liter v8 each with
different levels of performance and
power there's also a sport brake wagon
style but that doesn't come to the US
because we're so in love with SUVs and
crossovers and Jaguars got one of those
coming as well now our XF is very middle
of the pack we've got the 3 litre v6
supercharged rear wheel drive only in
this case and we have the Sport Edition
that means we get a little lip spoiler
on the trunk we get some door seal aero
add-ons and these very cool looking 20
inch throwback alloys now Jaguar has
been given to doing goofy in their car
lately you turn the thing on and these
motorised vent doors open up and this
gearshift knob rises to your hand for no
good reason just because they can here
is the head unit that is standard in
this XF including navigation rear camera
a lot of good things happen here without
any optional cost on the other hand it's
a dated interface it's relatively small
and it's relatively squared I will give
it good marks though for quick touch
response this is one of the best systems
I've driven lately in terms of getting a
touch quickly and getting it right the
first time
but compared to the beauty of this cabin
which is kind of restrained and elegant
this is an ugly little mess you've got
gradients on the buttons you've got
synthetic chrome highlights to give you
a supposed convex shape you've got
double line boxes around everything it's
busy and not terribly glanceable to my
eye now as good as that touch response
is voice command is also good and bad
it's very clear and crisp you just say
what's on the screen and it seems to get
it every time on the other hand it's not
a free-form system and you
give it an address in one big gulp you
got to go bucket by bucket by bucket
media choices you're not really missing
anything with HD radio satellite radio
USB here you've got bluetooth streaming
of course what's not in this car though
is an app based environment nothing for
media streaming and no live search to
power your navigation either now in
terms of drive controls right behind the
start/stop button you've got this large
controller that is your transmission
control and you've got a sport mode as
part of that paddle shifters on the
wheel and you've got a dynamic mode here
to really get things more gutsy and dial
back stability control but beyond that
it's not terribly complex in terms of
how you can set up its personality now
up here in the engine bay as I mentioned
we've got the three liter v6
supercharged car this is kind of the
middle of the powertrain lineup if you
will and the sweet spot for most buyers
the numbers are good 340 horse three
hundred and twenty-two pound-feet of
torque
gets this nearly 4,000 pound car up to
60 and 5.7 seconds while delivering 18
28 mpg and in all variants the only
transmission is the HP automatic now the
first thing I do in the XF no offence
jag is turn off this eco mode because
that disables auto start/stop and a car
like this that is so smoothly engineered
it's really marring of its ride to have
it on the next thing you notice is this
car has really smooth right now power
and plenty of it ergo is generally good
all around the car things fall where I
want them they've got a nice layout to
the center console I will say this some
of the horses thickest centre pillars in
the biz are right here I mean you can
you can lose another car in one of these
under the right circumstances
so three impressions overall the power
comes on super smooth very willing and
breathless thank you to super charging
secondly the transmission is very
buttery but also avoids being sloppy and
while it handles well as an overall
chassis it retains a Jaguar quality that
does mean though it comes a little
unglued at the edges you'll enjoy
driving this car all day long you just
won't like it so much if you're trying
to Canyon race an m5 now pricing our XF
about fifty eight thousand dollars out
the door in this sport shrimp now
because of that we have the 20 inch
alloy wheels that look great we actually
have a lesser audio system you could add
all-wheel drive to either v6 for twenty
seven hundred dollars but aside from
doing that it's a fifty eight thousand
dollar car CS stop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
