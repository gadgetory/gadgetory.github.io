and welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad stuff inside the world of
Apple now you know we keep it real here
on our show and a couple months ago I
said my sources pointed to a Mac Pro
refresh in early August but it just
hasn't panned out so I apologize but I
can assure you we'll continue to bring
you the best reliable until we can and
own up to it when we don't so I'm sorry
all right onto the show over the week
Apple reached a historic mark thanks to
the seesaw ups and downs in the stock
market but after the market closed
midweek Apple held onto its position as
the most valuable company in the world
surpassing ExxonMobil which is pretty
amazing and even more valuable than our
own cnet believe it or not now it's an
envious position to be in but sometimes
the power trip can get to you Apple
remove the ability for iOS apps to allow
users to go outside of them to purchase
content the kindle app was a perfect
example where you could read and
purchase content within the app until
the big app holes shut it down but
amazon is getting smart and built their
own html5 compatible app that works
through the web browser called the
Kindle Cloud Reader it's completely
independent from the App Store you can
read and purchase books from it use it
offline and apple doesn't get a single
cent now online video service voodoo has
released their own html5 compatible web
app and you can be sure there will be
more to follow so job well done Apple
via control freak discourage business
partners and you know let them innovate
without you because that's a solid
business plan now there are things that
Apple does right like the beautiful new
macbook air oh my gosh I finally got one
I went big with 13 inches in I can tell
you we are definitely in the honeymoon
phase
terson turn
two
momentum
Oh
don't judge me guys because you know you
do exactly the same thing now that's
what's hot now but what about cool
things Apple is thinking about for the
future according to patently Apple a new
patent app reveals plans for the
Cupertino kids to integrate projectors
directly into iOS devices they've been
working on this for a while and we've
seen patents for projectors in their
laptops but in even cooler stuff the
patent describes how they'll introduce
advanced gesturing that will be able to
interpret shadow and silhouette gestures
to control actions on screen and
hopefully hand shadow puppets will still
be allowed the butterfly alright let's
take a break and bring you a video from
our tap that app series for all of you
that want to trick out your iOS device
got you covered hey guys welcome to tap
that app i'm brian Tong and this is the
show we cover the hottest apt in the
mobile space now everyone talks about
how customization is king on android
phones with their widgets and skins but
iOS users you don't have to be left out
and you don't have to jailbreak your
phone either thanks to a 99-cent app
called pimp your screen now it's
compatible with every single iOS device
that has existed that's right I'm
talking to you first gen iphone guy so
pay attention now pimp your screen
includes a variety of home screens with
something for everyone lots of colors
and lots of fun there's themed app
shelves that can be used in portrait or
landscape mode and some really trippy
neon combos for the raver in you plus
they're constantly adding new styles a
killer feature allows you to preview
what the theme looks like with the app
icons on top of it to get a real good
idea for how you want to pimp yo pad but
the best feature is the lockscreen maker
and the homescreen maker the LOX cream
maker allows you to pick a background
but also customize the frame that will
wow your friends wow the homescreen
maker let you go to town by picking a
background and then mixing and matching
a shelf type or a skin to go on top I
prefer skin now once you're done with
everything press save and it will add
your creation to your camera roll go
into your photo app and find the picture
select the sharing options and you'll be
able to set your masterpiece as a
wallpaper and make it your locks
or home screen and just like that you'll
be pimping in no time now if you have
any other apps you like to show us send
them to tap that app at cnet com i'm
brian Tong thanks for watching keep it
bin thanks for that Brian but where did
you get that outfit alright iOS 5 guys
it released its fifth beta update with a
new feature a couple features that I
haven't seen in previous releases to
changes you'll benefit from is that
video content in all applications and
websites are now all airplay enabled by
default and in the one really useful one
the Maps app will now display alternate
routes for you to get from one point to
another with the recommended path
highlighted blue but the solid line and
you can switch between them so that's
some pretty cool stuff also in other
news the battle between Apple and
Samsung over patent violations rages on
this time a German Court has blocked the
sale of Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1 in all
of Europe after apple claims that it
infringes on the patented design of the
ipad 2 obviously we're all still
thinking the galaxy tab is the ipad and
dominating over 75 percent of the
current tablet market still just isn't
good enough plus you should add the
motorola xoom to that list as well
Apple's now suing them too because that
infringes upon the design of Apple's
products too and in an amazing story of
courage and bravery Chinese police have
arrested six people after they smuggled
over forty thousand dollars of Apple
gear into China using a zip line that
was fired three hundred yards with a
Rambo like crossbow now the zip line
crossed the border between hong kong and
shenzhen in hopes of avoiding exchange
rates and taxes on the apple goodies i
don't know about you but i love
ziplining and on top of inventing
everything in the world like paper the
compass gunpowder and printing this
makes me proud of my chinese heritage
now did you guys also know we created
the first burrito and pizza moo shu pork
baby look it up alright that's going to
do for this we show semi your emails to
the Apple by to cnet com i'm brian Tong
thanks for watching and we'll see you
guys next week for another bite of the
Apple
oh that's amazing oh no oh no no no not
