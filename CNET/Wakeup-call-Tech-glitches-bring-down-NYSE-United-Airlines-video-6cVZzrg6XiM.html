computer glitch can take down an airline
had a stock exchange I'm Bridget Carey
this is your cnet update various
computer glitches have wrecked havoc on
the business world Wednesday halting
trading on the new york stock exchange
and causing united airlines to ground
its flights even The Wall Street Journal
website experienced a brief outage but
as of this report the United States
Department of Homeland Security said
there's no sign that these were part of
a malicious cyber attack the stock
exchanges Twitter account tweeted that
it chose to suspend trading because of
an internal computer problem and it's
not the result of a cyber breach around
1130am eastern time the stock exchange
was brought to a halt and it was down
for almost four hours there have been
glitches before on exchanges but nothing
that suspended trading this long in
recent years other exchanges such as
nasdaq continued to operate before the
computer chaos on Wall Street United
Airlines was dealing with network
connectivity issues that grounded
flights worldwide for almost two hours
more than 4,900 flights were disrupted
and United was offering waivers for
customers to change their flights a
united spokeswoman released a statement
to various news outlets that this all
was because of a router problem which
disrupted the passenger reservation
system it's truly a wake up call to see
how one glitch can still be enough to
cripple a system worldwide meanwhile
there's other drama going on at
Microsoft the company is not giving up
in its mobile phone fight but it is
making big cuts to change its strategy
and focus Microsoft is laying off 7800
employees and most of these people
worked on Windows Phone hardware these
employees came from Nokia's phone
division which microsoft acquired last
year for more than 7.2 billion dollars
Microsoft's chief executive satya
nadella said in an email to employees
that the company is doing this to run a
more effective and focused phone line up
and he added that it'll help Microsoft
reinvent its mobile side so what does it
all mean Microsoft still plans to make
Lumia phones and its continuing to
release windows 10 mobile in
we're expecting some new Windows Lumia
phones to come out later this year to be
loaded with the new windows 10 mobile
operating system but what's hard to tell
right now as if Microsoft will keep
making its own phones in house or if
it'll outsource all of its manufacturing
Microsoft does a little bit of both
right now in his short time as leader of
Microsoft nadella has made some major
cuts to bring the focus more on software
and the cloud nadella has also made more
Microsoft apps available on iPhone and
Android you see Microsoft just wants you
using its software regardless of what
phone you own that's it for this tech
news update but there's always more at
cnet com from our studios in New York
