speaker not only does it offer very good
sound for its size but it has the added
value of offering a very cool light show
thanks to its built-in LED lights you
press a button on the speaker itself to
toggle through ten different light show
options including fire rain and
fireworks also the speaker has a
companion app and you can adjust the
light show remotely from your phone via
the app additionally you'll find a prism
sensor embedded in the speaker that
allows you to hold a colored piece of
paper or colored object up to it and
press a button on the speaker and have
the LEDs change to that color it's a bit
of a gimmick and didn't always work but
hey it's kind of fun to play with as you
might expect the light show plays off
your music and matches its mood you can
also download ambient sounds via the app
such as fire and rain to enhance the
light themes
and finally you can wirelessly link two
of these speakers together to augment
the sound if you happen to have two of
them the speaker seems pretty durable
its splash proof though not waterproof
and there's a gasket that covers the
microUSB charging port and audio input
to keep moisture out as far as other
extras go there's a built-in
speakerphone but it doesn't have the USB
charging port of JBL's charge speakers
and doesn't offer quite as good battery
life it's rated at 10 hours which is
still pretty good we think those charge
speakers are among the best sounding
compact bluetooth speakers and the pulse
2 is right there with them in terms of
sound quality yes we'll pay more for the
light show at around $160 online the
pulse 2 is well worth the extra dough it
is a very good value at that price point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
