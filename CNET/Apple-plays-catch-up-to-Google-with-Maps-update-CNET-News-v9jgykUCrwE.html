maps now last year we introduced nearby
a great way to find places and transit
with an incredible amount of detail
including all the entrances and exits
from every station but for iOS 10 we've
got an all-new design for maps it starts
with making it easy to access controls
and details on locations and we're
making maps do more for you in advance
it's more proactive so you slide up from
the bottom and you can see suggestions
maps knows that usually at this time I
usually go to work or it can look at a
calendar event and find a location it
also gives you convenient ways to filter
down on the places you might want to go
for example let's take a look at
restaurants nearby but we're in San
Francisco I feel like seafood so I can
slide across the bottom and now I can
see all the seafood restaurants right in
San Francisco
now we're applying all of these new
designs to navigation as well so you get
more information it makes it easier to
follow and control and we even include
traffic on route now when you're driving
it'll automatically zoom in and as you
get to a long straightaway it'll
automatically zoom back out and you can
even pan and zoom way further ahead to
see what the traffic conditions are
and we give you quick controls to let
you see route details so now you can
even look and see on your route where
food or gas stations are and maps will
tell you how much longer it will take if
you go to any one of those and of course
we're making this available on carplay
and if there's a lot of traffic ahead
maps will proactively give you alternate
routes and tell you how much time it'll
save and we're making it safer to follow
directions while keeping your eyes on
the road because now you can get
turn-by-turn right in the instrument
cluster of your car and we think you're
going to love these updates but there's
more because we are opening maps up to
developers now with map extensions you
can enable all new capabilities and maps
for example you can make a reservation
using a popular app like open table you
pick the number of people the time right
inside of maps and because these are
extensions they're open to the all
developers around the world like ding
ding and ping in China and the motto
around many countries around the world
and when you're ready to leave you tap
on directions and now you're offered the
new option to book a ride and with app
extensions like uber you can pick any
kind of car pay for it with Apple pay
and see the status so again I can find a
restaurant I can book a reservation I
can request a car I can pay for it and I
can see when it's going to arrive all
without leaving maps
and these extensions are open to all
developers here's the Chinese ride
service app DD and that is maps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
