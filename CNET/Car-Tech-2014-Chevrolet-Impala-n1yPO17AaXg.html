vehicle of lowriders grandfather's and
rental fleet employees dramatically
changed yes that is an Impala let's
drive a 2014 - LT and check the tech now
this is a part of our video right not
only tell you how to spot the car in
question that's easy on this one just
open your eyes this car looks nothing
like that previous dim Paula that dough
ball queen of the rental Lot
this car has angles and creases kind of
a rear haunch sloping forward design a
little bit of Camaro a little bit of
Malibu and hotness all over it and then
a nice job with this vehicle we have
what is known in the common American
vernacular as fancy unfortunately GM
traditionally can't help themselves in
confusing luxurious with gaudy so I see
a lot of overly polished plaster wood
and excessively wide chrome strips all
over this thing but that's just how they
do it now the star of the show is you
probably noticed is this 8-inch
Chevy MyLink head unit this is your
audio your media whether Pandora your
OnStar is now graphically controlled not
just in those mirror buttons that still
exist up here and the trick that
everyone loves is push the button you've
seen this on TV probably we don't push
it and hold it and the screen goes up
and there you have a little secret bin
for your mobile device and it can also
charge on that USB port which is also a
connection for media and when I go to
the navigation system you find the first
indication of what continues to pop up
throughout this rig which is very slow
response this unit seems to be
overwhelmed by the processing chores it
has to do that tells me not enough CPU
are not optimized code just trying to
zoom out is a push again and again
experience if you want to enter a
destination you can press that button
there oh no thanks I prefer to use the
voice command which is actually pretty
advanced on this car you're able to tell
it an address as the number of the
street and the city in one go that's
nice and you get good prompts in the
center screen and you sometimes get the
similar prompts on the main screen so
there's a lot of visual support so you
know what it wants you to say
can get the task done and get back to
driving street address say the address
in California or say changed state or
235 second Street San Francisco 2 3 5
seconds yes
complete your selection from the radio
display now here's where it gets long
and sluggish for some reason it's
transferring from that screen to this
screen and taking forever
and I was told to wait and look over
here and now continue my confirmation of
the navigation that's where things start
to break down so I hid my address to go
there for some reason it took me to the
Pacific Ocean I don't know what's going
on the audio sources are pretty
straightforward nothing goofy
everything's solid so you've got lots of
USB ports you saw the one up in here
right I've got two more down here in the
console you can run three USB devices at
once other media choices include my
streaming Bluetooth phone of course
there's am/fm satellite and HD radio on
this guy and Pandora works quite
seamlessly once your phone is paired
boom it just works
nice metatags good album art very clear
controls they've done a good job on that
now let's talk about driver control
technology first of all you see our
shifter here one choice only six-speed
Automatic there is a manual position but
not a sport mode but when you get in
there you don't have paddles to shift on
this car ever you use this little dainty
rocker switch on top of the knob I never
liked that now we have all the driver
assistance tech in this car which
includes rear view camera which is
optional by the way it should be
standard on a car of this level in this
price we have a lane departure warning
but it won't correct anything we'll
check that on the road we have blind
spot indications again there's no
correction just that little light goes
off and we also have forward collision
warning which will tell you when you're
closing on someone too fast but again
won't do anything about it and we also
have rear sonar for parking along with
that optional camera and that combines
also for cross traffic alert to avoid
getting t-boned when you're backing out
now under the hood the impalas unusual
the only car in its class where you can
get a four-cylinder two and a half liter
direct injection modern motor but you
won't find that on Taurus or azerath
other competitors we don't have it
though we have the big boy right now the
v6 this is 3.6 liters direct injection
variable valve timing output is 305
horsepower 264 foot-pounds of torque
this car weighs 38 hundred pounds or so
gets up to 60 in 6.8 seconds they're
about so not bad
certainly no slow now the mpg is 1828
but an average of just 21 kind of
thirsty which brings up an interesting
point there will be later in production
the availability of a 2.4 liter
ecosystem I'll die Brit we've driven
that engine before not anything quite
this big but it could be an intriguing
motor it's actually kind of a nice one
and it could take care of the
thirstiness here we'll see about that
let's go for a ride
you said the Impala's v6 engines got
gobs of good stuff you put it in manual
and sift through the gears but if you
leave it to the automatic everything is
muted the shifts are relatively buttery
they're not urgent and therefore the
engine doesn't feel urgent although I
think it is the powertrain isn't because
of the transmission
now the ride quality is excessively
smooth and the steering is kind of Numb
and over assistant all of this is as you
can tell adding up to a lot of the DNA
from the old Impala kind of bleeding
through General Motors still thinks this
cars apparently selling to the same
audience it used to sell to which I find
a little surprising for all the work
they've done on it now out on the open
road the lane departure warning system
is calibrated a little a little lazily
for my taste is the best way to put it
it doesn't seem to sound the warning
until you're already on or well over the
line most of the time on the freeway
that to me kind of defeats the purpose
the forward collision warning does have
the three set of bull levels and it is
actually a pretty meaningful tech it
seems to do a pretty good job although
I'm happy to report I rarely found it
doing its job while I was driving which
is good and all this car feels like a
much more quality piece than the
previous Impala which is actually high
praise I find the outgoing Impala to be
while highly uninspiring and actually a
very serviceable very well built car if
not much in terms of concepts
okay let's price our 2014 Impala this
guy's a 2lt it's basically the mid trim
level nice but not everything is in
there so we start adding on a thousand
95 to get that MyLink head unit with
navigation that's a must to go seen that
style now as I mentioned you got to also
package up if you want a rear camera
that makes me grit my teeth but you got
to do it that's called the convenience
package rear cam rear sonar automatic
mirror home link it's a little under a
thousand bucks
now the steal of the day is there a
driver assistance package for only eight
hundred and ninety bucks you get the
forward collision warning the cross
traffic alert the lane departure warning
the blind spot warning that's kind of a
deal
so all in we're somewhere shy of $36,000
nicely equipped but not top of the line
how does he empower fair overall this is
not a driver's car but it's a nice
driving car know what I mean it's not
going to appeal to a dramatically
different market than the one that left
it but it's now a seriously good
competitor against the Taurus the 300
the Azera and the Toyota Avalon all of
which by their way have been refreshed
lately it's a very competitive space but
this guy can hold its own
