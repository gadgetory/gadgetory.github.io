that is the mole cut
it's like auto-tune but for video
editing in that it smooths out some
rough parts but even if you don't edit
video you'll want to check out what this
can do
morph Kart is a new transition available
on Adobe's video editing software
Premiere Pro now usually when you remove
unwanted sections from an interview you
end up with a jump a morph cut smooths
out that jump so the viewer doesn't
notice anything here's a demo from Adobe
first the before I think what Mike means
to skateboarding I think Mike represents
an idea now the editor adds the morph
cuts to the transitions lets the
software interpolate and allies using
face recognition and voila the after I
think what Mike means to skateboarding I
think Mike represents an idea that
anyone can be a part of something looks
like magic but is it as great as Adobe
says let's put it to the test here's
Jason Parker
we've subtitled the words in yellow that
we're going to take out I know that the
lines start at 5 a.m. in the morning and
I don't I'm not going to get up that I'm
just not so it's going to be probably
going to get up around maybe eight or so
now here's the clip with jump cuts I
know that the lines start at 5 a.m. in
the morning I'm not going to get up that
I'm just not I'm probably going to get
up around maybe eight or so and finally
the most cuts I know that the lines
start at 5 a.m. in the morning I'm not
going to get up that early I'm just not
I'm probably gonna get up around maybe
8:00 or so that looks pretty smooth but
we didn't always get great results
here's another example from Wayne but
it'll give me the voice prompts and let
me get where I'm going I can also
activate I can also activate series
eyes-free by a long press but it'll give
me the voice prompts and let me get
where I'm going I can also activate
series eyes-free by a long press did you
see the hands that looks kind of weird
many of our tests
obvious like the video was stuttering or
buffering so the lighting and the
background has to be consistent you'll
also want to play with a transition
duration but when it does work you can
also get pretty cheeky and make someone
say something totally different
giraffes are some of the tallest animals
in the world but mice on the other hand
are some of the smallest animals in the
world giraffes are some of the smallest
animals in the world
that's a test-drive with premier pros
morph cut feature have you had a chance
to try it out did you get good results
or terrible ones post the links to your
own tests in the comments</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
