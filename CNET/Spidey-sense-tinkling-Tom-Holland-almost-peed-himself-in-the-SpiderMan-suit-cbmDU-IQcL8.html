I'm here with the spider-man Tom Holland
you've got to be featured in Civil War
right it was kind of like you know the
scene stealer you had a lot of fun
moments how is it different now the
whole movie is entirely centrally on you
as spider-man as Peter Parker how's that
just different for you it's way more
tiring dude Civil War for me was like a
blur I showed up I did my job and then
left she was a little awesome dude but
when we did spider-man we were about
four weeks in no sigh so guys when do I
get a break like do I get a day off what
do and they're like no you're spider-man
dude you're in every everything so of
course you don't get a break how much
you actually relate to the character a
Peter Parker is basically just an
American version of myself a lot of
people want to know about the suit can
you kind of tell us some what kind of
new bells and whistles that this suit is
gonna have it's almost like the most
advanced iPhone ever you know it can
just do so much and it helps him track
people and then it helps him listen into
conversations and it helps him pick out
threats and stuff how about this
favorite thing that the suit does for
you my favorite thing about the suit is
taking it off at the end of the day know
how awkward was your first experience
with the suit when I first walked on set
people who like oh oh my god everyone
was touched it was red and blue like
this it was it really was and it was
like okay guys this says stop with the
touching okay it's definitely a
nightmare to put on and take off if you
want to go to the bathroom you have to
plan like 45 minutes in advance I nearly
wet myself one time it was a close call
because you know how sometimes it just
comes on you're like I need to go now
and it's like is it me Hans it me hums
it me and then you're like get it off
get it off so it's and then you gotta
take a mask off and then you got an
unzip a muscle suit and slip the boots
out and stuff and then I've got Under
Armour on underneath that was nearly a
really expensive mistake but yeah that
was probably the closest I came to
really really embarrassing myself
because you are spider-man and we're
here we want to have a little fun with
you so we're wondering if you are down
to kind of do a little web shooting
contests so this spider-man vs. brighter
man okay we're down with that I'm down
you lose
I'm gonna win so much safer test company
this is not as good at it I did make
this set gonna make it I'm gonna give
you the first cup you drive corner you
would want your left go for it they're
ready here we go come on
informants issues I guess okay let's see
what you got Oh spider-man and brighter
it all out awesome everybody thanks so
much
appreciate it man I'm appreciating all
right cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
