people start screaming we're all gonna
die we're all going to die these are the
top five technologies that will not be
the death of us all I mean there may be
some casualties but not all of us at
number five virtual reality this
technology keeps coming back in one form
or another people worried that virtual
reality would lead to isolation which
will lead to the downfall of society now
that's not going to happen because
people will get addicted to VR but it
costs money to pay for electricity and
an online connection society is safe for
now at number four wireless technologies
I don't want to take this too lightly so
let's get serious for a second there's
been concern that cell phones can cause
cancer do their mission of radio waves
tissues near an antenna can absorb this
energy according to the US National
Cancer Institute radiofrequency energy
does not cause DNA damage they can lead
to cancer we're going to be okay at
number three robots in general we've all
seen terminator in the matrix machines
take over and we're relegated to a lower
class we are nowhere near sentient
robots that plan to kill us all take a
look at the Cosmo that's not killing
anyone how about that robot from Boston
Dynamics Atlas one long pole and Atlas
is done for hey Boston Dynamics make
sure you don't program Atlas with a
sense of revenge okay thanks at number
two drones I'm not talking about
military drones that is flying death I'm
talking about the drones normal people
can buy take a look at this video from
guard from above that's a bird of prey
taking out one of those quad copters the
scaly feet of the bird protected from
damage and at number one self-driving
cars there is this great fear that
self-driving cars will cause accidents
which will lead to many deaths well
according to some numbers from the
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety
there were one point oh eight deaths per
100 million miles driven in the US for
2014 Tesla states that worldwide there's
a death every sixty million miles the
first fatality we're Tesla's autopilot
was engaged just occurred after 130
million miles Elon Musk estimates that
auto pilot could have saved about a half
a million people per year at that rate
these cars may save more of us than we
expected for more top flies like this
good luck because that was a really
weird
