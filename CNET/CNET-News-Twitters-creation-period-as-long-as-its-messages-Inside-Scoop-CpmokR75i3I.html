Cena kaam karo tsuboi joined by senior
writer daniel Terdiman and today Daniel
is working on an interesting story about
Twitter and its origins and the Twitter
folks held an off-site today and one of
the tweets to come out of that meeting
was the fact that Twitter was
essentially created in two weeks right
clarify and explain that so Jack Dorsey
who was the person actually built
Twitter originally and as you know
credited with being a co founder of
twitter was at this sales conference
today and was being interviewed on stage
and apparently he said from what was
tweeted out from the conference that
twitter was built in two weeks and it
was originally built just for SMS so two
weeks for something that's really kind
of taken the world by storm what were
the original what was the original
twitter platform like vaganova yeah the
idea was for people to be able to send
messages to each other and you know
through mobile devices and the reason
you know everybody everybody always says
that the reason that you know tweets
have to be 140 characters is because
there was a limit of ability 160
characters for what could be sent over a
text message so this whole thing was a
very small project it was a side project
from from the company that that Dorsey
was working at and it was just meant to
be this like sort of new small
communications medium and I don't think
anybody really ever imagined that it was
going to be what it what it turned out
to be absolutely i mean we obviously saw
it rise to prominence in the 2008
presidential election and then here we
are four years after that six years
after Twitter's founding and look at
what an amazing medium it is I know it
really kind of set some records or
really had a lot of traffic this
election yeah an election day alone they
said there was 31 million tweets and
then you know they were putting out
statistics for each of the presidential
debates and like the first presidential
debate there was 10 million tweets sent
and I take the bulk of them had you know
something about big bird in them yeah
and there was let's say that during the
peak on Election Day this time there was
three hundred twenty-seven thousand
tweets per minute that was right when
the network's called the election for
President Obama so the numbers were just
astounding and sometimes there can be
problems however when everyone
is tweeting about the same thing and
using the same hashtag sometimes if
you're following a certain trend your
browser yeah well actually you know
there's there's a client called
tweetdeck which twitter owns right now
and it's a really good way to view
tweets you can set up columns for your
like your basic Twitter timeline and
your @ mentions and direct messages and
so forth you can also set up a column
that's looking at all tweets that have a
certain hash tag or keyword in them and
normally that works just fine but if
there's a if you're if you've got a
search set up for a very popular or
trending topic like say do you know
hashtag debates which I did during the
presidential debates what you find
quickly is that there's so many tweets
going so fast that it basically crashes
the application and so today Twitter and
said that they were had rolled out a new
update to tweet deck that's meant to
handle that problem and make it possible
for the for the application to handle
those those floods of tweets that
traffic well so from a two-week
experiment a little project to 500
million tweets a day it's amazing thank
you so much Daniel turned my pleasure
