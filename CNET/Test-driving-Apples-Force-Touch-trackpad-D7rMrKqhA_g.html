updated version of Apple's 13-inch
MacBook Pro that includes the new force
touch trackpad which is a new feature
that you're gonna get on the still
unreleased 12 inch macbook that everyone
is very excited about even though it
looks the same it works a lot
differently the big differences in older
try pads you had kind of a hinge along
the top and the whole pad would click
down like this when you press on it in
this pad you can click down from
anywhere and if you press harder you'll
click down again the second time kind of
a step moving bump um and then back up
bumbum like that however the pad is not
actually moving what you're getting is a
little bit of haptic force feedback a
little pushback against your finger that
gives you the illusion that the pan is
actually clicking down when it's not
it's remarkable even when you know
what's happening on the new force touch
trackpad this it's still a tiny bit of
flex to the glass but it's not actually
the same as clicking down that second
step and clicking on the new force touch
trackpad that gives you can texture more
responses depending on what you're doing
I can highlight a word here and then
click down really hard on it and I'm
gonna get like a dictionary definition
or I can choose another word and click
on it and I can get a Wikipedia
definition and I can get new stories
related to it or if I'm looking up where
some place is and I have an address I
can click on it with that again that
deeper force click and it's gonna pop up
a map I wanted to find out what would
happen when we showed people the new
trackpad and let them try it and then
told them what was happening under their
fingers and now press down harder click
it and then click down more and you can
feel 2 layers that go bump bump and then
bump um like that it says nothing is
actually happening the touchpad is not
actually moving well I know that but it
does feel like it's moving at there's a
little bit of haptic feedback it's
giving it a little jog a little shuffle
kind of but it's not actually going down
he has to be moving it feels like it's
it's like a step step there's a step yes
but it's not actually going down really
it's giving you a little like
that's I like completely convinced it to
step down now take your finger and put
it on there and press deeper feel a
second level the little step up and down
now here's the weird thing
the pant is not actually going down at
all it's not it's an illusion no it's
haptic feedback it's giving you a little
jog that makes it feel like you're
pressing it down Wow
for now you can only get the new force
touch trackpad in this updated 13-inch
retina MacBook Pro all total becoming an
April 2 the 12-inch super slim MacBook
and I bet in the next generation of all
the other Mac's you'll get it as well
I'm Dan Ackerman with Apple's new force
touch trackpad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
