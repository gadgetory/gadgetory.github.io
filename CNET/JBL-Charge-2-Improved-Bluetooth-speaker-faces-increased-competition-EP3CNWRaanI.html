charge - this is $130 portable bluetooth
speaker we were fans of the original JBL
charge and the key with that speaker was
that it had a bigger battery in it and
it offered a longer battery life this
charge - offers 12 hours of battery life
and the key is that you can charge a
cell phone off it as well as a USB port
in the back so you can in a pinch use it
to charge other electronic devices it
does offer a lot of bass and a large
sound for its size I said that now that
a lot of other Bluetooth speakers have
come out onto the market it doesn't
stand out in terms of sound as much for
instance we tested it against the Bose
Soundlink color and the Bose Soundlink
color had a little bit better clarity
this one has more bass but we overall
like the sound of the Bose Soundlink
color a little bit better it is worth
mentioning that if you are comparing
this to the Bose products this does have
built-in speakerphone capabilities
whereas those Bose speakers do not so
this is still a very good Bluetooth
speaker with also very good battery life
and some extra features and I do like it
however it is not necessarily at the top
of the Bluetooth game at this point I'm
David Carr noise and that's the JBL
charge - thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
