episode of 253 of the 359 podcast and as
promised we are continuing to fill the
hopper with some pre-recorded evergreen
shows while we are on technical hiatus
so if any of this information is
outdated
we apologize it's the future debate
because been Roger we got something
different in store keys yeah to my
understanding yeah okay
terrible genius usually do Roger will
take credit of course if it's so good
okay so in honor of the surprising 13.7
billion dollar deal Amazon made for
Whole Foods we decided to play a little
matchmaker game in which I throw at
hypothetical merger deals and Roger has
to immediately justify them and part of
the game is he has to justify each one
he can't crap on them he can't say that
this is a bad act which is bad because I
love crapping on things that's the game
right let's keep this in mind who you a
pigeon yeah I wish spread my wings to
fly away no important part of this game
is that I don't know any of the
companies that Benz put together any of
these mergers right I know they get is
more integrated I know they get more and
more ridiculous as they go on but I'm
gonna have to think on my feet a little
bit here right alright so let's get
started it's gonna be either just
terrible or you're gonna do you're gonna
do so great I'm gonna start you off with
two easy ones all right all right Apple
buys Tesla that's easy Apple has been
wanting to get into self-driving cars
they've been talking about developing AI
or a a I to run software to run into
different cars it's a lot easier if you
own the car maker itself to put that AI
in though you got to get the cow and you
know what they vote they've got they've
got a very very compatible brand right
luxury brand high-end you know they're
able to their high-tech how have they
not done this already totally sure okay
google buys Netflix Google has been
dying to get into the content business
for
long time obviously they've got YouTube
they've got YouTube read their
subscription service what better way to
add to your library in your catalog than
having the Netflix catalog at your
disposal okay
Amazon buys Walmart Home Depot and
Kroger all of them because we don't go
to the stores anymore why even have them
there's any of those stories left them
yeah Amazon basically already is taken
over those stores they're pretty much
dead already
might as well just put out their misery
and buy them up now okay alright
Facebook buys Philip Morris oh my god
well you know they've been trying to
stamp out negative comments I don't know
how this actually will be the trolls be
too busy smoking cigarettes if they hand
them okay alright yeah it's a cigarette
company you know he was going with what
that one was that they're both addictive
that was your answer right there all
right okay I was trying to like logic my
way out of that fine not what's not
working okay I maybe I over thought that
one McDonald's buys Nvidia well Big Macs
need more graphics processors I don't
know they're higher resolution Big Mac
images I mean if those Big Macs look
like super high res you'll want more
makhmour I don't know II went down like
the S&amp;amp;P 500 my can just picked like -
right number by the way we're break
through these really quick me please
slow down I know how long has this been
okay it's okay great by the way Brian
feel free to weigh in other increasingly
ridiculousness yeah ridiculous pretty
quickly yeah I have no idea what you're
talking about all right
like why does it make sense for one to
buy the other right I don't know
business all right well then it's all me
let's do it
okay I'll get you back to an easy one no
this is not mine I've thrown you off
that thoroughly yeah Goldman Sachs buys
PayPal right yeah so makes sense
the
a financial services company going to
the digital age
that's PayPal well alright that was too
easy yeah no all right fine I'm gonna go
to the oh boy
okay let me see fine I'll start doing
the really wacky ones so that's better
Microsoft buys the Hoover Dam
all right they need a power source oh
pretty good yeah that's it's a clean
power source to run their servers okay
yeah man okay that actually kind of
makes sense that kind of random I just
had this really bizarre and also over
dam with a red dragon doesn't it no no
no it's thinking the huge branding
update put like Windows 10 logos all
over the giant logos I'm very impressed
yeah you fly over there you're like look
at the Microsoft Hoover Dam totally
sorry the Windows 10 Hoover Dam I
totally made that one up and you you
justified the living crap out of it
way to go yeah well you'd have to
rebrand it though what would they call
the Windows 10 damn they would call it
the Windows 10 Hoover Dam that bomber
day no they'd be bad I'm saying the
operating system slows you down call it
the Hoover firewall ooh that's better
except it's blocking water not fire it's
close and it's it's got the idea that
fire water wall okay
Brian Brian is now turned on to it now
that I've cleared it license okay here's
here's a good one and and maybe you can
both answer this one Apple buys a
country which one oh I was gonna say
Ireland for tax implications whoo okay
that's interesting
I was gonna go I was gonna go with one
um with the UK really yeah because their
exit yeah they're spinning off of the EU
so now they're gonna be independent
right Big Ben could use an upgrade maybe
they're gonna turn it into a giant apple
wine digital clock dunking water ama
there yes it's full it'll be like the
Mickey Mouse head right a giant Mickey
Mouse head or maybe now a lot of things
with the UK I think Apple should at
least consider it
they know they have a lot of money they
might be able to pull it off you know
they've been looking for content there's
tons of great shows on the BBC although
show yeah yeah I mean it's a weird end
away it's a weird way to buy the show
bye-bye the country that produced by the
country you buy produce well show the
BBC is government state on yes exactly
they would end they would start making
Apple Apple stuff maybe will I am with
Sherlock Sherlock and then will.i.am
would be included in that show as well
no friend why France France go for it
explain it piqued snobby hipster dumb
plus they wear turtlenecks over there I
would like the nerdiest answer I don't
by the way for our readers or viewers
you don't know like Ireland is I think
it's been known as like a box haven for
companies making way too much money so
if they parked their profits over there
they get very low tax rates there you go
I actually how much time have we been on
cuz now I am running out of stuff we're
going in on eight minutes bird through
most of your talk that it's okay I'm not
writing myself
okay so Facebook buys a baby Allah The
Truman Show what year is it hmm
come on really
that's soon we're pretty close we're
pretty close to face book purchase I
mean I don't think the purchase the baby
in America I think baby maybe an Apple
owned France yeah just came up with the
French and yeah you know what think of
us they don't have to buy a baby like
bait like families will sign up for
whatever this is that's kind of sad like
way sooner than 2020 like if there's
some sort experiment with Facebook's
like will offer you free housing board
room and board for 20 years if you agree
to basically be on Facebook live all the
time don't you think it's more logical
or more likely for Apple to be the ones
to buy the baby and Facebook to own a
country and just really ran the country
Facebook eeeh and then I don't think
face Apple makes the ID we need an AI
baby no baby they'd later than any
country out there they
they like roboticize a baby I love like
Robocop oh my god and fight crime
watch that Robo baby would be brought to
you by Apple brought to me all aluminum
yeah it would be an alien video I would
watch that show if that was a TV show
every what year is it what year is it
with this Robo crime-fighting baby
I think Ryder's pretty close on 20 20 20
look how many stupid looking robots we
have running around we've gone over and
over this like as cool as robots are we
just keep making them look kind of wimpy
ER and lamer although to be fair
Robocop ones had a little hat Robocop
wasn't a robot it was a cyborg right yes
and a robot something else as opposed to
a humanoid robot which is an Android
right all right thank you for
filibustering for because I'm I'm pretty
pretty low on on it's okay burn through
those topics wing find coke vice Pepsi
Pepsi any more seriously like have you
seen a like a Pepsi bottle recently okay
yes yes crap but like yeah Pepsi like
people drink Pepsi people drink Pepsi
Pepsi also owns a lot of like snack
foods okay which are delicious there you
go well you just justified the purchase
for me it's fine why why why what why
did we go down soda pop I don't know I'm
now I'm now unlike the lower because
math is a game or drink or what I don't
know no no I just do a cook now it's
Pepsi Pepsi
yeah not booze Pepsi alright we're Code
Red
it's still out there is it still oh yeah
dude gamer still drink that or is that I
don't think there's a specific
preference when it comes to the Mountain
Dew brand I think the Mountain Dew is
just kind of like become synonymous with
like basement gaming yeah a very
negative unfortunate connotation even
though there shouldn't necessarily be
but it's a
what mountain Dew and Doritos is that
the joke yes yeah so I'm doing basement
game and it's redbull right you know
alright gasoline so let's let's do this
one I don't know maybe this will be
interesting a tech company buys the
presidency ooh
which tech company why think Facebook
pretty much all in the country already
did no one no one's by Twitter Twitter's
dimensions I know that was a running gag
that no one wants to buy Twitter
everybody wants to buy Twitter no
Facebook
literally all they have to do is I
changed some of the algorithms just
serve you different kinds of news get
you outraged or motivated this
perspective right so just take over the
bird is already gonna run for president
race true right like he's I mean he says
he's not but he's like running
he's like my goal is to visit all 50
states this year I think that's his
personal goal he's been having these sit
downs with like local damn like regular
families in you know middle America oh
my god Facebook is totally gonna buy the
presidency and we have nothing there's
no money they need to spend you just
need to tweak the rhythms on your
newsfeed Zuckerberg the greatest
president doesn't even have to win all
right so so this was actually one that
had been bandied about this was at the
bottom of a recode story once okay you
don't you know this one so you know it's
true it's a google buys our parent
company CBS yes i knew this one was
coming i actually been like a freight
train so and yes CBS is our parent
company louis colleges parent company
small hail CBS justification is i would
finally get access to their awesome
cafeterias okay the justification is
that CBS is a great company and who
wouldn't want to acquire such a
wonderful we've really just we've
crapped the bed with this woman
I'm sorry guys I'm like kind of out of
them already I have other one
Roger flip flip the flip the game here
turn it around I wants to flip the
script I have like a bunch of like
repetitive ones like google buys Ford or
Amazon buys General okay let's actually
kill this fun and you know kind of
rhetorical because the reality of it is
Google is going to buy all of them
alright what about their Twitter in the
mix sure uber buys Twitter whoa
why oh well they're both tarnished
brands yes they could help each other
out
I do too to tarnish brands make for yes
two wrongs always make a right that's
what the saying yes so and and with and
they'll do like a reverse merger where
Travis gets to come back and run come on
yo of Twitter and uber and square
Jack yeah Jack get scores out Dorsey's
out Travis is back because you can't you
can't keep that guy down he's just he's
just too much of an awesome bro and you
know and goober uses Twitter's I don't
know whatever algorithms thing to
reinvigorate their brand everybody now
loves they're gonna so like your Twitter
feed will be just full of like uber
right Frank Pepe Boggs yeah they're
gonna they're gonna get the Pepe frogs
to dead didn't they retire or kill that
meme they may have yeah that's it but
that's a pretty good one I was looking
at publicly traded companies but yeah
Hoover vice Twitter that's that's a
pretty good one I'd like to see that one
happened uh what about I've got one okay
okay
it could be silly a twitter buys Twitter
buys a lottery ticket and a six-pack of
Miller High Life
okay oh they're doing bet they would be
doing better than they are right now I
don't have the money for that that
sounds a little rich but I'd like to see
them try yeah I'd like to see a little I
like to see companies
get ambitious for sure for Twitter I
hope the poured Twitter people are
watching this world we're just kidding
we're just having fun Twitter I'm on
Twitter constantly so no I live on
Twitter yeah you have another one or
Samsung buys jack-in-the-box why oh my
god that's so it do you you know what
jack-in-the-box the West for the West
Coast food place you can't assume
everyone knows
okay so Samsung they've been selling a
lot of smart fridges they're gonna use
jack-in-the-box as its high-end to
deliver you jack-in-the-box food you
press a button on your Smart fridge and
you get fast food even faster right in
your house using Samsung drones delivery
using Samsung drones your sourdough Jack
and they and they heat it up with small
controlled explosions boom that worked
that totally works shots fired
I was gonna say they would microwave
their two tacos with Samsung Samsung
yeah with their exploding phones yeah
again we're just kidding folks we're
just kidding
Samsung we're killing time here on a
Thursday night as we pre tape this for
the hiatus so we want to be that ruin
the magic this is live we swear I think
that was pretty good though I found that
to be fairly successful everyone let me
have this out there Ryan
in case people are interested we have
tried crowdsourcing things before to
like minimal Suzy but that's okay if
you're at all interested in this and you
want us to do another one of these types
of episodes put it in the comments well
we will answer believe me we actually
read the comment we do read the comments
s pool as it can be I'm gonna take that
back we will not read any one of them
because that will allow you guys to
hijack the show you don't want to happen
but we get enough really good comments
maybe we'll do a show just from like
user-generated
crowdsource totally you know merger
deals like matchmaker of course all
right Wow
yeah I mean I I might need I may need to
call in a friend with Brian on that one
doesn't make any sense in the world to
me insert joke about breadsticks I don't
know I was really trying to find some
random body oh that's that's something
watch product place Hulu shows that are
showing while you eat your tallian oh my
god what they do is they insert mini TV
screens in the breadsticks so while
you're eating
you can watch Lulu shows sure it's
brilliant yeah yeah I'm like I'm
surprised they haven't done it already
so would you eat the breadsticks with
you would eat the breadsticks they're
edible televisions
Wow again we apologize it's rather
unusual episode standing by for the
inevitable they're out of ideas comments
