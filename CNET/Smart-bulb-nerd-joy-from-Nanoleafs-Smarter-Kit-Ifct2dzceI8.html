smarter kit this is a two bulb lighting
kit that comes with apple homekit
compatibility so you can turn the lights
on and off using an app or by asking
Siri to do it now it's a very cool
looking kit obviously the bulbs are the
same design that nano leaf is used for
awhile now that's kind of geometrics
jigsaw assembly it's 3d printed with the
diodes on the outside very eye-catching
and cool looking but the hub that
controls the system is also pretty nifty
it's a dodecahedron you'll plug it into
your router and I wouldn't mind having
the sitting out on the shelf beside it
now a hundred bucks is not inexpensive
for a two bulb smart lighting kit the
closest comparison is probably the
philips hue non color-changing white
light only starter kit that has two
bulbs works with apple homekit comes
with the hub same basic thing but that
cost eighty it's available whether this
is worth an extra twenty bucks over that
I think the bulb and the hub both look a
lot better and there's also a neat
dimming trick you can do with these that
involves manually flicking the switch a
couple of times to lock in a load
dimming setting that's a handy way of
getting the light down low if you don't
enter sewn-on you another nice thing
about this kit is that it's compatible
third-party bulbs that might not work as
well with other systems the obvious
examples are the Cree connected LED and
the GE Link LED here they both are with
the Nano leaf ivy bulb I've got all
three pairs with that Nana leave hub if
I ask Siri to turn all the lights on
they all come on together can also see
them in the app and dim them up and down
as you need very handy now the whole
gist of home kid is that any home kit
compatible smart home gadgets should all
work together and that's the case with
this app you can open the Natalie FAP
and see other home care gadgets and
control them it still feels a bit
limited for my taste so you can't set a
timer for instance if I want the lights
to turn off slowly over 45 minutes or if
I want to set the lights to wake me up
at 7 a.m. I can't do that in the app
still I think that the Natalie smarter
kit is a nice addition to the home kit
lineup of products and something to keep
an eye on is home kit continues to
expand
