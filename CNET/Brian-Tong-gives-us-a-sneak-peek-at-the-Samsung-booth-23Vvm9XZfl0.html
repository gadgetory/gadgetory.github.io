show floor here at CES 2013 we're here
in this central hall and behind me we
can't get inside this because they're
still working hard at it but this is
Samsung's booth we know we just came out
of Samsung presser and yeah like you I'm
personally really excited to see that 85
inch LED TV I actually got to see it
last night and one of their events but
you know just like kind of be able to
play around with a little more we hope
that we can see that inside there we
know that we're not going to see much
mobile stuff from Samsung this year but
if you look behind me just you know they
have a full force of workers going at it
right now down here kind of in our
bottom right hand corner those are all
the Samsung Galaxy Notes that they're
equipping out there with some colored
versions as well as white versions or
colored cases that they're going to slap
on top of those but we all know how the
note that 5.5 inch tablet phablet phone
tablet whatever you want to call it is
there but that's just again the design
here is very similar to Sony's designed
with that kind of circular 360 degree
rotation screen so we'll be able to
obviously show you a whole lot more
tomorrow once they let us inside of the
wall to Samsung what we're going to show
you kind of a little bit more right
things are kind of winding down people
are still setting up but they're going
to be here all day all night inside the
central hall so I'm going to take kind
of take a little look around and see
what else we have here Kobe has always
continue to have a presence here at CES
and we have told you about our sprint
hashtag series well if you look
somewhere near my right hand area that
might be a clue for all you guys that
haven't or don't know about this follow
our twitter account at cnet send us
something near my right hand this
hashtag send it to at cnet and it'll
enter you in a contest for a chance to
win a samsung galaxy tab 2 10 point 0
which we can't even touch in there
because they won't medicine it's very
sad okay so we're just going to keep on
walking over here to give you a little
more size and scope this is really a
little bit more deeper into the central
hall but we have I to be honest I don't
I some of these boots I don't even
recognize no but oh here we go look good
call sir just watch for my feet so we're
gonna keep on walking over here we have
boss systems a lot of you know one of
the few car system manufacturers that is
here in the central hall they're mostly
hanging out over there but we have
different variety of speakers amplifiers
subwoofers all lined up here from
planet audio so you can check that out
if you come out in the central hall I'm
gonna keep on walking I wish I could I
wish I could climb this ladder right now
I wish I could I can't okay so this is
take you around a little more just to
give you a little more perspective what
we have here there's a lot of smaller
booths that like basically spend all the
chatter that they want to get into the
central hall so we have here a variety
of cell phone accessories you have the
plug-ins for your Chargers whether
they're in the wall charger or for your
car so we have them all lined up on the
wall that are coming over here all right
