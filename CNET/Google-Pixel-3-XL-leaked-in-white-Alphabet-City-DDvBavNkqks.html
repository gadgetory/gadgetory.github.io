talk about Google's next phone onto
pixel park new pictures of what looks to
be the next Google pixel XL have made
their way to xda-developers calm thanks
to a member known as dr. guru the front
looks like what we've seen before a deep
notch on the top with two cameras
flanking the ear speaker then there's
that big chin on the bottom we also got
a clear shot of the back with a single
camera and fingerprint sensor unlike
previous pixels the glass back does not
have a two-tone look dr. boo roo says in
the top part of the back is glossy and
the bottom is matte that glass back also
suggests the pixel will get wireless
charging on to galaxy gateway
the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 will be
unveiled on August 9th at an event held
in Brooklyn but will there be any
surprises even more note 9 details have
leaked first up take a look at these
pics from when future dot de these look
like the note 9 in snazzy cases one's
got a kickstand another is an LED view
cover another is a silicone case efflux
also posted a picture of the note in
black blue and brown win future also
says the note 9 will be able to operate
index mode without needing a doc as of
right now if you want to use your
Samsung device as a desktop you'd have
to buy a separate dock plugging in your
phone gives you a desktop computer like
experience when future says that if you
use a DisplayPort enabled USBC adapter
you can connect an external display
you'd be able to connect a mouse and a
keyboard using bluetooth Samsung also
released a new ad that hints the note
will have lots of battery life in it
someone notices their phone died and
frantically tries to keep it alive the
30-second spot ends with the phrases
battery can't keep up a lot can change
in a day then it shows the date August
9th 2018 that happens to be unpacked day
then there's more notes about Samsung's
upcoming folding Galaxy phone a report
from Nikkei Asia review says the folding
phone will have a 7.3 inch screen and it
would be no thicker than an iPhone 8 or
8 + when folded the same report says the
folder can be folded 20,000 times and
will cost between $1,500 and $2,000 by
the way Nikkei Asia review also says
Huawei is aiming to release its own
folding phone before Samsung does next

Avenue yeah I had to do it and then
we'll take it higher
Google released the final preview of
Android pee the company says beta 4 will
include a release candidate build this
is the last chance developers will get
to test their apps on Android pee before

slowly trickles down to everyone else
over the next million years it takes so
long to get the latest version of
Android unless you're using a pixel
anyway Android pee will launch this
summer along with his official naming
what will the P stand for if you didn't
know Google names its versions of
Android after desserts it goes cupcake
donut Eclair Froyo gingerbread honeycomb
Ice Cream Sandwich jelly bean KitKat

Gardens Google is making some upgrades
to its search if you're looking up an
event you'll get location time and
ticketing info you'll also be able to
bookmark events share them and get
directions to that event it's very
similar to the for youth section in the
new Google Maps Google also introduced
the world to its tightened security key
what is it you asked to the screen
forgetting that I can't hear you
well the Titan key is a security key
there are two versions one is Bluetooth
another is USB you can buy either or you
can buy both for fifty dollars
what does it do it adds a second layer
of security through multi-factor
authentication so someone tries to log
in using your info but doesn't have your
physical key they're not getting in the
Titan key will hit Google shop soon time
to head to comment Cove
this is the part of the show where we
shine a spotlight on the best audience
in the world

Android it's the best iOS available alex
says what happened with Yeti the so
called Google game console is it still
in development or did Google already
kill it well reports have Yeti have
floated around online but there's been
no official word about Google's gaming
dreams it's hard to tell if it's alive

more news in Google changed its Play
Store Policies apps that mine
cryptocurrency on devices are out apps

cryptocurrency are okay that doesn't
mean you can't mine on your Android
