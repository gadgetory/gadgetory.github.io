awesome centerpiece it turns your room
shades of blue red green and purple plus
you never have to get off the couch to
control the light well once you get past
that novelty you can also be really
useful today I'll show you how to wake
up with you use it to keep burglars away
and set the mood the moment you get home
once you've installed the bulbs and the
portal is set up first on your list is
to set up remote controlling that means
you can actually control the lights from
miles away to do that go to the app and
tap the Settings button then log in once
you register for an account on the hue
website you'll be asked to grant remote
control access hit yes head back to the
app and you should be set now you can
use almost all the app features even
when you're not at home you've also just
unlocked three of Hugh's best offerings
alarms timers and geofencing if you need
a little extra push out of bed in the
morning there's a huge fear for that
waking up to light will tell your brain
that it's morning and it's time to get
up to program an alarm hit the plus
button to create a new scene then choose
a recipe and the brightness energized
would be a good one for the morning now
choose which lights will turn on and
finally tap this button then alarm to
set the alarm when you're setting the
time you'll see you have an option to
randomize if you enable this the lights
will turn on and off at various times to
foil any thieves
then choose your fade in interval the
days and you're set now you can give the
recipe a name up here and it'll show up
in the app if it's blue you'll know it's
activated
anytime you want to deactivate it just
double tap the scene' Hugh it's also
pretty smart if you train it to be with
geofencing lights will automatically
turn on when you get home and off when
you leave here's how it works like the
alarm create a new scene but this time
choose my location this marker indicates
where your house is if you need to hit
refresh to help the app find you down
here check the boxes to decide when the
lights turn on and off unless you don't
get a lot of natural sunlight check this
box to make sure Hugh only turns on when
it's dark out now whenever you arrive
home your lights will be on and the mood
will be set these are just some of the
more useful heute features but there's
lots more so check out my complete guide
on how to see Netcom and as always hit
me up on Twitter with any questions for
cnet.com I'm Sharon Vaknin now I think
it's time to relax
