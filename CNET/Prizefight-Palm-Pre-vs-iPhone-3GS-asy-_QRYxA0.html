and this is the price right you've all
been waiting for
it's a heavyweight title fight between
the top two touchscreen smartphone
Titans it's a prize fight between the
Palm Pre and Apple's iPhone 3GS these
phones have been duking it out on the
streets launching within weeks of each
other the media surrounding them has
been fierce and they finally had time to
be used in the real world showcasing
their strengths and exposing their flaws
so we're bringing in the big guns to
judge this fight senior editor ken
tournament senior editor Bonnie chop and
myself will do the honors now we'll take
all three judges scores and average them
out to the nearest tenth each round the
final prize fight score will be an
average of all rounds using the same
decimal system so let's get ready to
rumble and tumble the first round is
sexist the Palm Pre is a sexy beast when
it's closed with its minimalist design
when open the edges are a little sharp
but for those who think it looks cheap
with its plastic body pick it up because
it's anything but that the iPhone 3GS is
design is iconic and no one can match
it's simple and sleek body Bonnie
well she's over it and she thinks it
looks blocky compared to the pre four
really Bonnie I'm still making out with
it beauty is in the eye of the beholder
and both bones get a 4.3 we're even out
of the gates next round is navigation
and multitasking the pre isn't the most
intuitive device out of the box and
there is a small learning curve but it's
multi-touch display works wonders the
keyboard is very cramped so people with
sausage fingers beware now the hands
down killer feature of the pre that
makes it so unique is its multitasking
deck of cards feature you can run
multiple apps at the same time and no
phone can match it plus its notification
system is tucked in the corner and is
non intrusive the iPhones touchscreen is
still the most responsive and its
navigation is unrivaled it's so easy
that my three-year-old niece can use it
now when it comes to multitasking you
can listen your music collection while
working on another application but
that's it the push notification system
is
helpful but it's just not enough and
messages take up the screen the pre
takes this round with a 4.7 and the
iPhone gets a 4 now after averaging two
rounds the pre leads by three tenths of
a point round three is features both of
these phones are packed with the big
stuff like 3G Wi-Fi GPS and Bluetooth so
we'll show you a few of the minor
differences the pre comes with Sprint's
navigation for turn-by-turn directions
right out of the box while the iPhone
has third-party options that you have to
pay for you want access to the key
features on the pre press the upper
right hand corner to get to them on the
iPhone you'll navigate through multiple
menus and finally you'll find them cut
copy and paste are on both phones the
pre involves a combination of keys and
the touchscreen doesn't really keep up
with selecting text on top of that this
feature only works on text that you're
writing on at that time now the iPhone
uses one finger it's super accurate with
moving the cursor when you want to
select text and it can be used wherever
you see text across apps like in the
browser in emails or in text messages
there's no touchscreen keyboard for the
free so you'll still have to slide open
the keypad and hopefully that will get
resolved in future updates the pre has
MMS but will offer no tethering and
currently there's no voice dialing the
iPhone has voice dialing and is planning
to get MMS and tethering abilities by
the end of the summer the Palm Pre app
store is still in beta and it's pretty
anemic at the moment while app will
spark the App Store revolution with over
65,000 apps and games you make the call
but we're calling this round even and
both phones get a 4.3 next up is web
browsing and multimedia the pries web
browser is second only to Safari with
multi-touch functionality palm also says
flash will be coming to the browser by
the end of 2009 video playback looks
great for files stored on the device
streaming content from ESPN's web site
looked impressive but Sprint TV was not
so hot you'll have access to the Amazon
mp3 store but currently you can only
purchase tracks over Wi-Fi you'll also
get a 3 megapixel camera with flash but
there's no video capture at the moment
the iPhone 3GS has had time to mature
and its
made for multimedia the Safari web
browser is second-to-none
even without Flash support and you have
access to the iTunes store to purchase
music videos and download podcasts
directly video playback looks stellar
with movie files on its larger screen
and streaming ESPN content was excellent
it's three megapixel camera has no flash
but you can record video and then edit
and upload it instantly the judges all
agree here and the iPhone takes this
round with a perfect 5 and the pre gets
a 4 so after four rounds the iPhone
takes its first leaf by one tenth of a
point
you know this prize bite was destined to
be a nail-biter the final round that
will decide it all is called quality and
performance the Palm Pre had call
quality that was good overall and
cleaner than the iPhone but its internal
performance was just not as snappy
battery life is still an issue and after
a few updates we were able to get around
a day of juice with normal use on the
Apple side call quality has never been a
strong point for the iPhone and it
didn't really change with the 3GS the
other side of the line definitely
sounded more robotic compared to the pre
but it makes up for it with its speedier
processor that you can feel and its
battery life performs significantly
better than the pre I've been able to
get close to two days with normal use
now this one's too close to call and all
the judges agree both phones get off for
this is going to be a close one
so let's average out all five rounds and
in a hotly contested prize fight that
featured three rounds that tied we end
up tied with a 4.3 now we can't walk
away like this and this prize fight has
to have a winner so we're going to break
this down people 5 hundredths of a point
so do the math for yourselves but after
a five-round throwdown the iPhone 3GS is
still your reigning champion and takes
this prize fight winning four point
three two to four point two six in the
closest prize fight in CNET history this
just shows everyone how great these
touchscreen Titans are and ultimately
it's up to you to decide which one's the
winner
i'm brian tom thanks for watching look
at you guys next
on another epic prizefight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
