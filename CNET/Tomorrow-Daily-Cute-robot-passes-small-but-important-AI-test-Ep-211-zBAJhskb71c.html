but crucial artificial intelligence test
Ford's new headlight system that
actually turns as it sees stuff on the
road and VR is one step closer to
Hollywood
tomorrow Daley
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk shown there new verse I'm Ashley
together that's kill anonymous don't
don't correct your screen my pants are
really this red yeah yeah turn up your
saturation in fact just go right for it
you're not ready for it you're not ready
Kayla
wears these to keep people cars and
people will stop actually right in front
of him it's like it's like at your own
walking they can I had a lot of power I
don't know how I'm able to wield them
but I just am it's just a genetic thing
I don't know it's kind of like the wheel
near where you're the only person who's
actually able to pull them up like you
no one else can actually yeah if they're
not they're not worthy
no one's worthy I didn't buy them they
just showed up on my body and this one
is towed to you by a Nordic Nordic Norse
God all right guys let's hit the
headlines
is there a Nordic god of fashion I feel
like that would be fabulous gotta be one
right oh my god yeah somebody somebody
if you can draw draw fashion please just
send that right over okay let's talk
about real thing let's talk about this
is a little bit scary so researchers at
the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute a I
and reasoning lab that's a mouthful may
have made a very small but but quite
significant AI breakthrough this is very
interesting so there is a true AI shows
its awareness through recognizing itself
as an individual different from others
and so what they did was they took these
three little cute robots and these now
robots and they gave them a classic
logic puzzle called the Kings wisemen
and so in the King's wise men there's a
thing about hats it's like it's there's
it's a whole logic puzzle and what they
did was they modified the puzzle like
this so they told all the robots that
two of them had been given a pill that
rendered them unable to speak and one
got a placebo and was able to speak and
the mechanism that kept them from
talking wasn't actually a pill was just
a button on top of their heads okay so
two of the three robots had a button
pressed down on their heads that kept
them from speaking okay and and they
asked each robot individually see so
there they are like type so when they
tap on their heads there you go they're
quiet and they basically asked the
robots they gave him time to reason
because they have reasoning software
installed and they said okay did you
receive the the pill or the placebo and
one of the robots said the one who
didn't get silenced said I'm sorry I
don't know but then it recognizes that
it spoke it stands up raises its hand
like it's in a class and says I'm sorry
I know now I was able to prove I was not
given the dumbing pill so it recognized
that it spoke meaning it did not get
this pill to make it quiet so it
realized it was different than the other
two robots so this is like a very
significant thing like a maze
thing small it seems really small but
this is a really kind of amazing AI
achievement it's like a that's really
cool that this robot was able to reason
like oh I just spoke I must have gotten
I must have gotten a placebo I reasoned
that I'm different than these other two
robots I like it I think it's adorable
it's it's an adorable showing an AI but
but then what I I'm so yeah understood
the the robot understood the rules of
the puzzle it recognized its own voice
was speaking out loud and then was able
to reason that it was distinct from the
other two robots and that was what was
so important about it I thought it was
really fascinating and I I mean congrats
to the team over there and and and well
done because that is again small but
significant kind of thing where you see
it and you're just like wow like this is
gonna kind of open up maybe some doors
that weren't available to be open before
for adorable little robots and Skynet
tell me about we are okay so this would
be a real quick story but there's some
big stuff that happened with oculus
because oculus just partnered with
someone so we know that VR has been a
big thing that gaming has been looking
forward to that's really ready to go and
stuff like that but a lot of people have
been making content that is also
filmmaking it's bringing it closer to
Hollywood right and we've seen this done
before we even reach echt it out with
interstellar yeah he did an interstellar
experience there was one for Jurassic
world's so that you they were tying it
to a movie well oculus has partnered
with Felix and Paul Studios which is run
by Felix and Paul they just signed a
contract with the oculus or multi multi
project multi-year deal to make more
Hollywood crossover type stuff I like it
yeah so you know obviously what like I
said one of those was you know Jurassic
world look this was a Cirque du Soleil
one I guess oh my gosh this is amazing
but it looks like that's what that's a
direction that oculus wants to go and
there's going to be more of this
filmmaking variances marketing type
stuff right that is that okay so that's
pretty interesting because I think for
most of Hollywood they kind of still see
VR as kind of this
getting tool as opposed to full-on
filmmaking like I know that there are
like they I think have made like
narrative film that is virtual reality
based but I I find it interesting that
like right now the from Hollywood the
big studios they're like oh this is a
great marketing tool and I wonder if
that do you think that will change next
year like when when consumer headsets go
on the market because I think obviously
access is very limited right now for
most people they can't get their hands
on an oculus you know a developer's kit
or they can't you know everything else
is all you know the vibe is not
available nothing's available so except
for cardboard and so and the gear VR so
do you think that like within a year or
two we're gonna start seeing like beyond
just marketing experiences where it's
like oh go take a tour on these ship in
the endeavour from interstellar or check
out an Apatosaurus in Jurassic world
like do you think we're actually gonna
start seeing like full on full
feature-length films in virtual reality
I don't know I don't think so not yeah I
think there's it was gonna be a lot of
like fan-made stuff to start out with I
don't think anybody's gonna jump in
there right away
but I think there's gonna be like a lot
of fan experiences but like like yeah
like we were saying even the World of
Warcraft thing which you can watch
online now yeah so for the Warcraft
movie they made a flyover of Azeroth so
it is awesome it's gonna be stuff like
that and they don't I mean they're not
gonna be able to sell ISM I mean
headsets are gonna need to be much more
commonplace before they start making
that makes a lot that sort of cons
really common yeah yeah it's got to be
like you know the same type of thing is
like a television in every house yeah
it's a it's got to be that tipping point
where it's like there's so many people I
have them just have to make that it does
seem gimmicky to a lot of people still
and so the studio's also seen as
gimmicky and so they're not gonna until
it starts yeah just being like okay hey
you'll never believe what I saw yet last
night of my headset like it's like when
your face just goes like this and you're
just talking about your headset like
that but but until there yeah we're
bored oh so tired of being in a virtual
experience of flying over Azeroth on a
bagel anyway I do let go I like that
though like being inside a scene for the
movie if that would be cool yeah yeah I
want to be in Terminator 2 so that
brings us to our hashtag of the
which is hashtag TD thumb ver filter
yeah wait
yeah film VR got it what was the lower
third that we just saw what kind of VR
experience do you want to check out for
an upcoming film yeah what kind of VR
experience would you want to check out
for an up for me so a movie that's
coming out well it's gonna come out yeah
not something that already exists so you
can't like you know interstellar like no
we can't do that I feel like the right
answer would be Star Wars yeah that
could be good but I'm gonna I'm gonna
back out of that one I'm gonna try I'm
gonna try something original but you go
ahead I'm gonna say I would like to see
a VR experience for Suicide Squad where
you have to go on a date with Harley
Quinn duh yeah or that date with Harley
Quinn that would be great um no I I like
the idea of to one of two things one
like action-packed sort of heist II
kinda thing that's core you can do one
where it's a little bit more like get to
know the characters and you are the
psychiatrist the prison psychiatrist who
has to like talk to each of them like
down in their little prison cells Oh
like telltale games or you can like pick
answers and then they respond I think
that would be awesome it's pretty clever
I would like that I'd want to do the
hateful eight I want to see what good
you know would do with some VR and I'd
also be scared of that it would be
terrifying I don't know I don't know I
think I have somebody else right you'd
never come out the same you've never
ever come in but somehow blood comes out
of the VR headset he'd find a way he put
like pressure sensors in your chair when
you moved a certain way it just starts
bleeding so there you go TD film vr v
film vr that's delightful okay well let
me tell you about Ford and then we'll
hit the brake so for does this really
interesting headlamp system that they're
testing out right now this is super
weird and actually reminds me of this
this actually was it kind of a patent
like here just year decades decades ago
somebody wanted to make a car where you
turn the wheel and the headlights moved
right you have the Tucker the Tucker
so I'm sorry there's gonna be a lot of
people that don't know this is actually
a thing that has been people wanted
wanted to make something like this for a
very long time so Ford's new headlight
system is really interesting because it
uses infrared cameras GPS data and
pivoting spotlights alongside stand
headlights to pinpoint hazards and
people on dark roads and literally shine
a light in them on them so what it does
is um the GPS insights you can see how
this actually works it the infrared will
see someone on the road scary and turn
the spotlight part of the headlamp see
so it's not the headlights themselves
their actual spotlights where like your
fog lights would normally be that point
at potential hazards so your headlights
are always gonna be fixed in front of
you and then the these little spotlights
underneath your headlights turn to sort
of pinpoint things that might be hazards
or will turn with a bend in the road so
see like it's like they split out oh you
have to turn so this spotlights gonna go
this way and this one's gonna go so that
you can make your turn safely and be
able to see everything which is pretty
amazing so they said that this new tech
is gonna be available for customers in
the near term that was their their
phrase that's not a thing so I would
imagine that maybe we might actually
maybe even see a car like this at CES
next year might see one on the show
floor where they showed that show off
the technology and it's called the
camera based advanced front lighting
system which is a really long name that
no one's gonna remember you gotta make
it snappy like you know like I need
something short that guy can you put
that back on producer Logan cuz that guy
needs to not be walking that dog where
he's walking on a dark road yeah in the
middle of the night can we can we cue
that it's clearly this person is get out
of there go into the forest with your
dog and let him go pee over there
walking on this it's just bad there's
nothing like a sidewalk look at this now
you are that you are stupid sir
you're asking but able the weird a weird
side note when you're walking and a
car's keep coming by you and flashing a
bright light in your face yeah I'm I'm
all for safety safety first but I
thought about that too I thought about a
bicyclist like if they're if they're
going the opposite direction and this
light like shines into you like
swing-off you know I can't see and they
go blind but fortunately this system
actually designed to point downwards
like toward someone's have bottom half
to the dog towards the ass you blind the
dog but not there he shouldn't be
in the street no but as far as the
biking thing they're supposed to go with
traffic right supposed to go with
traffic that's the only thing that guy
did the dog did right was go against
traffic when you're walking can I tell
you about anxiety that is stupid
I always walk against traffic because
I'm always scared that when I'm walking
with it a car is gonna come up from
behind and like you're supposed to do
the rule is okay ride your bike ride
your bike with traffic walk against it
because you're supposed to be able to
see any danger coming at you yeah good
well the good I'm glad that my paranoia
finally paid off and I did something
right so that brings us to our hashtag
of the day hashtag Ashley is paranoid
about everything all right guys we're
gonna take a quick break we're gonna be
right back with a really awesome back
rockin that kind of folds into this this
technology it's a bicycle helmet and
then we're gonna talk about and then and
then we are going to discuss your user
feedback and our photogra for the day so
don't click away it's tomorrow daily
yeah you were not welcome back to the
show
we've returned it's Monday which means
it's time to discuss crowdfunding
efforts that have caught our eye it's
time for Becker Hackett alright so back
into Hackett we're gonna talk about a
bicycle helmet that is trying to push
bike helmet technology into the 21st
century which I feel is in dire need of
an update this is called Lumos we need
old helmets old town' just go for old
how much just no helmets at all tip
rocks to her head Oh perfect that'll
actually protect you very well rocks are
thick so Lumos is not just the Harry
Potter spell as I mentioned lower third
it's a this is a bike helmet that has
turn signals on it and brake lights
which is pretty cool so one of the
things that I always worry about with my
friends who are avid bicyclists or
cyclists is that you know when they
write at night it's dangerous you know
cuz cars aren't paying attention a lot
of the time and and you're little and
you're small yeah you're not you're not
exactly the bread the the biggest thing
on the road and it's hard to see you so
we've seen bike helmets with like brake
lights or you know headlamps things like
that sort of get the attention of
drivers but this one has a built-in
brake light that it works with an
accelerometer so when it feels that
you're slowing down it actually just
comes on you don't have to toggle it
which is pretty great and it also has
turn signals so which those are
controlled by a little remote that you
put on your handlebar and you could say
hey I'm going going right I'm going left
or I'm slowing down and then I'm gonna
turn and it recharges using USB so it's
really simple it's not it's not anything
crazy it lasts the charge lasts for two
and a half hours of flashing so it's
like I mean this in flashing mode lasts
for two and half hours so a good bike
ride it's not gonna you know you I mean
if you're going on the Tour de France I
mean this probably won't work for you
but you're you're safe anyway you're for
the most part you're it's although
streets are blocked off you know how to
worry about cars but yeah - now for our
bike ride if it's flashing the entire
time it's pretty good yeah good stuff I
really like this it's really really cool
now I need to know how much it cost
because it's cool I'd buy it my bike is
true so not all of us biker people biker
dudes we
spent a lot of money on your bike so
yeah like you don't have a $700 bike I'm
not gonna give inexpensive life I really
ridiculously because a safety is amazing
like this is the best okay okay so I'm
gonna at first I'm gonna tell you how
much they wanted they wanted one hundred
and twenty five thousand dollars they
have blown past that they've made three
hundred and eleven thousand dollars as a
right this second very cool which is
awesome they still have 23 days left and
a bike helmet after the couple of early
birds are have gone they're still an
early bird left $99 that's not bad at
all not bad at all that's bird I would
I thought $1.99 when I first saw it I'm
like 200 bucks as well you know
ninety-nine bucks which is the price of
a Fitbit so if you have something for
your fitness save up your money save up
your couch change and go get go get a
Lumos they deliver may of next year so
not not terrible
within a year there you feel like
they're they're pretty ready it does say
forty percent off the the early bird
that's available there's nine hundred
and eighty-two left of twenty five
hundred as I'm reading it on the site
right now and it says that this is forty
percent off the projected price at
retail a hundred dollars so it looks
like it's gonna be you know you can get
Loomis with Co you know you can get two
for a hundred ninety bucks right yeah
that's cool that's really cool you know
who needs one of these that stupid guy
walking his dog beyond the forest helmet
and get your limos and pulling on your
dog too because apparently you don't
have to take care of your dog I like
that you're more concerned about the dog
than the actual person in them oh there
he is again
what are you doing you're not even there
is a little path on the right you could
just go over there the dog is looking at
the car like could I just go with you
he's not walking the dog so the dog can
use the restroom and he's not even in
the place where the dog would go that
was negative on the street dogs don't go
ah sorry I hate to break it to you but
yeah there's like custom call signs and
stuff that you can do like real awesome
stuff yeah like depending on the tear
they have like all these like custom
different things yeah that's cool like
that yeah they've got a bunch of stuff
going on so I'm so really nice Loomis
great work really really like it and for
99 bucks I mean I feel like you can't
beat it that's a that's a little piece
of technology that would you know could
technically save your life beyond just
the helmet part
alright guys let's talk about you it's
time for user feedback you're gonna
really like all these answers we asked
you guys use the hashtag TV Mickey to
talk about what experiences you'd want
in a new high-tech Disney theme park
right you said just like one of those
cool like like the voice and I said like
soap in wrote to us and said Star Wars
battle groups or tea cockpit Sims x-wing
Millennium Falcon gun turrets with LCD
displays for windows I like that that's
pretty good they've already kind of got
a game like that but it's garbage like
it looks terrible but it's but it's yeah
I totally agree with you or like a they
have a pod simulators rad the pod the
bat is like the battle pods those are
yeah those are cool that's nice Derek
wrote and said I want to Star Wars Clone
Wars experience where I'm fighting
battle droids and clone troopers that
turn on me order 66 like they basically
turn on him and he's gonna fight whoa
whoa that's a pretty intense one to pick
by the way did everybody go Star Wars no
next person said interstellar black hole
ride the longer you're on it the more
years go by outside of it which I
totally thought was awesome that's also
terrifying yeah that's totally
terrifying
I would not you get out and like your
kids who can't write it or like you know
a hundred years old how was the ride dad
right now you're older than I am
Mitchell wrote and said each person gets
a different Avenger character and you
have to work together to fight Ultron
little kids yeah I bet you little kids
would be better at it than we would
totally have like Hulk just like falling
on my face and a little kid an Iron Man
I love that so much oh my god a baby's
with the Avengers so and then James
wrote in an email and I really like this
and I want to share with you because I
feel like you would really like this and
I really did he said I think it would be
a great idea for Disney to have a
simulation tour attraction have one at
each of the parks around the world they
would offer an interactive virtual tour
of all the Disney parks it's true some
experiences are difficult to fully
appreciate virtually but by giving
Disney fans some one which would be on
otherwise experienced a chance to enjoy
these parks they have fulfilled the
essence of the Disney spirit so he was
saying that like it would be kind of
like in-house market like and he
mentions like imagine like Ashlee if you
could go did you just down the street to
Disneyland and go see all of the
Shanghai Disney stuff like right there
in a like virtual reality setting pretty
awesome like I think that's a really
good idea also Disney should hire you
because that's a really good marketing
idea yeah super-good be really expensive
- they'd have to make sure that in some
way you could lose a lot of money while
you're doing it yeah because Disneyland
is expensive and that purchase like you
can in-app purchase a churro from your
favorite Disney theme park I'd buy it
yeah I'd do that I've met a lot of
virtual churros churros that's a new and
what do you think eyes virtual virtual
deep fried foods it's gonna be new new
moneymaker you know who it you know who
would probably really like that virtual
experience is like idiot that walks his
dog in the middle of the street probably
it's like he's got like he's look at
look at he's a lot in the street
- at least he puts the dog on the like
I'm towards your outside yeah he's
closer to the cars I mean he's
pretending when he sees the car he's not
like what better move out of these like
nah this is where I belong you remind me
so much right now of Brody from mall
rats when he keeps yelling about the kid
on the escalator and it's just so
amusing to me like I'm loving it so much
like you're so enraged all right guys
let's talk about our last piece of user
feedback it's our phone tiger for the
day
we got an email from a German listener
who was like I was walking my dog on the
side of the road and I snapped this pic
no that's not true
this is from pat pat says typhoons and
rains have passed by and finally a bit
of evening sun lit up the sky with a
double rainbow over the outskirts of
Tokyo panoramic shot on my iPhone 5s
keep up the interesting and fun stuff on
the show my god that's a beautiful
picture look at how nice that is in a
double rainbow what does it mean guys
what does it mean I still love that
video edible it looks great no that's
just definitely one of my favorite
pictures we ever showed on the show this
is really cool I really loved it it just
tells it tells its own story like I just
totally dig it so Pat thank you so much
this is like one of the ones that I
don't know if you guys have them around
your town but in LA they have billboards
that says chicken with an iPhone which
is which is cool and kind of lame at the
same time but also interesting yeah and
they'll show like a picture you feel
like that you feel like Apple would be
like we got a oh yeah well Apple watches
the show oh yeah totally yeah of course
I mean Johnny I've number one but they
but they like but they really hate Brian
time oh wow
paid him uh alright guys if you want to
send in your photogra fee you can email
us tomorrow at Sina comm set of story
ideas if you feel like it
I can also of course find us on social
media where tomorrow daily pretty much
all over the internet but mostly on
Twitter but really if you want to get to
know us go to our personal accounts or
house please don't come to my house go
kills house exactly right I don't have a
house I'm homeless so if you want to
find me you can find us on our personal
accounts I'm at guy walking dog in the
middle of the street and that kill
anonymous yes then I met Ashley together
that's it for the show today guys we'll
be back tomorrow with Randy Jacque at a
weird wonderful science back meeting
science fiction blown up in your face
all I could
but until then begin humans we'll see
you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
