month it's easy to believe that you need
the latest greatest model just to keep
up but in reality I have to bet many big
practical advancements and smartphones
for a while so buying an older phone
isn't really a bad idea especially if
you get a great deal donal Bell and this
top-5 I'm counting down the best smart
phones that can be had right now for
just one dollar on contract selected by
scene that associate editor Lynne law
these are oldies but goodies and the
most practical ways these are just as
good as any of the top shelf phones of
2013 starting things off at number five
the Samsung Galaxy s2 on t-mobile now
everyone freaks out about the galaxy s3
but it didn't just drop out of nowhere
it was the s2 that set the stage with a
4.5 inch Super AMOLED screen dual-core
processor NFC and an 8 megapixel camera
this phone was way ahead of its time for
2011 one of the only complaints we had
about it was that it was too pricey at
$230 they fixed that problem we also
wondered why anyone would need to phone
this big and now it looks frickin
adorable so cute at number four the
Nokia Lumia 822 now here's a phone on
Verizon that just came out a few months
ago it's a Windows Phone with good specs
a 4.3 inch screen 8 megapixel camera and
enough memory support to let you put in
64 gigabytes of additional storage best
of all you get Verizon's 4G LTE network
support now when this phone came out we
thought it was a little boring for $99
but now that we're seeing it for about a
penny boring is fine just treat yourself
to a fancy case an AT&amp;amp;T phone comes in
at number 3 she Pantech Burst now this
is the smallest phone of the bunch with
an iphone like 4-inch screen but it's
using a beautiful Super AMOLED display
backed by a dual-core processor and a
classy design that doesn't feel as slick
and plasticky as some of these other
phones the call quality wasn't so hot
but that AT&amp;amp;T 4G LTE makes up for it
especially when you consider that this
phone is being offered for just up
me personally though I don't care how
much it costs anything named burst is
going nowhere near my pocket region and
only slightly less explosive sounding
option comes in at number two it's the
LG Nitro HD this one's also on AT&amp;amp;T you
get a bigger 4.5 inch screen with HD
resolution 1080p video capture 4G LTE
and a dual core processor when it came
out at the end of 2011 it was a four
star top shelf smartphone that was 250
bucks on contract now can be had for a
penny and it connects to the same
internet and gets the same email as any
other phone in the room but just in case
you're wondering with spending a little
more will get you
here's seen its top 5 list of the best
smartphones overall for February 2013
now a lot of these are going to fall off
the list in the next few months but the
satisfaction of paying a dollar or less
for your new phone as a feeling that
never goes away
alright and now our number one smart
phone pick for cheapskates like me the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus on Sprint for
Android phones having that Google
sanctioned nexus endorsement is a big
deal and more importantly it means that
you get the most up-to-date version of
Android on here jellybean 4.6 inch
AMOLED HD display 4G data from Sprint's
now operational LTE network and even has
support for Google Wallet so you can
freak out cashiers when you pay for
stuff with your phone and tell them all
about how you've been sent from the
future to prevent a robot uprising all
of that for just $1 amazing so there you
go five great smartphones that cost less
than a sandwich for all of our latest
