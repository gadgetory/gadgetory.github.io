coverage of the Google pixel 3 event my
name is Jeff Bakalar and joining me for
the next 14 hours or so in our studio
here in New York is senior editor
Bridget Carey and senior reporter Ben
Fox ribbon hello hello thanks for having
us very excited I have no idea what's
gonna be announced today well if you're
like me you also have no idea what's
going to be announced today we're gonna
be checking in with the hosts of
alphabet city is actor who's live at the
event in just a little bit now if you
want to be a part of our fine
live show hit us up on twitter using the
hashtag seen it live ok so genuinely is
anyone else as excited as I am to find
out things we have no idea about at this
pixel event man you just are just
beaming with excitement okay obviously I
said that because we know so much it's
been leaked upon the leaks upon leaks
and I mean I would say it's not like you
can buy it but hey China you can buy it
I feel like it's kind of ridiculous how
much has been leaked well let's let's
talk about what what's known with all
the leaks so far okay okay so we have
photos we've seen it's the pixel 3xl in
a pixel 3 you get looking at it with a
six point three inch display or so and
when it comes to it being sold there was
a store in Hong Kong that a reporter
within gadget went to to go see it so if
you wanted to pay a premium suppose you
could buy it early but with it it looked
like everything that was rumored it came
true the larger one has a notch the
smaller one doesn't have a notch the
mystery still I think is the price yeah
it's like the only thing that hasn't
been revealed just yet that's like the
only thing we don't know about when it
comes to those two phones but I'm not
really you know worried about that these
phones phones are usually expensive
they're gonna be a lot of money maybe
we'll be surprised are we guys that chop
it is yeah are we gonna hit that
thousand dollar mark or are they gonna
stand out because they're not going to
go there I mean last year's what the
larger XL was about eight
50 right now you can get it for and the
pixel to that started it with like 650
so yeah are they gonna keep those prices
are they gonna go with Samsung and Apple
and say yeah let's all have our thousand
dollar phones I don't know they're bad
Fox Rubin I want to ask you is there
anything that Google can do at an event
that everybody knows exactly what it's
about to come out of their mouths yes
absolutely what can they do well you
know usually it's like feature sets are
software they're a little bit harder to
leak because it's not a physical product
so we saw like with Apple they tend to
like you know a head of an iPhone event
there are tons and tons of leaks that go
on for months ahead of that but I
remember there was one Apple event where
Super Mario run was a really big deal
everybody was like oh my god we had no
idea this was coming this is a cool new
app from Nintendo so at the very least I
guess I'd be looking for that then maybe
they're gonna have a Super Mario run in
their back pocket but maybe that's
expecting a little too much or maybe
it's a new camera feature with some
special selfie effects some fortnight
filter that you really want bad it's
gonna make you buy a pixel phone all
right so we obviously know about the
pixel three and the pixel three XL let's
talk about some of the other stuff it
sounds like they are going to be coming
out with some kind of Google Home Hub
which would be a direct competitor to
the to the echo show you know all about
the echo show you cover Amazon for Cena
what do you think that would look like
how do you think that would do I I'm
still like sure that people are buying a
lot of these products right now like the
echo dot and the Google home many are
the big standouts and because like
they're really small and you can put
them anywhere and they're $50 and they
go on sale a lot and I don't think that
they've really convinced people quite
yet that having much more expensive ones
with a touchscreen on them and also that
they have a camera is something that
people really want I mean like for you
guys is that something that you like
desperately one on your kitchen counter
Nihal grandma's also the rumors that is
something we're gonna have a camera yeah
no wait hear me out here okay I think
that would be interesting we're at a
time where you have people worried about
you know too much in their home too much
watching and listening going on and
maybe they could stand out I mean also
Facebook just came out with something
that just does you know video chatting
although if you're really into Google's
ecosystem yeah you're probably are using
things to do Google's
you know video chats and stuff so it's
either gonna make you get really upset
because it doesn't have something or it
may make you go oh I don't have to worry
about covering my camera up and maybe
maybe you do want it although there's
still obviously voice commands so
there's so bad
usually the solution is is that you have
this physical shutter that's what Google
did with their partners there are a
handful of other companies that provide
these things called smart displays
already they were first announced at CES
and then Facebook also has this little
shutter thing where they're like okay we
know you don't really trust us so here's
a physical shutter to make sure that you
know that we're not filming you when you
don't want to it's still a listening
device anyone camera into their home
right now has really not been reading
the news hasn't had a great week either
with with Google Plus having to shut it
down because of you know and I agree
it's a bad look nobody uses Google Plus
they should have they should have quote
they shouldn't have kept back you know
withheld the information that they were
they had data exploited for sure but I
mean do you know anybody on Google+ no
and people who like Google products
aren't gonna really probably care about
what the news but if anything is just
it's just weird to be like hi guys this
news just happened and please invite us
into your home even more it's just it's
just a little it's just an awkward kind
of I mean right now I trust Google more
than Facebook I think anyway we're all
Google fans here today aren't we
alright so talk more about so that we're
gonna get maybe their first tablet right
we're gonna get something called chrome
tab for the Chrome OS supposedly it's
called the pixel slate and it will have
a fold-out key
maybe as an as a secondary accessory
kind of like how surface works we just
like attach the keyboard or even you
could go as far as to say it's an iPad
pro competitor awesome yeah so I'm not
terribly fluent in Chrome OS I don't
know if you guys are but is that
something that could be appealing maybe
if the price is right how do you feel
about that it's gotta be really cheap I
think yeah for something like an Amazon
Amazon tablets are like $39 50 dollars
yeah
Chrome OS is their big selling point in
general for their laptops is is that
they're really cheap they've been really
successful in schools and that's why a
lot of schools have been moving away
from Apple products and doing a lot with
Chrome OS so maybe that's that's a good
play for them to do the pixel slate so
we'll see if that's the direction that
they go in if this is the first Chrome
OS tablet then I would expect a lot of
partners to start doing tablets too so
look out for that absolutely like agree
with you on the schools of the interest
inside and students and also there's a
rumor this could have a fingerprint
reader okay that would make it the first
chrome device with something like that
so interesting if they can get it to be
cheap and also have that good biometric
security all right is there anything
else that we already know about I mean I
know we're doing our best to act
surprised but we kind of have an idea of
what everything is going to be called
what everything is going what every
single product that's going to be
released I mean it is downright
ridiculous how much of this Google stuff
has leaked out ah let's talk about that
not real quick on the pixel 3xl I feel
like that is something that I am just I
really can't wrap my head around I think
it comes off kind of like a snaggletooth
it is an exaggerated knotch you're not
then you're not not yeah I am why not
can you guys just get your take on I'm a
little disappointed in Google that they
didn't decide to go in a different
direction that obviously not this
direction
yeah well the normal pixel this the
doesn't look like it has it right this
is for the larger okay so my point
larger one where the first year that
they came out with the pixel they said
guess what Apple got rid of the
headphone jack but we're gonna keep it
and we're gonna put it in our sizzle
reel and if you want a headphone jack
come to Google and they're not a big
player in smartphones if you have a
smartphone more often than not you have
an Apple phone or a Samsung ya so for
them they should try to differentiate
they should try to do something a little
different instead they got rid of the
headphone jack they're doing the the
knotch thing what exactly are they doing
that's actually different yeah
pave your own way I mean come on Google
insightful comment amazing man we have
eyes Akhtar on the line who is at the
Google event what's up is no are you
saying that Google wants to do something
something different I will say that the
mood here is very very subdued look
around and see the blandness of the
arena it looks like you're you're in a
classroom yeah well I also wouldn't want
to go to a movie if I knew every last
piece of the plot and how it's going to
end I mean who the hell has to go do
that it's definitely an interesting vibe
today a Scott tonight was discussing
earlier subdued or tranquil either
trying to get us very calm maybe setting
expectations for what we think we know
about the pixel three and a three XL
because if those two devices were leaked
and they were like completely planted
and be amazing but I wouldn't expect
that to be the case that would be the
coolest thing I've ever seen that would
be slightly cool this crazy like gag
this bait-and-switch where they just
planted all this stuff because it seems
fake that's how ridiculous it got with
all the leaks aiyah so back to that
whole idea like what do you do at an
event if your Google where everyone
already knows what you have up your
sleeve like what do you think they can
do I mean I realize you can't just
invent a product at the last minute but
do you think there's gonna be any kind
of surprise whatsoever is I know it's a
ridiculous question but what do you
think I would think not I think what
they plan to do is to focus their
attention on their camp my stuff I'm
flipping the camera now to show you the
stage and on the stage they have a bunch
of photos which seem to be shot by the
pixel what they might want to do
is saying that their camera is the
greatest camera of all time even though
it's it may be a single lens device so
that would be the only way to really
surprise people is to have maybe
something on the software side maybe
there's some assistant improvements that
change the way the camera is used but
otherwise Hudler wise i cannot imagine
the surprise popping up this slate and
what how do you feel about the the other
stuff that they're probably going to
announce the slate and the Google Home
Hub I mean is there any sort of like
besides I guess the pricing for all this
stuff is something we still don't know
about is there anything in terms of what
those products are looking like that
you're really you know interested in
seeing oh maybe they'll do this with
that I know again we're really great
jigsaw puzzle looks like already why
bother doing it right when it comes to
the Google home hub that rumored device
that a smart display we've already seen
that kind of thing from Lenovo and JBL
but with improvements to Google
assistant now it seems like a
touchscreen interface makes more sense
for when these devices a much more
visual so I don't know people get
excited about the home hug maybe that'll
be something that's big there was that
one with chromecast which I know
everybody over there is excited about
because chromecast their Jen kind of a
fan of something for that we need it's
just a lot of iterative products right
they're trying to build a ecosystem of
hardware and if doing it slowly if
anything what might be the most
interesting about this is I believe this
is the first time that Google's
designing their hardware in house they
bought the HTC engineers and a lot of
talent from HTC and previously they have
farmed it out to other companies so
maybe with improved control they have a
different set of hardware standards but
let's see what that looks like that's
interesting I mean look like I'm
genuinely interested in chromecast but
for me I use it more as a software
technology thing than I do as a hardware
thing because basically everything I own
you know surprised to find out that oh
it's got chromecast built into it so
it's really not something that I
necessarily you know
for as a standalone product but I
realize it's good for retrofitting stuff
that maybe doesn't have that kind of
technology built-in what do you guys
think you have anything else you want to
ask guys while we have them on the line
they have good breakfast over there yeah
what's that the shake situation like I
heard there's like a serious shake
situation okay the shake stuff looks
good I saw a lot of empty glasses they
were very short glasses apparently the
breakfast pastries not so good so again
I think they're setting expectations
it's gonna get brand but it's gonna be
there I look that's the one thing we
didn't know who's gonna happen in this
event so I'm you know you gotta give
them credit they're also what are those
goofy looking structures in the middle
of the audience like those look like
people those are people yes
they're just essentially barriers to
separate people that's it that's it but
they look like Google home you can't
just sit in your palm there for
something cool at Target say like jor-el
[Laughter]
put my hand on it see if you can see
that it's nothing to speak the will but
here's the cardboard underneath so I
don't think it does anything I put my
thumb on it there might be
there's probably Google pixels in there
so just keep your eye on it they're just
gonna give them all out to the people in
attendance there get me one of those
just only way by 15 50 pounds so so
Aya's you're the host of Alphabet City
you're obviously personally invested and
interested in this event for you what
are you most looking forward to in terms
of like confirmation of something
happening I don't know if you have a
pixel phone but knowing what we know
about the the pixel 3 and 3 Excel is
that something you would consider I
would consider the three Excel depending
on how the screen technology is last
year I picked some key myself for a
short time I could not get over the OLED
issues they use LG to produce the screen
on that and they have to work grittiness
to it some blue filter light issues it
was kind of a mess I've had the pixel
the original pixel the two XL and I
switched to one note because the display
ecology was superior I liked it a lot
more so the big thing that always calls
me back to the pixel even when I have
chosen a device is the updates you
always get the latest version of Android
and as we know what Samsung not exactly
something that happens very quickly so
that it thinks still a big draw that
from day one of a release of an update
you get it on the pixel so as long as
that continues and there's no reason why
that wouldn't that could probably pull
me back I assume you'd at 3m cell looks
nothing like what we saw yeah I have a
pixel to excel and you're totally right
they don't lean into the idea of like
you being in this club and I hate to
like make it this sort of like exclude
Tory sort of thing but like that's what
it is like you get the updates first you
get all the cool junk first so I
definitely think that's something that
people are psyched about I don't know if
it's necessarily enough for someone to
jump from iOS but I mean you did this
right yes yes and admittedly it wasn't
that easy
um iOS to Android I did I did and it was
it was a tough two weeks let's let's
pour it you pour I know I know
look I had to I had to walk you know
10,000 miles through the desert yeah it
was really difficult I mean I you think
about that maybe this is an opportunity
for them to sort of say hey we know you
know what this phone is but maybe let's
talk a little bit more about the perks
of actually owning a pixel because
ultimately they do want people to swap
sides yeah that one should be a very
strong point we should emphasize because
if the hardware is the hard with Assad
well there's not much to say about it
but then again we're in a bit of a tech
bubble right we've all seen the stuff a
lot like that I grew up in the city so
I've seen every single rumor possible
about this so they start to introduce
the phone to the general public as
something worthwhile to them and then
they need to push because people have
picked a pixel the people that pick a
pixel it's fun to say they're making a
decision about their devices so it's
it's this kind of introduce to the world
what the pixel 3 is and then explain hey
it's actually pretty cool to be on the
side yeah they're making a decision
they're they're making the zoom you say
look I realize all my friends are going
to get
my text messages as a green bubble
they're gonna think I'm weird they're
gonna be like who's this one guy who's
not using any message what is this how
come you're talking to me I just grew up
some sort of alien phone and you say
shut up you know what you're talking
about
pixel phones are really good you're just
a sheep like everyone else bad okay so I
thought people keep friends right
exactly
I picked my friends and face on their
cell phone Aya's Akhtar thank you so
very much
enjoy thank you guys what you already
know is going to happen at the pixel
event and we will also try and act
surprised here in in the office well
we'll keep it right thanks so much guys
oh man it's tough to stay surprised when
you know what's gonna happen but I
really feel like that's the thing they
can do they need that that this event
can accomplish is the pivot from like
okay we're not gonna talk about the
500-pound gorilla in the room everyone
knows what we're gonna do but instead
maybe make the case for owning a pixel
phone and why that's a cool thing and
make the case for having like living
that Google life right cuz it's gonna be
more than just a phone and they're gonna
talk about all the different ways to
stream things and have a hub and like in
fact we're talking about a lot of leaks
on the phone we didn't talk about the
chromecast and how that also was already
on sale by accident how does that happen
at best buy at Walmart like how does it
come off the truck and Best Buy opens it
up it probably says all over the bucks
do not open till October 9th do not and
someone's just like scan this and sell
it because it's time so alright I don't
know if Brian you can go to my screen
over at reddit there was already an
image of someone who bought it because
some what someone had a Best Buy
did put it on display he goes to
checkout and they're like oh that's
funny it's not scanning here let me just
charge you for an older version of the
chromecast in the system so in his photo
he took back at home you can see the new
one next to the older model and it looks
like this new one is obviously Matt
and if you look I can't even tell the
difference was a little shamey
you can see the little shiny I'll take
your word but looking at okay what do we
reverse seems that maybe with rumors
this might be a small upgrade look we're
talking bluetooth might be added so you
have the ability to use headphones
nothing really big but still funny that
you could have accidentally bought it
before is even in our pretend for a
second that I don't know the feature set
of the original chromecast just pretend
it is it 4k gonna do 4k i I have to get
my you're pretending as well why don't
you know this doesn't make it so you
don't pay attention I mean technically i
use a Roku but yeah I use Roku to you
know why because you can't get
everything on the chromecast I mean okay
but you can get a lot well I subscribe
also to Amazon so I want to be able to
get everything that was always a thing
with Roku did you find out
I'll get back okay okay yes the new one
will definitely but I feel like there's
a chromecast ultra and that's what I
feel like is is the 4k one maybe the
original original doesn't there's not a
whole lot that you can do with these
streaming players I mean like my Roku is
a couple of years old
I think Roku just came out with new
stuff they do yeah what's gonna get me
to buy a new one it works I didn't buy a
new Tel Aviv out because they're cheap
it was yeah that's like like a $30.00 oh
my gosh I have to go grab it so I'm sure
they'll try to replace cheaper than $30
$20 the one I already have
so like tell me what they're gonna do
with this chromecast well should it be
really that different I mean the you
know there is you know you talk about
like minor updates the the sort of
hardware its I could be a little faster
a little zippier like that's kind of
what happens when new Roku's come out
they get a little quicker the menus
respond a little a little peppier and
that's important I mean if you're using
a four-year-old Roku which I was out of
friends I staying over at a friend's
house come on feeling like things
struggling you know you're like hitting
the thing and then you gotta wait 10
seconds
catchup like you need a new one of these
things every now and that that's true I
mean now that they do 4k and for cheap
that's that's a win maybe you don't need
a new one every year but you don't do
nobody I was also gonna be interested to
see how this home hub situation how that
is advertised to play with video right
right because as we know with Amazon you
can't really get you have to bond there
is Google going to kind of you know talk
a lot about that or make it more of a
you know this is just for notifications
and controlling the smartphone I just
want to see how where they're pushing
and I think it's lame it doesn't have a
camera um so say with YouTube actually
the new echo show and the old echo show
are both gonna get YouTube because
they're gonna go and get they all will
be getting YouTube yeah more like you
have to go on like a browser yes they're
adding browsers into it and with the
browser you'll be able to go anywhere
you want to on the web including YouTube
so it is weird okay is it workaround but
at the same time that is something
that's been a big limitation to the echo
show here's an impossible question for
you what what's the future of voice
assistants gonna look like I'm really
I'm done with this with with Google
assistant and Alexa going it's like when
are they just gonna bury the hatchet and
become like one thing is that even a
possibility because right now my house
is like 70% Google and 30% Alexa I mean
I don't want to live like this anymore
question yeah it's a serious question
like when is the dust gonna settle like
do we have to live in this period of
transition forever like it is a good old
fashioned ecosystem and standards battle
at this point and it looks like Amazon
and Google are the two pillars at this
point Microsoft they basically decided
to you know throw their hands up in the
air and they said we're gonna work with
the Alexa that was the writing so Alexa
and Cortana now work together we'll see
what Samsung decides to do obviously
Apple goes in its own direction but our
Alexa and Google assistant ever gonna do
a kumbaya moment and start working
together not anytime soon I really
there's there's a lot more
room to grow I mean like a resistance I
mean their mortal enemies that Amazon's
a search engine in itself you know I
realize that but I don't know like now
you can put that that Amazon thing in
your car and it's like well what am i
you know your car cars come with iOS or
they come with Google Auto right like so
what I don't I don't know it just seems
like a real big pain in the ass and I
don't like pains in the ass consumers
are probably gonna ask for it at some
point but I don't anticipate something
like that happening for at least the
next couple of years because there's
still a ton more runway there are still
a lot of people that don't use voice
assistance at all so these guys are
still trying to gobble up customers I
like what Google's doing with their sort
of transition into being a voice command
hybrid with touch as well like I enjoy
the fact that like not everything needs
to be voice you know I mean like
sometimes you know you use your voice to
bring up something on your phone and
then you're presented with a slider or a
button not every single thing and I
think they're learning that slowly but
surely that you know the way we
communicate with products through our
voice is not only exclusively it
shouldn't only exclusively be voice I
think there's like a weird sort of gray
area where they're kind of learning and
feeling out their way it's gonna start
soon but before it does I did want to
throw to see who is using hashtags it's
not a Twitter because because we do have
some questions that are coming great you
want to quickly get your question or
comment and use the hashtag CNET live on
Twitter all right so Conor Roy do you
think it's worth it to switch from an
iPhone to a pixel 3 or the big jump
Conor with the real and what I found
do you have to cut to the chase it's
totally preference like I mean if your
life is already in Google email and all
the Google services you know that's the
case they're gonna have to make today
like oh well could things be easier
right if I only had one assistant to
talk to if I already have a Google home
you know it's it's not necessarily a
decision we can make for you ok
look at Ben Fox Reuben okay just look at
it he did it if that dude can do it you
can do it
Conor besides I mean totally can
capable dude right you said it only took
about two months to get used how long it
does take a little bit of like searching
around to figure out how to transport
this thing over and that thing over once
you're done it's fine it's not that
different or you're okay now you came
out outside at one piece I'm okay I'm a
normal person now I'm not going
okay not a transitionary god let's help
Connor really wrap his head around this
what was the toughest thing making that
transition what was the hardest thing
for you to like overcome switching over
my music library and I did it yeah
what's on your iPod it was bright it was
on my iPod no I switched over the music
library and then immediately never used
it again really because I use Spotify so
if that's really if you're already
streaming your music then that shouldn't
be a problem at all for you I just love
talking you about this because I don't
know that many people that switch from
iOS to Android I feel like if anything
you go the other way these days maybe
not I don't know what do you like the
most about switching to Android I mean
that to me the price just made a lot
more sense the process of an Android
phone yes okay yeah I got an essay for
$400 an Apple keeps charging people more
money so every single year in fact
raising their so every single time they
have an iPhone event I feel smarter
where I'm like oh okay that's $1,000
that's $1,200 I'm glad I stuck with this
thing so just like oh they're all these
suckers paying you know what they're
paying for you price that's going up you
said that no but yes Apple makes great
stuff they use Apple products every
single day I don't hate or dis you know
or love one brand more than the other
personally I use an Android phone
because it's better I mean you know look
I don't pick sides
Bridgette I know you're an iOS yeah
loyal person how do you feel about this
I don't because I honestly would like
some more I think Google puts a fire
under Apple to do some things
differently I am lazy I'm too lazy to
switch that said usually when it comes
to like apps they must came out for a
while like they were always iPhone first
and now let's not really feel like the
case anymore
it still opens but that's awesome yeah
yeah we have a couple other things okay
yeah let's get to the tweets Fred wood
is asking basically as Google gonna
reference the fact that everyone knows
what the pixel three is already so an
over-under is not really the right
betting terminology for this because
over-under is like a total amount of
points I think that maybe like the money
line what's the money line on Google
being self-aware
so we're on Twitter I would said the
wire laughter is like minus 800 meaning
they're obviously gonna bring it up
right
well the question is are they gonna
start with like a mayor Copa about
Google+ first so like what exactly are
they gonna bring they're gonna bring up
Google hey thanks for coming in
yesterday let me tell you let's see what
they say we're gonna go to the live
stream right now when it's over come
right back here and we'll have reaction
yes enjoy the press conference we know
what's going to happen
the pixel can't stop leaking we pretty
much know everything there is to know
about a pixel 3 as well as the pixel 3
Excel we have a very clear image now of
this pixel 3 pretty much everything
about it no matter how hard you try you
literally can't get anything past the
Internet
good morning good morning everyone
great to see you all here you're gonna
hear a lot more about help today I'm so
glad you've joined us we're shaking
things up a little bit with a new venue
some new faces in a new city special
welcome to our friends in the media
we've also invited some of our top sales
associates from Verizon and Telus
welcome yeah that's right for you
out-of-towners thanks so much for coming
here to New York City to be with us so
this year marks Google's 20th
anniversary and for two decades we've
been working towards our mission of
helping to organize the world's
information make it more accessible and
helpful for everybody delivering
information has always been in our DNA
it's why we exist we love working on
really hard problems that make life
easier for people in big and small ways
and I wanted to tell you a couple
stories about what I mean about this so
even after two decades we're constantly
working to shave as many milliseconds as
possible off of our search times that
focus has caused us to push into a bunch
of new areas we designed our new our own
servers we designed an operating system
to run our data centers all this so you
could find search results faster but if
we're really going to help people we
need to make sure we provide the most
relevant search results and we can only
do that if we know what people are
asking for so we set out to understand
the nuances of language and the intent
behind the words as we progressed on
that we realized that we could help with
translation - let's let us down a path
of developing completely new
technologies software hardware and the
AI that underlies it all and now we're
translating a hundred and four
three billion words every day in more
than a hundred languages and now more
people can say what they want to say to
each other
beautiful hello
thank you these are three of the most
requested words in every language and
with speech recognition as good as it is
we can roll out voice interactions
across our hardware devices so your
devices understand you when you talk to
them we can lessen the pain of
responding to emails by suggesting quick
responses and smart compose in Gmail
even offer offers to finish your
sentences as you type it can suggest
relevant contextual phrases and cut back
on repetitive typing like addresses
smart compose is already saving people a
billion characters of typing each week
and it's coming to mobile first with
pixel so with our improvements in
language the Google assistant is much
better at getting things done for you
like booking a restaurant reservation
over the phone that's our duplex
technology you saw earlier this year
these incredible technologies you'll
hear about today are built on this 20
year history of making information more
accessible and helpful for people this
is also true of our working imaging many
of you in this room say last year's
pixel to still takes the best pictures
even in a year with so many amazing
flagship phones that's not a fluke
pixels camera completely rethinks how
images are captured and we can trace
that intelligence directly back to
Google search we noticed very early on
that people were using Google to search
for images even though our results
weren't perfect back then because we
were looking at meta tags we were
looking at surrounding text that was
just really a workaround but what we
really needed to do was look at the
images themselves so we spent years
researching computer vision technologies
analyzing hundreds of millions of photos
and now we're getting better all the
time at recognizing objects and faces
and even concepts within an image or a
scene and we have all kinds of ways to
put this technology to work for you like
right now you can search through your
photo library so pictures are accessible
wherever you are without any work from
you and we can help take a stunning
portrait photo just like you would with
a DSLR and we can smooth out shakiness
in your videos you can also point your
camera at a movie poster get local
theatre listings maybe even look up an
actor's bio and we've invented a new
type of camera put it on a fleet of cars
and then drove those cars all over the
world to give you a detailed map of the
world
so from searching to translating to
getting a great photo of the world when
we see an opportunity to help people we
go the extra mile our deep investment in
AI over many years is at the core of our
ability to push forward in many areas at
once and you're gonna see this in a lot
of our products today I say this every
year but the big breakthroughs you're
gonna see are not in Hardware alone they
come at the intersection of AI software
and hardware working together this
approach is what makes Google's Hardware
experience so unique and it unlocks all
kinds of helpful benefits when we think
about artificial intelligence in a
consumer hardware context it is an
artificial at all it's helping you get
real things done every day a shorter
route to work a gorgeous vacation photo
a more efficient home our guiding
principle here is exactly the same as
it's been for 20 years to respect our
users and to put them first
and that guides our work in three very
specific ways first
we want to respect each user as an
individual and provide them with their
own personal Google just as Google is
organizing the world's information we
can combine AI software and hardware to
organize your information your
experience and the help we provide you
is unique to you the Google assistant is
the best expression of this and it's
always available to help provide help
when and where you need it
second we're committed to the security
of our users we need to offer simple
powerful ways to safeguard your devices
one way we do this is at the OS level
Google Play protect is the most widely
deployed mobile threat protection
service in the world and it constantly
works in the background to keep your
devices and data safe we've also
integrated tightened security the system
we built for Google Data Centers into
our mobile devices with a new dedicated
chip tighten security protects your most
sensitive on device data by securing
your lock screen and strengthening disk
encryption and it also even protects the
integrity of the operating system itself
by combining tightened security both in
the data center on device we've created
a closed loop for your data across the
Google ecosystem we know people want to
hear a lot about this so you'll be
hearing more about it throughout the day
a vital third theme of ours we want to
make sure that you're in control of your
digital well being from our research 72%
of users are concerned about the amount
of time they spend using tech and we
absolutely share that concern
so we've developed new tools that let
you control your devices instead of
those devices controlling you we're
introducing new simple ways to cut down
on notifications and distractions we can
help you understand the amount of time
you're spending with different
applications and set app limits so you
can switch them off when you want to and
we're providing parents with simple
controls over
screen time with the family we feel a
deep responsibility to our users to
provide a helpful personal google
experience while keeping their
information secure and making sure
they're in control of their digital
well-being these things really matter to
our users and it shows in their response
to our products the the enthusiasm has
been absolutely great this year
our Google home devices are expanding
into more countries and more homes our
daily active users have grown by 5x in
the past year alone and test after test
concludes the Google home is the most
accurate and most helpful home assistant
device it does the best job of filtering
out background noises and understanding
different people's voices and it now
offers help in multilingual homes pixel
book has had a huge year as well the
verge said pixel book is stellar
it's elegant sturdy fast and smartly
designed and both pixel book owners and
a lot of you tech reviewers gave it the
edge over other premium laptops for its
speedy performance and innovative design
and we're just getting started here and
what a year for pixel - a couple months
ago wire named it the best smartphone
money can buy in 2018 that's as good as
it gets especially in a year with so
many great flagship phones plus the
pixel experience keeps getting better
over time as we've rolled out a number
of helpful updates the UI is improved
the colors are deeper the phone is just
all-around more helpful than when it
first came out we're really proud of the
progress we've made across the whole
made by Google family but you probably
don't want to hear too much more about
last year's products so let's talk about
what we've been working on so first for
life on the go we design the world's
best camera and put it in the world's
most helpful phone introducing the
beautiful new pixel 3
and for life at home we designed
oops sorry for life at working at Flay
we're bringing the power and
productivity of a desktop to a gorgeous
tablet called pixel slate
and for life at home we designed a smart
display so you can hear and see the info
you need and manage your connected home
from a single screen introducing Google
home hub and here they are coming up
here in the pedestals for the first time
seen in real life go ahead you can take
a couple photos if you'd like try not to
knock them over because if you break it
you have to buy it give you about 30
seconds or so
I gotta get us out of these these look
great
Wow
okay all right we can start to put them
away don't worry everyone you'll get
more time with them in the demo area are
you trying to take one out of there I
would too but please don't I think they
look great it looked great right well
let's talk about the design because I
think the design of this year's products
are absolutely terrific
just last month Fast Company named
Google the design company of the year
for our efforts in both hardware and
software design we've seen incredible
progress in material design our
adaptable open-source system of
guidelines tools and components that
support the best practices of user
interface design and this has resulted
in some truly beautiful evolutions of
the applications you know and love and
this year's new devices fit perfectly
with the rest of the family that's due
to the amazing IV Ross and her wonderful
design team they've really yes
they've really pushed us to think about
how technology can be designed for the
way you live today and the design world
has taken notice over the past year made
by Google products have won more than
forty five of the design industry's top
awards Ivy's going to give us a rare
peek into our design studio and share
some of the details about our team's
philosophy and approach let's take a
look people think aesthetics is making
something pretty and it's really not i
mean aesthetics is about igniting our
senses I think we're all craving that a
little bit what is the design language
for Google bold and optimistic human in
our forms and our colors our shapes
as technology progresses it needs to be
closer to us
soft circles and curves evoke something
natural and familiar how that language
shows up will evolve over time I think
technology has to fit into place it will
eventually be invisible the design
challenge is to make that transition
smooth and beautiful our job is to
figure out what it feels like to hold
Google in your hand so cool so cool some
of the best examples of the amazing work
that ivy and her team have been doing is
in the most important place in your life
your home fast company named Google home
mini the most innovative product design
of 2018 and consumers love it too
as it extends access to the assistant in
more places throughout the home with
Google Wi-Fi we're using mesh networking
and AI to extend your home Wi-Fi network
Google Wi-Fi is still the number one
router and it's the simplest way to make
sure that your connection speed is good
and your home network is well-managed
you might have heard that we're bringing
together Google and nest so we can solve
deeper problems in managing people's
homes the right way to do this is to
start with the basics the smart home of
2018 is too complex with siloed
technologies and interfaces your smart
home really doesn't seem too smart when
he can't figure out how to turn on the
lights or set your home security system
so together with nest we're pursuing our
shared vision of a thoughtful home that
isn't just smart but it's helpful and
simple enough for everyone to set up and
use nest to find the thoughtful home
with the Nest Learning Thermostat which
is the number one product in its space
and it's helped say
over 25 billion kilowatt hours of energy
nest also has the top rated products in
connected security cameras smoke alarms
and doorbells so working together Google
and nests can shape how these
technologies come together for a more
helpful thoughtful home to show you what
that means
let me bring dia out to talk a little
bit more about the newest addition to
the Google home family dia
thanks Rick hey everyone thanks so much
for being here today let me tell you
about how we've reimagined Google for
the home two years ago we launched
Google home with the goal of helping you
and your family simplify the hectic
moments in your life and we've seen that
this is striking a chord with our users
the number of queries on google home has
gone up by over 400% in just the last
year but now imagine not only being able
to hear a response back when you ask
Google assistant a question but imagine
being able to see a response back that
is the power of Google Home Hub with
Google home hub we've redesigned
Google's most helpful services like
search YouTube Maps calendar and photos
so they're easily controllable with your
voice and provide glanceable help today
all of us use many different display
devices in our homes like phones laptops
and even tablets but none of these were
developed with the goal of helping you
and your family in your home environment
that is why we built Google home hub we
obsessed about what a display designed
specifically for your home should do how
should it interact with you or your
family what kind of hub should it
provide how should it look in any room
so we spent countless hours on the
design of hub we incorporated soft
rounded corners and premium materials
including our own custom fabrics you can
also choose from four beautiful colors
to complement any room the elegant
floating display is big enough so that
you can see things even from across the
room but it's small enough to fit in any
space in your home we also consciously
did not put a camera on hub so that it
was comfortable to use in the private
spaces of your home like your bedroom we
wanted to make sure that hub is not an
bright glowing screen in your home
so we made sure that hub can respond
automatically to the ambient light in
the room to do this we developed a
feature called ambient EQ
with ambient EQ we take a dedicated
sensor and combine it with our own
imaging algorithms so that we can fine
tune the brightness and color of the
display so now hub will respond
automatically to the bright white tones
of natural light that you get during the
day and then gradually shift into the
oranges and yellows of your indoor
lights in the evening you can feel the
magic of ambient EQ when you look at
their photos on a hub and of course hub
automatically turns the screen off at
night so now no matter what time of day
which room and even your home decor hub
can blend seamlessly into your home
finally we also wanted hub to be a
communal device one that works for
everyone in your home so we train hub on
Google's industry-leading speech
recognition technology by using voice
match hub is able to recognize who is
speaking to it and it's able to provide
a personalized experience for each and
every user in your home today 85% of
Google home users are using voice match
so by now you're probably wondering how
hub works so let me call up mark one of
our product managers to show you how in
action
thanks dia hello everyone I'm excited to
share with you a few examples how help
fits into my home mornings are crazy for
most of us and having a little bit of
help would be awesome with hub I can
just say hey Google good morning good
morning mark
the time is 9:00 a.m. currently in San
Francisco it's 64 in sunny the best way
to get to work by cars via US 101 south
and we'll take 45 minutes there are 11
entries in your calendar by the way
remember to pick up eggs for dinner
tonight because have recognized my voice
it tells me everything I need to know
while I'm finishing up my cup of coffee
and in the evenings hub is great at
helping me make dinner and relax Google
home hub is the best display made for
the kitchen so instead of fumbling
around with your phone or the tablet
while you have flowers on your hands or
your washing dishes or weren't oven
mitts you can simply use your voice to
get help in the kitchen you can set
multiple timers you can find out how
many Ounces are in a cup you can even
figure out what to cook for dinner
tonight my hub gives me access to a huge
library of recipes including great
dishes from tasty tonight I'm going to
make two of the classics eggs benedict
with the French 75
hashtag late night brunch as you can see
with hub I can follow along step by step
instructions to figure out how to make
Eggs Benedict I can even watch a video
to figure out how to poach an egg now I
like to tell you a little bit more about
YouTube onhub the YouTube experience has
been optimized so I have access to a ton
of how-to videos just by using my voice
good example is I can say hey Google
YouTube video now hub hey Google show me
how to carve a park how to carve
Halloween pumpkins on YouTube
it's a pretty epic pumpkin and of course
hub is great for enjoying music as well
with YouTube music you can easily find
the perfect song video or artists hey
Google Play something brand new
alright here's some music on YouTube all
I have to do is ask
I have instant access to the massive
catalog of music and videos by offering
the ability to hear and see your music
on up it really brings the concert right
to your home through December hub comes
with six months of YouTube premium on us
including add free videos and our new
YouTube music streaming service so we
all know technology can make our lives
easier and more fun but sometimes it's
really hard to disconnect and enjoy time
with friends and family hub can help
with that too
just put hub in to downtime mode and it
won't interact with anyone in the house
except for those critical things like
alarms it's a simple step but it makes a
huge difference we're also introducing a
set of tools to provide parents with a
little bit of peace of mind with filters
you can ensure that everyone in the home
is a joint family friendly content so no
matter if you're starting off your day
if you're learning something new or if
you're just chilling at home hub is
there to help
back to you dia
thanks a lot mark as you can see hub can
really help you simplify our home but
there's more as Rick mentioned we want
to build a thoughtful home for our users
and where this comes to life the most is
in how easy it is with hub to set up
manage and control your devices you can
even see the state of your entire home
at a glance it truly is the hub for your
thoughtful home so let me show you how
today I have a few different smart
devices in my home
smart lights thermostat or Bell and even
a door lock to be able to control and
manage these devices I have to go to
multiple different apps and if my
husband wants to manage and control
these devices he has to go to the same
apps we have no one place to go to to
down to get the state of our entire home
did we forget to turn down the lights
and lock the door in the living room
before going to bed with Hub we're
introducing home view with the swipe
down from the top of the screen you can
bring up a simple dashboard the
dashboard shows you the state of your
entire home at a quick glance and
provides you quick access to all your
devices this has been a radically
helpful addition to my home home view
was designed to be super easy and
intuitive to use with a simple tap or
with your voice you can even see things
by room so you can turn down the
temperature in the bedroom and turn up
the music in the living room it's now
all in one place for the very first time
and easily accessible by everyone in
your family and we're providing the same
level of control even if you're not near
your hub we've redesigned the Google map
to be the mobile controller for your
smart home it has the same home view
dashboard as hub so now you can control
all your devices from any phone even
when you're not at home now with nest
devices we have all the tools in place
they help take the experience of a
thoughtful home to the very next level
so we made sure that hub was deeply
integrated with nest devices like nest
camera nest thermostat
and even hello doorbell so for instance
if you're having dinner and someone
happens during your doorbell
Hubb will automatically show you at the
front door and you can tap a quick
response or use your voice to let your
guests know that you'll be right there
many people have connected devices in
their homes today and they don't even
know it
hub can help with that whole view lets
you control over 200 million devices
from over a thousand brands many of them
in your home today so now with a simple
tap or with your voice you can control
your dish hopper DVR your chromecast
your vizio tv and even your Philips you
light both with home view you have all
the tools in place to help you build it
and manage your thoughtful home whether
you have a house full of connected
devices like I do or you're just getting
started with your first simple smart
light bulb
now we've talked a lot about what hub
can do but what about when it's not in
use we design hub to be the world's best
photo frame so that you could relive
your precious moments and Google home up
we do this by a deep integration with
Google photos
Google photos has over 1.2 billion
photos and videos uploaded every single
day so now you can select any album that
you've ever created or that was shared
with you and we're introducing a new
feature called live albums with live
albums you can just select the photos of
people that you want to see and what we
will automatically do is create a new
album with all the photos you've ever
taken of those people you your photos
also never get stale because live album
updates automatically every time you
take new pictures so it's been really
amazing every time I walk by Hub and see
a photo of my son or husband that I've
forgotten about it brings a smile to my
face and recently we came home from a
family vacation to show our photos
already displaying on hub hub also makes
a perfect hub also makes it easy to
share live albums with loved ones
so now my parents can see photos of my
son show up automatically in in their
home now you also might be wondering
what about that blurry picture I took
the other day will that show up on hub
as well the answer is no we use machine
learning to only show your best photos
on hub we automatically filter out
blurry photos underexposed photos those
random pictures of things likes receipts
and even duplicate photos now with
Google Home Hub you have a great way to
actually relive your favorite memories
so you can pre-order Google home hub on
the Google store today for a hundred and
forty nine dollars and it's also
available on October 22nd at retail
locations here in the US UK and
Australia
Google Home Hub is the perfect display
to help you manage your thoughtful home
and provide the help you need with the
glass check out this video thank you
alright alright as I mentioned earlier
Google's been obsessed with speed and
relevance of the search information we
can provide we built this incredible
search engine but back then browsers
were just too slow so then we built
Chrome a faster more secure browser but
users still had to use our fast browser
on their old slow pcs they took way too
long to start up they were a hassle to
keep secure and they just weren't
optimized for the web and app
experiences we use today and we knew
computing could be fundamentally better
so we developed Chrome OS to represent a
new vision for computing based on our
core tenets of speed simplicity and
security Chrome OS brings together the
best of Google search ai and apps and
services all in one place now your
Chromebook boots up in seconds not
minutes it lasts all day and it gets
better over time it keeps up with the
many aspects of your life because work
and play are fluid throughout the day
and that's why millions of people have
used these devices in schools homes and
businesses worldwide last year Chrome OS
took a big step forward with the
introduction of apps from the Google
Play Store and also with the
introduction of helpfulness from the
Google assistant we tied this all
together with the launch of pixel book
the high-performance Chromebook pixel
book reviews from both the press and
customers have been fantastic people
especially loved it's beautiful
versatile design and it's blazing fast
speed and today we're sharing a new
chapter for our vision for Chrome OS
with the launch of Google pixel slate
here's Tron to tell you a little bit
more about it
thanks Rick Google pixel slate is a
completely new experience giving you
powerful productivity in a fresh mobile
form something that isn't a laptop
trying to be a tablet because who wants
a fan of their tablet or a tablet that's
really a phone pretending to be a
computer instead we combine the helpful
elements of all of these devices to
create a modern computing experience
people have been asking for we design
pixel slate to be both thin and light
it's crafted with beautiful lines and
rounded edges in a stylish midnight blue
it has a perfectly balanced center of
gravity so it's incredibly comfortable
to hold pixel slate is engineered with a
stunning detailed display so sitting
back to enjoy a movie is better than
ever
it has 293 pixels per inch that's 6
million pixels for the sharpest picture
in the category when we put pixel slate
in the hands of some of our most
demanding YouTube creators filmmakers
who make movies in 8k they raved about
this display let's take a look at how do
they reacted to seeing their content on
pixel slate for the first time we're
looking for something that draws us in
personally that excites us as a creator
I spend a lot of time trying to just
looks the best it can be to see the
pixel slave representing that correctly
it's really awesome
it's like you're taking the glass out of
the window
that's exactly how it's supposed to look
to get to this level of quality pixel
slate uses a custom display with
low-temperature polycrystalline silicon
technology which allows for a hundred
times faster movement of electrons
versus a standard display as a result
you can efficiently light up a massive
number of pixels your movies photos and
games will be stunning in vibrant colors
and brilliant resolution now a brilliant
display doesn't mean much without great
sound so with pixel slate we've
positioned the speakers on the front of
the device so they can direct stereo
sound towards you instead of out towards
the walls or the floor they deliver
surprisingly big sound
things we've also tune our audio
algorithms with a custom design profile
that gives you crisp highs and clear
loads this combination of an amazing
display and dual front firing speakers
gives you the best entertainment
experience you can hold in your hands
it's also a great device for cord
cutters and nothing brings us to life
better than YouTube TV we're excited to
give you three months of YouTube TV with
the purchase of a new pixel slate or
pixel book so you get live TV for more
than 60 networks including sports and
local news now you heard red talked
earlier about our deep history and
imaging and computational photography
we're bringing some of that same
innovative engineering to pixel slates 8
megapixel front-facing and rear-facing
cameras both cameras incorporate our
machine learning algorithms so you can
take great photos including portrait
mode we've also designed the
front-facing camera to be perfect for
video chat it has a wide-angle lens so
you can fit everyone in the frame in a
sensor with larger pixels which allows
for excellent low-light performance
pixel slate represents a new chapter for
Chrome OS let me show you how we've
reimagined it for this new type of
device the UI is now optimized to be
simple and easy to use on a touchscreen
it's a Chrome OS experience that's meant
to be held in your hands and at the same
time it gives you a full desktop
experience not one designed for a phone
you can work the way that you're used to
working you can even run developer tools
and full powered Linux applications
check out the reconfigured launcher
instead of hunting for the app you need
machine learning customizes the launcher
just for you suggesting the apps that
you're most likely looking for it's your
own personal Google right at your
fingertips you can easily multitask with
features like split-screen which lets
you seamlessly shift between work and
play and now with pixel slate the Google
assistant is even more deeply integrated
within Chrome OS simply use your voice

all of these amazing new experiences on
Chrome OS truly make pixel slate a
perfect device for play and work but a
true desktop experience demands a great
keyboard so we created the pixel slate
keyboard the perfect companion to pixel
slate the keyboard connects to pixel
slate in a snap no pairing or charging
needed just connect it and start typing
I love the way that pixels like keyboard
feels last year TechCrunch said pixel
book has the most most satisfying
keyboard to type on I've ever
experienced so we took everything great
about that keyboard and put it in a
folio it's full size backlit keyboard is
incredibly comfortable to type on the
rounded hush keys are soft and quiet so
you won't be that person with a loud
clackety keyboard and the full-featured
trackpad works just like you're used to
the folio is infinitely adjustable so
you can comfortably use it at any angle
you'd like use it at your desk on a
plane or at your kitchen table and when
you're done with work it turns into a
slim protective case that you can take
anywhere whether you're using pixel
slate with or without the keyboard
there's a universe of apps to help you
do more G Suite is amazing on pixel
slate our powerful productivity tools
are used by more than a billion people
worldwide and people spend an incredible
seventy-four percent of their time in
these apps working together with Docs
sheets and slides you can collaborate
and create like never before because of
slate also uses the full desktop Chrome
browser so you'll never be limited by
the mobile version of a site and you can
take complete advantage of the rich
ecosystem of extensions and open as many
tabs as you need to get work done there
are also millions of apps in the Google
Play Store from productivity to fitness
to games and entertainment we're
continuing to work closely with Adobe
and are pleased to launch the all-new
Adobe Acrobat on pixel slate it's a
great example of how developers are
optimizing their apps for Chrome OS it
lets you edit PDFs with precision
quickly fill out forms and sign in
annotate documents using the pixel book
pen we also have new apps launching
focus on helping you stay healthy one
that I'm really excited about is peloton
because I'll let me keep up keep up with
my workout even when I'm away from my
bike and when it's time to relax enjoy
your favorite shows on Netflix or
experience millions of
worlds with roblox so that's pixel slate
powered by the reimagined Chrome OS it's
designed to be as versatile as you are
with a desktop operating system a full
keyboard and trackpad a brilliant
display and the mobility and app support
of a tablet pixel slate comes in several
configurations starting at 599 pixel
slate keyboard is $1.99 and picks a book
pen now in matching midnight blue is $99
all three will be available later this
year on the Google store and at major
retailers in the US Canada and the UK
pixel slate is truly in no compromised
way to work and play let's take one
final look at it before I go
finally it's time to talk about phones
Google pixel three is designed from the
inside out to be the smartest most
useful device in your life it's a phone
that can answer itself a camera that
won't miss a shot and there's a whole
new experience when it's charging pixel
three was built with exceptionally
beautiful and thoughtful design choices
it feels great to the touch and light in
your hand the matte finish on the all
glass back is the first of its kind it
carries over our iconic two-tone design
while providing a beautiful silky
texture that helps avoid fingerprints we
developed a new etching process that
allows for both matte and glossy
textures on the same piece of curved
glass with smooth lines and seamless
transitions pixel three comes in three
colors just black clearly white and a
new color which is not pink the new pick
flow comes in two display sizes the five
and a half inch pixel three and the six
point three inch thick so three XL both
of them share the same features but we
know users who want a bigger phone
really want a bigger screen so we've
designed pixel three excels screen to
extend all the way to the upper corners
giving users an edge-to-edge viewing
experience with some extra extra useful
space at the top the flexible OLED is
the best pixel display ever the new
adaptive color profile provides a bright
vibrant viewing experience from any
angle and in any lighting both phones
have bigger screens than last year's
pixel and a larger screens of body ratio
they feel smaller and more comfortable
to hold our front firing stereo speakers
are 40% louder and richer than last year
perfect for a video call or for playing
music by the pool the custom sound
profile was developed for pixel three by
a Grammy winning music producer for
stunning volume and clarity to get the
most out of this incredible audio
experience pixel three is the first
phone that ships with a new youtube
music streaming experience and we're
giving it the pixel pixel owners on us
four
six months between the design the
display and the powerful speakers you'll
love how pixel free looks and sounds
everyone raves about the pixel camera
and today the smartest camera gets even
better with the pixel 3 it's so good
even professional photographers are
shooting with it we're excited to
announce a new partnership with one of
the most celebrated photographers of our
time Annie Leibovitz
for her latest project she's using pixel
3 to take photos as she travels around
the country capturing portraits of
inspiring people and places it's the
first time that Annie has officially
partnered with any camera and we can't
wait to unveil the series and Annie is
not the only professional choosing our
camera a few weeks ago we gave our
camera we gave the pixel three to conde
nast
and some of the world's top
photographers to shoot 7 magazine covers
let's take a look behind the scenes
this is the first time that Conde Nast
has used a smartphone to sheet ælis
talent for Megazine covers like glamour
W and GQ these photos are amazing they
belong on magazine covers and arrive on
newsstands starting this week now it's
no accident that pixels camera is ahead
of the curve it's a true end-to-end
combination of our AI software and
hardware we're building on Google's deep
expertise in computational photography
perhaps the most obvious way it comes to
life is with HDR plus when we introduce
zero shutter lag hdr+ in the first pixel
it blew away traditional HDR methods and
we're still the only ones to use this
method when you press the shutter pixel
captures a burst of short several short
exposures we combine the images
algorithmically to create an image that
is brighter more detailed and more
colorful
this technology is generations ahead of
other smartphones and all this is
happening on device pixel visual core is
our custom-designed imaging chip that
takes complex imaging and data crunching
power out of our data centers and puts
it on your phone we built pixel visual
core into pixel 3 making the camera even
faster and smarter to power new
computationally intensive features no
matter how great your camera is at
capturing the finest details and
reproducing the the colors you can still
miss the perfect shot if you don't hit
the shutter at exactly the right moment
top shot solves that problem let's check
it out
let me try
very
pixal serese camera is smart enough to
know a good photo when it sees it our
machine learning is trained by analyzing
millions of images so knows you want to
see smiles instead of sneezes photos
where everyone in the group has their
eyes open and the perfect moment of
shock at a surprise party top shot Auto
quickly madly captures alternate shots
in hdr+
so your timing wasn't perfect it will
suggest a better one you can also scroll
through the alternate and save one of
those instead and then their super
resume anyone who's tried to take a
photo at a concert notice that phone
cameras have terrible zoom instead of
shooting a grainy photo pixel three
shoots the burst of photos each a bit
different taking advantage of the
natural tiny movements of your hand you
can guess what happens next
you run the variations through a merging
algorithm to create a beautiful zoomed
in shot so you can get closer to the
details and frame your shot the way you
want this technique of merging slightly
different photos for higher resolution
has been used in advanced astronomy
research to surface the image of Mars
damaged the surface of Mars pixel 3 puts
this technology into a device you can
hold in your hand another feature that
we're really excited about is night
sight life's best moments aren't always
perfectly lit a party a campfire with
your friends one last shot before the
bar closes the typical solution for low
light settings is the flash which makes
a big scene blinds your friends and
leaves you with an unnatural looking
photo with uneven exposures and shadows
knife sight works so well you'll never
use your Flash again let's take a look
an extreme low light returns machine
learning to choose the right colors
based on the content of the image these
shots are completely untouched night
sight makes pixel the best low-light
smartphone camera it's coming next month
to pick so three and our other pixels as
well you might have noticed the second
camera on the front of the phone let's
see what it does
boys gonna back up just a little bit
back up back up back up stay in the
plane well just stay in the frame guess
where I am
you're armed we're not going to fit
you're not gonna both fit just move
could you uh scooch in I'm trying to
take a selfie wait one sec all right
three two one
pixal users tend to get drafted as the
official photographer including four
group selfies and we want to help them
be great at their job so we added a
second camera on the front that captures
a hundred and eighty four percent more
of the scene than iPhone 10s now you can
fit everyone in the shot without a
selfie stick or unusually long arms like
mine just zoom out the difference is
striking you aren't just getting more
people in the frame you're getting more
details more scenery more of a story for
photos and selfies with even more story
we've got you covered we've evolved AR
stickers to what we now call playground
and bolt it into both the front and rear
cameras we've got lots of new content
and characters including the Avengers in
celebration of Marvel Studios ten-year
anniversary
these characters are rendered to feel
lifelike in the scene and they even
interact with each other characters can
now also respond to your actions and
facial expressions they look like
they're really in the scene with you
for even more playful federal photos and
videos and here's a sneak peek at the
childish gambino character we're working
on with Donald Glover
coming soon to playground and
exclusively to pixel sorry you got a
little excited there playground is
launching on pixel 3 and will be rolled
out to pixel 1 &amp;amp; 2 soon with more
content on the way and of course pixel
face camera is for so much more than
taking pictures last year we introduced
google lens which helps which helps you
do more with your camera with what you
see this year we integrated google lens
directly into the pixel 3 camera pointed
at a takeout menu and lens we'll pull
out the phone number to call point at a
movie poster to click through to the URL
lens is now able to work instantly in
the camera and on device for some of the
most common actions even without a data
connection this is only possible by
combining pixel visual core with our
years of work in search and computer
vision being able to search the world
around you is the max logical step and
organizing the world's information and
making it more useful for people and
we've been doing that in some fun new
ways like we science I'll search and
lens so now when you're where your
friends wearing a cool new pair of
sunglasses or you see some shoes you
like in a magazine you can use lens to
find them online and browse similar
styles it's one more way we're
integrating our AI software and hardware
to create the best end and camera
experience there are a lot of brilliant
new superpowers coming in pixel threes
camera
but we didn't have time to get through
them all I'm sure you don't want to sit
through a two-hour keynote so here's a
quick list of some of the other features
you'll see in our demo area later photo
booth mode automatically snaps photos
with a smile or when you make a funny
face
no shutter button needed with motion
autofocus just tap on people puppies or
anything else that won't hold still and
they'll stay in focus as they move
around the frame we made a few
enhancements to the portrait mode you
can edit the depth of field in a
portrait you can also change the focal
subject of the photo or make the color
pop and one of the best aspects of pixel
3 it's free unlimited storage at
original quality you'll never have to
worry about storing syncing or finding
your photos pixel 3s camera is the best
end-to-end photography experience ever
on a smartphone we can't wait for you to
try it so what about when you're not
taking photos
we designed pixel 3 to take things off
your plate so you can spend more time
enjoying the moment and looking at the
world settle looking at your phone as
Rick mentioned earlier our new Google
assistant feature powered by duplex
technology is able to help users with
real-world tasks over the phone like
calling a restaurant to book a table
pixel phones will be the first to get
this Google assistant feature when it
rolls out city by city this month next
month one of these months next month so
stay tuned for details
and we're going even further to help you
with phone calls with our new call
screen feature let's say you're at
dinner with runs or in a meeting at work
and a call comes in
it could be something important or it
could be an offer for a free cruise when
you get that call and you can't or don't
want to pick up just tap the screen call
button and your phone will answer for
you and ask who's calling and why as you
can see here the trip conversation is
transcribed in real-time on your screen
you can decide whether to pick up Sena
quick reply or mark the cost BAM you'll
never have to talk to another
telemarketer
this all happens on device powered by
Google's AI call screen launches today
with pixel 3 in the US and comes to the
entire pixel family next month and we
all know what it's like to be
overwhelmed by notifications sometimes
you just want to disconnect entirely so
we've developed a feature we call flip
to shush an easy gesture to minimize
distractions just turn your phone upside
down on the table your pixel will take
the hint and mute sounds and
notifications so you can have a quiet
dinner with friends or spend some time
with your family
and finally pixel 3 includes our new
Titan security chip as Rick said earlier
Titan is a big step forward and how we
safeguard our users data with on device
protection for login credentials disk
encryption app data and the integrity of
the operating system we have one last
thing to show you what if your phone
could provide a totally different
experience when it's charging we're
excited to introduce the smartest
wireless charger ever the new pixel
stands as a wireless charger pixel
stannis best-in-class it charges your
pixel 3 superfast even through cases but
pixel sent isn't just a charger it
changes the way you interact with your
phone thanks to the Google assistant
when you dock your phone the UI adjusts
to be easily glanceable from across the
room you can control it with your voice
or the one touch of suggestions on the
display in the morning your pixel 3 is a
more thoughtful alarm clock the screen
was slowly brain before your alarm goes
off so you can wake up more gently and
with help from the assistant and knows
your morning routine the weather and can
easily answer your questions similar to
Google home play your music on pixels
and cry incredible front firing stereo
speakers and the cover art is displayed
on the screen pixel stand also turns
your pixel 3 into a helpful component of
your thoughtful home you can easily
control your connected devices around
the house and with mest hello you can
see who's at the door on your

helpful assistant even when it's
charging before it comes back up enjoy
this short film shot entirely on pixel 3
by the amazing Terrence Malick
is strong
Oh
so there they are
the newest members of this year's made
by Google family we're taking an
end-to-end approach to consumer
technology that merges our most
innovative AI with intuitive software
and powerful hardware made by Google
devices empower people to do more with
their day so they have to do less with
their tack and they can focus on what
matters most we've designed them from
the inside out to give you your own
personal Google anticipating your needs
taking things off your plate you got a
first look at tightened security and how
its integrated into our mobile hardware
for powerful protection in a simplified
experience and you've also seen how our
approach to digital well-being is woven
throughout the whole portfolio from call
screen to flip to shush ambient EQ and
family link we're taking our users
well-being very seriously with pixel
slate we've built a Chrome OS device for
the way you work and play today it's a
powerful workstation at the office and
it's a home theater you can hold in your
hands with pixel three we've built the
first phone that can answer the phone
and we've also taken the world's best
smartphone camera and made it even
better with Google Home Hub we've built
a radically helpful smart display which
lays the foundation for the truly
thoughtful home there's a whole lot more
to these devices and we're really
excited for you to see that for
yourselves in our demo area downstairs
for those of you on the live stream
please stick around to see our products
and more in depth demos online and also
head over to our fresh new online store
at this address behind me for full
details pricing and availability really
appreciate you being here with us today
thank you very much
have a great day
here's some recipe
welcome back to our 15 of CNN's live
coverage of Google's pixel event has it
been that long
it's been that long you just fell asleep
you didn't realize how long they were
talking about everything we hope you
enjoyed the livestream which was billed
with yes a lot of the stuff we already
knew that was going to happen but to
your point bed thank you to your very
clear lucid and on the money point they
were able to keep it fresh and somewhat
maybe surprising is being generous but
compelling details about the hardware we
already knew so real quick off the bat
we did know everything that was going to
happen but they didn't talk about a new
chromecast which maybe it was just too
small but upgrade maybe maybe they had
to go but any exists right nevertheless
you know obviously the big story here
are the new pixel phones and while we
knew all about the specs and whatnot
I think what's surprising and kind of
cool is some of the software features
that are coming there's top shot which
sort of uses AI to do like a cluster
shot of all these different so you don't
get that like derpy face right so which
was I really loved how they introduced
that they had a gallery of derp faces
which I mean any press conference that
features that as a win in my book so
they had that and then they were gonna
use AI to determine which is the best
looking photograph to to sort of suggest
to you I thought that was cool super
resume which is something I can
personally relate to if I met up you
know a hockey game or a concert and
you're trying to trying to zoom in and
you take the thing and it just looks
like mish-mosh hopefully that's going to
be a little bit better and man they were
talking some smack about this Knight
site stuff where where they're saying
that the the iPhone 10s can't even hold
a candle to what no pun intended to what
the lighting yeah to what the pixel
three can do in low-light situations so
I mean that was kind of cool flipped to
shush
seems simple I feel like my father he
does that I just know like this and it
leaves me alone so yeah I don't know the
screening call stuff that was really I
was waiting for you to mention that Rudy
would you give you that well when people
constantly talk it well when these tech
companies constantly talk about the idea
that you know we're addicted to our
phones we're gonna give you all these
additional tools and tell you when
you've used your app for too long one of
the ways that you fall into the phone in
the first place is is that somebody
beeps or buzzes you or whatever so I
like this idea of screening calls ahead
of time even if you're in a meeting or
you know you're doing something else
kind of makes it more kind of a digital
personal secretary I would think I like
that feature a lot I was I was on the
Lummi see how they're gonna do this
after the duplex right and when you hit
the please screen it then it says
something on the behalf of what this is
Google's you know service that is
screening or call go ahead and say your
name and why you're calling so at least
then if you did suspect it was kind of
shady you can right there in real time
see and I like that I mean I'm
interested to see how it sounds on the
other side yeah and like what if it's
it's it's kind of like a different way
of going new phone who's this bro Jeff
pick up twenty is like a lot of the
times that I would probably use this is
when I'm getting a call that I don't
recognize and the pics already has a
thing where it's like this is probably
spam don't pick it up but now I could be
like all right hive robot talk to my
robot and now we're just gonna have
robots talk and no no I was the until
you actually do accidentally do it to a
friend and they're like oh you didn't
save my number you don't know who I am
I've been googled yeah but then you see
that playing out of real time you're
like oh oh my god it's Bridget I'm sorry
Bridget I'm sorry you know it's worth
mentioning though with Robo callers even
having your robot Google answer the
phone will compel them to call you more
so you do have to be a little bit
careful how do you do that
I thought I thought there is some what
is appears to that that lot that if you
do pick up the call any indication
whatsoever yeah I just pick it up and I
curse for 14 seconds at it and I hope
that you're saying that bad yes anything
difference but it definitely gives the
other side an indication that this
number does engage what maybe doesn't
make a big difference but it does put
you on a list that's all moving Dickens
they are alive and they're at that
number like there's a pulse at the end
of this phone okay all right well it
sucks for me um alright so what else did
we hear about we heard about let's talk
about this slate the pixel slate and
again we're gonna try and get in touch
with scott stein who's at the pixel
event right now depending on what he's
up to but back to the pixel slate the
top the tablet the first Chrome OS
tablet what do you guys think I was I
was on board until they said how much it
was I was like it's is really getting
into that yeah surface territory with
$600 right want the keyboard another 200
205 another hundred it works I it is it
is a watch so if you want everything
that you saw there you're looking at 800
Melissa most are doing our work on the
web anyways though so it had a lot of
great features I want to see how that
keyboard feels yeah I think that's your
that's your deciding factor I have to go
to a store and feel it um you know for
me it's like all right they they are
making the pitch for this to be at
laptop a laptop replacement that's fine
is it as versatile that Chrome OS
ecosystem I'm not very fluent in it I
don't know what's there I mean I think
if you were to somehow chart the amount
of time you spend on your laptop using
what I think you'd find that a lot of
that stuff does fall into the Chrome OS
is functionality it's sort of cameras on
it yes about right but who's this guy
it's not like who does this oh let's get
out of here right
who takes photos with tablets your
grandmother students know crazy people
do
you see at the baseball game they're
just like what are you doing stop it you
have a phone anyway sorry I just you
know I want to know what is going to
compel me to ditch something like this
in favor of a that chromeless tablet
maybe it's the battery life 10 hours
it's not not different than what I got
yeah I mean that's better than this
thing so you know I'm hearing right now
that Scott Stein is being beamed into
the studio over the Internet hi Scott
Stein hello be an Internet what's the
internet like there it's very connected
I'm here demo room right after the
Google event we're in the pixel slate
pixel 3 pixel 3 X out Google Home Hub
they're all over having me I haven't
touched them yet looking forward to
doing that if you want to try and touch
one law we got you on the line that
would be hot but I want to get your
instant reaction from the from the
announcements at the event for a show
that had no surprises I think this kind
of was you know they did the best with
what they could with with all that
software stuff about the pixels
specifically what did you think how did
you how did you find the show yeah I
mean I thought yet you know there
weren't that many surprises but it has
been happy with product snail I think
the prices grow a lot more aggressive
than I thought I mean the home hub is
basically you're like you know I don't
know what to get for the holidays maybe
I'll get at that type of thing and the
slate which is right over here actually
people are using it but I really love
the keyboard but from what it sounds
like on that the adjustability in the
back of the thing I need you know love
to see how it feels
it's price very much like an iPad pro in
terms of what you be paying and yeah the
photo features on pixel 3 sound like the
exact ones that I would be looking for -
the fact that there's no no dual rear
camera is that ok
I mean pixel two did fine without it the
wide-angle selfie is pretty cool I mean
for the fact that I had not I'm not a
huge I am a big selfie taker but I mean
like that's that's really nice the the
no flash at all with that they're
climbing with with night mode is really
interesting and so yeah I think those
photo features sound really really
promise it that 149 price point for the
hub was what gave us our really like oh
my god reaction like they are
undercutting the echo show substantially
and that go shows two hundred and thirty
dollars I mean you know it's not even
yeah you know it's not even close and in
terms of functionality I mean I think
you know it's tough to make the case
that you're better off getting an echo
show unless you are somehow so ingrained
in the Alexa universe that you have to
have it are you able to have you been
able to check that out or have you seen
it from across the room I kind of want
to get a feel for what that screen
quality is like I do to know I haven't
looked at it in person you know the
products just started rising up right in
front of me when they announced them I
was sitting right in front of the like
demo tube where they all rose up and I
tried to get near the the J stuff back
down away from me so yeah that is a
YouTube box and photo frame that's
basically look that would be enough for
a lot of people yeah I think like the
the selling points are are easy to make
for that one um were you surprising and
do anything with the chromecast I was
pretty surprised I thought I would hear
something about that I guess at this
point they kind of like already
basically announced it and it's just
going to slip out there there was like a
Bluetooth update to chromecast that
seemed like it it just kind of slowly
emerge so yeah I guess I'm kind of
surprised it seems like this whole thing
was just about lots of screens
everywhere yeah byte digital well being
your whole home is going to be filled
with screens so you're the right person
to ask about this you go to the Apple
events and now you go
the Android events and I well I'm
curious you know when you look at the
pixel three and then you look at what
Apple did with the iPhone then you know
the 10s antennae s-max
which which which presentation left you
with more of a compelling kind of reason
to own either product I think in terms
of software Google's made more of an
impression I think that they always talk
about the software hardware dovetailing
and I think there are new ideas coming
forward with crazy hot erwin mr.
excreting phone calls and the indian
happy ways that assistant keeps stepping
forward he's in some of the stuff with
AR and lens even though some of those
may not be used they're pushing towards
new ideas whereas I think Apple is
refining its hardware and and even
though iOS keeps making advances there
really hasn't been that all that much
with iOS that's really been new and
different so I think that's the big
difference and then it's even like down
to camera styles like I feel like Apple
has been talking about things like
camera sensor but you know the ISP Apple
and Google is talking about how their
algorithms in computer vision equations
are changing so they said ok well you
know we're learning how to how to take
photos better so it does seem like some
of those modes that they're promising
are things that should be on other
phones I mean things like the you know
the smart assistant to take better
photos the ability to pluck out photo
you know Apple doesn't have anything
like that built-in and so I think that's
a really useful feature but it would be
nice to have a second camera on the back
of the pixel 3 I think why it's a zoom
in better although here's the thing if
Google's intelligent in you know it's a
I assisted zoom really works maybe
they're making the same statement they
made last year with you know being able
to do portrait mode without a second
lens right say
they you only need one camera and the
rest of it is gimmicks so interesting
yeah a lot to see I mean I think that
could very well be the case I just think
it's nice to zoom in on things to get
closer I don't really need it but I find
that I use it yeah most most regular
people though don't really care I think
it most people don't have multiple
cameras on their phones so I do feel
like Google is maybe acknowledging that
and just say the most important thing
for Google and Android is to figure out
how to take better photos via software
all right we're gonna let you go we're
let or one last thing I need to know
what you think about this controversial
mega notch on the pixel three XL I'm
fine with it I don't know I'm not
spurned down like I hated the notch last
year yeah everybody started making the
damn notch and now whatever like we're
in notch land right so it's fine
it is what I mean I think people are
going out of their way to put notches on
things now yeah it's I've seen worse you
seen you see worse notches that's where
we've gotten to we're living in a post
notch world I get it thank you so very
much
Scott Stein you've been very helpful let
let us get you to go playing with all
that stuff and bringing them back so I
can play with them thank you very much i
i i really like some of the points that
scott me because i was thinking the same
thing we were talking during the
presentation about how we use apple
sorry we use Google Apps cuz I have an
iPhone but I'm I love Google photos I
love the software that they work on
their maps and such and here this
presentation kind of feels more like
about oh you you want our phone here's
how it works with your daily life and
here's your family and we're picking the
good photos it's not so much about like
look at that the new hardware that's
inside it's about what you can do it
it's about living with it and oh yeah
that hub now we have a photo frame now
too so it's really family life oriented
it's super interesting how Apple doesn't
and again not to make this just about
Apple versus Google but that's a
conversation that matters and Amazon
versus Google and vice versa also
matters as well but it's interesting to
notice and again like there's no watch
here right like where so you could make
the same argument well there's no watch
talk because Google doesn't really have
a flagship watch but at the same time in
terms of like the centralized assistant
hub you know kind of brain that they're
going for Apple really doesn't have an
answer to that I think you could call
Siri a distant third place when it comes
to voice assistance so it's just kind of
interesting to see all the whole that
shakes out what do you think Ben I think
that they marketed this very well I
agree with everything you said Bridget
but at the same time I was kind of left
feeling with the Apple event and also
this event that both of these phones
from a hardware perspective were very
incremental and yet like apples entire
event was like I'm not even sure what
remember what the big toy was about yeah
you know there was no what was the 10
yeah there wasn't a talking the big
thing was the 10 and the 10s was like
what was the takeaway I generally can't
remember it's because there wasn't one
really you know they were like we made
everything a little bit better so
something here maybe there's more
software bells and whistles so so that
kind of goes to Bridget's point in that
okay we're struggling to try to figure
out how to make this Hardware a markedly
different or much better right so we're
gonna try to tell you here's where it
fits into your life here's how you can
kind of use it and make your life a
little bit easier and I think Google's
selling the this stuff was a little bit
better than our software is going to
older pixel phones too which makes you
fall more in love with what Google is
doing for its quest I mean that brand
definitely has this club kind of feel to
it I mean you know you look at the
starting prices it's very competitive
the pixel starts at what is it $7.99 for
the six about 800 yeah right you know
and then goes up from there and I stand
eighty not a hundred or
this might be a little but it's wireless
charging that doesn't come for free you
guys you know what I liked another thing
but a photo feature we're talking about
sure autofocus to follow around a dog or
a kid as the rigging around a lot of
that matters more to people than having
a second camera because it's just about
I don't care to maybe change my settings
I just want that shot and when they
showed all them like mistake face
captures you can also pick you know
which one you like I mean that's that's
really important I think I think Apple
is and all the manufacturers that put
two lenses in the back of their phones I
think they're having a tough time
explaining why that is better you can do
the blur background in the goob yes all
they're like how is it if you was more
than one I feel like is the biggest
talking there's there's still two
cameras there's two cameras in them yes
for the wide-angle
so it's a whole different twist is
something that really says which is
which is it's creating a genuinely
practical application and use of that so
that's why you got that big honkin notch
it's for your your wide-angle group
selfie yeah
if Google felt like it was really
important to add the second camera and
they would have done it by now this is
we're now onto the third generation this
is a hair time this is a very typical
thing that they have in a lot of
flagship phones so they must feel really
confident with where they are and
they're not worried that people aren't
gonna buy this thing because they've
only got one camera in the back right um
what do you think was a letdown about
this show is there anything that they
came up a little short on you know
they've always had competitive prices
but I did wish the slate I wish that was
cheaper because but they did seem to
introduce aggressive pricing structures
for all of these products were except
for the slate which kind of feels like
this expensive thing that I probably
don't need we're at a time where there
have to give a new reason to buy a
tablet and so that's high-end tablets
whether it's the surface or the pro for
the iPad it's
about having that flexibility of okay I
can have it I can have a keyboard there
but right I want to see a test between
how these keyboards feel sure Ben
where'd they come up short I'm still a
little surprised that they didn't
include a camera in the home hub I
almost feel like it's an admission from
a major tech company should have a
camera but you could always put tape on
it you could always do whatever if you
want other things listening to you arias
but the whole idea is to keep this thing
in a room static and just kind of like I
would do a duo boys boys call hundred
percent my purse i reading on it wise
hook guys we know you don't trust us and
we don't trust it you don't trust this
to the point where you even take out a
piece of hardware you know like we're
not even gonna do the little physical
shudder anymore we're just gonna get rid
of it because people kind of think this
is creepy or there are a lot of privacy
issue I don't think it needs it but to
me it's just like put it in there maybe
it's your proof it's not a 149 product
then what do we it's it's you future
proof the product by making sure that
you write exactly because a lot of the
improvements come from software so who's
to say if there's gonna be a killer app
that comes along a year or two from now
but it eases the camera I wouldn't put
it in every room then I put it in the
kitchen only if I had a camera I
wouldn't put it in a bedroom like I said
so yeah um I really was okay something
else that Google does well their design
it's true they did talk about that but
man they do have pretty products and I
I'm a little bit of a sucker for that
pink and mint although is the phone
called not pink is it actually like
that's the name like I'm got that
Horrell that it's a coral it's a sermon
if the official name is not pink that's
a turnip I don't know I could just do
you like that becoming a little confused
yeah like what color do you want it's a
very pale pink sure we just something
you don't want people what color would
you like
I'm not pink coming back when when I
checked out the Google home speaker they
tried some of these demos at a press
event where they
would be like oh look you can get
cooking instructions just by talking to
the speaker next step next step and it
there were times where it didn't exactly
always go perfectly but if you had a
screen I can see that you know I went
into this going I don't want another
screen I don't want this home hub too
many screens in your life and then I'm
like it's not a bad price and it's no
camera so I kind of was won over a
little bit it's something about it they
did make a compelling case but the
cooking stuff it just seems that like if
you don't have a clock in a room spend
another hundred dollars and have like a
super capable type functioning thing I
think I know what's going on oh you want
to have a touchscreen voice assistant
because they think that okay if it's
always on and there's always a display
available we're gonna really push
forward the concept of voice shopping so
you're like oh I need to get milk or oh
I need to buy new socks or whatever
you're gonna use this thing and shop
through Amazon or Google or whatever
that's why I think they're really trying
to push this concept yeah the and I
think smart is smart assistant plus a
touch screen and I think been pushing it
a lot and I think they are more in a
better place to do it positionally
speaking because it all comes back to
your email like because how Google
because your email is like the central
Nexus of your like yeah entire in and
out life right like everything comes in
through that gmail account so and they
base a lot of their smart assistant
stuff off of things that come into your
inbox that you're going flying they
happen book so where Amazon has the leg
up in terms of like what you like to
shop for and what you like to browse for
Google is still in that intermediary
because they're gonna get the email from
Amazon that says your crap is shipped
you know be like this is like they are
very smart
yeah they are a very good strategic
geographical if you if that makes sense
in how I'm trying to explain the
situation so they did something
interesting that will play out this
holiday for gift buying they brought
back the electronic photo frame by
automatically it's a side feature no
that is gonna be like for some people
getting there
parents into automatically you could see
everything in my shared Google photos
from our family trip oh man they just
made it easy and then oh yeah by the way
you can also do other things too mom and
those oh it was a nice dig Amazon to
that they said it's optimized for
YouTube because you know now you have to
do this we're kind of like janky
workaround with a browser are using it
for the echo show so I don't you'd soon
necessary Anna but I can get it for an
instructional video I know I know it's
useful it's another reason to buy the
product and when it's a little bit
harder it's just a little bit more
friction to do it on an echo show
there's another reason for this is
centered around shopping Google is
trying to be centered around like your
life and for the most part for me
personally I find that working like we
said mote you have Google Apps on your
iPhone you don't have Apple apps on your
Google phone I know so I am all about
Google inside of this iPhone totally
totally so it's living a lot so you know
that's really kind of impressive to me
like I think for me personally and
getting real granular here because I am
very much ingrained that you could
system I don't love the way they do
reminders and tasks and stuff I still
want that to be more flexible and
malleable to what I personally use it
for but I think with this ecosystem
they're going we'll get there
let's turn to Twitter real quick one
more time before we have to say goodbye
because we've got lives to lead let's
see Ricardo says what model is the best
option pixel cannon pistol 3xl thinking
of getting project 5 what do you have
any experience of project 5b or 5 I
would say 5 no I have no experience with
that I'm very curious about Google 5 I
have so James Martin one of our staff
photographers he uses it we were
travelling in Greece for an assignment
now that's in Europe yes ok it is and it
was piece of cake yeah just got right
off of the airplane and Google sent him
a notification and said hey you're all
very reason
you're fine which is a huge advantage to
using it that you don't have to like all
of a sudden call Verizon or they're
going to start charging you $50 for
every megabyte or whatever alright so
you can endorse their global data plan
[Laughter]
ricardo asks which option is the best
you know i think between the pixel three
and three excel there doesn't seem to be
that much different a difference in
terms of specs and whatnot obviously the
screen size being the whole thing so
maybe that's a preferential kind of I
would agree you want the big you want
the big honkin screen or do you want a
notch list tinier screen that's really
where it's at for me personally I have
the Excel right now and I don't know if
I can go smaller than this so but I do
but I would like to see this
side-by-side with a three Excel and
hopefully I'll be doing that later today
all right what else we have on the
tweets anything compelling that's
jumping in not a lot of questions but
there was that moment when user is
talking about where there was a
presenter and it just kind of didn't do
the Google assistant demo quite right
and it just showed to me that yeah these
things aren't actual live demos these
are powerpoints online they are well
like it looked like the way he got ahead
of it or behind it or he was waiting for
it then it went too fast and so didn't
even hear him so you know these things
are kind of stuff sure you know it's
sure being presentation style yeah I
guess a little some of the smoke and
mirrors maybe you have to see behind the
the curtain a little bit we've seen a
lot of demos get screwed up on this
stage yeah well alright I think that's
all the time we have
Bridgette Ben thank you so much for
being here this was a lot of fun yeah
thank you would you want to do it again
maybe or sure sure yeah maybe when there
are more surprises okay it's time
hopefully next up maybe we don't have a
teal pixel next it'll be called not teal
yeah not aqua thank you so very much
keep it here cnet.com is gonna have all
the reviews of all the new products that
are announced today that we already knew
about and thank you so much for tuning
in live we'll see you next time
Android way mo YouTube you should be
watching
Alphabet City it's the show that covers
alphabet from A to Z what's alphabet you
ask let me google that for you
alphabet is mostly a collection of
companies the company would consist of
Google as well as other businesses
including X capital and GB I know it
sounds like a lot below explain it all
on Alphabet City
