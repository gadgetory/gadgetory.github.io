has it the show that rounds up the
week's biggest tech rumors and don't
forget that you can vote on what you
think about the rumors too in the
interactive player if you're watching on
cnet now first up Facebook held an event
last week where it surprised nobody by
announcing video capabilities in
Instagram so now you can take pictures
and videos of your food and your cats
and add all those hipstery filters
awesome what wasn't announced that the
event was Facebook's rumored answer to
Google Reader which is set to go dark on
July first according to The Wall Street
Journal Facebook is working on an RSS
reader of its own though and it's called
reader it would display content from
users and publishers in a new format
that's tailored for mobile devices the
project which has been in the works for
more than a year reportedly resembles
Flipboard the popular news reading app
that aggregates content from multiple
sources so first Facebook copies Twitter
now it's going to copy google reader and
Flipboard if tomorrow Facebook comes to
work dressed in a red wig and glasses
i'm going to call shanigan and my lawyer
next up the folks over at the blog
google operating system report that they
have obtained an image of a new service
that google is working on called google
mine not to be confused with minecraft
which is something completely different
the report says that mine would let
users organize the things that you own
use wish for and more like gadgets
clothing electronics DVDs cars bikes or
anything so it's like if your Amazon
wish list had a baby with Pinterest and
finally as you can imagine iphone rumors
are continuing to heat up as the
announcement day looms 9to5 mac is
reporting that the iphone 5s will have
an improved camera 12 megapixels with
improved low-light shooting the current
iPhone 5 has an 8-megapixel camera now I
know that megapixel specs don't
necessarily mean better images but it's
definitely something to consider suppose
it pictures of the rumored 5s of leaked
showing a bigger flash and improved
battery specs did those two things lead
you to believe that a megapixel boost is
on the way what do you guys think well a
significant boost in camera specs make
you buy the iphone 5s don't forget to
vote and leave a comment and we'll check
in with the cnet council the cnet
council is composed of five editors who
cast their votes anonymously their
opinions are not an endorsement by Cena
or CBS interactive obviously because
these are rumors folks and the cnet
councils verdict is yes three out of
five editors think that the camera in
the 5s will likely get a mega pixel
boost one editor said that Apple would
never tout it as having a ton of
megapixels and the upgrades would
improve more than just the image size
other improvements like a better sensor
would probably be a part of the update
that's our show everybody please share
