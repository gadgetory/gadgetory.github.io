devices but in the past year the company
has made a push into the activity
tracker market first there was the
vivofit activity tracker and then the
forerunner 15 a GPS running watch that
also included activity tracking and now
there's this I'm dan Graziano and I'm
here with the garmin vivosmart this
little device can track the steps you
take distance you travel calories you
burn and your sleep at night but that's
not it it can also display notifications
from your smart phone
there's Bluetooth so can connect to your
Android or iPhone it's even compatible
with wireless heart rate monitors and
it's waterproof up to five at meters
meaning you can wear it while swimming
or in the shower the design is thin
flexible and lightweight and most of the
time you actually forget you're wearing
it this secondary security slider that
Garmin calls a vivo keeper helps the
device Stan your wrist throughout the
day as the name implies the vivosmart
includes some smart features you can
control your music and view
notifications right on your wrist
unfortunately though you can't interact
with these notifications all of this
information is displayed on an invisible
OLED screen that appears after you
DoubleTap the front of the device the
screen can be a little difficult in some
environments and I found that the
DoubleTap action didn't always wake it
up you can however set it to
automatically wake up when you raise
your hand to your face one of the more
interesting smart features is a fine my
phone option as long as the vivosmart is
in range of your smart phone and of
course connected to it the band will
display a proximity bar that shows how
far you are from your phone at the same
time your phone will also ring and
vibrate make it easier to locate with
all of these features you would expect
battery life to take a major hit but
that's not the case
the vivosmart gets about seven days of
battery life which is pretty good
conserving everything it does the garmin
vivosmart is available now for more
information be sure to check out my full
review over at cnet.com I'm Dan Grazia
Pristina and that was a first look at
the garmin vivosmart</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
