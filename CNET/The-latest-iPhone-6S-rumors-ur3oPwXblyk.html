guide and welcome to the Apple by for
everything good and bad inside the
wonderful world of Apple now we showed
you the rumored casing of the apple
iphone 6s last week and this week
there's more after a purported schematic
of the phone from engadget japan sources
revealed a change in thickness 5.2
millimeters it's so subtle that current
cases are still expected to fit the
phone that might be the most amazing
news well until next year's iPhone now a
Wall Street Journal report says Apple is
requesting suppliers to produce a record
number of iPhones by the end of this
year somewhere around 90 million units
and betting that the new changes will
outperform the iphone 6 and 6 plus from
last year they still expect a new iphone
to feature the rumored force touch
screen and that's really believed to be
behind the slightly thicker design based
on the current leaks now 9to5 mac also
reports that in addition to force touch
and upgraded camera and the new Qualcomm
LTE chip we talked about last week the
next iPhone will most likely include NFC
hardware with fewer and more efficient
chips and a new flash memory that will
still remain at 16 gigs for the minimum
capacity now you can see the difference
here in this side-by-side comparison of
the logic boards for both phones that
nine if I Mac acquired and finally
bringing NFC to the iphone in I really
mean finally it dovetails nicely with
the latest finding from patently Apple
that reports the big a applied for a
patent for a method of transferring
money from one phone to the other now
the transaction would take place in the
wallet app the app previously known as
passbook and touch ID would be used to
authorize it so you know venmo is
looking over the shoulder right now like
say what and my friends in the UK Apple
pay is set to go live on July the 14th
and if you can use it you're going to
dig it all right Apple seated the third
beta for OS X El Capitan the Third Watch
OS to beta and the third release of iOS
9 s beta the iOS 9 release brings Apple
music to developers who are unable to
access it in previous betas it also
includes Apple's new news
up with a curated list of news based on
your interest but it's only for us
developers right now there's new
streamlined two-factor authentication
for security iPad app folders now
display apps four by four instead of the
previous three by three and you now have
dedicated photo albums for your selfies
and screenshots which is super important
now official versions of the operating
systems are coming this fall alright
let's follow up on some more stories
from Apple music I told you how I felt
about it last week and everything really
still holds true you all know how much I
disliked connect and a lot of the apple
byte nation reached out to tell me the
trick to get rid of it and replace it
with my playlist so I'm returning the
favor for those of you who don't know
yet so check this out jump into your
settings then go to general then
restrictions and if they're not turned
on you'll need to turn them on then look
for Apple music connect and turn it off
now when you go into Apple music the
connect icon will be replaced with your
playlist icon and the actual music
you've always wanted to listen to booya
and for those of you waiting for Home
Sharing to return to your iOS devices
for music listening since Apple squashed
it in iOS 8.4 Eddy Cue says it will be
returning in iOS 9 but having it
disappear without any explanation you
know that's getting a bad apple oh okay
and some fun stuff the guys from
everythingapplepro had nothing better to
do so they decided to see how many
iphones it takes to stop a russia ak-74
bullet now lots of fun I candy here and
the final results it takes five iphones
to stop a bullet but the fifth one was a
clone in not an official iphone so i
guess that means they're going to have
to just do this test all over again
except they decided to blow everything
else up with a shotgun and if that's not
absurd how about this one I'm a big NBA
fan you all know that well San Antonio
Spurs three-point specialist Matt Bonner
aka the red rocket told the Concord
Monitor that he believed the tennis
elbow he developed in his non shooting
arm was caused by the new iphone he said
it was way bigger than the last one and
I think because I got that new iphone it
was a strain to use it yeah
stretch further to hit the buttons and I
honestly think that's how I ended up
developing it seemed at if you've been
watching the apple pie from the start
you could have learned about double
tapping the home button unless you have
small hands but you're 610 so that can't
be it and really for all you big screen
phone fans somewhere Steve Jobs is
smiling and before we go we have to show
you some feedback of the week from alas
we show the rican kkkkkk cardo says LOL
my c reactivated when he said hey Siri
LOL use manasula called it the apple by
pride edition and kitchen cargo van said
weird intro alright that's going to do
it for this we show you can always email
us at the apple byte at cnet com or
tweet me at brian Tong thanks so much
