right now we're taking a first look at
the new motorola moto g for a
ridiculously low price of 179 the
unlocked moto g puts all the power of
android 4.3 jellybean right in your palm
but how good of a deal does the Moto G
add up to let's take a closer look the
first thing you'll notice about the Moto
G is its compact size in fact it shares
an almost identical footprint to
motorola's current flagship the Moto X
that makes the Moto G small enough to
operate in one hand it's quite a feat
considering the phone's large 4.5 inch
screen and despite its low price the
Moto G feels well built and like the
Moto X features a curved back that's
comfortable to hold above the display is
a 1.3 megapixel front facing camera and
notification light on the bottom edge is
a micro USB port to both charge the
device and connect it to pcs while the
left edge is bare the right side holds
tiny keys for power and volume up top is
the geez 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
around back you'll find the phone's five
megapixel camera and LED flash along
with a speaker that gets mighty loud I
also really like the circular dimple
under the flash which is positioned
right where your index finger naturally
falls the real allure of the Moto G is
its Android 4.3 jelly bean software
which while not Google's latest
iteration Android 4.4 KitKat natively
supports all of androids modern bells
and whistles this includes gmail google+
not to mention the vast library of apps
movies books and music in the Google
Play Store you also get Google now which
tries to provide timely personal alerts
for say how long your commute home will
take reminders and directions to your
next meeting and so on the Moto G
certainly has plenty of shortcomings
though first the phone uses a 1.2
gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon 400
processor which while not terribly slow
is by no means blazingly fast also the
Moto G comes standard with 8 gigabytes
of internal storage space
there's no expansion slot to add extra
you can buy a 16 gigabyte version of the
g which costs 199 I'm not a fan of the
stock back plate either which unlike the
Moto X smudges with fingerprints easily
I suggest springing for Motorola's
add-on back shelves which come in a
variety of colors plus resist finger
grease better the 5 megapixel camera
isn't particularly fast either and has a
low resolution sensor compared to the 8
and 13 megapixel imaging systems now
standard on high-end smartphones
additionally the Moto G is 3g only and
isn't capable of connecting to 4g LTE
networks for fast wireless data I'm

first look at the motorola moto g for
