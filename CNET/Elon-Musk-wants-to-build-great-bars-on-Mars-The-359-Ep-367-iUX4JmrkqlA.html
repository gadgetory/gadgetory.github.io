episode 367 of the 359 podcast I'm BVG
and your host today are Alfred a and
Roger Chang what's up guys how's your
weekend morning happy Monday
is it I came back from really warm and
sunny Mexico to do this sorry yeah sorry
you had to hang out in warm and sunny
Mexico you shouldn't be sorry that I
well we were without power should be
sorry that I had to come back to this
powerless hellscape no I had a good
weekend well things could be worse you
could be on Mars this is true where I
don't know if there are great bars and
Mars then so we'll get to all this I
will talk about Elon Musk and his
thoughts about Mars we'll talk about
security loopholes security
vulnerabilities of robots yep and lastly
we'll talk about ready player one it's
not out yet out at the end of this month
but Aaron Carson got a chance to check
it out South by Southwest gave her a
early review we'll talk about talking
about that and why Alfred hates ready
player one and why I'm actually pretty
excited it's a terrible book as always
if you have any questions in the
comments section Brian will pick out the
best and we will get to them in three
minutes and 59 seconds all right hang
out folks we'll record the audio podcast
and then you can join us back here from
a more artistically wonderful segways in
three minutes and 59 seconds from three
to welcome to the 359 I'm Roger Chang
I'm Alfred hang Elon must want to save
humanity by building bars on Mars
musk was at South by Southwest for an
impromptu chat with West world
showrunner Jonathan Nolan and talking
about his SpaceX initiative and his his
plans for Mars
he sort of hints at World War 3 and what
would happen if the world would
basically kill itself basically we want
he wants to have pockets of humanity in
outer space kind of keep humanity
because this is literally a Gundam plot
that says how Gundam starts you're right
it really is yeah but I mean I get what
he's like trying to do here I don't know
if we'll be seeing something like that
within our lifetime I know he has his
whole SpaceX program right as long as as
Mars program yeah I I don't I mean I'm
skeptical of it with I know it'll happen
at eventually out someday in the future
I don't know if ever happened and like
I'll be alive to see it it's it's
interesting that in the typical Elon
Musk way like he talked about all those
high tech stuff but then you know he
mentions how Mars will need to have
everything from iron foundries the pizza
joints and nightclubs and that Mars
should have really great bars he didn't
so that's actually a direct quote from
him like that's not Roger just like
paraphrase okay and that is Elon my
almost literally said of that and I mean
it's not wrong I feel like Mars should
have really great bars we should have
really great bars yeah let's have great
bars on earth first I feel like we
should get rid of all the terrible bars
on this planet I have great bars we live
in New York City we have many terrible
bars yes but we have really great bars
which I feel like we should solve
Earth's the bar problems before we look
at Mars all right so next up as you
hinted before you just got back from the
kaspersky conference down in Mexico tell
me some of that the big headlines yeah
so almost every story that I was on was
essentially about some IOT device having
vulnerabilities smart cameras gas
stations cars yachts right and we're
looking here at some popular robots yes
so this is from Softbank they make
pepper and now yeah which is the smaller
version of pepper which their big thing
about it is oh this is humanoid robot
you can talk to it can help you shop it
can help you like figure out what you
need to get at a hotel or an airport or
anything like that here's the big
problem of them they have a massive
security vulnerability where as long as
you're on the same Wi-Fi network as it
yeah you can basically get root access
and do anything you want with them well
so they did a demonstration where they
changed its voice and then had it just
basically demand a Bitcoin from you and
the whole problem of that is that and I
spoke I spoke with a rep from Softbank
and the idea is you know they're not
they can't change this because these
robots are so expensive and like it's
built into their architecture like a
software update no they're they're whole
statement was essentially you know just
have a their own private Wi-Fi network
so like make sure no one else is able to
get on that same Wi-Fi network but the
problem is though is that because these
are in like your malls and airports and
they are using the public life
yeah they're all on the same exact
Network like I can get on that Network I
can't I don't have the technical
expertise to get root access to it but
like I can get like theoretically if I
did I'd be able to do whatever I wanted
with these robots alright lastly we
wanted to talk about ready player one
movie comes out March 29th but our own
Aaron Carson was at South by Southwest
and was able to grab a premiere viewing
of it you know in her review she
basically says it's really great at
mining 80s nostalgia a lot of
pop-culture references but it doesn't
really go that deep in a story where I
really should write there's there's a
lot a lot of interesting themes like our
dependence on technology like being in
this this VR world as a because the rest
of the actual world is terrible but it
doesn't really mine or explore those
those topics very well there were so
many ways that they could have gone with
this book and they decided to go with
the worst way possible
yeah you you watched you read about a
quarter of the book and you gave up I
read a quarter of the book and I dropped
it because I was just like this is
literally an 80s fanfiction I there's no
point for me like I have no nostalgia
for anything I will say having grown up
in the 80s like this really hits a sweet
spot with a lot of art the book out
particularly hits a lot of sweet spot
references for me just looking at the
trailer seeing like like a Gundam in
action with the Iron Giant that alone
kind of in the fact that it's directed
by Spielberg that alone kind of gets me
excited regardless of the fact that it
is admittedly a shallow plot a shallow
story but like there you can do
references on nostalgia with like a good
plot though like wreckit-ralph was a
really good movie yes yeah yeah Oh we'll
see ya Aaron I think James agree with
you not so deep pretty good with the 80s
stuff I mean Brian what do you think
about this film you're gonna close the
show first or yeah oh okay alright what
do I think of the film I'm excited I'm a
fanboy I sometimes I don't need to have
anything all that heavy plot driven I'm
not looking for the Citizen Kane I'm
looking for bright shiny pictures in
this instance they're just watch
wreck-it Ralph then I did was wreck it
was great
oh boy these stories check us on CNN I'm
Roger Cheng I'm Alfred Inge
thanks for listening
what are you doing to me you can't bring
me into the race
sorry you're so you're like I feel like
forbidden no no I'm sorry confused I
don't know I just felt like you were the
perfect person to weigh in on this given
your love for 80s nostalgia and you just
wanted a two-on-one yes somebody else
would pick on Alfred fair enough
so what did we say we've got we got
Gundam in the first segment we got
Terminator in the second segment we
brought got in the back for the third
and Berg gonna back for the third
segment so we're essentially screwed so
one thing I did want to ask as we've
said so many times on the show one thing
I did want to ask with the bars on Mars
are there going to be Busey bars are we
gonna get like blue milk green milk from
Star Wars or something oh good question
I mean as long as the blue milk gives
you a buzz we're gonna be like a cantina
Connor bar like who drinks milk at a bar
they didn't Star Wars yeah there was
blue milk in the background at the
cantina maybe I was a Blume alcoholic
drink I think it was just because they
didn't have as many props yeah milk
they call it them no no no but they
didn't call it milk in the bar I would
go on for this with this for a while yes
I'm gonna start digging through the chat
but I did want to give a shout out to
Matthew dacher who says I hear Martian
bars will have great drinks but no
atmosphere and that's why I need a yeah
why don't we have a sound board give me
money to get one I'll make a Kickstarter
for you yeah all right so the sound
board but while I'm digging through
looking for your comments and questions
Alfred how doomed are we with this robot
security like first we thought like
hacking a teakettle was bad and now it's
like oh this thing can hold a gun yeah
there's so many like Oh a can pepper
hold a gun pepper can hold a gun right
man
I actually don't know there was a video
of a robot like holding a gun that was
from like Paulson's I never intend that
was waste guys not pepper yeah I mean
that was the inspiration for metal hood
so yeah yeah so the thing for me is that
yeah there's so many IOT devices around
us that or like easily like hacked I
mean the good news is that usually they
can fix them or like you need physical
access to them or something yeah
this is not one of those scenarios so
but the thing is just be fair how many
of these are out that many they're
pretty popular though yeah like I don't
know I've never seen one in person you
might be more popular in Asia yeah but
yeah I don't know it's it's the good
news is like you know they're mostly
using it for ransomware so it's not like
they're sending these robots to come
attack kill you what you know the pepper
I was I was more interested to see how
vulnerable the robots from you know
those security robots in like San
Francisco that like push out like
homeless people and oh yeah the one that
drowned itself at the mall in Washington
DC
yes I'm very interested in their
security and like what the issues were
with that I asked a researcher about it
and they couldn't get access to one
because it's so expensive they don't
want to buy something into research just
to like break it right thing we do have
a question here from Alex Mitchell says
Alfred you're probably my favorite but
why do you hate this book I'm sensing
sarcasm thank you thank you for saying
that I'm probably your favorite there's
doubt to it like maybe baby so I read
the first quarter of it I'm very into
dropping things when he's just a big
quitter doesn't really play out
offerings this is also true but it's
just you know life is too short to read
books that you hate
I didn't like how referential it was a
there which is like literally the
defining quality of that yeah the issue
for me is essentially you know there's
so many things going on and it's just
like I don't know why you chose to like
just hey look at like the part where
he's like getting bullied in school or
whatever but like in the in the chat
room that's invite-only and then he like
best this person who's like way tougher
than him because it is no because he
knows one more about 80's knowledge like
that's that's the important thing here
like it just seems like some like weird
like fanfiction that like I don't know I
I was not a fan of like several plot
lines and I was like this doesn't make
any sense I don't okay cool whatever I'm
done with this book I suppose one would
need to experience the 80s - yeah I
think that that is the key right there
is like having and that's not a
criticism I don't know
like I I really like hip-hop music but
it's not like I grew up like with
hip-hop music but like you grew up with
a different generation yeah yeah yeah
yeah but it's I don't know like I like
80s hip-hop too but like it's not like I
had to experience it to enjoy it
I just wonder yeah but I think it's less
than enjoying like how it hits the song
just like so like these nostalgia very
powerful thing yeah made this based in
the 90s you think could be more
appealing no because in the movie in the
movie they obviously update it to have
more like there are definitely more like
Master Chief from like halo they have
like the Iron Giant like in one of the
trailers - must L just become somewhat
ubiquitous I mean I just think that if
nostalgia is your only driving force I
don't think that's that that's it feels
like it's pandering it doesn't feel like
you actually told a good story it feels
like you totally here's all the things
that you like so like Family Guy yeah
Family Guy for Syfy
pretty much that that's a thought I'm
still just kind of excited to see these
things I mean it's it's the same appeal
to me that I get when I get giggly at a
Marvel movie and it's like Captain
America the same screen this is neat and
it's just like maybe that movie was
great maybe it wasn't it's just kind of
like that childhood fantasy come to life
mm-hmm and I think that's that obviously
that's the Pele that's why they made it
and I think there's anything wrong with
that
mhm that's that's my two cents I don't
like I said I'm just to see Iron Giant
and Gundam fighting together yeah why
does Spielberg directed movie effects do
great pretty cool walk me through this
and when you're reading the book and it
gets to one of these in the static
moment like what what are you like oh
wow I can't like believe it or like what
is this no it's not it's not like anyone
nostalgic moment really like it's a no
for me I think it's just like the
undercurrent of nostalgia that it's just
constantly there it's not the highlight
of it I did like the story it moves like
a trashy novel it moves very quickly it
is a thrashing
it is a trashy novel what was wrapped in
nostalgia totally I get that but I'm not
I'm not saying I'm like oh look at that
thing and look at this reference like I
never thought that I just thought it was
it was a clever use of a lot of that 80s
nostalgia a lot of those references
folded into the plot it is look I admit
it's not the deepest story at all it's
like a it's very easy very disposable
very digestible story and mu
very quickly it's very breezy you don't
really think about too much afterwards
but it is it was enjoyable me when I
went through it yeah but yeah I hope you
guys enjoy it I you know I'm not here to
take away anyone elses joy no no you
just enjoy this person yeah I don't get
any joy from this do you think that
there was potential in the story do you
think there are elements that could have
been done better was a potential I think
the world was the world was set up where
you could have explored things a lot of
deeper like I said addiction to
technology the fact that we're using VR
to get to escape from our real world
there are a lot of issues there that are
real that are worthy of exploring I
don't think the book did a really good
job of that I mean just sort of was too
busy getting on this adventure and
wrapping up all this nostalgia around it
but that's it that's not what this book
was I think had a cool concept I think
you know despite me like making fun of
it seeming like some kids like fantasy
or something like that a while ago it
does seem like you know they have a lot
of like fantastical like elements to it
that like they could have explored a lot
and it's just like here's all 80 stuff
that yeah well I will say though that it
did a really good job at predicting like
oh if there's a VR world where anybody
can make anything it's all just give me
like cartoon references and stuff
because that's essentially what's going
on in the our chat right now Futurama
did it first yeah so do you know about
VR chat no it's this game on Steam
that's available it's kind of like
second life but like VR wise right now
it's been taking over taken over by a
bunch of like little knuckles like from
sauna our chat yes but yeah that's my
point though like if there were like
really like a VR would it be all these
like obscure references and stuff right
from what I had seen so if it's not the
knuckles it's like all these like anime
characters and like there's a guy who's
like really well-known as like Hank Hill
from king of the hill and he just runs
around doing like Hank Hill noises I
will say there are a lot of interesting
concepts about applications of VR that
that are pretty interesting like I don't
want to get into like spoiler territory
look or the movie but like as you get
through like more of the challenges that
he faced the main characters face like
those are some interesting VR
experiences Turk I would be interested
in yeah I think we're way over analyzing
a movie that we have anyone I know I
know
frankly a movie that probably doesn't
need to be analyzed this deeply I mean
it was cater made to be a summer popcorn
films yes yeah yeah I'm probably gonna
see it oh we want to give a shout out
before we close a good discussion -
Channing in Columbus who says people are
just kind of excited because it is a
story that takes place in Columbus and
they hype the book is anything good yeah
I think that's cool I mean in a world
where every damn movie just takes place
in New York in LA and sometimes Gotham
it's nice to see other cities
represented especially place as nice as
Columbus because one of my best friend's
lives the ironic thing is like even
though it's set in Columbus I mean a
vast majority that movie is actually
it's in a VR world right you're not
really seeing Columbus and then which
has also been underrepresented in film
did you be super excited with the way
Columbus is presented in the movie
because it's not described as the nicest
place yes I know like trailer stacks now
yeah it's like literally stacks of RV
homes yeah because that's just how
that's how we would like a high-rise
building yeah it seems it's like I was a
great place I love Ohio alright let's
move back into IOT imagine psyche wasn't
really sure what I ot was we did not
clarify yeah yes yes oh yes ants were
Internet of Things and it's basically
most connected gadget gadgets so yeah
like your smart refrigerator that like
tells you like what food is left in your
fridge or something like that the point
is that small refrigerator is able to
talk with other things
yeah it's connected it's not it doesn't
just tell you something like it it goes
on the internet to find the information
yeah so the fact that they're all
connected and all talking to each other
means they're potentially all vulnerable
yeah because the thing is like a lot of
IOT makers when they make these devices
they're you know they don't really make
them with security in mind they make
them more so how do we connect us online
how do we make them talk to each other
because sometimes like when you do have
this like secure aspect to it it makes
things but sometimes can make things
like inconvenient for you like if you
needed to enter a password every time
you wanted to use your refrigerator or
something like that that can be kind of
annoying so they they do implement some
like ignore some security features more
for like convenience sakes but if you're
the bioscan your thumbprint to open your
fridge I'd be okay that seems like a lot
of trouble and what if you get guests
over exactly yeah so they can trade my
fridge so we're saying is variable there
was oversight in the security
consideration for developing new
technology we've never seen that before
no what kind of conversations do these
things have I you say they're there
talking to each other can you just
imagine that chat room with like the
fridge in the toaster the idea that like
your refrigerator knows that your milk
and it'll talk to your phone if your
knows that your phone you are in the
market because your phone is in the
market like sending you alert like oh by
the way if you're in the market yeah so
the thing most IOT devices use like
different kind of protocols to like chat
with each other and in some scenarios
like the one with this robot it was oh I
know it wasn't this robot it was a it
was a smart camera one that I had
written where it was a it was sent in
plaintext like over like your wife your
internet signals or whatever some it's
some use like encrypted signals so that
like if I were on the same Wi-Fi network
as you I wouldn't be able to see like
you sending your password over or
something like that but those smart cam
one that was sent over in plain text
over jabber which is like from like the
IRC days oh yeah yeah yeah yeah so that
one like it was like particularly like
insecure because yeah an aspect like
that that is like novice level screw-up
right there I think it shows you like a
lot like you said all these device
makers when they're making these
products they don't think it was yeah so
like they're like what what can you do
to make this feature this product look
cool and do cool things but the security
is sort of a second that's their
astonishing in this day and age so are
there any groups out there actually
trying to move that forward and make it
a higher yeah so the Senate has
basically proposed a bill that like to
make cybersecurity like you know have
more of a standard in IOT devices but
they're not doing it and like a standard
like all companies that sell within the
US it's just what they're trying to do
is like all US government like
properties that buy IOT devices which is
like a lot cuz like you think about it
in terms of like a TV or fridge but like
it's everywhere it's like the sensors
that like track
like traffic lights it's like that track
like water levels when it rains like
just even like tiny or like smaller ones
so they're trying to do it kind of like
how New York is trying to enforce
mentality rules by basically telling the
ISPs that do business with the
government to follow those rules like
that's me it's like we're not we're not
making businesses do anything but if you
want to sell to us that's it yeah didn't
Washington just implement that bit while
Washington actually implemented a full
net neutrality like state rule state
which is government leave New York was
like if you want to do business with us
you have to follow these principles got
it which is sort of an end-around to
actually making a rule Washington like
went out and just said nope we're doing
this this is a rule now yeah the hope of
the IOT security bill is that like
because they buy so much IOT products
that they would change it to fit them
and then once they change it to fit them
but anybody else that buys from them
like would also have that added like
benefit hmm interesting
all right we are just about out of time
I wanted to propose a question to farm
out to viewers and listeners if you
would hit us up on Twitter we want to
hear your best Mars cocktails mmm give
us the titles and the recipe if you feel
to go that far I want to see we can let
try to actually make one maybe let's do
that the best one just submit your best
Mars cocktails and if you can how to
make them and if you come up with the
best one you'll motivate us to make it
and drink it here early in the morning
yeah yeah we're reminiscing of our old
open tap show we're on them we're on
Twitter at at the 359 podcast yeah if
you want to put it in the description
I'm sure it already is I don't have a
hashtag for you got a good hashtag for
it I'll come over in a bit okay yeah
yeah look out look out for our account
on Twitter and should have the
information there yeah so please do that
yeah until then that's gonna wrap it for
the day Roger you wanna bring us home
yeah if you like to anything you saw or
heard here check us out on CNET our
podcast is also available on iTunes tune
in stitcher Feedburner google play music
