thing the surface style
the surface style was created as a new
form of input we've learned a ton over
the last several years of how people are
using their pen and how they use their
other hand to do operate whether it's
touching the screen grabbing a mouse
typing but there's so many different
flows of interaction that happened this
product was meant to help you change
that workflow give you that next option
to help you create even faster now we
have integrated global controls into
this which are part of Windows I know
that sounds like a lot of words but what
it means is it's built right into
Windows as I hold it down can you see
right here in the middle of the screen
if you bring this up you can see that
here I have the dial essentially on my
screen in front of me this allows me to
select different things within windows
in this sense I'm going to show you a
new product called ink replay you'll
notice my ink went away on the screen
that was purposeful but watch as I move
the dial to the right as the ink comes
back on the screen if you can see my
hand and you see the ink coming to life
behind me now here's what I love about
this I can recreate this ink or I can
take it away at any given time but if
the team gets this document and they
want to replay my emotion you can see it
because it came out of my hand if I had
typed that message you would not have
the inner pieces of what came with it
those three exclamation points may not
look the same the writing may have
looked faster or slower which is
important let me show you another cool
trick if I just come here this product
comes to life with the scroll wheel so
as I scroll can you see this flipping
just moving my hand and flipping through
showing you how the device works off the
screen and we're going to show you how
it works on the screen in just a minute
but if you have a surface pro 3 if you
have a surface pro 4 if you have a
surface book this mode of interaction is
for you to so don't worry if you already
have one of those you can grab a surface
style you can turn up or going turn it
down change the brightness scroll
through your document like I do here you
can do all the magical things that the
dial does for you to help you create</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
