it is my pleasure to introduce the
Samsung Galaxy s7 and samsung galaxy s7
edge they feel smaller and thinner with
smoother edges and sleeker lines you can
do more faster thanks to the new and
improved edge panel always-on display
they can spend up to 30 minutes
submerged in a meter and half of water
we integrated a micro SD card slot we
wanted to redefine the smartphone camera
so that you can take a great quality
picture at any time of day so we started
by adding a brighter lens the pixels in
our light absorbing sensor capture about
our 30 percent larger than those on the
iPhone 6s plus a kettlebell is going to
drop in the foreground and I want you to
notice how much more quickly the s7
achieves focus are you ready
did you see the lag on the iPhone 6s
plus it can be the difference between
catching the perfect moment and watching
a go by here comes my favorite in your
feature it takes the wide-angle
experience to a whole new level
we call it motion panorama gear 360 you
can see your 360 photos and videos
directly from your phone gallery and
post them seamlessly on your social
media but let's also talk about we are
now you can create 360 virtual reality
experiences on your own
so in over the last year we've been
working to make Facebook the best
platform for 360 videos and video is
already some of the most engaging
content that you'll see online there are
already everyday more than a hundred
million hours of video content are
watched on Facebook an example of an
important breakthrough we call dynamic
streaming for VR video the idea is that
instead of delivering the whole video in
a high resolution
we just focus on the part that you're
looking at and this allows us to deliver
the video with a much higher resolution
and quality about 4x while also reducing
the overall bandwidth consumed for
streaming the video by about 4x we've
recently created new teams at Facebook
to build the next generation of social
apps and VR and there are hundreds of
incredible content titles coming to the
oculus store this year we've put
hundreds of our best engineers on this
to make much faster progress than the
industry would have otherwise so we're
committed to building the best VR
experiences in the world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
