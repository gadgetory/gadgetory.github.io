2014 Consumer Electronics Show everybody
had one to show off
Samsung even had one that could Bend
from flat to curved at the press of a
button but that doesn't mean he should
buy one I'm Donald Bell and this top 5
I'm counting down the reasons to think
twice before buying one of these curved
TVs starting things off at number 5 they
stick out I mean they literally stick
out just when we finally got some
affordable and possibly thin TVs that
can blend right into your wall now all
the sudden we're supposed to be cool
with TVs that have wings
it's creepy because TVs coming in for a
hug
I need boundaries at number 4 size
because these things visually distort at
the edges you'll either need to go
really big or sit really close for us to
see them immersive and not annoying now
there's a reason that all the curved TVs
of CES were around 80 to 100 inches
because anything smaller it's just kind
of a novelty coming in at number 3
positioning now with the curved screen
the visual sweet spot gets pretty narrow
anything less than front and center and
those wings start directing the image
away from you now for one or two people
its immersive but family movie night is
going to have some cheap seats at number
two price if you think the hot new trend
in TVs will be cheap think again
especially when you figure you're going
to need to buy something over 70 inches
just to do it right you can find an
affordable curved TV in 2014 it's
probably just a flat panel someone left
in the Sun too long now before we get to
the number one reason not to buy a
curved TV let me take a moment to point
out some reasons why you may want to buy
one anyway without a doubt these TVs are
going to be fun to show off they're
great for gamers we're going to be
sitting up close to the TV anyway
version with a 21-9 screen could be cool
for you
pure movie experience fanatics and
arguably these screens minimize ambient
lighting reflections but ultimately the
main reason you should buy a curved TV
is that you have too much money on your
hands and you just need to throw it
around and bite all right and now the
number one reason not to buy a curved TV
it's a fad this is the perfect example
of manufacturers doing something just
because they can not because it actually
makes sense if they can convince
everyone that flat screens are out of
fashion they stand to make a lot of
money but in five years when flat is
back that curved screen on your wall is
going to look about as cool as a pair of
acid wash mom jeans so there you go five
reasons to keep your flatscreen flat now
for more in-depth reasoning of the
appeal and drawbacks of curved screens
check out David Katz Mars post on CNET
