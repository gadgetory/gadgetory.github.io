there and they're all looking to take
over your wrist you've got fitness bands
and you've got smartwatches the Samsung
gear fit looks to be the best of both
worlds
by combining a fitness features of a
band but still making it a fully capable
SmartWatch
I'm Scott Stein and this is the Samsung
gear fit what the gear fit is is really
kind of a hybrid between a Nike FuelBand
type device and something like the
pebble smartwatch it can get
notifications from your phone it can
tell you anything from Facebook to
Twitter to incoming phone calls and ping
you about what's coming in but it also
acts as a full-fledged Fitness band and
we're not just talking about pedometer
we're also talking about heartrate
because on the back of the gear fit is a
heartrate monitor and this is able to
measure standing heartrate but also in
action heartrate and works with a
coaching aid when you're running or when
you're cycling telling you when to speed
up or slow down so you can set your
exercise mode right from the gear fit
and you can pick a goal based on the
amount of time you run or the amount of
estimated calories or by the distance so
I'm going to try running here set the
goal distance for I don't know one mile
and you can actually set the heartrate
to be displayed and also be able to set
whether you want coaching which tells
you whether speed up or slow down based
on your heart rate now I'm not on a
treadmill right now but I'm going to
give this a try right here it's going to
start by measuring the heart rate
getting a ping and then it's going to
give me a three-to-one
to start working out so three two one
and I get a buzz I should start working
start running let's see how it's going
it says speed up so I'm going to speed
up now I just keep doing this it
actually didn't tell me to keep the pace
sometimes it tells you to keep the pace
even if you're standing still if your
heart rate is high so a little up and
down in terms of how the coaching is
going and you don't know whether if it's
buzzing to tell you to speed up or slow
down or whether you're buzzing because
you got a facebook notification it all
depends all right it says I still have
to speed up
okay it's hard now unfortunately as both
a watch and a band the gear fit leaves a
little bit to be desired it does have a
pretty forward-looking design and a
gorgeous-looking
AMOLED display that is curved you've
never seen anything like this before
and you swipe it and it's got a variety
of colors and watch faces and it
actually pops out of this plastic key
band so you can change out the band and
pick something else it's a pretty cool
design but it's a little bulky bulkier
than you might think so it's not the
super curved around your wrist feel has
a little bit of a bulbous top and when
it comes to that curved screen it's hard
to read messages the battery life is
really only functionally about two days
before a recharge based on what I was
using it for using it for heart rate
monitoring and always being connected
plus the gear fit only works with
Samsung phones that brings up the point
that if you're buying a fitness band a
lot of those work on both iOS and
Android with the exception of a few so
if you're buying this you're really
closing yourself out of a lot of
flexibility and this needs to tie into s
health which is Samsung's own health
application which has been expanded now
to add heart rate monitoring and in the
future sleep monitoring - all through
the gear fit or actually through your
phone because the Samsung Galaxy s5 also
has heart rate monitoring but at $1.99
this comes in at the same price as the
gear 2 neo which is a more full-featured
watch which counts against Samsung
they've created a competing product out
there which you might want to pick
instead all that stuff with the cool
display that costs you on battery I feel
like this is a half step forward into
the future something that does fuse
fitness and watch but is not the best at
either it's something I like showing off
but I'm not sure I'd always want to use
I'm Scott Simon C net and that's the
Samsung gear fit in a nutshell
