that smarts apartment in downtown
Louisville Kentucky we operate this
space in conjunction with the city of
Louisville baby being to explore what
smart city might mean to residents
living here so we have people from the
city here today to show off some of
their early smart city experiments to
hopefully give you a better idea of what
this means well I came in contact with
the government in a hackathon they
wanted to use the API they have or junks
it out and make it an elixir enable
skill so you can ask the alexis kuehl
when is the John set up in your area it
will ask you back the address for your
area right and then it will tell you
that information that you need Alexa ask
city services about my junk set out Dave
sure tell me your address my address is
29 10 Dartmouth Avenue Kentucky the junk
set out will begin in your area on
December 9 2016 and will go on till
December 11 2016 so this project that
we're showing today is a integration
between Louisville Metro government air
quality data to a third party service
called ifft that then plugs into your
Philip Hugh bulb so it will show the air
quality of the area so basically the hue
Bob will change color based off of how
good or moderate or hazardous the air
quality is in your area and I'm skill I
built is the mayor of Louisville
newsfeed and what it does is it hooks
into an XML feed that the city provided
of the mayor's like daily news briefings
basically Alexa give me my flash
briefing for today here's your flash
briefing
from me your Greg Fischer's office in
Louisville Kentucky now the smart city
concept is still in its very early
stages and cities around the world are
experimenting with how to bring data and
residents together in a way that makes
city services run more efficiently what
you've seen here today is just the
beginning and we're excited to see how
Louisville and other cities pushes
concept forward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
