welcome to tomorrow daily the best ski
talk show the new verse I'm Ashley Scott
you're watching one of our short
episodes because of the Thanksgiving
holiday here in the States will not be
having an episode
tomorrow unfortunately but you'll be
stuffing your face with turkey if you
live here so that's fine also we don't
have an episode on Monday the 30th so
you can check us out the first the
second and the third next week we'll
have a long show for you and we can't
wait to tell you who the guest is but
until then let's do the headlines
get ready biohackers because tech
tattoos are just around the corner
chaotic moon is a mobile dev company
with an idea they're calling tech tats
tech tats are actually biosensors that
rest on top of your skin as opposed to
being injected underneath them like real
tattoos and a small micro controller
handles incoming data and storing
information electro-conductive paint
allows for temperature sensing while an
ambient light sensor flips on an LED if
it realizes it's dark out making you
kind of feel like a really awesome
cyborg a Bluetooth low-energy connection
means transferring health data to an app
is easy and since it can be placed
anywhere instead of just on your wrist
chaotic moon believes it might have a
place in tracking for medical athletic
and other applications where a visible
monitor might not be an option or if the
wearer wants to be more discreet they
also mentioned the possibility of bio
NFC which would turn one of these
temporary tattoos into a payment portal
that you could activate by gesture if
this all sounds kind of fun I've got
good news for you
chaotic moon hopes to make the final
product inexpensive enough to sell in
packs like band-aids or other small
first aid items would you wear one of
these things out I mean on the one hand
I am getting old but not old enough to
want to know everything about what's
going on in my body at all times but on
the other hand I feel like it would be a
really really cool icebreaker at parties
ok so our second story is about NASA
building a robot that's going to help
with space exploration this robot is
called the Valkyrie robot or the
Robonaut 5 we've actually seen it before
this video that you're watching is from
2013 but NASA is making a really
interesting move towards getting the
most out of what
do they've chosen to university teams to
make the robot as autonomous and
dexterous as possible MIT and
Northeastern University are the two
schools pitting there are five robots
against one another and they will show
off their final designs in nasa's space
Robotics Challenge next year the
Robonaut 5 is already a pretty
impressive robot it's 6 feet tall it
weighs 290 pounds and it has an array of
sensors sonar remote sensing tech and
other features on board so the teams
will primarily focus on improving the
software for the robot when the 2013
video is released then Project Lead
Nicolas Radford said quote these robots
will start preparing the way for the
human explorers and when the humans
arrive the robots and humans will work
together in a tight relationship unquote
yeah until those researchers from
yesterday's story show up and start
teaching Robonaut 5 to say no to
astronauts and then we end up with a Hal
9000 situation I'm just saying if you're
still thinking about the tech cat story
from earlier and you don't really want
to wear a biosensor how about ingesting
one that's what MIT is thinking you
might want to do in the future they are
again in the news with a sensor that a
person would have to swallow to make it
work oddly enough the main feature on
this particular device is a microphone
why a microphone while all the better to
hear your heart and lungs functioning
from within your GI tract scientists say
the microphone will pick up the sound of
your heart beating and your lungs
working giving two pieces of info from a
single sensor it's embedded into a
silicone capsule that people can easily
swallow and then once it's been ingested
a nearby receiver picks up the signals
and passes on the data so what's the
benefit here well researchers think this
pill could be used to help patients with
chronic illnesses monitor soldiers out
in the field improve athletic training
diagnose heart conditions and more
unfortunately if you really think about
it this pill will only last for about a
day or two before you have to start the
process all over again
so one or two days of monitoring all
right it's time for Mod Squad let's go
from cool sci-fi to on you tried
japanese comedy website Oh Mikoto thinks
it has a really good solution if you
find using a selfie stick to be really
embarrassing
user monsoon is one such person and this
is his creation ultra long fake arms for
selfies it's a pretty straightforward
construction he just camouflaged a
couple of selfie sticks inside some
plastic hands you know as one does and
then added some more sleeve room to a
shirt to help hide his new weirdo selfie
stick arms the end result looks super
natural except not at all and honestly I
think it could have been made better if
they were retractable arms so that you
could go out and pretend that you were a
real-life mr. fantastic or an Inspector
Gadget pick your generation all right
guys let's look at your photos our phone
talker for the day today is K Vaughn who
snapped this on his HTC One XL and he
writes to us and says hi my name is Kay
Vaughn big fan of the show great and
fresh news really liking it keep up the
good work
these are a few photos I took with my
beloved HTC One XL which I lost later
from visiting Hormuz island in Persian
Gulf beautiful place I was stunned and
in one word colorful the whole island is
made of these colorful soils red yellow
green and the Sun and a lot of light and
of course the beautiful sea and also
some sci-fi shaped rocks the photos are
untouched and I would be more than happy
to give you permission to use them if
you find them worthy of your amazing
show kayvon yes 100% these are worthy
and I agree those look like really weird
sci-fi rocks I'd like to have them as
the backdrop for this set unfortunately
we're really expensive to ship them if
you guys want to send in your phone tog
Rafi to be potentially featured on the
show please do email us for tomorrow
Tina calm send us your photo tell us you
give us permission to use it because we
need that and then also tell us a little
story about it because we like stories
if you want to find us online you want
to share the show the friend take them
over to tomorrow daily calm it's that
easy
give the gift of tomorrow daily this
holiday season and I'm not going to stop
saying that until holidays are over and
also you can find us online on Twitter
personally I'm at Ashley's gether
producer Logan is over at Logan Moy and
Jeff is at Jeff kanata with 2
and one tea we're gonna be back next
week on Tuesday with a brand new docket
a weird science fact in science fiction
I love our friends celebrating
Thanksgiving in the US have a great
turkey day and be good humans we'll see
you next time
hi
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
