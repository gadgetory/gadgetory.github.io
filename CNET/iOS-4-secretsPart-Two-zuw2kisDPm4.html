I'm back with more little secrets you
might not know about that are hidden
inside of iOS four now I know this may
not be the sexiest one but anyone with
an iphone 3gs third gen ipod touch or
the new iphone can now take advantage of
iOS force data protection feature that
enhances the built-in hardware
encryption all you have to do is go to
your settings then general and passcode
and create one once you do that scroll
down to the bottom and you should see
data protection is enabled and you are
good to go now folders is a big deal for
iOS four fans but a fun little trick is
that you can now bring folders down into
the dock as well and access them from
there in the mail app the new threaded
emails is a favorite feature of mine but
you might not like it so in your
settings go to mail contacts and
calendars and you can toggle on or off
the organized by thread option once
inside the actual mail app you'll also
see that contact pictures will display
within the email in the corner which is
a nice little touch now we all play
music on our iphones and ipod touches
and you can now create and edit your own
playlists directly in the music app and
they will sink back to your computer the
next time you connect it this is another
killer feature and if you're also
searching for songs by album there's a
whole new layout with artwork and
additional information now if you're the
type of person who thinks lyrics or
podcasts information just gets in the
way you can turn them off in your
settings by going to iPod and switching
off the lyrics and podcast info option
I'm Brian town for cnet com with another
batch of iOS four tips for you use them
wisely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
