apartment a smarter smart TV sure
today's televisions can stream Netflix
or Hulu or YouTube but the livering
content is what TVs have always done
I want TVs that put that cloud
connectivity to more creative use I want
my Smart TV to be a smart home
centerpiece now in fairness Smart TVs
already have a couple of cool connected
home tricks up their sleeve but none of
them are developed well enough for my
liking some of them use your TV to help
control and monitor your smart home
gadgets for instance you can watch live
nest cam footage on your TV using nests
Apple TV app but in a weird twist you
can't do that with any of the cameras
that already work with apple homekit at
least not yet that's a big missed
opportunity on Apple's part on the flip
side you've got ways of using smart home
gadgets to help you trick out your TV
for instance we've already seen the
appeal of smart color-changing vyas
lighting behind your TV so why don't we
have a TV with lights like these built
right in philips took a shot at it a
couple of years ago with their Ambilight
TV sets and it still offers cool ways of
synching your philips hue lights up with
programming on the sci-fi network but
why not something bigger the Olympics
the Super Bowl even why not sync up with
Playstation or Xbox to coordinate color
changing lighting with the game you're
playing there's a ton of unrealized
potential here the other way that smart
home tech can help make TV better is
through voice control you've already got
Cirie and Alexis powered voice search on
Apple TV and Amazon fire TV respectively
and you can also sync Alexa up with the
logitech harmony hub in order to switch
channels and inputs using voice commands
like this Alexa turn on watch Hulu it's
a slow semi clunky integration though
mostly because Amazon still doesn't have
dedicated software that tells Alexa how
to control TVs now the Google home smart
speaker is a little bit ahead of Alexa
here you can sync it up with your Smart
TV then tell it to play specific Netflix
shows or YouTube videos
no logitech setup needed okay google
play videos by CNET smart home on
youtube
sure playing CNET smart home videos from
YouTube on living room TV still it
doesn't support any other streaming
services just yet and it can't handle
basics like switching inputs or even
turning your TV on or off so clearly
there's still a lot of work to do in
this category but rest assured that we
are eagerly keeping tabs on all of it
and as soon as things start to get
compelling we'll tell you all about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
