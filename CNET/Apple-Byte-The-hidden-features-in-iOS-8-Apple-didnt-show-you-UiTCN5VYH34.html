the old office good to be here I know
it's been way too long it has been a
while have you seen everybody yeah saw
the editors I hung out with the mailroom
guys for a little bit grab a bite you
know what's cool what about Brian and I
get really know he really hasn't gotten
over you actually it's been two years
man I don't know what to tell you I'll
go see ya all right let me go see all
right
took out the film
it's not
goodbye what's good brian Tong here and
welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
this week it's the stuff Apple didn't
show you an iOS 8 and product rumors
galore let's get to it and we'll start
off with the gadgets Apple still hasn't
shown us according to a new report from
Mac generation Apple is plenty to update
its imac line next week with speed bump
and lower prices we aren't expecting
these imacs to bring a Retina display
just yet and they could surprise us but
recent evidence in the OS 10 yosemite
beta points the direct references to
retina display imax in the near future
now in more mac news that we couldn't
get to last episode intel announced our
next-generation broadwell chipset that
will be used in devices that will go on
sale later this year the intel core m
processor will be the most
energy-efficient one in the company's
history and even better a majority of
designs based on this chip are expected
to be fanless a fanless chip is a big
deal and i don't know if we'll actually
see that tech integrated into apple's
laptop line like the rumored 12-inch
MacBook Air it's not likely but we'll
see all right Korean site et news
reports displays for apples next iPad
air are set to begin production this
month with the camera module entering
production soon as well we're still
expecting an updated a a processor and
upgraded camera and touch ID this time
around with rumors still pointing to a
september-october release based on the
past history of iPad releases and watch
out multiple reports including the
Nikkei and recode are sane Apple is
aiming for October with an apple event
in the same month to show off the device
the Nikkei reports it will use the
curved OLED touchscreen and will use
biometric sensors to collect health
related data even Apple has already
started pushing the idea of health and
fitness with their new ad
go you chicken fat go I mean what do
they even mean by chicken fat I demian
see it in the video I gotta get that for
you look at the screen okay that's
disgusting and I'm going to finish this
show without throwing up promise all
right Apple Insider found the big a was
recently granted a patent this week for
a weight lifting tracking system that
uses a standalone sensor to transmit
metrics to a remote display including a
wristwatch a sensor laden device would
attach itself to a weight lifting bar
and counts and displays repetitions or
what we call in the workout community
reps now this is just one of the
examples that perfectly aligns with the
idea of apple's next-gen wearable but
come on I don't need a watch to keep
track of my reps
that's right I work out now the iOS 8
and OS 10 Yosemite beta have been out
for a while now so we just wanted to go
over some of the things a Polly or
really get into detail at WWDC the
rumored split-screen multitasking is
still in works code related to apps
running side by side has been found in
the beta and it will reportedly only
work in landscape mode and may be
limited to the iPad air initially also
iOS 8 will be able to show battery usage
by app so you can find out which one
draws too much power that one's super
helpful there will be a time-lapse mode
for the camera which is a great built in
addition Safari includes the option to
request the desktop version of the
website on your mobile device you can
set a time of 30 days or one year to
remove your store messages and free up
valuable space and your recent photos
will also show up so you can add them
quickly instead of always going to your
photo library to find them there's a
gray scale mode for accessibility and
there will be an option that will allow
users to place calls over Wi-Fi instead
of the older cellular networks saving
minutes data and the best part better
call quality so there's still plenty
more little bells and whistles but those
are just a few of the smaller useful
changes we can expect an iOS 8 when it's
available to the public this fall and if
you thought apples Maps we're all
figured out they're not we were
expecting to hear about the new
improvements but techCrunch reports that
many developers left the company and
improvements for iOS 8 maps just weren't
finished in time now the story continues
that tasks were badly planned developers
were jumping from project to project and
internal politics issues were more
significant contributors to the
failure to complete maps on time yikes
now do we even have to question this
that's a bad apple and I'm still not
using those maps and you thought i
wasn't going to show you an iphone 6
rear shell case this week right well
here they are thanks to taiwanese race
car driver jimmy lin who is flaunting
his iphone 6 mock-up case thinking he's
a cool guy it's not the real thing
because if it was really working he
would have turn on the screen but more
importantly what can we learn from these
photos use nail clippers alright that's
going to do it for this week's show send
us your emails to the apple byte at cnet
com or tweet me up brian Tong and if
it's your birthday you might get a
special wish and if not it means I don't
care that's going to do for this week's
show I'm Brian telling thanks so much
