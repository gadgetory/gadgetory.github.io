invading your space too much well if so
you might be interested in this it's a
prototype of the runcible a SmartWatch
they're designed to look like a pocket
watch and be a bit more discreet we're
here mobile or Congress 2015 let's check
it out so the philosophy behind runcible
is that current smartphones are getting
bigger they're getting less friendly and
they're getting less usable and this is
something that's a little bit more
discreet it's not going to be constantly
bleeping at you the company that makes
this which is called monome they also
say that this is going to be a long-term
device so they're not going to change
the design of it which means that you'll
be able to get the hardware upgraded and
keep this as a family heirloom so again
this is just a prototype for now so they
don't even know for example what kind of
camera this is going to be yet so it's
still in its early stages what they do
know though is that it's going to run
Firefox OS and that the display is going
to rotate as you twist it around so
another thing about this is that monome
says you're not going to hold it up to
your face like you would a traditional
smartphone instead you're going to have
to pair it with a Bluetooth headset it's
going to be on sale later this year
there's no fixed price yet but we're
told to expect it to cost around as much
as an unlocked high-end smartphone so
it's got a long way to go yet but we
like the idea of mixing up the
smartphone design and trying new things
it's not going to be for everyone but
let me know what you think and check out
