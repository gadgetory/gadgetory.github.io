people off to the show no you ever go on
Halloween when your trick or treating
and you have that little white ghosts
hanging from the top of the door that
sensors your senses your motion yes and
all sent it sets off
it's a classic tempered I dude it seems
to remember i do then the meeting it was
like that's actually really good it's
real it's real good it's real good all
right ladies and gentlemen boys and
girls thanks for coming out to the show
thanks for listening on all our various
platforms we do stream this live to
youtube periscope live streaming we will
have a new live streaming capability
functionality in what may be around the
next week or so yeah hopefully next week
we're gonna be live streaming on
facebook had a watch yours gonna be
scrolling to be like Oh watch your
facebook but again this show is all
about YOU we're just here to we're
stewards of the show basically it is the
apple byte extra crunchy all that munch
you can call us to be a part of this
show the number is 1 800 61 62 63 8 you
can leave your name your number not your
number name we get your number by the
way just so you know your number shows
up in the email your name your message
or comment your bad apple your good
apple we want to know what you're
thinking what do you want to hear from
us what do you want to talk about but I
really love it when you guys and gals
contribute to the show with your own
opinions or thoughts but again keep it
around 30 seconds and we can bounce off
each other I know it's not live calls
we're working on that maybe if you're if
you guys are extra nice it's gonna take
another person to get will take another
person so uh we'll get there one day but
let's get to the show right now and the
latest news just dropped and this is a
big one it may not sound the sexiest but
this is big because Apple does not do
this apple recently just invested 1
billion dollars in Chinese ride-hailing
service DD shushing I said DD shushing
true true Xing Xing when you know it's
not it's not died I chuck Singh is DD
true Shing so they're basically the
largest ride-hailing service their
competitor is actually China uber we
know we know about that uber service but
Apple has invested 1 billion dollars
they never do this type of stuff in a
move that Tim Cook said they would hope
to help give Apple better understanding
about not only the Chinese market which
is extremely important because what it's
a population of approximately 1 billion
people and that means to change a ching
but this allows them to
also get data of how these cars are
operating running optimized what is
working even let's talk about mobile
payments in cars that exchange and also
the fact of the matter is that Apple is
looking at a car themselves we know this
right yeah so this is very interesting
because uber and lyft or doing things
where they're having autonomous cars
driving around picking up people so you
can get in a car that has no driver
right it's look I think there's one in
in London's happening and a couple
others other cities so uh Tim Stevens
sent out a tweet earlier this morning
he's like you know what I've been
thinking about this Apple car thing and
maybe the Apple car is not going to be a
car but it's just going to be a service
just an autonomous writing service and
that would be very smart about that you
know just to expand on that the the end
game for a lot of these car services is
autonomous vehicles yeah the reason why
unfortunately as humans cost more money
we also create more mistakes yes and
therefore replacing us this is like the
first phase of our lives where we will
most likely see some sort of autonomous
computer controlled vehicle / device
that actually replaces human jobs we've
seen factories of course but this this
is kind of like the next level right
she's gonna be like Siri give me a car
please but she's gonna like go what okay
okay okay yeah get me a bit and then a
car's gonna drive up you know what you
know what's funny about the new driver
that was Syrian in her spine in her
finest form Sri get me a car okay French
what no she was calling me French again
remember that's my nickname that's sure
that she knows when she can yeah your oh
my god we forgot I forgot you are the
friend she can French I can she knows my
name so they're investing in 1 billion
dollars this is not something Apple
normally does you don't hear them
putting this much money into a market
again this is all for the data I find
this interesting from a standpoint of
look Apple needs all the help they can
get when it comes to this car
self-driving car autonomous vehicle
their own car market but there's a lot
of connections here connective tissue
here we have
Bulls carplay platform we have the car
obviously we have Apple pay at work and
the biggest thing the Chinese market
getting hundreds dollars a bit of a
billion populace yeah billion dollars
per billion a billion puzzle that's a
lot dollar head doll that's a dollar a
Chinese person each Chinese person is
worth a dollar in China so we will we
will see how the shakes out again this
is just very for thing but this is
another thing to kind of consider what
else is going around in this car market
now just at the end of April just
recently Google Ford and uber and lyft
and who else was it a Volvo announced
the formation of this self-driving
coalition for safer streets and what
they're trying to do is really lay out
rules that we can follow by the
government that are kind of in place so
we can start moving forward more
aggressively with autonomous p cars
autonomous vehicles but just having
those rules set in place to help push
for the movement again those names
Google uber lyft Volvo Ford they're all
in cahoots also hell yeah they're all
married together to see this happen
guess who's not in that party Apple so
Apple needs to figure out how they're
going to be involved in something like
this what information do they need so
they're partnering with Chinese service
can you do want to try and say it um
Steven do do shuksan sorry that was
wrong d teaching CDs regime there you go
you know it's Maya true Chinese friends
and viewers and listeners gonna be like
that was horrible that song that's wrong
tom okay that's wrong tongue so we'll
see how this sum all comes together but
it I thought it was a fascinating story
that apple would actually drop 1 billion
dollars in cash I'm to do this so we'd
love to hear what you guys think about
this is it smart is it stupid is it
really going to help Apple that much 1
800 61 62 63 8 is the phone number that
you guys can call it serious I'm curious
to know if if a car drives up no one's
driving it that you called would you get
in well I think there's gonna be some
sort of authentication with your phone
to the car like I said would you trust
to drive in an autonomous car that's
essentially you will it's right this is
jets and stature kids in there this is
Jack
it's an autonomous car is arguably
already to this date although there
needs to be a lot more regulation and
things that need to pass autonomous cars
are currently the Google ones that are
tested out tap being tested are safer
than regular cars right now today we've
only had like one accident there was a
Tesla accident though to that just like
it's big news on road show yesterday
that a tesla car auto parked itself and
it went under his back of a semi as the
semi was like too high right over
overhanging equipment or something so
there you know sensors they got to work
on those sensors gotta work on those
sensors a we will be talking about the
apple iphone 7 blueprint we will get to
that but there's still a little bit of
news that is more current and more
relevant to what's happening this week
so hold on to your panties periscope
someone's like blueprints blueprints
look I don't hear about the blueprints
awesome blueprints just just calm down
okay this one Apple denies the iTunes
streaming music shut down this is a
report from digital music news that came
out I believe was it yesterday or two
days ago yeah yeah it was the I users
yesterday or two days ago according to
their sources check this out Apple is
planning on terminating music downloads
from iTunes within two years ha within
two years now this was this yeah right
this is this is a thing where people
were instant like what what's going to
happen to my music collection what if
I'm someone like right here me who buys
music who wants to own their music how
is that going to change things do I like
this do I not like this so what it comes
down to at least in the story according
their sources is that a range of
shutdown time tables are being
considered by Apple this is according to
the digital music news one executive
noted these are basically conversations
this person reportedly was privy to and
then told digital music news over a
phone call not even via email they
didn't want any written record of this
stuff because of the sensitivity of it
this the report says one executive know
that keeping itunes music downloads
running forever isn't really on the
table anymore also under discussion is a
plan to ride the itunes music download
offering out for the next three to four
years maybe longer when paid music
downloads are likely to be an after
in streaming in a streaming dominated
industry we see how streaming has taken
off Apple has been late to the party but
at the same time Apple has been really
successful just what in their first six
months or so they their will to lock
down 13 million active subscribers
that's of Apple music with the
projection of 20 million I think some
time by I don't know if it was by the
end of this year but I think yeah by the
end of the year twenty million subs pain
subscribers are expected by then but
just to give you an idea also of the
numbers here that we're talking about
with itunes music downloads now current
downloads are still estimated to be
worth around six hundred million dollars
in 2019 all right this is forecasting
but that's a huge difference during its
peak right when everyone was downloading
and purchasing music itunes revenue
brought in 3.9 billion dollars Wow so
the only and went from 3.9 billion to
what is it to a projection 600 million
in 2019 oh that's a huge drop we know
that streaming services are really
filling that void replace and I know
that's I feel like I feel like I'm one
of the few people that doesn't have
doesn't subscribe to streaming service
tonight amazon prime yeah I do but I
don't use it Apple muse our amazon prime
nothing baby it's like look amazon prime
is build everybody's hand into it but
it's not you know integrated into the
ecosystem the way that I like it sort of
is though like if you get the app if you
get the Amazon Prime music app yes it'll
take it'll in take all your itunes music
which is nice stuff which is cool which
is nice so it does it does work it's
always that whole thing of like okay do
I want to give not give but have all my
music then transfer to another app I
know you know it's it's a pain I'm sorry
I'm still old squid if you want to
stream you know if you want to stream
new stuff that Amazon Prime has then
then the app is that's the way to do it
if you don't have like Spotify or
something like that and I get the whole
debate trust me but I just at the end of
the day am I going if I stop how about
this everyone will argue that you will
never stop subscribing to a music music
subscription once you do it and I say
yes you're right and
you can have this entire library of
music accessible you at any time yeah
and I'm like yeah you're right but then
it also can go away but that's also so
much I don't know yeah it can go it can
dig it can go at the same time maybe I
should just stop being an old futz and
just in addition to buying my music just
subscribe as well in fact I think I'm
gonna start a Kickstarter so I'm just on
a GoFundMe I'm gonna start of go fund me
pay for Brian Thomas Apple music
subscribe to get music now YouTube you
know it's music is everywhere so I see
why their numbers are dipping I totally
makes sense it totally makes sense now
again Apple offered a rare response to
this report regarding the itunes
download shut down they let me see if I
can find the actual quote from Apple oh
here they go in response to the article
they said it is not true we are not
shutting down iTunes downloads per your
story yesterday this is according to
media executive Tom newmar yeah he
didn't say in two years or in three
years he just said we're not shutting
iTunes downloads through your story
today today the periscope looks like
it's flipping out so I don't know if
it's still working or not but it's like
blinking and doing weird things to me
right now oh well get going on it's okay
it's fine people that are listening two
days later really don't care in fact if
we talk about periscope too much let me
know no periscope is cool because
they're gonna start archiving videos
finally that's true so you're the
hashtag save on it yeah all these
beautiful apple byte we'll see archived
youtubers you can roll your eyes like
you guys get to the deficit going get
the show all right um I do want to
follow up on one more itunes thing
before we get to the iphone 7 blueprint
set miss some of you are waiting so Oh
anxiously for we talked about that
itunes issue where a blog post described
how a gentleman's pretty much entire
music collection was deleted or he
believed was deleted there's a lot of
back and forth so there's a report that
are saying look it didn't delete them
you might have made a different
selection when choosing to either remove
music from the cloud or delete your song
entirely but serenity Caldwell from I'm
or did this really great article that
digs into it and really kind of gets to
what might be the root of the problem
and it looks like it could be an iTunes
bug not Apple music that may be to blame
for the disappearing music libraries now
that doesn't make anyone feel better
about this right well a little bit makes
a little bit little I mean like it
wasn't deliberate yeah it is well let's
hope it can be fixed because here's the
thing about the bug based on multiple
support threads it appears that a recent
version of itunes twelve point three
point three okay this was at some point
after march 21st the update affected a
small amount of people and here's some
of the conditions that may have been in
place that causes first of all you
subscribe to apple music at some point
you updated to itunes twelve point three
point three not only was it a our
gentleman was their friend up i forgot
his first name mr. pink stone and then
another designer robert a trop etre
polski said that their collection also
disappeared the update appears to have
wiped parts of their music library due
to a database error because apple music
had already uploaded and matched their
collection and it's still presented the
user a complete library but then when
they clicked on it it ended up
downloading the cloud stored version of
that song which is not the original
version and it is a more compressed
version and then their native original
version went missing so it could be a
bug it's not affecting everybody it is
affecting a few people more of the story
like we said last week back up your
collection collections everything you
have oh yeah and if you are using apple
music i'm still although it kind of
cripples some of the features i still
like I recommended turn off the iCloud
music library function and at least
you'll be able to stream music but not
use it in the same way that you can
where you can access it all the time so
um you know I just wanted to do a
follow-up to let you guys know we don't
leave we didn't want to leave it hanging
there what happened to that thing it
looks like it might be a bug thank God
yeah yeah you're saying thank God a bug
that they can fix that did not affect
you I got lucky this arrived no I'd
still did I do have some problems like
you try to launch you know we talked
about it last week you try to launch the
Apple the ipod app and it like takes a
while you know it's like thinking like
it needs a connection or something of
course of course it takes a while ok
let's get on to more the the moment you
have all been waiting for the new iphone
7 and 7 plus drawings this these are
based on blueprint CAD drawings that
were released by on leaks online who
have had a pretty reputable Pat history
you can scroll down on that beach him
just to show people they were posted on
you switch and what they show off our
two iphones the iphone 7 and the iphone
7 plus according to the report these are
blueprints from as as recently as
january of this year that showed the
2mon models now if you've been following
those reports have said that there might
actually be three different phones and
iphone 7 and iphone 7 plus an iphone 7
pro and the rumors were i was like dude
Apple you are not making that is the
best thing you could ever do then the
plus would have liked the snazzy dual
lens camera the smart connector on the
back that's you can find on the iPad but
what happened now is that these
blueprints and other reports are kind of
following and connecting to it are now
saying that Apple will not release three
phones in fact they're going to release
a iphone 7 which is pretty much you know
a semi redesign a faster processor but
the iphone 7 plus the 5.5 inch screen
model is the one that will get the dual
lens camera and will also get the smart
connector so again though this is still
an issue to me that they are still
making now they're making two phones at
two different sizes with two different
feature sets in two different and
cameron different camera different
cameras on the lenses allegedly going to
still be protruding from the surface it
won't have that metal ring that we're
used to but it will still protrude
somewhat nipple nipple we got the iphone
apple but again look when i see this now
even if this camera is hot sauce i am
not a 5.5 inch screen person
me I am completely not that guy although
I do have big hands ayala we did confirm
this actually my hands are larger than
yours I think you Adam lower lower no
and up higher way hm do you really want
to do this again or not I do you want to
walk away we want to walk away with a
hold hands you want to walk away from
this dog okay but again this is like I'm
feel like Donald Trump haha you tell him
you have small hands okay that mess
that's a personal problem 73 cameras
iphone 7 three cameras uh but again
different this would not entice me to
upgrade to a 5.5 inch screen which means
I'm gonna tell you right now unless it
has some killer feature that I need to
have just from a review standpoint I
would lean towards at this moment
probably not needing to upgrade the
iphone there was although I cover the
iphone all the time there was one year I
think it was the five to the 5s I did
not upgrade my phone because it was just
like a little slightly better camera
yeah at that time I went to the sixth of
the success because I thought 3d touch
is amazing which it is but it's being
underutilized so it is success to the
seven and you're telling me I have to
get the 5.5 inch screen it's too big for
that uncomfortable it's hard to hold
we'll see but that is not compelling at
all I'll tell you like a light row
camera no re cameras who knows it only
has its only have to you know you might
get a adept you might be able to do some
level yeah in that what is it the deep
focus thing deep focus you'll you'll
have better you can have one that is um
you have a wider range one could be deal
with lighting you know lower low light
levels better and it will kind of like
combine the attributes of both cameras
together it won't they won't be exactly
the same lens in each camera they'll be
able to do different things like maybe a
macro lens there's a feature where
they're talking about how you could take
a picture and then click on what a
zoomed version of it would look like
versus a wide version of it in one move
I mean we'll see what happens we'll see
how they actually use this we don't know
yet vr just kidding you know we are
happily a pipeline on we are there
they're way behind there
but I'm not hating I'm just saying the
fact okay this is so if you're not
excited about the iphone 7 which I it
really just like kind of breaks my heart
when I see that I'm like okay I'm
definitely gonna wait look 2017 is the
10th anniversary of the iphone and if
you're telling me that Apple is not
gonna go big and go large oh yeah on the
10th anniversary of the iphone they are
going to do something special I feel
like they have to do something special
especially since what we've seen up this
point is just not very special so
according to John Gruber he's a covered
APPL forever he's an apple blogger he
has his podcast called the talk show it
doesn't have as high star ratings as the
apple byte extra crunchy for the record
but not even close no it's honestly not
even close but I will show him love
because he does have a podcast in his
podcast he talked about how he's heard
rumors and scuttlebutt from inside
sources that the 2017 tenth anniversary
edition iphone will include an
edge-to-edge display that eliminates the
top and bottom bezel so those that what
we call like the forehead and the chin
those big black lines on the iPhone
those will be completely gone there'll
be a front-facing camera touch ID and
the sensors will all be hidden under the
display is that with this video is this
video is like kind of a rough concept
idea of what it might look like and
don't look at the back of this is just
someone's rather horrible the back
littoral what the front is cool because
kind of neat it was edge to edge it is
nice now there's a few things that line
up with this idea Apple is rumored and
report it not even rumored it's reported
that they made a deal with samsung 40
LED display screens a flexible OLED scan
wrap to the edges we've seen that with
Samsung already so 2017 is that that's
in place already okay so that component
is in place we've already seen
technology from algae that exists that a
touchscreen sensor without a physical
button is going to be available so that
tech is already out there in Apple's
most likely working on it and apple has
patents for that they've applied for for
using your fingerprint through a
touchscreen panel without any physical
button so you only see the sum of the
that looks like that but watch right
there yeah it does but you see some of
these bread crumbs that lead to the fact
that they can't do this it's just a
matter of will we see this in 2017 but
that would at least be a design that
makes you go huh I wouldn't be happy to
get rid of the home button because you
know my kids get my phone and they like
mess up the home button sewn are you
gonna lock out your kids from your phone
and not give them access to your their
feet like you're gonna give them no code
and no fingerprint access no see that's
what I thought that's what that's so you
are they are still gonna be able to use
your phone they'll be able to I have to
unlock it for that okay what dad dad is
the whole not having the button cuz you
know my son will have like peanut butter
and like push the bad I'm like ah you
got peanut butter my home button buddy
so uh yeah that'll solve that problem
example the thing about what you just
described is that that I feel that
affects me as an adult yeah I mean it
affects everybody not just children with
peanut butter but what about me with
peanut butter on my finger what about
you with jelly I mean everything jelly
in a letter in there peanut butter what
is it peanut but what's that song okay
peanut peanut butter and jelly jelly
jelly you know that's all peanut no no
jelly someone's gonna be like yo I know
that song that's my missing links and
this is all right um let's jump over the
Siri Siri has improved over time it's
getting better I feel it's a lot better
still not the best but don't you think
it's a lot better beach yeah ya series
definitely a lot better a lot more
helpful and she's not a me faster though
agreed it's it's not as fast as Google's
google voice oh yeah middle voice
Cortana is actually pretty darn smart
but this is a cool story from the
Washington Post the creators of Siri who
sold it to apple apple acquired them
that technology have now created their
kind of next generation or the next
evolution of Siri where they call viv
myself coding assistant now viv is tight
okay you guys and gals if you haven't
seen anything like this you need to look
up viv they showed up a demo at New
York's disrupt just look up on like
YouTube viv disrupt New York and what it
is it's think of it we do queries for
cereal
what's the temperature today but viv is
able to on the fly do multiple layers of
this using third-party plugins as well
as the technology itself so for example
instead of saying what's the weather on
Thursday they did an example like what
was the weather two weeks ago at five
o'clock did it hit 70 degrees like the
cool multilayers but then let's take
this beyond just like weather right
they're able to show off things like I
like to book a fancy hotel room on labor
day weekend in this city for three
nights and then it through their
partnership with hotels.com it popped up
options for basically like deluxe hotels
on those days and instead of having to
like select multiple prompts through
that an app you could just basically say
yes or no or even some or ordering a
pizza what was crazy is ordering a pizza
pulling the data and options from
something like a grub hub and you being
able to be like add pepperoni take
pepperoni off add pineapples put extra
cheese as it's going on through your
voice purely and then it orders you that
pizza it's delivered to your door like
it actually is a live working product
that has has been working for them
that's awesome so I don't like to talk
to people a lot you know so you just
talk to my phone and we get detailed and
granular that'd be killer but it was
very detailed it's worth checking out I
thought it was pretty slick can you ask
good stuff like do I need to wear a
jacket today I think serious answers
questions like that yeah but that's I
mean that's pretty straightforward yeah
sure it's 40 degrees put on a jacket
like thanks Siri you know like I could
actually open the weather app and look
at the temperature and decide if I need
a jacket faster than probably Siri can
answer that we should actually have a
test yeah we should do something right
do right now let's try it I don't know
it's gonna take too long okay you look
at your phone I can't look at my phone
it's periscoping dude Oh or it's like
crash periscope I don't even know if
it's working right now I can't see in it
just blinking all the time it's probably
crash next time next time do your test
okay thank you French again and just to
wrap this up before we hit the phone
calls my new favorite thing have you
check the g board out Beachum have you
checked out g board the new google
keyboard specifically for iOS i have not
but i watch whole update lee crap very
interesting holy crap ok Mike can I may
I argue to say this is a game changer is
it I've been using it I've been getting
used to it does take a little time to
get used to but I don't know for those
of you that use text messaging on your
iPhone natively you have that bar that
shows like the predictive text of words
that you're able to right now this g ki
g board keyboard is an app that you can
download for free and then you have to
install it as a keyboard and give it
full access which is great but what
allows you to do is the little g logo
pops up where that line of predictive
texts and it allows you to directly from
your keyboard my friend ok I it has
built-in search that's built in google
search that shows results and fields
awesome you can obviously do whether um
ok this was a fun one some people might
think this is annoying when i type in
words it has predictive emojis so if i
say like when did you lose your key the
key emoji shows up as an option ok how
tight is that ok that's fun you can turn
all the stuff off it also has what they
call glide typing which is basically
like the swype keyboard this is all
integrated on one keyboard that you can
use on iOS i'm not a fan of glide typing
stuff well you don't have to use it
though my friend I'm just saying it's an
option ok I'm just saying it's an option
then also hello gif or gif searching is
built directly into the keyboard just
like so important because ok this
everything the we don't we don't have
emotions anymore yes we have gift
motions man it's like we don't we don't
know how to express ourselves anymore
because we're so uncomfortable doing
will let it will let a video do it for
me ok we'll do a five-second clip will
unable you to know how I feel now this
is cool you can customize it yeah you
can customize turning off those things
that you want or don't want my telly I
like how they turned off block offensive
word look if you guys want to just put
eyes and gals want to play with a new
keyboard try the G board I want to know
how you feel about it I've been using it
now for what three or four days we
didn't make it explained to me isn't an
app in the App Store yes oh okay when
you in
stall any keyboard on your phone oh yeah
okay you have to doubt it's basically
like an app you download first and then
you go into your settings general
keyboard you add the keyboard there's an
option that says allow full access and
then you can do it so like I have a bit
moji hey what do you ever on the bit
moji train I don't think so it's
annoying when you have friends that all
they do is use bit mo geez I'm like
you're a loser like i don't i do i'll
drop a bit moji on someone like once a
week at the most but i like you know you
got people that like every line is like
when they're happier can't see you or
you too man it's like all bit modem like
this is disturbing man this is stupid so
it's okay so on my phone I have like a
little emoji keyboard would there be
another button next to that that's a
little Google so you keep on pricing
that global key to change the keyboard
and we'll end up on the G board i see
okay and then you by leaving it there
it's kind of like the default yeah i'm
just saying try it how about this Beach
get it and the next week's show I want
to know how you've what you feel like
how you like it because it's some
homework it takes yeah it takes a little
time to get used to we want to know what
you guys and gals think about the g
board as well I i think it's freaking
boss I might get tired of it but I still
think it's really good if their search
there cuz I'm to actually leaving you
know I'll leave like a chat app to go
search for something i said i'm probably
and now i have to do that so dude you
can throw a map like let's say you want
to go to a restaurant you type in the
restaurant you hit there and you can
send them the direct map direction and
they just click on and go to it you
leave the app at all Booya Booya G board
keyboard what's up that's cool ok shall
we um get to the calls the people are
people do people like the g board
keyboard i don't know we'll see what
they say let's see um hang on my
computer just decided to freeze oh
that's great at the very key moment here
give me a like the most definitive
moment could possibly the time i get to
shine when I play the voicemails alright
I'm seeing here I love g board why isn't
there a google extra crunchy because
someone's right because Apple Grandin
ghoul no no we're talking about it right
we're in talks maybe like Kyra
Paul's all oh my god Brian yours wasting
time here is there anything important to
discuss we're talking about real stuff
here all right I got I got the voice
mails okay let's the first one is from
our tell in Indianapolis they
you for calling whoops what is happening
I screwed it up Bryan you did not just
well hang tight I'm listening I think
they got deleted on accident when the
computer just froze on my gosh okay so
if I remember off the top of my head I
believe are telling Indianapolis he
asked us is the nine point what are my
thoughts in the 9.7 inch iPad pro right
yes that is correct and so I'm sorry we
can't hear the voicemail but I will tell
you that I actually as someone who has
an ipad in the past if you have like a
to an air I gotta fix i fixed it is it
let's do it let's you sorry guys I found
him all right here we go hey Brian and
Stephan and this is our tell from
Indianapolis I was wondering if you
could give me some information on your
show if you get to my question about the
new Apple TV offering 4k video with some
type of 4k streaming service through
apple I was wondering about this because
like I said before I am not buying the
apple TV unless s 4k thank you very much
for your help and I love you guys a show
have a great day of mine see I'm glad we
had our tells actual voicemail because i
confuse him with another hour tell we
love you too bro thank you thank you for
listening and being a part of the show
first of all the app the current Apple
TV has an a8 processor based on those
requirements at least the way that Apple
poses it you are it is not able to
stream any 4k Ultra HD content as of now
and so really until they either lift
that requirement the fact of the matter
is that you're probably going to have to
wait for the next Apple TV whenever that
is whether it's in a year or so for them
to give us the 4k ability it was one of
my major complaints about the product
because we have iphones that record 4k
4k I'm gonna put my two quotation marks
around we have iphones that record 4k
video how awesome would it be for us to
stream directly from our iphone through
our apple TV 4k video on our TV
that's just a logical like ecosystem fun
cool thing but we can't because they put
an a processor in there so right now the
answer is no if you that's really your
deciding factor and what's important
don't do it right now and just wait till
the next one and I gave it a bad apple
before so it's now it's when it went
it's the badness has lasted so long i
I'm kind of leaning more towards SAT
Apple here's a here's a bad album
that's the better that's a does bad
apple a scary apple all right next call
okay next call is from keegan in canada
alberta he says the country backwards
and then the state so let's see hi Brian
and Stephan my name's Keegan i'm calling
from canada alberta and i just wanted to
ask you guys what your opinion was on
the ipad pro 9.7 and more importantly if
you know if there's a way to exchange a
32 gigabyte version for the 128 gigabyte
version unfortunately i thought i had
enough space and I just don't thanks so
much love the podcast you guys have such
phenomenal banter have yourself a great
day alright alright so let me tell you
this my friend I do like I actually like
the ipad pro first of all the 12 point
nine inch iPad pro I love what I don't
love about his Apple four months later
put that freaking true tone display in
the 9.7 and left me just like what the
hell what why would you do that I still
on my iPad pro 12.9 I use it all the
time I read comics all the time I it's
not worth okay how about this if you
don't read comics you don't watch movies
and you're not traveling a lot the
twelve point nine inch may not make
sense for you because it's expensive um
and I guess I did buy it myself the 9.7
inch great ipad if you're someone who's
owned an earlier one it has always been
looking to upgrade and has just been
like man this is good enough this is
more than good enough and it's been
years and you still want to get one I
actually feel comfortable with
recommending it if you really want
upgrade but if you don't really care
about the two-tone display and all your
apps are running fine like most people
are you still don't really need upgrade
it yeah Andre in the in the YouTube chat
says I pred ipad pro needs OSX well ipad
pro needs an iOS x they need an io 6i
they need they need io sex and also
canada has provinces not states my
apologies kannada wii u you
mispronounced their name also just then
i like to call it you're such a
not only do they not have States you
also miss it's good nada a hey hey so
yeah oh also as in for your effect of
returning that if you bought it within
15 days of apples return policy 15 15
days baby you can return it they will
not charge a restocking fee and then you
could upgrade that if you're maybe
within a month you can get on your knees
and beg and kiss their feet and maybe
tell them how many apple products you've
bought in the past I always like to use
this against them i buy applecare all
the time on all my stuff so I always
like if I have something show my dude i
buy applecare and all my products you
can check and they're like okay we'll
take care of you and now I'm like by the
way you might recognize me from such
shows as they're like no we don't

gonna talk about this on my show ah damn
