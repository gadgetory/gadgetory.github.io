today we're going to be talking about
smooth top cooktops or range tops we'll
be using the Samsung any 5 8 f 9 7 1 0
WS as an example to show you some
visualization of some of the features
that we're going to talk about now I
know that this Samsung model is a full
range that includes an oven we'll talk
more about that in another video but you
can also buy these smooth tops as just a
cooktop that will lay down into your
counter space as you can see electric
smooth tops have a very sleek kind of
sexy appliance appearance people really
like this they like the look and they
like the feel in their kitchen it's a
very modern looking appliance this
particular cooktop is controlled by
dials as you can see and they go from
low to high you can also find smooth top
cook tops that are controlled by touch
pads or buttons or dials that may be
placed on the cooktop itself so there's
a lot of variety there and it really
comes down to what your preference is
most smooth top cook services will come
with four or five burners in the case of
this model there are five the one of
them is meant really primarily for
warming and in a lot of cases they'll
come in a couple of sizes this one has
three sizes there's a small a medium and
a large but a lot of other smooth top
burners will be in just to kind of a
larger burner size and then the medium
and they alternate another thing that
people really like about smooth top
stoves and cook tops is that they will
indicate to you when the burner is still
warm
sometimes with electric coil stoves and
certainly with gas stoves this isn't
always the case but most smooth talks
have an indicator that has lights
underneath it that will shine when the
surface is hot to the touch there's a
feature that's newer in comparison to
other models this one features it it's
called the bridge when it's activated it
joins two burners next to each other
into one long kind of oval-shaped burner
that's really good for griddles so if
you're making pancakes your griddle be
evenly heated all the way across rather
than just in the front in the back with
a cold spot in the middle
it's important to note with smooth top
cooking surfaces be they in a range or
just a countertop drop in but you should
never use cast-iron as it scratches nor
should you use stoneware or glass
cooking materials as they will also
scratch this is a complaint that we
should note that many people have about
smooth tops they do scratch easily they
are prone to it but you can buff a lot
of them out and they can be really
easily cleaned with solution that you
can buy at any hardware or grocery store
they kind of fit in a middle ground
between electric coil stoves and gas
stoves gas stoves are lauded for their
really even cooking electric coils get a
lot of complaints for having hot spots
on the bottom of your cookware these
glass tops because there's no balancing
issues with the actual coil itself it's
concealed under this ceramic glass top
they ride somewhere in the middle in
terms of even cooking for both their
utility and sleek appearance a lot of
people find electric smooth top stoves
to be their ideal kitchen appliance
