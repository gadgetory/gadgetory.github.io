want to build an ecosystem of Google
cast ready apps and Google cast ready
devices that so that's why we're excited
that Google cast supports coming to
Android TV devices as devices roll out
later this year Google cast is designed
to work of the most popular devices you
find in a home today in fact in the last
30 days almost 50% of chrome casts were
used by devices from multiple platforms
one of my favorite features of
chromecast is that it works with my
friends and family because they can use
their own devices well today we're
announcing a new feature to make that
even easier by allowing others to cast
your TV without needing to be on the
same Wi-Fi network so I have a que here
on stage with me and let's say a que is
over at my house and he wants to use his
phone to share or cast one of his
favorite YouTube videos to my TV now
normally I need to share my Wi-Fi pass
with them but sometimes are long and
complicated or I don't remember it well
with this new feature a que can still
take out his phone and open up the
YouTube app and you'll see in the top
right E is only connected to the
cellular network but you still see the
cast button simply press the button and
well out it could allow him to connect
to nearby devices now in a few seconds
his phone will connect to chromecast
through the cloud and that's it so now
he can control the video pause the video
play the video just if it just says if
he was on my same Wi-Fi network so how
do we do it we're using a variety of
different technologies which allows us
to authenticate users in the same room
as a chromecast and if for whatever
reason we can't automatically detect or
that occasion you will ask for a pin
that will always be present on the
screen so now you can invite all your
friends over to your house kick back and
let them cast your TV without any
friction or hassle it makes chromecast
and even more social experience now this
is an opt-in feature so you always have
control over who can cast to your TV
we'll be rolling this out to all Android
users later this year and developers
will get this for free by the Google
cast
became so we also spent a lot of time
thinking about new use cases for the
television for example today lots of
people talk about the five hours per day
people watch TV what about the 19 hours
per day your TV's just a blank empty
screen with chromecast
we want to make use of this large
beautiful canvas so we start with
something really simple a feed of scenic
images that's been gradually expanding
over time today we're announcing the new
Google Katz ambient experience and we
call it backdrop it just takes a minute
to set up and you can do it from any iOS
or Android device in this case we're
going to use an iPhone 5 for the demo
and we have the feed accelerated just
for the demo purposes so you can see
more images so let's go ahead and open
up the chromecast app and you see
backdrops a new option in the app drawer
and from here you can personalize the
feed to match your own interests and
tastes well the top feature requests
we've gotten is ability to add your own
personal photos to the ambient feature
well now you can so we turn on photos
you can select from one or multiple
Google+ photo albums and in a few
seconds you'll start seeing my personal
photos show up right on the TV screen
it's that simple so we also have a lot
more topics we want to give you an
infinite source of great and beautiful
images one of my favorites is one called
places which brings geospatial images
from Google Maps to your TV these
satellite photos give you a totally
different perspective on how you can see
the world it's really amazing leave it
on for a really long time we also have
other topics like news and lifestyle and
Google+ featured photos when my other
favorite topics is art which includes
artwork from famous museums and
collections from around the world
including the Getty Museum the National
Museum of women in the arts and now my
TV's a beautiful set of paintings every
topic is curated to make sure we're
showing high quality and safe safe
images and every user has a bility
control which topics show up on the TV
now gently I'm gonna leave this in the
background of my house
but let's say one of the images catches
my eye and I want to learn more a little
bit more info about it I can use Google
Voice Search to always learn more what's
on my chromecast
for every topic will show a synchronized
card that will show you relevant
information and relevant actions so in
this case I can learn more about any
artists of the painting backdrop brings
your TV to life even when you're not
actively using it and we're looking
forward to working with third parties
for third-party developers to actually
bring in their own topics into the feed
backdrop will roll out to all chromecast
users later this summer so finally one
of the big advantages of the Google cast
model is that we can start thinking
beyond traditional use cases of the TV
like video for example your phone and
your tablet have unlimited possibilities
and there's many times we want to bring
those experiences and extend them to the
TV well to help accelerate that shift
we're launching a new Google cast
feature that allows you to mirror any
Android device to to your television so
to start mirroring just go to your
chromecast app on your Android device
and select cast screen and from here
everything on your phone will just show
up on the tip on the TV it's that simple
no cables or wires needed now we built
our own protocol to reduce latency and
frame drops so the experience feels
really natural and smooth and now you
can share anything on the big screen so
let me give one example a real-life
example I had a few months ago and I
using Google Earth I was planning a
family trip to Maui later in the year
and I want to show my four-year-old
daughter where Maui is on the map so
instead of huddling on my small phone I
ended up open up Google Earth and
projected rights to TV so let's type in
Molokini one of my favorite snorkeling
destinations in Maui and as you can see
it's a totally different experience to
navigate the world with my daughter on
the biggest screen in the house it you
can play with this for hours we'll be
rolling out this initially in beta as
devices get updated latest version of
Google Play services which will happen
over the next few weeks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
