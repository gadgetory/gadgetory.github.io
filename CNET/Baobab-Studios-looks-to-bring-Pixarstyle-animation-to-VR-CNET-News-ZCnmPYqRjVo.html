virtual reality you can get a taste of
what that might be like with invasion a
short VR animation by Baio Bob Studios
it's available for oculus rift HTC vive
or the Samsung gear VR i sat down with
CEO Maureen fan and Eric Darnell
director of animated movies like ants
and the Madagascar series to see what it
takes to make a virtual reality short
instead of looking at a rectangular
screen and in a dark Theater you're now
actually in that world so what is it
like to be underwater in finding you or
like you're actually there and you're
participating in the story in the case
of invasion because you are characters
Eric can you show me anything
specifically that you used visually in
order to like direct the viewers
attention one way or the other
absolutely so here you see this Bunny's
coming out of the rocks
well first you has to escape from this
Hawk that's got looking for lunch
but once the hawk takes off the bunny
comes out and we hear her sound that
pulls your eye over there hopefully and
the bunny spots you and looks you right
in the eye now she looks off screen and
that invites us to see what she's seeing
what is she looking at and so everybody
wants to see what the bunny sees and
there's also a sound cue of that little
ships are breaking the sound barrier
which also gives us this cue in VR the
sound is spatialized so you know that
that sound of that ship is coming from
right over there behind those trees in
Maya a tool for creating computer
graphics animators look out character
movements then they put on a VR headset
and watch the animation in real time to
see what it looks like in 3d and so once
we we sort of have that how we like it
then we pass it over to the lighting
team who begins putting all the
finishing touches on everything
Google's spotlight stories and the
oculus story studio from Facebook are
also working on animated films for VR
headsets for us especially for real-time
devices like the more advanced headsets
we can change things on the fly so we
can react to what a viewer does and have
a care
to move in space in a way that's
different than they might for the next
viewer what was the most exciting or the
most thrilling part about working in VR
there was one guy who said I look back
and I saw the bunny hiding behind me and
I wanted to then see what the aliens
were doing so I turned to look at the
aliens and I know I was just standing in
your office but I could still feel the
bunny's presence behind me almost like I
can feel her breath on the back of my
neck it was probably the air
conditioning blowing or something but
that's some of the sort of reptile brain
stuff that VR can really dig deep and
and and get to those places of your of
your brain that I think other mediums
can't because it does feel so much like
you're really there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
