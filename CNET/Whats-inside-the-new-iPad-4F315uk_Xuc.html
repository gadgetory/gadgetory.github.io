shocked full of iPad announcement news
I'm Bridget Carey on cnet com and it's
time to get loaded Apple's newest iPad
is just called the new iPad it looks the
same as the ipad 2 but the big update is
in the hardware the screen has been
updated to a Retina display which
doubles the iPad screen resolution it's
a better screen than any current tablet
or laptop it also has a better camera on
the back with 5 megapixels and the
camera can take video in 1080p HD
there's also a faster quad-core
processor and that means better gaming
graphics the Wi-Fi only model starts at
the same price 499 and now there's a
version for a 4G LTE connection with
verizon or AT&amp;amp;T starting at six hundred
twenty nine dollars Apple is taking
presale orders online and the new iPad
hit stores on Friday March 16th also
noteworthy with the new ipad apple says
the battery can still ask for 10 hours
and on 4g it can last for nine hours
that's impressive considering most
gadgets suffer a battery drain when
tapping into 4G connection speeds but it
does weigh just slightly more than the
ipad 2 and what about siri the voice
command personal assistant will not be
in the new ipad instead there's a simple
voice dictation app that will turn
speech to text in typical apple style
most of the presentation focused around
the software and what users can create
Apple has brought a five-dollar photo
editing application to iPads called I
photo which has features like
multi-touch editing of a pitcher there's
also updates to the video editing app I
movie and the music creation app
GarageBand in GarageBand players connect
to iCloud and can have a jam session
with four other iOS device users and so
what about the ipad tube well all models
have dropped in price by a hundred bucks
apple also announced a new version of
its Apple TV the streaming video box it
will now support 1080p HD video and will
cost the same as the previous version
for ninety-nine dollars available also
on March 16 movies and TV shows and
iTunes will now be playable in 1080p
and users can redownload their purchases
to the higher resolution now there is
other tech news besides the iPad let's
turn to a nemesis of Apple Samsung at a
spring product launch event in New York
Samsung showed off its smart interaction
televisions which respond to hand
gestures and voice commands to change
the channels or browse the web and these
TVs will come with a remote control that
has a touchpad and no number keypad the
remote also has a built-in microphone to
listen to spoken commands Samsung is
also coming out with a Bluetooth
keyboard that works with Smart TVs and
it's galaxy line of tablets those are
your headlines for today I'm Richard
Carey for cnet.com and you've just been
loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
