right now deserves the label next big
thing as much as smart wearables
especially in the fitness category the
Flex consists of a flexible rubbery band
and a tiny tracker module which sits
inside this gadget goes well beyond your
average pedometer to measure sleep you
tuck the one into a special cloth arm
strap you wear in bed
jawbone up features a bendable design
crammed with sensors that track
everything from what you eat to when you
sleep it even logs mood swings for
suppose a real alphanumeric OLED screen
another SmartWatch like ability is phone
notifications it runs Android it can
count steps and measure your stride
track your speed and how far you ran and
it also has bluetooth so you can play
music through a wireless headset the
current design darling of activity
monitors is the shine from misfit
wearables that's worn on your wrist
pocket or as a necklace now at this
stage there's a lot of gerrymandering
going on as we all try and figure out
what constitutes the smart wearable
category Fitness wearables smartwatches
and augmented reality glasses all have a
lot of distinctions but also a lot of
overlap part of that is why you'll find
some wild differences in the estimates
of the market size from as much as 4.6
billion dollars this year to as little
as one and a half billion dollars next
year now we had seen that think that
Fitness wearables really broke out
around January 2013 at the Consumer
Electronics Show prior to that this sort
of tech was mostly found in either a
triathletes wrist or in the pages of one
of those dumb Airlines shopping
magazines suddenly though the product
started to speak to the needs of real
people they're all using the currency of
the 3 s's stairs steps and sleep no
longer do you have to be into like body
mass index measurement a CrossFit
profile or a gym membership instead this
is all real relatable to all of us the
smartphone has become a sort of key it
unlocks a lot of the richness of what
the device is learning about you
displaying it on its nice intuitive
interface or also via web services that
lets you not only really get deep into
what's happening but also gamify your
performance against people you know
or the broader user population wearing
that kind of device now as personal as
Fitness wearables are there are at least
two major parties that would love to
look over your shoulder as you use one
first of all a lot of corporations are
now nibbling away at the idea of
incenting you to wear one of these in
exchange for perhaps better health
insurance rates or other benefits they
want to encourage you to be healthy but
they might also then be able to find out
if you're not it'll be an interesting
development in the future secondly
advertisers and marketers would love to
have a look at this data and I have
little doubt they will in some form
let's face it millions and millions of
dollars are wasted marketing weight loss
programs to thin people and sports
drinks to lazy people
this kind of data coming off fitness
devices in real time could really help
to make a lot of that more efficient
bottom line if 2013 set the table for
Fitness wearables as we believe I agree
with Juniper research that 2014 will be
the breakout year for them but as that
happens watch for some interesting
cannibalization because smartwatches are
coming along in parallel most of us I
don't think you're gonna want to wear
one of each but we do want the features
from each who ends up owning that real
estate on your wrist that'll be an
interesting question to watch as we go
in search of the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
