gaming PC and console I'm Dan Ackerman
and this is the Alienware alpha now
we've been hearing about this particular
system for more than a year now it was
originally proposed as part of the steam
machine series so Alienware decided to
take the box they've been working on and
just release it as a Windows 8 desktop
but with a custom UI that gets you into
the steam big picture mode now you can
use a master keyboard but it's really
designed to work with a gamepad you can
use a wired or wireless Microsoft / Xbox
gamepad and here's the custom UI you can
launch into steam that tation into big
picture mode which is the television
version of steam you can go into
settings and you can set your display
resolution and connect to your network
and do a few other things so in the
steam big picture mode any games you
bought through the steam service and
there are thousands of games and a lot
of them are actually very inexpensive
some of them are the same games you can
get on console some of them are ones you
could only play on a PC will all be
listed here you can download them
install them and you can run them and
hopefully if they have this little game
controller icon that means the work well
with the controller I found a bunch of
games that actually don't have that
controller icon I have a keyboard icon
still work fine with the controller now
the catch is this box starts at five
hundred and fifty dollars when it was
first proposed the new gaming consoles
cost you know five hundred dollars like
an Xbox one those prices have come down
since then so this is now at five fifty
still to get into it is more expensive
than the current generation consoles the
components insider are a little
perplexing it's almost better if you
play around with this without knowing
what the parts are because it only has
an intel core i3 processor which you may
think of it's underpowered for gaming
system and the graphics card it's a
modified version of nvidia x' 860m
which is a fine mainstream card you know
not fantastic but the way they've
optimized the processor and the graphics
card actually works really well and I
was able to play brand-new games like
Far Cry 4 on kind of medium as sheddings
that really look great on a television
as opposed to being like on a big super
high-res monitor right up close to your
face and I found it to be you know as
good or or perhaps better than the
console versions in a lot of cases so if
you're willing to take a chance and work
through some setup hiccups we
occasionally had to dig out a mouse to
fix a few things and we had a couple of
problems early on it's a little bit of a
first generation experience with the
custom UI once we work through all that
I actually found this a lot of fun and a
great way to access my huge library of
Steam games and get them all up on my TV
we're frankly it feels more powerful
than connecting to a current gen console</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
