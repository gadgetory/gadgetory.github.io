appliances and today I'm gonna be
talking about the dacor renaissance RN r
P 36 GS the design of the de corte is
actually fairly simple there's no
digital displays there's no time or
clock display all you have are knobs and
two buttons to control the convection
fan and the oven light there's two glad
racks that make it really easy to bake
or roast heavy items like turkeys or
roast beef there's also a wok ring if
you cook with a walk a lot there's also
a griddle that comes with the oven and
some brass burner caps that are really
cool to look at but I don't recommend
cooking with them because they start to
discolor as soon as you use the gas
stove top there were some features
though that I did not like about this
oven first of all the boil toms weren't
really as fast as I thought they would
be for such a half Howard expensive oven
now the broiler plate is located near
the back of the oven so you have to push
all the food that you're trying to
broiled toward the back which feels a
little unnatural since we've always been
taught put your food in the middle of
the oven also it cooked six burgers very
very unevenly the first row that was
closest to the infrared reuler plate was
definitely overcooked
while the burgers in the next row were a
little bit underdone the knobs are
really great and heavy and sturdy to use
but it's a little difficult to see which
knob goes to which burner because of the
location of the little burner key on the
actual stovetop this oven also has a
tricky preheat light that I found really
frustrating to use the light is supposed
to flash on and off once your oven has
reached preheat temperature but I found
that the light would just turn off for
about two minutes or so and then turn
back on for two minutes or so it's a
little confusing unless you're sitting
by the oven watching this light and
whether or not it's coming on and off
now this steak or oven is really pretty
to look at and it's definitely going to
be a showpiece if you decide to include
this
your kitchen however the price is seven
thousand one hundred and thirty dollars
which is more than my car to be honest
there are definitely gas ranges on the
marketplace that deliver a comparable if
not even better oven performance than
this particular day core model
I've definitely look into those before
you decide to invest so much money into
your range
