new Microsoft Surface book with
performance pace it's all about that
base Microsoft's new Surface book is
like last year's a bold design that's
somewhere between tablet and laptop with
a detachable display and a base that has
more serious computing power if you love
the surface books look last year you're
in luck if you thought it was weird well
nothing's really changed with it it has
the same hinge with its odd gap the same
Microsoft Pam which is included in the
same ports thankfully USB 3 an SD card
slot and no USB see but the whole
package is nowhere near as thin and
light as the surface pro 4 this time
Microsoft amps up that performance in a
slightly thicker base it has a better
battery improved nvidia geforce gtx 960
5 mm graphics and a more powerful intel
core i7 processor it doesn't work with
surface pro 4 however but the idea is to
swap bases and tops down the road
perhaps you can't buy that base on its
own that what comes prepackaged with the
top half sorry if you bought a first gen
service book you're out of luck it's
more expensive it finally feels like a
higher-end laptop you're paying for that
privilege the surface book starts at 20
399 with 256 gigabytes of storage and 8
gigs of ram and goes all the way up to
32 99 it's not a VR machine Microsoft
wants to make everything about VR and
mixed reality but the minimum specs for
VR gaming on a PC are higher than what
the new service book can provide so
don't expect to plug in your oculus rift
or HTC vive maybe down the road
Microsoft will aim to make some VR work
with this laptop don't go buying the
surface before VR na go somewhere else
the new service book is a better
computer and a more expensive one but
it's also more of a bump up to last
years than a totally new experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
