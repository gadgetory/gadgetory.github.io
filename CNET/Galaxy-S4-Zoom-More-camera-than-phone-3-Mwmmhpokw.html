galaxy s4 zoom is a point-and-shoot
camera first and a smartphone second I'm
just good all core with Cena let's check
out this crazy phone essentially the
love child of the Internet connected
galaxy camera and the galaxy s4
smartphone the zoom is the only handset
anywhere with the 10 times optical zoom
again the 16 megapixel lens sticks out
two full inches from the phone's face
which is normal for a camera and really
outrageous for a phone that means you
can forget about carrying it in your
pocket and if you do make a call without
using a bluetooth headset yeah as far as
photos go using the zoom is natural and
intuitive on-screen controls zoom in and
out flip the camera and get it settings
and modes smart mode hides a ton of
extra presets you won't find on the
galaxy s4 like a food mode for amping up
your dinner and one to freeze moving
water there are manual controls as well
some more precise or creative
photographers can set things like ISO
white balance and exposure just how they
want when you aren't in the camera
turning the zoom lens is a quick way to
pull up some common modes holding down
the shutter button also opens the camera
app just keep in mind that you have to
unlock the phone before you can take a
photo however if you want to you can set
the s4 zoom to unlock to the camera app
which does save you a step I took some
really good photos with the zooms
automatic settings and extra camera
modes but I took some less successful
shots as well sometimes zooming in made
people and objects look out of focus but
other times it was very very clear
pictures of texts were especially good
with really crisp writing overall I was
happy to use and share the majority of
my photos as for video the zoom captures
nice smooth 1080p HD clips the 1.9
megapixel front-facing camera is also
capable of recording 720p HD video which
is really good for video chats the
zooming camera lens is clearly the main
event here but the zoom is also a
capable android phone even if it is
incredibly awkwardly shaped like the
galaxy s4 the zoom runs android 4.2
jelly bean but it also has a smaller 4.3
inch screen compared to the s4 s5
insurer and a dual-core processor
instead of a quad-core chip it still has
the same android apps though and it
still has the IR blaster that you can
use as a TV remote there's also a
microSD card slot that can take up to 64
gigabytes in external storage because of
its enormous size the zoom really is a
niche device that isn't for everyone
instead it's going to be best for
budding photographers will already carry
around a point and shoot and it would
rather consolidate to just one device if
you're a serious photographer then I
don't think the zoom is going to replace
your higher power DSLR I will say that
it is a fun cool idea that yield some
better than average photos but for most
people the awkwardly large handset just
isn't practical for day-to-day use I'm
Jessica doll court for cnet you can
