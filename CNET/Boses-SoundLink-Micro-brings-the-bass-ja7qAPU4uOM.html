smallest and least expensive Bluetooth
speaker yet it cost $110 and comes in
three color options black midnight blue
and bright orange this speaker is fully
waterproof it's ipx7 certified so it can
be completely submerged and while it may
be small it does have a bit of heft to
it
weighing in at 10 ounces or 290 grams
with a built-in speakerphone for making
calls its claim to fame is that not only
is it very durable but it also produces
what bo says is unmatched sound for its
size
overall I was impressed by its build
quality and liked its integrated tear
resistant strap which you can use to
clip the speaker on to a bag or just
about anything else you want to clip it
on to including your bikes handlebars
there's a battery life indicator near
the microUSB charging port and volume
controls on the speaker plus a
multi-function button for controlling
playback battery life is rated at 6
hours which is pretty standard for this
type of speaker in my test the speaker
maintained a rock-solid Bluetooth
connection and you can wirelessly link
it with other Bose sound like speakers
using the Bose Connect app as far as the
sound goes I was most impressed by how
much bass the little guy was able to
output for its size it doesn't offer the
sound quality of Bose is larger more
expensive bluetooth speakers including
the Soundlink mini 2 but in terms of
low-end performance delivers
significantly more bass and volume than
JBL's clip 2 and other essentially
pocketable speakers don't expect it to
al class similarly price speakers like
the JBL flip 4 but it is a lot smaller
and even easier to carry around I'm
