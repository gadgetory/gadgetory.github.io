with cnet com and joining me here today
is Game Director for the order 1886 Dana
Jan here from ready at dawn studios and
you know this is a game that we're all
really excited about but you know when
we talk about this game the order what
everyone has talked about is the look
and the feel what are some of those
things that you guys tried to achieve
the ability to in real time put you in
positions in the gameplay and in the
story where you feel like wow I'm really
in this world I really belong here I
understand what's going on and it feels
more realistic than anything I've seen
before so this weapon here that I've got
is called the arc induction lance and
it's a weapon that was designed by Tesla
and when you hold our two but now it was
not designed by test it was designed by
Tesla I'm serious no that's one of the
cool elements of our story is that Tesla
actually decided that he was going to
help the order design weaponry through
some of the technologies that he was
dabbling in their stuff to be in range
and they just let it go pretty much and
it's if you just shoot it's pretty wild
it'll actually are to whatever guy it
takes is closest to where you are nice
oh there you guys see where that gun is
actually pretty dope let's go first oh I
was were those epics would knock him off
his feet he's like oh how was cool all
right let's just breathe her a little
bit let's just breathe okay this is the
triple barrel shotgun so what's better
than having two boroughs three barrels
it's a triple triple its elite okay okay
this is a gun you only a name if you get
a like close enough you just run up on
guys and pull the trigger from the hip
here you'll just decimate them ok here
we go here we go here we go oh well you
killed out a guy getting kind of mate
look I gotta walk up to Scott amaila him
yeah let's go let's go let's go Oh to
the side Roma I don't need you I don't
need you you don't love me o th e comes
done dial is that you're right um this
is I'm going crazy right know who we go
always shoot I can't okay okay okay I'm
gonna do somebody good take cover I'm
confident okay cool yeah i mean the
playstation 4 mean it's so powerful like
just my graphics standpoint i just died
yeah i saw that it looks good when you
look real good yeah it looked amazing
when I died I mean if some of that also
like I think some of the things we'll be
saying when you when you look at the
game and
detail is you're going to start to see
that a lot of the reasons why it looks
at way it does is because some of the
techniques that were using from
rendering and cinematography standpoint
makes the game feel more like you would
expect a film to look rather than a
video game because are you coming up the
easier part or kill the sky first cuz
much I take that shot get out of there
gone okay I'm going to go back this way
get somewhere Emma yeah when the when
does the easier part then I'll play
again take a look at this that's
actually you know westminster palace
under tax was smoking here oh man that
looks crazy yeah we jumped in a little
bit kind of in the middle of a scene
that was playing out where they were
under text you missed that part but yeah
i mean if you really look at this like
people who've actually been to the
palace today like you could spin the
camera on you can look at this green
paint in this motif here like they'll
it'll be extremely familiar even these
lamp posts like that's what's there you
know so we really paid a lot of
attention to the details and made sure
that what we did didn't feel like it was
some make-believe you know possibly
disneyland version of it you're shocking
guys gonna eat this guy's gonna get you
guys I got together you better get a
little bit now what are you to know I
love them gun me down hey Seamus this is
the game their shameful this is the game
director and he had he died yeah I'm not
the only one that's bad at this game so
one of the things that's really crazy
about this game also is the depth of
field right i mean we could we can see
that quality just kind of like how your
actual wherever you're aiming we try to
bring them to focus except for when
you're being suppressed so you'll you'll
be down to cover enough guys are
shooting at you it's actually going to
bring the depth of field in a little bit
and I mean that just kind of gave us
this cool way of playing with the
trade-off of clarity versus actually the
feeling of being so sorry a guy came out
of nowhere well you know what Dana
thanks so much for your time here the
order 1886 looks like a crit just a
killer games visually and just what you
can do it in you know we're excited to
play more with it I'm excited to play
more tix up for a keep dying yeah we're
gonna work on that alright for cnet.com
