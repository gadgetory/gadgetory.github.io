on a complex home security system or you
can do it yourself with almost any old
cell phone and just a few accessories
here's what you'll need an old cell
phone today I'll be using iPhones and a
way to mount it to the wall I'll be
using car mounts as an option you can
also use an add-on smartphone lens I'll
be using a fisheye a wide-angle and a
super fish eye lens and what they'll
give me is a wider view of what the
camera sees and finally you'll need a
power cord for each security camera
because those phones will pretty much
stay on all the time what I'll do is set
up three different cameras and you can
do this at home or at your office or
wherever you want to keep an eye on
things I'll set up one at my desk one at
a coffee shop and one word I have a view
of traffic and weather
once these cameras are all set up I'll
be able to check in on any of these
real-time feeds with my primary phone no
matter where I am and there are lots of
apps that turn your phone into a
security camera but the one I'm using
today is I cam that one is only
compatible with iOS devices but if
you're using Android phones then there's
tiny cam the setup is really easy the
way I cam works is that there are two
apps the first is called I cam source
and you download it on the devices that
you want to use as your security cameras
that one's five bucks when you've got it
just create a username and password log
in hit start and that's it your camera
is set up then grab the device you'll be
using to monitor in this case I'm using
an Android because I Hamm works with iOS
and Android for monitoring download I
cam it's also five bucks sign in with
the same username and password and voila
you'll be able to view one or all of the
devices that you've set up as security
cameras
to set up the three security cameras
attached each camera to a mount place a
lens on each camera then mount your
security cameras in your desired
locations finally to ensure a continuous
stream disable the auto lock feature now
that my three cameras are set up I can
launch the app and check in on them in
real time
I camp also has a feature that record
still images whenever it detects motion
it doesn't work perfectly but it is good
enough if you want to keep an eye on
who's coming and going you should also
know that the app works best when you
have a strong Wi-Fi connection it'll
make this whole process a lot smoother
if you have any questions or tips of
your own hit me up on Twitter and check
out how to Xena calm for the written
guide to this tutorial for CNET I'm
