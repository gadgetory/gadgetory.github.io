against Google I'm Bridget Carey this is
your scene that update Microsoft
released a brand new version of its
office software and the big change is
collaboration now it's been three years
since Microsoft came out with a major
update to office and this office 2016
incorporates a few social features some
that made Google Docs popular to people
can work on a word document at the same
time and you can see what the other
person is typing in real time but unlike
Google you can only do this in Word not
an Excel spreadsheets or PowerPoint
presentations Microsoft also puts Skype
inside of the program so you can chat
with teammates by text or video while
working on a project it also folded in
Bing search so you can look up terms
inside of the program but the most
useful feature may just be the new
approach to searching for help
type the word of what you want to do and
it'll instantly pull up the menu for
that option it won't give you some long
list of instructions on where to find
the option it just puts the drop-down
menu right in front of you to select now
it's not easy for Microsoft to convince
people to pay for office when Google
Docs are free but with office you are
getting more advanced tools of course
one copy of office 2016 for one computer
is a hundred and fifty dollars but if
you pay for an annual subscription to
office
it starts at 70 dollars a year and they
sweeten the deal with a few perks by for
example including a terabyte of cloud
storage in Microsoft onedrive you can
create and edit documents for free on
office comm but that's a bit limited
like you can't get all types of charts
in Excel for example as Microsoft
strengthens office another tech company
is feeling a slump QWERTY the company
behind winks smart home gadgets is
filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy and
it's selling the wink platform to the
highest bidder in the meantime wink
products will still be sold they'll
still work and customers can get tech
support the wink hub is the control
center for various web connected gadgets
you can think of it as the brains to a
smart home with an app that controls the
various devices in your home earlier
this year the company faced an
embarrassing headache when a botched
software update to the wink hub crashed
the box and required customers to tinker
with a manual fix
the box and for a replacement but
there's much more than the hub quirky
collaborated with General Electric with
some popular items like smart lightbulbs
and a smart window air conditioner there
have even been some weird ones like a
smart egg tray and smart piggy banks but
the smart home industry is going through
an awkward adolescence consumers can be
apprehensive to invest in multiple
products when these gadgets are
expensive or complicated to set up
