nice phone it's lovely out are we
enjoying a nice a couple of beverages a
little rest a little rest here in the
midst of our long journey maybe taking
some photos looking at things yeah you
know the thing about these beverages
though they have very wide open tops
they do because they're double-double I
think they're illegal in New York
actually oh yeah so we've got them
filled with energy drink from our super
long road trip here we are exhausted
yeah and then you know I mean here you
are in the middle of a torture test
really anything can happen anything
could happen anything likes a big foam
but that's a big opening right they're
just very slippery it is three two one
I'm just waited until Jeff get it it's
still on still on okay
it's a dripping dripping all right we're
drying we're darling
it smells like orange and look it's on
it's still hot for some reason it's
playing a video it's playing a video
let's see if we can get it to power up
oh no nothing happening oh I can see
like I can see the water seeping in the
water oh he's still wet look at this
little drip coming out oh poor little
thing I can't get it to turn on Mikey I
don't know if it was me or of its own
volition but it is now shutdown
poor HTC why
all right we're rolling down the street
we got the HTC one we got the open
window unfortunately sometimes you try
to lean out the window you try to take
some pictures with it when the window is
open and this happens three two one
little frisbee toss I wasn't what I was
hoping for I well I should have give it
a twist should give it a twist good
we definitely have some scratching and
denting it looks a little bit like
buckshot on the back here what if we can
get old Jeff to hit his mark try it
again
say goodbye going out the window
like dramatic reveal no scream crackage
our SIM card slot popped out a little
bit you got a nice big dent right here
where you chucked it right on the corner
but this thing is looking remarkably
intact that is one tough phone I'm gonna
call the drop test and passed and we're
gonna find out if it could take the heat
but kind of like a lot of heat
nothing says road-test like a barbecue
and nothing says barbecue like safety
goggles and safety mask once we're going
safety gear because here's the theory we
think with the metal back the HTC One
would get very hot if you left it in the
car on a sunny day or you left it
outside for a long time we rode on the
top row safety first safety first
everyone all right you see what I'm told
that lithium-ion can become combustible
at about 200 and about 300 degrees we'll
see if HTC C stands for heat test
compliant like maybe like a minute or
two how are we putting the lid down or
leaving it up no I don't think we need
to put the lid down you think I don't
know
all right it's been like a good two to
three minutes I think if we're gonna get
grill marks on the phone yeah I love
what you're like keep it pulled off
there man I'm starting to freak out one
that's gonna give me a little nervous
all right I'm gonna get it off of it all
right we're just gonna like basically
put it on the ground there's no marks
yes it does seem kind of wimpy now that
you mention it let's put it here why not
they put us put it here come on trust me
yeah put sideways
careful you're close to the top there oh
there we go
don't drop it on my foot I bets please
and not oh we got a good we got some
girl back now 15 degrees what that's so
like a boy look at it it's not really
not seeing much damage at all no I mean
I'm sure the electronics inside aren't
very happy right now probably not so
what we're gonna do is take this back
dry it out see if it can come back on
yes a couple of days but I have to say
so far I'm really pretty impressed with
how oh look here though oh is it warping
I'm in a way a little bit it's warping a
little bit I think because it was
already cracked there yeah that's the
drug test I would frankly I would have
expected more like an explosion I'm as
I'm surprised I'm surprised the screen
is all right all right good job HTC One
we'll check out your holiday
she's been about a week since our RV
road trip and the HTC one has been
drying out at Rice that whole time
because I wanted it to get the best
possible chance at survival dude still
has some barbecue marks on it I've got
this genius little power brick here I'm
sorry to report that we have warped the
plastic around the actual mini micro USB
port I have to do a little surgery
before I could plug it in I got it I
made it work power
it's on look at this thing the fact that
this thing went through all that it went
through and it is on I would say that's
a keeper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
