country podcast with your host mr. Brian
Tom what up everybody what up Beach how
you doing my man I'm good man how you
doing I'm doing good from an undisclosed
location somewhere in the universe but
you want me tell you why I'm really
doing good here yes please oh because I
have in my hand I was like can see you
cannot see it it's it's bigger than my
head - I got iPad pro twelve point nine
inch and I love it
that's awesome man is it light is it
light in your hands like how does that
feel same weight same weight it's the
same exact weight is the last one
remember we talked about how mine was
stolen recently right huge bummer just
just a few weeks I mean trust me that's
really sad it's sad right but just a few
weeks before I got my hands on the iPad
Pro so we're gonna talk about a little
bit and so yes to answer all your
questions
I got it we're gonna we're gonna jump
into it but also we want to make sure
that this show is all about you all
watching we do stream the show live on
periscope YouTube and livestream but you
can also call us leave your name where
you're from get tremendous a though
Beach this week um people are leaving
really long kind of semi incoherent
messages that were just bouncing all
over the place you got to get right to
it
yes kind of rambling and uh and in
multiple subject equations yes like I'm
sorry we want you on the show and we had
a lot of people call but you gotta you
gotta keep it tight so call us
I'm like school dude like Percy that's
the first button you pressed I was
immediately noticed that it was really
fast this is fast don't lie all right
this is the 8nx processor they bragged
about a promotion the 120 Hertz refresh
rate I'm telling you anyone so for
someone who has never had an iPad if you
get any of the new iPads I think you're
gonna love them a lot but if you've had
any version of the iPad before and you
get any of the new ones whether this is
ten point five or the twelve point nine
you're gonna be like this thing is
awesome just from the pure you can tell
you can feel it everywhere this is a
faster machine I use the pencil a little
bit just you know I goof around and
sketch and I'm not like a high-end
artist or anything um I didn't feel that
the delay was as noticeable they reduced
the the timing from when you you know
use the pencil from a 50 millisecond
delay to a 20 millisecond delay it was
hard for me to say it was really that
much faster maybe like a hair faster but
again 50 milliseconds to 20 milliseconds
although you're saying yeah it's less
than half the delay it's still a really
finite amount of time but for a lot of
people I think that if anyone's even
deciding I should I go nine point seven
a ten point five honestly purely because
of the speed of this machine and the
specs on it you've gotta get a ten point
five inch iPad if you're thinking of
getting the new iPad and that's if you
even like the iPad did you get on board
with it like so I'll use the keyboard
with it so check this out apples
keyboards are straight up do too right
but in the past Logitech and Belkin had
keyboard cases but they were like these
they're super thick editions on it
Logitech just came out with this new
keyboard called the slim keyboard you
know what here I'm gonna step away for
one sec I'm gonna grab it okay I'm gonna
grab it K this is oh it's the Logitech
slim iPad pro keyboard okay hold on one
sec Oh Bryan is going to hunt for his
logitech slim keyboard and until then
I'm gonna try to find out on the
internet here before I pack let me see
here we go so it is this is by far this
may not look anything like crazy but
this is by far the best keyboard that
I've seen for the iPad pro hands down
because a the keys like you actually
feel like you're pressing on keys it
reminds me more of the surface keyboard
that comes to the surface Pro it also is
backlit so when you plug it into the
actual iPad pro the keys backlight as
well and then you have you know quick
hotkeys to do your like volume or you
know to minimize your windows but the
biggest thing is it's super slim it's if
you look at people that see this it's
basically almost as slim as a Smart
Cover yeah and then it has this little
keyboard area that is not heavy it's not
chunky it's not dense you snap that bad
boy on it's like the Apple Smart
keyboard is like this thing that you
like fold three billion times it's just
dirty it looks kind of like a Trapper
Keeper when you when he snapped it
together it's got an old school you know
traffic I mean there's my Trapper Keeper
on the backside of this Logitech
keyboard is that it the case itself it
has this stand here but it's it actually
rotates I think something like a full 50
degrees room or more oh wow
so you can you can edit it's it's tight
it's not like janky it's legit so I
don't know I'm just saying I'm gonna do
some videos that are gonna follow up on
just what things that I like and things
to look out for specifically in this um
product but it's it's awesome like
anyone who has been waiting upgrade to
an iPad for maybe 2 or 3 years you're
gonna freak out when you get this new
iPad if you love it I know that iPad is
not the most popular product but I'm so
happy with it when iOS 11 comes out I'm
probably gonna freak out anymore even
more I'm not willing to put the beta on
it yet because it's a little too
inconsistent and a lot of times some of
my apps that I use they end up not
working and I hate if like my comic book
app doesn't work on my iPad it's useless
to me it's just useless so um you know
so that's that's kind of some of the
cool stuff about it but we did want to
jump into a story about the iPad pro
just because I found this actually be
really interesting so a new report
basically from this company called bare
feet and they ran the Geekbench
benchmark test for both the iPad pro
10.5 inch the iPad pro 12 point 9 inch
in addition they also benchmark compared
it to a 2016 MacBook Pro and a 2017
MacBook Pro as well and this is this is
what's really shocking about some
these results so first of all if you
talk about how they performed single
core processing which is typically you
know really the most commonly raw used
power for these benchmarks you are not
going to top a MacBook Pro versus an
iPad pro in any of these single core
benchmarks okay so if you want to order
how they rank them and yes you know
these are not all completely SPECT out
2000 17 inch macbook pro 13 inch was the
top single core then we have a 2016 then
we have the 12.9 ipad and the started
attend the 10.5 inch iPad those are both
2017 models but if you start going down
more in multi-core performance the 10.5
and 12 at 12.12.2012 out power here and
then if you talk about graphics
performance from a pure if you want to
test out the metal metal you know apples
graphics engine on the metal platform
test the iPads outperformed both the 16
2016 and 2017 MacBook Pros in addition
there's another benchmark called the GFX
of the graphics benchmark test where the
iPad pro 10.5 an iPad pro 2.9 again both
outperformed MacBook Pros from this year
and last year like that's actually
pretty surprising that is surprised
would have not expected that and I know
that benchmarks don't mean anything in
regards to real-world performance per se
right it's going to be different but at
the very least you're talking about a
product on pure benchmarks an iPad pro
now that can hang in some categories
with a MacBook Pro that's pretty
significant you know we haven't seen
anything like that before so that's why
if you're someone who's getting a matte
looking at the iPad pro line that just
got refreshed I'm not saying it's gonna
replace your laptop but it's going to
have the raw power to hang with it and
there's a lot of apps there's like some
podcasting apps there are some video
editing apps or some great drawing apps
and there's um you know that affinity
photo program that was teased at Apple's
conference I'm gonna learn that it's
like it's basically like the dope
Photoshop for the iPad pro yeah that one
looked pretty cool actually I like
right that one look like
so these are things that you start you
know it didn't happen last year year and
a half ago you start putting out some of
these pieces of puzzle some of these
breadcrumbs and the iPad pro is becoming
more legitimate and again iOS 11 I can't
wait for that I know it's not going to
do what a surface pro does but it's
gonna really make it a unique device I
can do a whole lot more than it does
today and this is coming in a few months
so I feel like when iOS 11 comes I'm
gonna get even another kind of like
brand new iPad so you can tell I'm kind
of juiced about this yeah man it's cool
cuz they're they're are trying to catch
up with the mat with the surface pro
market and you know they're trying to
make them fast so people will use them
as laptops in the future feels like
that's the direction we're headed right
now so that's all good news for me I
never got a keyboard case because I
thought they all sucked in last
generation and this new logitech slim
iPad pro keyboard case that is as close
to what I imagined a good two great you
know it's it's more than about its I
think it's a really really good keyboard
case for the iPad finally like there's
nothing else that even comes close to it
because the others are too thick and
chunky and they just suck they just suck
I hate using that word but they suck so
I got a thing the sad thing to me is
that Apple didn't even make one like
couldn't even make one that good right
there like that's like I mean I think
part of it is because Apple is so spread
thin they don't even have time to make
accessories they didn't even make a rear
shell case they didn't make a single new
rear shell case for the twelve point
nine inch iPad pro they made them for
the ten point five inch but they
completely discontinued the twelve point
nine inch ones I thought that's kind of
weird I feel like a lot of time Apple
depends on their third-party vendors you
know to make stuff for their products
and they probably expect it at this
point now you know when they're just
like Oh someone will make a cool
keyboard for us so we don't really have
to worry about it you know maybe that's
their thinking now but I could be wrong
so for every one that is still curious
about the iPad pro or even if you
purchased one and experienced it
yourself I'm curious how you guys like
it or maybe you don't like it so you
guys again you call us on our number let
me look at it up one more time
too legit to quit it is too legit to
quit
I don't know you were saying legit so I
had to get the song I love it in my head
I love it I love him sorry I was up the
Warriors thing to me was that the word
is great yes baby with the mirabeau I
don't play warriors warriors one the one
then be a champ in case in case you did
yeah well we'll bring it up later in the
show as well
alright now let's kind of transition
over to some other things about what's
happening in the iPhone world we know
there's always rumors going on but just
a pause and kind of give you the current
state of I phone sales the latest cantar
data shows that the iPhone 7 and 7 plus
remained the top-selling phones in the
US for the three-month period ending in
April with a combined market share of
twenty point one percent so it grew
compared to the year-on-year total
iPhone share in general grew now here's
the other thing that was kind of
interesting
can't ours reports say that early
indications suggest Samsung's flagship
flagship s8 and s8 plus only reached a
combined market share of eight point one
percent which even is lower than the
number that they hit last year which was
eight point eight percent at the same
time this year so although there's a lot
of buzz I mean I think the Samsung
Galaxy s8 is a great phone Consumer
Reports just recently rated it a better
phone than of course the iPhone 7 which
it now has like a seven or eight month
lead on that that makes sense when we do
prize fights we compare phones that are
on the market at the time they're
available so people get mad always
saying oh the s8 is six months newer
than the iPhone and then when the iPhone
comes out the other side says oh the
iPhone is six months you know brand new
compared to the last s8 like you'll
never win you can only compare what's in
front of you at that point in time and
you know if that's what it is that's
what it is
so although it is getting you know
recommended is a great phone from
Consumer Reports and people generally
think the s8 is a great phone it still
didn't make a dent in market share at
least four top-selling phones this year
which I I thought it would actually
maybe at least
pick up a little bit but instead it
dropped there last year I mean seeing
that we even called it the most
beautiful phone on the market right now
the best phone of the year right I mean
if you're outside of ecosystem we know
apples ecosystem is ridiculous
but outside of that if you're talking
about pure specks of the phone even
Consumer Reports said hey the
fingerprint sensor on the back is a
little awkward and everyone that's
probably its biggest complaint but
beyond that it's a really legit phone
more than legit right it's is you know I
don't want to call anything an iPhone
killer per se right and that's funny we
haven't heard that term in a long time
right I'm gonna play the song again I'm
sorry too legit um yeah I mean I'm
surprised you know like it's very
popular phone that has you that says a
lot about Apple's brand cachet you know
absolutely people like know the iPhone
it's a very famous popular phone they're
gonna buy it
Samsung comes out with a new beautiful
phone everyone gives it great reviews
and it still doesn't sell very well so
what does that tell you you know it's
crazy Foss the tech industry bro
everyone said it was great it wasn't
even like a mixed bag it was unanimously
a great phone so yeah it speaks to the
apples muscle like you said in their
brand power uh if you want to talk about
a little more few things about iPhones
the iPhone 8 I know we always have more
rumors and stories that around that
world but we'll just kind of pound
through some of these according to the
nikkei asian review out of japan iPhone
assembler whisperin this is a company
that Apple has worked with in the past
they assemble iPhones for Apple the CEO
of the company during their recent
shareholders meeting said assembly
process for previous generations of
iPhones have not changed much although
new features like waterproof and
wireless charging now require some
different testing and waterproof
function will alter the assembly process
a bit so so is he is he blowing is he
blowing yeah sit on the beans it's funny
I wonder if you got a call from Tim Cook
hey we saw this interview and you're
giving away all of our secrets buddy hey
buddy those rumors that are supposed to
stay rumors yeah they're supposed to
rumors hey don't complain about how
difficult it is to make our phone you're
lucky you're making the phone press hey
ed you want to still be a partner do you
want to tank like those other companies
that we thought that we prevented from
making our chips and prop and our you
know in our put in our products
he's a leaker he's a leaker is asleep
homie come on he's the wrong oh just
kidding all this talk of leakers and
here he is leaking you know fake news
fake use touch tech 8 news anyways a win
stryn um is the one of the assembly
companies that works with apple that
leak came out in a way basically
confirming a lot of the rumors we've
heard about this but in another leak
that might be even better I might be
even more telling depending on what you
believe on reddit which we know is
plenty of plenty of action goes on and
read it a redditor like that east
recently put a post out and in the post
basically claims according to what they
call a friend in the industry what hit
what they've received from manufacturers
over the last week are shells of front P
shells and rear shells of both the
iPhone eight so that's the iPhone eight
if people are looking that has the super
thin bezel kind of that not black notch
on the top that we've seen in renders
for the camera but then on the back
you'll notice it does have the vertical
rear camera dual lens and the biggest
thing that you'll notice is there's no
actual touch ID fingerprint sensor on
the rear
oh yeah okay and these are the latest
parts that they've leaked out if you
click on that next picture you can see
on the left hand side there is an iPhone
7s rear shell purportedly and then an
iPhone 7s plus which would have the dual
lens camera in that form factor still
resting horizontally and then on the far
right the pieces for both the iPhone
eight front and rear shell these are
these are what a redditor poster put out
fine maybe they're fake maybe they're
not but everything that we have seen and
heard and posted and renders and
multiple sources with multiple parts as
we get closer to that September timeline
I can't see how this isn't what the new
phone is gonna look like yeah I mean it
looks it looks like it's completely
possible that this is what it's going
belike and the camera situation is kind
of interesting it looks kind of cool
actually with the three yeah they put
the flash in between the two cameras
yeah that's kind of interesting I guess
the wines it you know widens the depth
perception of those two cameras or
something yeah yeah some people you know
it's still the camera is still gonna
stick out so you're gonna still have
phone wobble but wait again
there's there's really I want you see
iOS 11 you see the form factor of this
the prop there really aren't gonna be
many surprises and you know for people
I don't know maybe they will still
surprise this I think they can I thought
I actually really enjoyed WWDC I was
just let down with the lack of any new
real true improvements to Siri but
beyond that I was actually happy with
WWDC I don't know about y'all okay also
um we talked abouts kinda like the
iPhone 7 and whatnot component
production has started I drop news even
released some new images of the renders
that really support exactly what we saw
from the from those parts that we have
so it's coming it's going to happen look
at that beautiful thing Beach I mean
that looks nice it's like a nice it's
like the galaxy s 8 version for the
iPhone yeah but I think what's a little
be interesting is if they can't
implement that touch ID sensor on the
front screen panel with no physical
button is it an area you have to touch
or as you touch any part of the lower
area it's gonna be interesting to see
how that all shakes out there's got to
be a version of iOS 11 specifically for
that form factor it's gonna be different
than what they showed at WWDC if there's
no home button it's gonna be a little
different it just has to be and then I'm
gonna have to learn and like adapt and
like figure out how to use the phone
again which we kind of have to do that
with every new iPhone you know it's like
how do I hold it in my hand how is it
comfortable how do i balance it it's
always gonna do it's always a new kind
of thing and it's I I don't like that
actually I don't know you know when I
went from my 5 to the 6s it was like a
big adjustment like I don't have to
balance my phone like this I can't race
across you know it's kind of a pain in
the ass yeah so we'll see how that all
shakes out um we also have a quick story
about a Apple supplier named larg Ann
who
typically supplies the lenses rare
lenses for the iPhone 7 and 7 plus they
just announced basically that they will
be shipping a 3d sensor for 403 sensor
lens for the for the second half of 2017
to an unnamed company when Apple is one
of their largest clients which means
it's probably Apple
it's another leaker right here like this
guy leaked all these Asian liquors what
is going on here I'm not a leaker I am
NOT a leaker you are a leaker you leak
all kinds of Apple info all the time as
soon as you see it you leak it I know it
there there's a new trend hashtag Asian
leaker sign me up
if you leak anything Beecham I'm gonna
call you an Asian leaker that's fine
with me
you're down with that so this 3ds uh
sensor lens would clearly be to help
potentially be used for face unlock with
your phone but also augmented reality
applications which brought me up to this
next story that was really cool Mac
rumors kind of collected a few examples
of what people are doing in the AR space
a Ark it was announced at WWDC so we had
some cool developers do some stuff I put
up three links video links up there
Beach so my god we kind of talked about
a few of them here's this first one this
first one which is really cool where am
I at right now oh here we go
yeah so this first one is a combination
of and it's thanks to Kody Brown founder
of virtual reality production studio IRL
is a combination of using AR kit with
unity 3d and including the overwatch
character Widowmaker in a room that he
kind of set this mood lighting and put
the steam in it what makes this kind of
cool and interesting he said just
fundamentally AR kit is the framework
itself is more elegant and simple to use
compared to others in addition he was
really impressed with how lighting how
it handles lighting adjustments in real
time you can see right he it looks
pretty horrifying man I mean that is
crazy this is just like a little quick
sample Chinese's room completely you
know that crazy so so this is I mean
again this is the quick
so that was one video um another video
it may not be visually as impressive it
talks speaks to a arc its ability to
place things I'm specifically in a
geographic location where you can then
go see them so this is from another
company here where they showed off I
can't remember you know it off the top
my head I brain farted I can't remember
the name of the company but you are you
you a are there you are so what they
showed off is like this jet that they
placed in an apartment room what what
makes and you can see all around it up
and down which is kind of fun but what
was really cool is later in the demo
they walk completely out of the room
like to a different area you don't see
the jet anywhere in any way shape or
form but then when you return to that
room based on distance and angle that
jet still remain so
although yeah it's kind of a
quote-unquote simple application look I
don't make this stuff I don't build this
stuff but the fact that it has
geographical reference where someone
could build kind of their own world or
game
plop things in certain places and maybe
like a treasure hunting type game yeah
you would only be able to find it in
that spot and always stays in that spot
it's kind of cool like it's not just
like projecting an image onto a screen
it's keeping it fixed at specific
coordinates of your geographic location
that is pretty neat okay I got the best
one for you coming up now Beach this
third one is an example it's called
rainforest garage from 8/9 and people
that are listening they can kind of
check this out which makes it really
neat as well so it takes his phone and
then he basically like in the app
there's like oh hey look there there
happens to be a blowtorch on the ground
who knew and then what he does is he
goes up to this garage door and then
there's this dotted outline where he can
kind of burn around the edges of the
garage and then you're gonna see what
happens next I was like dude this is
just like a demo that you made
the door cuts out and reveals a freaking
rainforest that's pretty amazing it's
like in Mexico or something that looks
like he says are all right forests in
Mexico gee I bet I've been to Tulum or
the Aztec ruins and this is exactly what
this is absolutely absolutely
that's very awesome what's cool is like
you you can when he changed the angle of
looking into that opening that he cut on
the garage door you can see the
different depth in the edges like you
can see into the space and he's kind of
looking at it from different angles so
if you moved to different English she
around the corner kind of exactly the
how much by using I'm like you can't go
inside
nice uh yeah that's the only limited
yeah again there that's pretty quick
this is kind of stuff the cool stuff
that Eric it is showing out you know
someone on periscope is cracking me up
vocal turfs like people will forget and
try to walk through I know and run into
it with your head it it might just
actually happen what up Daryl 1988 ICU
so um yeah this is kind of some of the
cool stuff that's happening in a arc it
and it it's coming soon and so that was
another kind of big thing that was part
of WWDC we got already floating frissina
we got to build some sort of a our
adventure we here are developers that
are way smarter than we are
not we you know we don't need something
awesome but hey it would be a funny
documentary beach and tong attempt to
build their first AR kid down on like
the worst reality show ever of all time
yeah might be um before we get to our
phone calls you wanted to touch upon the
home pod I know that people have a lot
of different opinions about the home pod
like I'm still not sold on it from a
price standpoint again I'm going to buy
one I'm gonna demo it out I'm gonna try
it and I'm most likely just because my
house is outfitted with an echo and a
Google home just for purposes of just
trying them out I don't know if I'm
going to keep a third one that's 349 but
this is kind of some interesting
information that we have here okay so a
survey recently done by morning cons
consult or consult I think it's morning
consult they pulled 2,200
dholtze specifically about the home pod
and about smart speakers now according
to this poll 33 percent said they were
initially interested in the home pod
once they were introduced to the other
products of comparison showing off hey
this is what the echo does this is what
the Google home does that number dipped
to 30% now that in in reality that's
actually not that big of a dip so that's
initial interest okay now among people
so we're seeing people who have no
context or just their cheers about the
home pod 33% 1/3 of people now here
people who already owned Apple products
their interest before comparison was 45%
interest now after they were introduced
to kind of some of the other products
that are out there because let's be
honest a lot of people are very Apple
blinders on that number dropped to 40%
but if you look at that both for people
that aren't familiar with the home pod
and people that are familiar with Apple
products it actually didn't drop by that
much of a percentage no didn't know it
didn't at all final if you're talking
about a final purchase decision
according to the survey 17% they would
most likely buy an echo 11 percent said
they would most likely buy the cheaper
echo dot so let's just chalk up a 28
percent of that group would buy an
Amazon echo product nine percent said
they would go for a home pod which and
11 percent said they would go for a
Google home so the home pod ranked
amongst those products was last with
only nine percent of 2,200 people saying
I would buy a home pod for 349 the other
big thing which obviously is makes sense
is it appears according to the survey
price was the main concern among
shoppers 57 percent is very important in
a smart speaker apples home pod is 349
the echo is currently at around like 140
ish 150 ish yeah I mean if you're going
to put a bunch of products all in front
of a bunch of people that they all do
basically the same thing say this one's
350 this one's 40 this one's 100 or
whatever that Google home is they're
probably going to go for the cheaper one
you know and the one that's been on the
market a little long
it's little less you know it's more
low-profile
and a little easier on the eyes and I
think the the home pod is kind of big
and it looks like it can collect dust
very easily yeah so a little concerned
about that
but um I mean clearly people are going
to want to go for the one that's been on
the market a little while longer a
little more sleek looking and more
affordable you know and even even right
out of the box I'm sure they're gonna
support more services down the road but
from what we you know from what we know
and we really don't know much Apple only
talked about is supporting Apple music
like that's you gotta support more than
just apple music on launch oh yeah yeah
and maybe it will again the we're only
talking about what we know at this point
in time you know they they're touting it
as more of us be a music speaker before
a smart speaker I think that is gonna
actually in a weird way persuade some
people to buy it just because they're
like I want the Apple music speaker you
know yeah there there are people like
that in this world that are just gonna
buy purely because oh it's just an Apple
music speaker that looks like a toilet a
roll of toilet paper I'll do that it
does look like I like I'm gonna buy then
I'm putting on my toilet paper I wanna
see if someone wipes about with it looks
like one of those bathroom air
fresheners but so does the Google home
the Google home looks more like a
bathroom right now like anything yeah
then I go dot is like a little hockey
puck you know it's so small but the echo
dot also has Spotify it has Pandora
uh whereas Amazon music it has an energy
has so many services yeah so in Google
home supports a variety services but
Amazon clearly supports the most it'll
just I'm really curious of what the
response will actually be once this
product comes out and once we learn more
that those are the two things so there
we go we'll see what happens all right
you want to check out our calls jump
into our calls let's do it we got a lot
of girls the wait thank you guys all for
calling um here we go first call
hey guys my question is in regards to
the rumor that resurfaced a month or two
ago about the possibility of Apple
purchasing the Walt Disney Company and
while that buyout doesn't seem like it's
going to happen I wanted to get your
thoughts on if you see Apple possibly in
this age of mega-mergers buying an
entertainment company that already has
an extensive library of content as well
as several things in the pipeline
especially since Apple seems still very
new at this and their output is very
small just wanted to get your thoughts
on it love the show guys
take care yeah that was a big rumor that
was kind of flowing around the reason
why I never put it in the show is
because I thought it was so speculative
and it has turned out that it really was
more speculative than not right you
never heard anything after that and I'm
like come on like I'm gonna give this a
week to see if there's really any legs
to it and at least up to this point
there has not been I think if there was
any company that I'd want Apple to
honestly purchase from an original
content standpoint I'd want it to be
Netflix and I think that Netflix has all
the momentum quite honestly also if you
look at how Netflix is burning through
cash and investing in their programming
there's going to be a point in time
where Netflix actually is gonna need a
new infusion of cash maybe Apple can be
that but at the same time I wouldn't
want them to integrate Netflix and make
it be like oh here's the Apple movie or
TV app I I would want Netflix to just be
a puss be a part of the ecosystem but
not kind of disappear the way that we
use it today I think they should if they
were gonna do anything like that they
could acquire them and just let them do
what they do and then in addition maybe
create some more hooks to that but let's
be real from a Content temp standpoint
people aren't watching and there they
aren't reviewing very highly planted of
the apps I'm curious about the bad-boy
documentary but I'm not gonna subscribe
to Apple music just for that uh what
does it take i watch the trailer for the
bad-boy documentary and it looks scary
like I was I was a fan watching it right
it looks like some real life you know
what there's like a lot of violence and
like um you know Puff Daddy looks like
he's like mad like he's angry and stuff
like I came up because I was angry
I was I was actually kind of in shock by
it I was like what this is crazy
this would just wait for a wait for dr.
Dre's biopic what they reported orgy Wow
it I don't like it it only get it only
gets better from here gets better that's
crazy
no but Apple if yeah I don't I I pray to
God Apple never buys Disney because
Disney has just a long legacy of just
you know just being an awesome company
and awesome characters and everything in
Apple doesn't have a track record for
creating stuff like that other than
products you know so I don't know I
don't I don't see it happening I don't
see it happen the only way that it works
is if Apple acquires them because they
need the cash because they're struggling
which they are not by any means and then
just leaves them alone to operate the
way they are it that doesn't make sense
to me but I could see a Netflix
acquisition making more sense whether it
happens not but depending on how you
know subscribers in Netflix increase
based on how much money they're spending
and how that is trending over the next
few years I think that's gonna let us
know if Netflix is really going to be up
for sale for an acquisition or not but
if it is you've got to imagine that
Apple who is desperate for legitimate
content like Netflix has so much good
stuff I know you're not on it yet Beach
but like I can't keep up with it like
it's yeah there's a lot of stuff on
there how many times have you heard Oh
have you seen that on Netflix yeah all
the time all the time all the time now
right yeah I mean master none I mean I
like your idea like if they do purchase
it just don't touch it just let Netflix
do what they do and just collect the
revenue you know cuz they're doing well
what they're doing now I feel like Apple
come in they could break a lot of stuff
and turn off a lot of people you know
the only way that Apple creates maybe
something that is more compelling to me
as if they somehow locked down but
they're not going to they're way behind
everyone is already kind of locked in
their own TV subscription service if
they had created that TV service and
then integrated original programming
within it to kind of create this whole
new world of media content then that
that can be exciting to me but beyond
that they're what they're doing and
trying to force us to subscribe to Apple
music to why
you're very limited content that doesn't
have much of a broad appeal that's not
the right way to go about it and I know
they're trying because in their brains
like we've got to create original
content you got to create original
content people want to watch and not
just one show it has to be Netflix
started with a couple shows house of
cards is one of those first ones then it
grew to like maybe three or four shows
now it's like 10 that's what you got to
do but you don't put on Apple music you
just don't and and it's called Apple
music you know what this is called Apple
music no you know what with the the
pitch for the plan of the app show is
that they have to make their pitch while
they're on a conveyor belt like that's
like seems like it's the big like you
know the big hook for that show is like
they have to do their pitch before the
conveyor belt runs out so it's just
ridiculous it seems ridiculous that it
that does seem right all right next all
thanks for the call that's a great one
that's a great one in prose
all right here we go next call hey
what's up my crew my name is Nigel I'm
calling from Miami Florida and I have a
problem not with Apple but actually with
the way people are perceiving Apple so I
just listened to last week's podcast and
it was one guy who was going on about
how at WWDC Apple they don't really
innovate much but I have a problem with
like people always expecting innovations
from Apple for most companies
innovations are like a
once-in-a-lifetime thing and Apple has
been lucky enough to do that a few times
once with the iPhone again with the iPad
but innovation don't really come when
you're looking for them so I wanted to
hear your dad's thoughts on this um so
what do you think you guys think that
people are expecting innovations to
often from Apple or yeah let me know
your thoughts thank you goodbye I think
it's absolutely right I think you make a
great point about this expectation
versus reality I think we've actually
seen innovations from Apple for me what
I'm more what I think what is more
distressing and what we've always tried
to kind of bring them back down earth is
when they talk like they're the most
innovative company but they're doing
things that other people have done you
can't
walk around with that same swagger right
the Apple watch
they wanted it to be there next thing
but it wasn't I really feel like if they
make some sort of augmented reality
glasses down the road though I'm talking
about like three four or five years down
the road maybe that's whatever that ends
up being or looking like and however
stylus that is maybe that is their next
thing I feel like that could be a moment
where they have the opportunity at least
to have that next thing but until then
you know their innovations has been 3d
touch which is I would say depending on
who you are some people love it some
people don't some people don't use it
most people like I don't even know what
it works for but in order for them to
elevate 3d touch which I was super
excited about when they first introduced
it they have to make it ubiquitous on
all their devices right so and it has to
work the same everywhere if it's just on
a phone and then you don't know how it
works that's one thing I do like the
fact that the iPad it's screen is what
it is today but right after they
announced 3d touch I was like wouldn't
you maybe want to announce an iPad with
3d touch so people get familiar with the
technology you're kind of creating and
building a new behavior that people are
used to and it just didn't happen and so
that was an innovation for sure who else
really has that no one but I was
something that and to me weren't looking
for we weren't asking for it it just
kind of popped up if something they
thought of which was kind of the point
of his call was like a lot of times when
an innovation comes we're not even
expecting it we're like oh my god that's
that's a great idea I like that I'm
going to use that you know like when the
first iPhone came out the other things
you mentioned like the Apple watch and
the sunglasses yeah I guess you could
call them innovations but other
companies have done them you know so
which they did phones and which they did
tablets yeah it's just how you know
Apple hasn't been able to recreate them
magic that they used to have when
introducing their version of a product I
think that's that's kind of part of it
and also let's be honest when you watch
a keynote the reason why it doesn't how
about this if you if you really pay
attention Apple keynotes go watch a few
keynotes before when Steve Jobs a kind
of tell a story you could see how he's
emotionally connected to the product Tim
Cook just says this is what we have Tim
Cook's like reading a checklist of like
this is
we're going to talk about next it's the
greatest one we've ever made sales void
there is no heart connected to it it's
very it's very logistical then when the
people come on stage you don't feel like
they're passionate they're just running
down specs and showing us how it works
I was excited about the iPad because I'm
like wow we've actually never seen
something like this to me that is
actually them trying new things and
being innovative but they didn't connect
the emotion to the product of why you're
doing it you don't even need to spend
five minutes on it just tell me a little
bit a bit a story of why it's so great
instead of just going down a checklist
of bullet points of features it's
totally different
it just doesn't connect the same and so
I think part of that has been lost but
for people that say Apple is not
innovative anymore it's just that other
people are quite honestly innovating
before Apple it's been this way
we've just felt like Apple as the
innovator because they gave us the
version of it that we really wanted I
don't think they've given us the version
of a product that we've already seen yet
in a long time yeah well Dre Fae in our
YouTube chat said the air pods are a
culture cultural phenomenon and yeah Tim
Cook said that Tim Cook said that but I
mean you cannot you can't argue that you
know no one else hat well there were
other companies that had that but no one
else had air pods or you know an
headphone like device that was made
specifically for their phone which is
their flag well I don't know if there's
their flagship phone but you know what
I'm saying like it was a new thing that
we saw and now where everyone wants it
but they can't get it so you know it's
is a fine line there there's a
disconnect between reality and what
Apple says and I think that in the past
they were able to sell that you know
reality distortion field yes but but now
you have a bunch of guys that are trying
to do that but you don't believe it
you know and it doesn't come off the
same way so I think that's part of it
you can always quite honestly every day
technology companies are innovating it
just depends on how you tell that story
that makes it special or different than
what other people do and then the proof
has to be in the pudding like I got to
give Apple props they were talking about
promotion I was like eat
it up and then I'm like alright I'll see
if this really delivers and then when I
got that iPad pro I'm like dude this is
the fastest iOS device ever I've ever
seen I was like okay they lived up to it
that's why I was hyped about I'm like oh
damn this is good so you know you've got
to deliver tell a story deliver and
innovate the same time for to feel
quote-unquote innovative as a whole yeah
and a lot of time some of the guys that
are doing like the biggest coolest
innovations are like in some little tiny
shop somewhere and Silicon Valley we
never even know about him and then a
bigger company will come in and buy them
just to like either shut them down or to
just take their technology you know and
we never really know about it so ya know
that's the world we living anyway yeah I
think that people agree with him though
I think people are being a little too
hard at it I just think brought reason
why people are being hard on it and
maybe some people would include me in
that group is cuz Apple talks so much
junk like they are the best it's like
that's not the best we've seen that like
five times before you know they know
right that's the other issue that's not
quick to point out Android did that
first any time yeah you know that uh uh
Apple makes some new announcement
Android had that for two years already
they always say that he's easy pickings
it's a low-hanging fruit come on so um
so yeah there we go
anyway that's all I got man that's all I
got that's it
Warriors for one yeah it's two out of
three years we'll see what happens and
be a time to catch up bro yeah yeah
