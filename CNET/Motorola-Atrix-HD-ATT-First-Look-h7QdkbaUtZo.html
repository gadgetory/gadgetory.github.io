and today we're taking a first look at
the Motorola Atrix HD this latest
handset in Motorola's Atrix line
launches July 15th on ATT for an
attractive price of $99.99 if you're an
Android and Motorola fan you may do a
double-take when you first see the Atrix
HD that's because this handsome phone
looks very similar to the Motorola Droid
Razr
right down to its curved top-heavy hump
around back and Kevlar coating that
resists scratches available in colors of
white shown here and titanium the Atrix
HD definitely feels well crafted but a
bit plasticky and not as premium as the
more metallic Motorola Droid Razr phones
on Verizon the Atrix HD is pretty thin
too at just a third of an inch thick at
its trim aspyn despite being svelte this
phone features a big bold and bright 4.5
inch LCD screen with a 720 HD resolution
Motorola also says the display uses
something called HD color boost which I
suspect is a form of image processing
and possibly a special filter designed
to pump up colors and contrast just
above the screen is a VGA front-facing
camera you'll find modern software on
the Atrix HD the device runs Android 4.0
Ice Cream Sandwich gussied up by
Motorola's interface while Motorola
doesn't call the UI the old motoblur or
refer to it at all in fact it still
feels blur like to me I do dig this
funky widget on the home screen that
combines clock weather plus battery and
memory status in one slick interactive
graphic the phone is pushed along by a
fast 1.5 gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon
s4 processor backed up by one gigabyte
of RAM as a result Atrix HD feels quick
nimble and responsive also nice is an 8
megapixel camera on back with LED flash
which also shoots 1080p HD quality video
the camera snaps pictures quickly and
boasts a ton of features settings and
shooting modes it also lets you take
pictures while the camera is
the Atrix HD also connects to 18 T's
fast 4G LTE data network which I've been
very impressed with at least in New York
anyways on top our ports for micro USB
and HDMI along with a headphone jack the
right side holds a tiny power button and
small volume rocker located on the left
is a flap covering slots for micro sim
and micro SD cards around back is an 8
megapixel camera with LED flash and that
Kevlar surface which I can't stop
touching for some reason keep in mind
the Atrix HD uses a 1700 milliamp
battery which is not removable so you
won't be able to swap out the battery
yourself for a fresh one if it runs dry
or fails completely also compared to the
massive 3300 milliamp battery in the
Droid RAZR MAXX
I can't imagine the Atrix HD to provide
anywhere near the maxes runtime
I'm Brian Bennett and this has been a
first look at the Motorola Atrix HD be
