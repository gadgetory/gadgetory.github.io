operating room just for robotic arms to
operate on a patient's heart controlled
by a surgeon 10 feet away by digitizing
the surgeons movements for the first
time in 200 years
surgeons hadn't had a tool that actually
made them a better surgery dr. Douglas
Boyd is a cardiothoracic surgeon at the
University of California Davis Medical
Center in Sacramento he's been
incorporating robotics into his
procedures for nearly two decades but is
now training robots to do some of the
work on their own
along with researchers at UC Berkeley
dr. Boyd is training them to do things
like remove shrapnel and cancerous
tissue put in stitches or make basic
cuts it's simple work for a surgeon but
incredibly difficult for a robot because
of the soft tissue involved robots are
very very accurate and doing things once
they are told what to do they stay on
task they don't get tired they don't get
distracted to train the bots dr. Boyd
performs a maneuver many times in a lab
the motions are digitized and the
average is used to program the robots
all of the data is stored in the cloud
so as the robot perfects the action it
can be used to program other robots by
cloud sourcing you have access to 15 or
20 experts now that that can that that
can contribute to movements and that can
be analyzed in the cloud but the robots
do have some limitations there are two
or three times slower than a surgeon and
can't make decisions on their own which
is why they won't be replacing doctors
any time soon human beings in general
are really good at abilities such as
dexterity manipulation perception and
robots are very very far away from from
getting to that stage the UC Berkeley
team led by Professor Ken Goldberg is
hopeful that robot assisted surgery
could one day connect patients and
doctors no matter the location it opens
up the door to be able to perform
surgery at a distance in days gone by
surgery was all about blood and guts in
the future surgery will be about bits
and bytes and of course bots in San
