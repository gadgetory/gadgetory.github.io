security conscious black phone
smartphone has made a tablet it's called
the black phone plus let's take a look
so this is a 7-inch tablet it's running
a locked down version of Android and
that's because this device is all about
security so when you buy this you get
access to silent circle's encrypted
services so that means you're going to
get encrypted voice over IP I'm getting
it encrypted video chat and an encrypted
contacts list at the moment there's no
encryption available for email yet at
least so another really interesting
trick that this tablet has is that it
lets you partition your work life away
from your personal life to be extra
secure so you can create a different
part of the tablet for your work stuff
that has a different password on it for
example it's a little bit like having
two devices in one so that could come in
handy if you use this thing for work and
you've got sensitive work information on
it but you still like handing the thing
to your kids every now and again so that
they can play a few games one thing to
mention is that this is a prototype
device silent circle says it's
experimenting a little with the look so
the final tablet might look a little
different to this one there's no fixed
price yet but silent circle says that it
hopes this thing's going to be coming
out in the autumn it also acknowledges
that no system is perfect but if you are
very security conscious and if you want
a high level of protection this might be
worth looking out for I'm loot where
I've seen at checkout cnet com splash
