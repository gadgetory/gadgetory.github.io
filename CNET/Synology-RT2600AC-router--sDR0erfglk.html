for missiology
is one of my favorite and here's what
first is fast it has the top Wi-Fi speed
of up to 700 actually more gigabit per
second also it has good range and quite
reliable in my testing but what I like
the most is operating system the so
called Synology router management it's
not only comprehensive also up for the
most unique feature on a routers ever
seen the coolest thing is the fact that
you can add more function to the route
of view of packages for example if you
want the router to download 5 by itself
or you get the download station if you
want to make your home network secure
get the intrusion prevention package
when VPN where I've got the VPN package
and more you can also actually add
packages that you develop yourself now
keep in mind that the router does not
have any internal storage so before you
can install or add anything to it you
need to connect a external hard drive to
one of eight USB port here or use an SD
card and by doing so you also turned the
router into a robust home network
storage server so you can easily to
store share folder or stream media to
different devices in your home and by
the way everything worked well with this
router in my trial now one of the things
is very hard for other routers to do
well that is a web filtering most of
them can block most website but not
secure website this one can so we can
plug Facebook YouTube on Google if you
want to you can also dictate the
broadband speed to a particular client
so that it will not hog the entire
bandwidth basically if you want to get
the most out of your network and have
the best control over your home this is
the route to have now that's it for my
money this one here is totally worth the
corn cross up some 450 dollars but for
your money you might want to consider
the older model the RT in 1900 I see now
it's a little bit slower but has exactly
the same creature set so basically if
your advanced user this is a great
router for you you will love it for the
rest of you I'm down go
that too don't you of course you do and
this is the RT 2100 AC router technology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
