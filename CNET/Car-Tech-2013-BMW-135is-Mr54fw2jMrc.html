always specialize in cars you can't
really afford and this guy they get back
to their roots of pretty affordable and
highly delectable let's try the 2013 BMW
135i s and check the tech now before we
talk about a 2013 anything we've got to
take you back to 1977 when in the u.s.
at least BMW is still a very niche very
European car maker then along comes the
original 320i and it captures a wide
swath of the American public's attention
great engine great suspension and
grownup elegant lines plus it was big
enough to look like something Americans
could imagine driving it also didn't
hurt that BMW 3-series arrived about the
same time that yuppies did in the
American cultural psyche and for better
for worse BMW has been the official car
of the American booze wah ever since but
the real key to the 3-series back in the
day was its simplicity its capability
and its style and that's what we're
seeking in the 1 Series today
now you may think the 1-series looks
almost comically small on the road but
if I can paraphrase glorious once and
it's the other cars that got bigger this
is actually just about the same
footprint as the original 3-series and
it was not considered a tiny car now
length is the most interesting
comparison the two cars are less than an
inch apart from their the height and
width grow a bit on the one series yet
it appears smaller on the road compared
to its contemporaries the one series has
two more cylinders a liter more
displacement and almost three times the
power moving 25% more weight from zero
to 60 in less than half the time it took
its ancestor all of this is a lesson in
modern car trends not just BMWs spot a
135 is by its wheels aerodynamic KITT
more monochrome body coloured parts
outside and the best-looking exhaust
tips this side of a Porsche in the back
that's 120 horse powers made it up with
317 foot-pounds of torque nice numbers
for a pretty compact car courtesy of a
lot of Technology as I mentioned twin
power turbo means one turbo but with two
Scrolls inside it four different
portions of the RPM range on top of that
you've got direct injection you've got
there completely variable valve train
technology and you've got traditional
front engine longitudinal rear wheel
drive only not even an all-wheel drive
available on this guy this is a
six-cylinder in-line it's a pretty big
piece of metal so they've done a good
job of shoving it way back toward the
cowl meaning you get some very nice
weight distribution on this car it's
about 49 51 which is pretty good
considering how big a lump you've got up
here in the nose now well this may be a
rather compact car it's got sort of
mid-range to good fuel economy you've
got 20 28 with the manual but a
significant haircut if you get the dual
clutch automated manual then you go down
to 1825
that's quite a delta and it's also
unusual to see a manual do better these
days
now one series is not a tech
tour-de-force
in the cabin most of BMWs cool cabin
tech not spoken here in fact on this
particular car we didn't even have an
LCD head unit navs not option and I like
the fact that we've got the old-school
orange and black display but they used
to call the BMW business radio now what
do they call it Oh professional it makes
no sense at all but I like the look very
stripped down and Spartan for a car that
I think does best in that vein you've
got all the sources you really need
am/fm HD radio CD slot USB ipod an aux
jack what you're missing is satellite
radio if you want that you've got to get
a big old fat option package that acts
me it's not all a carton nor is it
standard also not available here rear
view camera forget it you can get Park
censors it's about as good as it gets no
driver assistance technologies none of
the stuff that takes this car off
mission or off price
there's only one word that really
applies to this it's not spacious it's
not luxurious it doesn't have any real
presence but it's possible and that's
what a one series is all about
especially with the big motor now I wish
I didn't have the turbo lag there is
some in there and when it kicks in
there's definitely a sort of an e that
you get to but you can push this guy
around longer with that nice weight
balance there we go that nice deep one
less torque once you tap into it and
it's a party on four wheels here we go
diamond lean on it keep the speed up and
let that rear end just hang up
nice built the toss and don't say that
now I've got the traction control off
it's actually not too intrusive when
it's on I'm putting it back on now throw
into number three right here and it kind
of catches you what is you're about to
have too much fun very nice
an autocross cream with the exception of
the fact
nice turbo boost
it's not linear when it kicks in I would
love to drive this car with the non
turbo inline six and then you may have
the perfect possible predictable one six
the nice thing about a car that's a
smaller form factor like this one is
that you wear it more than drive it
it's no BRZ or or Miata but it's
definitely a car that feels like it's
more tailored to you than one of the
bigger BMWs that has equal prowess it's
just more personal
correct it's just hard to get this car
angry action there aren't any tires
laughs at the end of this particular
video but that's BMWs brand in the end
this is one of the most fun cars to push
around a track front-engine rear-drive
lots of power and a nice weight balance
a forgivable little guy as well if you
get in trouble with this car you were
asking for
20:13 135 is top of the stack for the
one series in the u.s. unless you want
to convert 40 for one out the door with
destination now to get it seen that
style I'm gonna pass over the Premium
Package that's 2,400 bucks I don't want
to spend on a bunch of convenience
features that just large the car up
instead I'll take 20 350 and put that in
the text package now we're talking
navigation BMW apps and more although it
does that an LCD head unit to the car
and kind of take it off its purist
mission that's the scene that style
choice
875 for Harman Kardon audio good choice
there and while I love the price I'm
gonna skip that dual clutch automated
manual only 450 bucks a blind steal but
this car needs a manual gearbox so done
up far away it's 40 for one closer to 50
then I want to be for the baby Beemer
but this is a nice car that's as close
as you'll get to the way it used to be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
