I can't find the answer to the question
I heard well
the echo may not know the answer but I
know another way to find out and perhaps
in the process we'll also find out what
makes this a smart speaker I'm Bill
Detweiler and this is cracking open
heart speaker park microphone part Star
Trek computer in your house the echo is
around nine and a quarter inches tall
and three and a quarter inches wide or
about the size of a one liter drink
container its controls are minimal there
are speaker on/off and action buttons on
the top as well as a rotating and
lighted volume ring on the bottom is the
connector for the power cord from the
outside that's really about all there is
to see
other than the microphone and speaker
holes that cover the echoes black
plastic shell so to learn what really
makes this speaker smart we'll have to
break out our screwdrivers and crack it
open to get inside the echo you'll need
to go through the bottom so first I
removed the rubber base now
unfortunately I used a bit too much
force and tore it during the process but
since it's on the bottom no one will
really notice when I put the echo back
together four screws hold the bottom
cover in place once I removed them and
disconnected a few cables I could remove
the cover which also holds the power
board now the lower speaker cover comes
off next followed by the outer shell and
a thin piece of fabric which sits behind
the speaker holes we now get our first
look inside the echo on the bottom is a
two-inch tweeter followed by a two and a
half inch woofer now the system board is
mounted to the side of the internal
frame and air chamber and finally a
volume ring control button and
microphone assembly is located on the
top another set of four screws hold the
tweeter in place and after removing them
I can lift out both the tweeter and the
woofer after detaching a few cables and
removing a few more screws the system
board came off neck
although much of the processing for the
echo happens in the cloud there are a
few cool chips on the board including a
Texas Instruments DM 3725 digital media
processor a 250 Meg Samsung mobile DRAM
chip a 4 gig
Toshiba NAND flash storage chip and a
Qualcomm QC a 60 to 34 wireless chip now
lastly I removed the volume ring
assembly which is made up of several
layers all sandwiched together and
covering the microphone and control
board now on the top of the control
board are the LEDs and contacts for the
speaker on/off button and the action
button on the underside are microphones
and more LEDs various LED drivers and
audio processors and the volume control
wheel with the echo completely in pieces
our teardown is complete well now we
know that there's plenty of cool tech
inside the echo and we got a look at the
speakers and air chambers that help it
deliver pretty good sound as small
bluetooth speakers go but did we find
out what makes the echo smart well yes
and the answer is as with most digital
assistants like Apple's Siri Microsoft's
Cortana or Google now the cloud
somewhere and massive data centers
armies of servers collect a recording of
your voice process your request and then
send a response back down to the echo in
essence the echo is just the ears and
mouths of Amazon's Alexa voice service
so the echo is only as smart as that
service is which I would say is average
as digital assistants go where the echo
really shines however is its always-on
capability day and night it's sitting
there waiting for you to make a request
now yes this is a bit creepy but it's
also incredibly useful sure I could take
my iPhone out of my pocket
hold the home button and ask Siri to do
the same thing as the echo but that's
just not as easy as walking into my
kitchen and asking Alexa what the
weather is to turn on the news
or to set a timer so I don't burn what
I'm cooking I've used the echo for
several weeks and found it to be
incredibly useful and as close to a Star
Trek computer as any digital assistant
I've tested now if I could only get the
echo to wake up when I say computer now
