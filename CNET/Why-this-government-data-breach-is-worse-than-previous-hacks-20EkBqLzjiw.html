massive hack and this time fingerprints
are stolen I'm Richard Carey this is
your CNET update it's easy to become
desensitized to hacking reports and data
leaks these days but the latest
government data breach isn't your
standard hack more than 22 million
people have had their personal
information stolen from cyberattacks on
the US government Office of Personnel
Management the stolen private info is
tied to past current and prospective
employees so if you apply for a federal
government job in the past 15 years and
a background check was done there's a
good chance you're in this mess this
time it went beyond stealing Social
Security numbers
it also included health and financial
history info on these employees
neighbors and spouses along with more
than a million people's fingerprints
these are finger prints of people who
needed government security clearances
losing fingerprints is a big deal just
like you see in the spy movies people
can make synthetic prints to trick a
security scanner and that means
fingerprint scanners are now compromised
this trick can even be done to fool the
iPhones fingerprint scanner the head of
the Office of Personnel Management
Katherine Archuleta has resigned in wake
of the breach but hackers didn't
directly attack her department's
computer systems they got in using the
credentials of another contractor with
access hackers go after the outside
people with the keys remember the
massive target credit card breach those
hackers got into computer systems
through a company that had security
access to building ventilation systems
it's no different than the movie cliche
of someone breaking in by disguising
themselves as the repairman or the
janitor but it's being done on a cyber
level well let's change topics to
something lighter
how about smartphones we could see the
next big Samsung smartphone unveiled
sooner than usual this year The Wall
Street Journal reports that Samsung
wants to show off the upcoming Galaxy
Note 5 in mid-august it used to be a
September reveal but it seems Samsung
wants to woo us before the next iPhone
comes out after all
iPhones are now as large as the notes
and for a brief time last year Apple was
out scouring Samsung in mark
sure and speaking of new products
there's some buzz that Apple may update
some of its iPods maybe as soon as
Tuesday the report comes from the French
tech blog I generation which has some
credible source leaks in the past but
there's also other evidence the newest
version of iTunes has some code and
graphics hidden inside showing iPods and
new colors like a bold blue hot pink and
beige and look closely at this
discovered graphic see the date on the
calendar Tuesday the 14th could that be
this Tuesday coincidence that's it for
this tech news update but there's always
more at cnet.com from our studios in New
York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
