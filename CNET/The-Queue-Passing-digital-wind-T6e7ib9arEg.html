demuro with cnet TV in New York City and
you are in the queue so the first legit
full length movie is now on YouTube four
eyed monsters clocks in at 71 minutes
and 54 seconds exactly 71 minutes and 24
seconds too long for the average youtube
viewer time for some eye candy cool
pictures from the crease stock
photography contest round 3 still open
for voting looking for the best speed
demon shop photos that convey a real
sense of speed previous rounds includes
sexy photos and the meeting of life so
the hd-dvd vs. blu-ray battle is just
driving me insane just over the weekend
I saw an HD DVD player at costco for 250
bucks tempting but not until there's a
clear winner apparently the new low HD
DVD player prices are helping the group
behind the technology says the players
now make up sixty percent of the market
sales of the discs also reaching an
all-time high in May selling 75,000
movies in the last week alone of course
over at blu-ray a similarly sunny story
they say seven out of the 10 top selling
HD movies are in blu-ray format the saga
continues Wall Street Journal with an
interesting article on a concept called
digital wind this is when you
unwittingly share private documents over
a peer-to-peer network it happens when
you share your entire My Documents
folder when all you really want to do is
share folders of your mp3s or videos the
article cites new studies from Dartmouth
center for digital strategies they found
sensitive financial documents on three
of the biggest p2p networks there were
loan applications bank statements and
more people either inadvertently
download the files when looking for a
similarly named media file or scout out
the private information the lesson watch
what you're sharing time for the beta
while juice gets a lot of the next gen
TV on your PC buzz how about a chew of
some bowel gum the internet TV network
now open to users around the world
available as a free download Babel gum
delivers niche programming there are
nine channels including news trends
music sports and documentary but the
cool part is that you can create your
own smart channel which automatically
generates a programming playlist based
on your personal preferences finally I'm
always
what pets do when you let them roam
outside you know they've had their own
little great adventure all day but
you're left in the dark unless you've
rigged the cat cam now you too can
follow a cat named mr. Lee as he wanders
into the real world the cat's owner
rigged a collar mounted camera that
automatically snaps a picture every few
minutes and then he downloads these to
his website the result pictures that
tell a story of snakes cat friends and
running back home the site also has
instructions for making your own cat cam
before you try this at home make sure
you consider the safety of your feline
friend you are now all cued up I'm rich
tomorrow with Cena TV
that might work for Sopranos but not
here don't say I didn't tell you so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
