announced its latest high-end phone the
v20 featuring a 5.7 inch display and an
aluminum design the v20 has a unique
rear cover release key which allows you
to pop off the backplate and access the
removable 3.2 ampere hour battery the
phone also has three cameras the two
shooters on the back include a 16
megapixel standard lens and an 8
megapixel wide-angle lens
similar to LG's g5 flagship on the front
is a single five megapixel camera but it
can capture both standard and wide-angle
images up to 120 degrees the camera also
has improved image stabilization and fun
filters that work on video recordings
similar to its v10 predecessor the V 20
has a narrow screen at the top of its
regular display here you can add a
signature and get shortcut access to
your favorite apps and contacts this
time however the secondary screen is
brighter and has a higher contrast so
it's easier to read although a few Nexus
phones have already received Google's
latest Android 7.0 update over-the-air
the V 20 will be the first handset to
come out of the box with the nougat OS
the update bakes and features like multi
window and replying inside a
notification with this device LG also
took a big emphasis on audio it equipped
the phone with three mics and four
digital to analog converters you also
have more advanced audio settings and
there's an app for HD audio recording

processor 4 gigs of ram 64 gigs of
internal memory with the ability to
