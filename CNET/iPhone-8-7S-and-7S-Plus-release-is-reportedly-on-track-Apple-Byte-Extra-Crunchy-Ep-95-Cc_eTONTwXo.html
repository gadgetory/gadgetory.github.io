my name is Steven Beecham and you are
tuned in to the hottest podcast on the
Internet the Apple byte extra crunchy
podcast with your host mr. Brian Tom get
your brain working your brain working
what's up everybody welcome to the show
Beach and Tong here in the house apple
byte extra crunchy episode 95 the
podcast for your listening pleasure all
things Apple all things our thing again
this is the show where you all are a
part of it it's an interactive back and
forth thing we livestream it we YouTube
livestream it we periscope stream it but
if you want to be a part of the show and
be in the show remember you all you have
to do is call us at 1-866-376-8255
firmware from last week continues to be
a treasure trove of everything and I
people that keep on messaging me and
telling me that it was done on purpose
the damn thing wasn't done on purpose
yeah there is no way there's so much
stuff not only are we talking about
iPhone 8 now people have been digging it
more we have stuff about the new Apple
TV for you we also have stuff about the
new Apple watch for you all of this
rooted from the home pod firmware
release of iOS 11 point 0.2 to
that enable and they didn't scrub it of
any of those references of some of the
new stuff and all the new goodies so
people continue to dig in
developers everywhere and then reveal
all this new stuff so I have a question
about this yeah what's up so do you
think Apple had a meeting after all
these leaks my microphone is screwed up
after all these leaks do you think they
might have had a meeting and said maybe
we need to codename the stuff for future
firmware will codes and
you know what I mean they've actually
always code-named everything for example
like the face ID is codenamed pearl and
it's referenced as pearl ID in the
developer in the developer notes so what
what a lot of these guys they're digging
in is they're looking for similar things
they've seen from the previous iPhones
they're going to those same strings
finding new terminology then searching
for that terminology to try and figure
out what is it like no it has been now
revealed like pearl is basically their
face ID or face recognition platform we
also have things like gizmo which is the
code name that was kind of leaked out by
the New York Times a long time ago that
references the new Apple watch people
start looking for those terms in the new
firmware to see what it's related to and
then it surfaces all this good stuff
yeah but I remember this code was like
pretty self-explanatory is like face
detect oh yeah exactly type in the word
face and see wherever it shows up as
well so Perl ID related to face to text
so let's jump into the newest stuff
because people complain oh you've got
all this stuff late it's called a weekly
show it's called a weekly podcast I
think that's why we do it weekly let's
just jump into what is dropped today as
of Friday some of the new information
now is talking about everyone was
worried about the delays of the iPhones
are the new ones gonna come on time well
they come out in September will they
come out in October some outlets are
even reporting maybe as late as November
here's the latest piece that we have
right now all three 2017 iPhone models
according to digit times rx have entered
volume production ahead of the expected
September launch we don't know when
Apple's going to do the official
announcement we'll find out typically a
week before they do that and typically
it's been done in early September that
doesn't mean they'll stick to early
September when they talk about these
phones have entered volume production
mass production large quantities that
are going to be able to be fulfilled all
rumors are not only digit on digit times
report this but minke quote from KGI
securities also talked about how that
new 7s and 7s plus
kind of standard size phones that were
used to right now will have more than
enough quantity it's the oled iphone 8 /
iphone x /
i phone future that is the one that'll
be in limited quantities much like the
seven plus was with the portrait mode
camera this past year so I think
everyone that's worried about what it
when are these coming they're still on
track pretty much so don't worry like it
seems like they're getting on the ball
and they're gonna make sure that they're
gonna be on time cuz the last few
releases they can you hear that that's
bad arable bad that's new that's a new
problem everybody but yeah their last
few releases have been behind so they
they're making sure that they're gonna
be on point alright so we'll see just
how that shakes out also in addition to
that news that just dropped today not
only is Apple in volume production
they've been placing orders for this 3d
sensing laser component and so this
company or the supplier they're called
Lou mentum they've received over 200
million dollars in bookings for the rest
of the 2017 calendar year related to
components for what they call vertical
cavity surface emitting lasers VCSEL for
short but these are believed to be aimed
specifically for Apple's 3d sensing
camera to be used on the iPhone 8 let's
just talk about in comparison in their
last fiscal quarter how many how much
money worth of orders do you think they
got if they just got received a two
hundred million dollars in bookings from
Apple for the rest this year what do you
think Beechum don't look at the source
don't worry I have no idea what if I
told you was five million Wow
so five million to two hundred million a
huge jump we know how this 3d sensor at
least in many ways is going to play in
the whole facial recognition system
we're gonna talk about that more in a
bit but this company Lou mentum they're
pretty happy right now so it's a laser
it uses a laser to tell like depth like
a depth sensor using lasers LG's phone
has had similar ones for taking
photography where it uses basically a
laser to pinpoint the depth of where you
are to get a better focus focal point
how does it appear adjust the line how
does like Instagram and snapchat do it
when they put those a I filters over
here or those you know the augmented
reality filters over your face that's
just using the camera using the camera
and
features I mean they don't have exact
depth information but they can they can
still see you know it's really more like
your facial features it's not it's not
based on depth as much it is as what
look at my face and being able to build
a framework here's my eyes there's my
nose here's my ears there's my lips yes
sir those are like shockingly fast you
know like you put a thing in it like
pops right on yeah I imagine that that
technology is super fast now instagrams
were also really bad like they look my
straight up my five-year-old nephew
could do better ones than that it's like
man that's horrible so what's the
difference with this it's gonna blast a
laser in her face will be laser laser be
able to have a laser will enable
focusing to be extremely fast it can
pinpoint exactly the depth that you're
at at that moment I see okay so it's
like measuring the distance between yeah
exactly exactly so that that's that's
where you have these depth sensing
cameras also when it's a 3d sensing
camera that uses lasers that can pretty
much build a general wireframe of your
body of your shoulders of your face why
is that important if we're talking about
more specific augmented reality to be
able to see this versus the surface of
this table and they use that that's
really important yeah so um we we
already have a certain level of sensors
in the phone but nothing this specific
so this is gonna be a big a big deal
when it comes to AR kit and other
platforms that Apple is implementing
into the iPhone so alright let's keep on
rolling through kind of some of these
other things
maangchi quo we referenced him about how
he said that mass production is on time
also it appears according to him that
the iPhone the 2017 lineup of iPhones
will initially only come in three colors
his report is that it'll be silver black
and gold although there's been kind of
this copper looking model or like a more
bronze copper model that's been floating
around he also says that the phones will
not only be announced at the same time
but they'll be launching at the same
time and again it's that OLED iPhone 8 /
iPhone X / iPhone future that is
believed to be really the one that a you
know could be a little slower slower to
arrive just because of lower quantities
so we have that all right
talk about this boatload of recent leaks
again from the home pod firmware this is
stuff that you've kind of collected if
you're on top of this you've heard about
this stuff over the past you know really
three or four five days or so but not
everyone is so we want to kind of get
you up to speed the biggest thing is
facial recognition everyone keeps on
saying oh why do I have to hold this up
to my face it's not it's gonna take
longer it may not be as accurate we're
gonna find out exactly what it's like
when Apple releases it but with the
facial recognition according to what
people have found in the source code it
could mean that Apple themselves will be
able to use facial recognition while
your phone is laying flat on a table
while your phone is indifferent maybe
not your normal standard angles but
instead of you having to lift it up and
hold it up to your face in the developer
code you're going to be able to at least
unlock your phone while it's resting on
a table that's what this alludes to if
it's true Apple themselves is really
touting mark gurmann right Rumour Apple
News guru had also put a tweet out that
Apple is really gonna try and position
this as kind of like this face ID
platform that's that's kind of the name
that is starting to be used around a lot
more commonly but it'll be faster it'll
be quicker it'll be it'll take more data
points from you not only just you know
whether it's a combination of iris
recognition 3d 3d detection of your face
also in the early reports there were
some level of being able to tell that
you're actually a live living beam right
whether it's like ticks or something you
know subtle movements in how you are so
you couldn't just hold up a photo and it
would unlock and I think that's the
number one thing everyone just says
instantly like you're gonna be able to
hold up a photo and lock it it's not the
case it has to detect like blood flow or
something even even with the Samsung's
iris scanning you had to take a photo
and then put on a contact lens over that
photo and then hold that photo up to it
and it didn't mean they would always
work but it took it wasn't just like
holding up a photo for it to unlock it
wasn't that easy I mean there's ways to
make it more difficult but it just
wasn't that easy so the whole idea is if
it is really as fast people internally
according to mark remand say this
face ID or facial recognition is going
to be extremely fast we'll see if it if
it's fast enough I don't think people
will care yeah it kind of reminds me
when you're saying different angles and
stuff like that it kind of reminds me
when you're first you know in putting a
fingerprint into your phone then it
makes you do like different edges of
your finger and stuff so you can kind of
get it all down really quick and then
you can kind of just half-ass it and get
into your phone easily it's kind of
similar huh yeah just you know I mean
there'll be some sort of level of
initial calibration yeah but again the
whole idea of if it look if I pick up my
phone and by the time I get to like
thirty degrees if it can already unlock
that's fast enough right yeah it does if
I have to go all the way to 90 that's
gonna be a different story but if they
does it like around 30 45 degrees you
know where my arm is that compared to
where I pick it up from that's gonna be
fast enough and I don't think people are
gonna really care as much but this is
all speculation that we're talking about
I know yeah it has to be really it has
to be very fast you can't like I hope
you don't have to like stare at it for a
second then it comes on and then also
like taking up we've talked about this
before taking off sunglasses or whatever
if you're wearing a hat or something
weird who knows what we're gonna find
you how we will I'd this is the thing
right we've got about a month about a
month and a half out before we really
find out everything but because this
look if there was not this leaked by
Apple that everyone says when it was
intentional but it's not we wouldn't
have as much stuff to talk about but
there's so many nuggets like in
relationship to the facial recognition
system new reports again found within
the code are talking about how this will
likely work with Apple pay so so there
was a voicemail about how that would
work and I'm curious how that I've been
using Apple pay here too at the vending
machine a lot and you know I'm curious
how that's gonna work I just double tap
and I hold it it's good so the thing is
you may not even have to hold you know
other than do some sort of gesture on
the phone maybe you're gonna be good to
go
so yeah even even there might be a
signal that sent from that point of sale
unit that already activates the fact
that that prompts Apple pay to show up
your face is just there and then it just
does it - yeah I've been doing like the
double tap and then it asks for a
thumbprint to authorize and then and
then tap the
the iPhone 7 is so fast I don't even
have to you only have to redo the finger
pain yes oh yeah you are seeing your
prey you are slow I'm Way behind bro
catch me up I'm trying to help you out
man
trying to help you out get on that
iPhone eight gravy train I think also
what I've noticed is as time has gone on
even though there's a lot of leaks about
this a lot of people are genuinely
excited about the new iPhone coming out
now it's like that first you're gonna
have the naysayers like that say Oh
Samsung did it yes Android did it yes
but is the thing about it is if you
haven't had a new feature on your phone
and then you all of a sudden have it for
the first time on your phone guess what
it's going to feel new to you and guess
what you're not gonna really care yeah
like portrait mode people went crap like
bonkers about portrait mode and we've
seen phones that have been able to shoot
relatively you know depth of field type
stuff mm-hmm but guess what when it's
new to your phone you're like oh yes who
sells hundreds of millions of phones
it's Apple Apple baby also another
report says this one coming too from
developer yellow herm Rambo who really
is the first one to kind of break the
news on the home pod firmware leak the
iPhone 8 may mute notification sounds
when the user is actually looking at the
screen which alludes to the fact that
this kind of facial recognition facial
detection in a creepy way might be
passively always happening so it's
always looking huh that's always it's
always look looky looky that's what
people are most uncomfortable about you
know like Lex is always listening it is
series always listening or this is how
it you know everything is always on now
you got if you want to be plugged in if
you want to be part of the future that
sounds like a battery problem to me it
cameras always watching it might be I
mean we'll see what type we'll see how
they handle all this stuff that's the
other issue right a lot of new sensors
new technology is the battery life gonna
be the same it's probably the only way
that they really are able to squeeze out
a lot of battery life these days is when
they optimize the operating system you
know they're not putting a bigger
battery in this thing in fact they're
putting like kind of some sort of like
an l-shaped battery RUP rumors yeah yeah
into this phone so even even if it's an
l-shape battery and you get like a
little bit it's it's real
more about the optimization of the OS
because we're these phones are getting
thinner they're not getting thicker so
there's not as much space for these a
battery so we'll see how that all shakes
out and then also to kind of play on
with this whole wireless charging aspect
of the new iPhone pictures allegedly
leaked from an employee from Foxconn our
screen grabs of an iPhone in its eighth
room rumoured iPhone 8 in its final
verification test stage alright this is
called engineering validation test the
codename of this product in the top
corner says Ferrari EVT Ferrari is
referenced as the internal name codename
for the iPhone 8 oh yeah so it looks
like we're looking exactly at it and
that there's a big black dot in the
center and really what that big black
dot is is the coil to for the wireless
charging capability of the iPhone ok so
it's this charging coil that then would
that's the money spot where you have to
like put it on some sort of a dock to
then get you your wireless charging
functionality
I think it's cool they're like calling
it the Ferrari that's like the Ferrari
of internally yeah they should just call
it the iPhone future they should just
call it future so uh it's pretty good I
think we should just take a little
breather because I've heard that we
should probably read something today
should we do that yeah should we keep
our show alive let's check it out Jam
software today's show brought to you
from our friends at Jam now J AM F as
your business grows so does your supply
of tech equipment and as a result it
gets harder to keep track of everyone's
Macs and iPhones and iPads thankfully
Jeff now helps you manage your Apple
devices from anywhere so keeping up with
your equipment is a breeze need to
secure that iPad that your sales rep
loss on a recent business trip shame on
them champ now allows to configure
settings protect sensitive information
even lock or wipe a device no matter
where you are that way you can focus on
your business without any IT expertise
needed I know the IT guys here use Jim
do they really yeah a lot of businesses
and companies do quite obviously you
just didn't realize this would be killer
for like a small start-up like a
people and this for Apple devices you
can even jam an Apple TV in case you
didn't know that's Pacheco set up their
first three devices for three for free
sorry add more for just two bucks a
month per device start securing your
business today go to Jam comback /
crunchy to create a free account and
setup your three free devices today
that's Jam com / crunchy you got that
got it you got it got him alright let's
jump into more stuff coming out to you
from the firmware leaks you want to talk
about we haven't talked about the Apple
TV in the longest time yeah because the
only time that the Apple TV really comes
up is if it has to do with the fact that
Apple never was able to get their ish
together and give us a streaming TV
service of any kind in any way shape or
form we'll talk about some of the
streaming stuff later
aka Disney and like every other company
has managed to do oh yeah literally
every like PGA Tour has one easy easy
peasy I mean ever there's four or five
companies that have their own TV
streaming service with relationships
with the major networks but guess what
the Big Eight couldn't do it oh well
they're lost now right I mean that's
that's all on them so what we have here
in the code again for the firmware of
the home pod there's been references
which reveal the fact that the a new
upcoming Apple TV will have most likely
4k HDR support nice there are strings in
the code that said display mode Dolby
and display mode HDR 10 that's really
direct references to Dolby vision and
HDR 10 those are the two formats for 4k
video depending on your television set
some support some support both I believe
for example LG TVs and Vizio TVs support
Dolby vision and HDR 10 some TVs only
support HDR 10 because it's software
based and Dolby vision is actually like
a chip based
kind of system and partnership and
licensing agreement that you can go
through but if I can recall right my
brain could be wrong I swear that they
kind of changed some of the terms with
Dolby vision that it can that in the
future it'll be done also a software
based if I'm wrong
you guys can correct me but that makes
it easier to put on TVs when I hear
Dolby I hear I think like 5.1 sound is
that well yeah for that for 5.1 set so
not only does it allow for a 5.1 sound
allows for a dolby atmos sound as well
so so here's the thing Dolby vision and
dolby atmos are their own two
proprietary formats that are then
licensed to certain company so if you
look on the back of some of the blu-rays
you buy or if you buy the 4k blu-rays
there's actually just standard blu-ray
discs you will see a little logo that
says dolby atmos on it and that's that
and but then again look you have to have
not only a dolby atmos disc you have a
have to have a dolby atmos compatible
receiver and then you have to have a
Dolby Atmos system which is basically
like a a five point one point two system
that's a lot of i surround sound
speakers a subwoofer and then to ceiling
firing speakers so which i have so this
it is what dolby atmos is is redonk at
the home so then this this leak is kind
of alluding to you can have four home
pods in your house or five home pods
well I don't think I know it's actually
not related to having four or five home
pods it's just more related to that the
Apple TV as a device will support 4k
video okay and the two 4k you know how
there was like HD DVD and blu-ray for a
long time there were two different
formats but they both displayed 1080p
blu-ray video are sorry 1080p video this
is the same thing
HDR 10 and Dolby vision are technically
competing standards but they're starting
to now be readily adopt adopted by all
companies all right so there's some
hardware that only like there's some TV
sets like I believe samsung only
supports HDR 10 but then future ones
ideally would support Dolby vision and
HDR 10 they all have their kind of like
different optimizations it's I could get
into it's like one of the format Wars
that's happen but most people don't even
see it it's invisible
them so anyways the appletv expected to
support some of this which would be a
huge deal also later to touch on more
appletv support Steven trout Smith
another huge big time developer was able
to crack into the TV OS simulator which
kind of displays what is going on if you
know people use it for their apps and
whatnot of how they look and they can
simulate this at home he was also able
to find thanks to some of the code
options for a resolution of 3840 by 2160
which is ding-ding-ding that is 4k video
boom so look we don't know when this
Apple TV is coming it could be coming
I got a hope that it's coming by the end
of the year Apple could have a huge
holiday season if they just drop a bomb
give us the new iPhones come around
October give us a new Apple TV and Apple
watch just drop it on us already it's
all starting to work together and be
merry
it's the momentum has taken a long time
to build but it's getting there it's
getting there so that's kind of the
latest that we have with Apple TV news
again no word of any type of Apple
service I man to by now they're just not
there's not gonna do it there's so many
different options there's there's five
weds hulu has their own TV service
YouTube has their own TV service sling
TV has their own service PlayStation
View has their own TV service those are
the big for all the major those have
their own everyone now has their own
platform their own app sports so yeah
just CBS let's not forget our favorite
CBS I'm just gonna I'm gonna leave that
right there all right let's talk about
some Apple watch again new stuff
revealed from the freakin firmware
originally last kind of like earlier
last week Bloomberg and our friend Mark
gurmann dropped the bomb with a in depth
report about the fact that Apple is
planning to release a cellular capable
LTE based Apple watch the series three
Apple watch sometime this year the big
thing about that really is that last
year there were rumors that Apple was
going to actually do an LTE based Apple
watch but they didn't the the problem
was really optimizing
battery-life did they wanted to put an
LTE chip in there and just kill your
battery life they weren't able to tweak
it or get it good enough so they opted
not to do it we don't know how much
better the battery optimization has been
able to be improved
I've got imagine to a certain degree
also just watch OS in general but watch
OS is like really light the main thing
about this LTE Apple watch is the idea
that it will be give us kind of that
free independency from our phone the
more I use the Apple watch and the phone
well if my Apple watch is charged like
see look again fashion statement not
even charged but the more that we use
the Apple watch on its own this is
really more I think for people that are
active runners on the go I think people
are gonna freak out and feel naked
without their without their phones for a
while again we're gonna move in the
future like a way way down the future
we're gonna move to a point where we
don't really have a the phone that we
know is not gonna be the phone right but
you know that for that first time you go
out and you just have an Apple watch I
think it's gonna be kind of cool but
it's kind of freaked you out - yeah I'm
gonna pear I think you gonna be scared I
think you have anxiety this is first
world problem stuff right here you used
to that little weight in your pocket
there's got to be some first world
therapist out there that are gonna have
to deal with these anxiety issues that
y'all gonna get it's just it's just
inevitable yeah so anyway some marker
man just talked about in depth about the
plan released the cellular capable watch
it will be using an Intel based modem so
that's a that's that's the rumor that
it'll have an Intel based modem for that
not a Qualcomm modem and that is also
kind of interesting because if you've
been following some of the news there's
a lot of beef between Apple and Qualcomm
specifically suing each other over
different uses of or you know different
patents blah blah blah they're going
back and forth and they're not really
friends right now they're beefing bottom
line until an Apple aren't but then if
you remember when the new iPhone 7 came
out there were there were proof just
positive proof that an Intel based modem
for the iPhone 7 was not performing as
well as the Qualcomm base modems oh
really
yeah in the phone like to get oh that's
right Euler connectivity
faster rates a better signal I know I
have an intel-based one and I know the
signal my phone is not nearly as good as
it used to be for an iPhone 6s that's
right I know this for ask kind of a
controversy yeah and so and then also
Qualcomm was complained that Apple is
actually throttling down their modems so
that the performance would be even or a
revelant relatively around the same as
the L Intel based modems I just forgot
all about that that's all this like
inside baseball stuff so guess what
they're not happy but Apple is looking
to use Intel based modems for the new
Apple watch inside the latest code there
are also references to an LTE based
modem for the Apple watch so that's
gonna happen but we don't know when it's
got to come out by the end of this year
though I would assume I would assume so
we have guiding those so you can finally
make calls from your Apple watch I mean
that's that's an exciting and this is
forward this is gonna give moral
momentum for for earpods quite honestly
because I don't want to talk to my wrist
I know yeah I'm not that I'm sorry I'm
not that guy who's gonna do that
although people say my shirt might
indicate otherwise
it's very James Bondish that would be
kind of cool now you're sure the talking
yeah that was like wait like what are
you doing with that pink camo shirt bro
all right let's keep on rollin through
the rest of this we also have just kind
of a quick update note the fifth betas
for iOS Mac O's and TV OS have been
related and watching us basically for
developers they put out the fourth
public beta so if you guys want to get
on that it's kind of play around and
tweak with it that's fine um there's
again it's the latest version of the
software it's not final I still love the
iPad beta but for some reason I can't
connect to my the works corporate Wi-Fi
anymore oh no and I think it's because
of the beta but that's ok that's ok I'm
really sad about that another story this
has kind of been always going on but we
don't we haven't had any concrete data
according to the Financial Times Apple
is working on surprise-surprise like
they do with every product several
different kinds of wearable augmented
prototypes it's trying to find out the
most compelling application for a a our
augmented reality headset look they're
gonna learn so much from a our kit and
the iPhone in these next few years I
think that's really gonna drive their
direction of how they can use these
glasses remember just remember that this
year
what was it I mean it's been shows ago
but when everyone's like what could be
the next big thing from Apple like what
could be that product I think if it's
going to be anything and it's not gonna
be this year or next year or maybe two
years it's it could be the pair of Apple
glasses yeah that is the only thing that
I think that they can get ahead of
everyone like actual glasses not
straight-up like crazy big chunky
headsets and they're not trying to go
for virtual reality we know they're not
but if there's some if there is a
product that maybe it could be there
next thing could be I think that that
would be thing it's not gonna be a car
it's not gonna be like any it's not
gonna be the Apple watch the Apple watch
is good it's not great it's not like
everyone's going crazy over the Apple
watch well we saw people go crazy over
the snapchat glasses they did go for a
week yeah until they use them well
that's I think that has a lot to do
because they're marketing like really
suck like they put like a you know like
a vending machine out one place for a
day this is terrible the snapchat
glasses had a lot of buzz but then when
you use them constantly like I used them
for a little while just to see what it
was all about and then you're like okay
like it's alright it's a cool idea they
kind of said it focus to one specific
thing taking little video clips that you
can rotate your phone 360 and again the
tech world can get seduced by like the
newest hottest thing but I've seen now
these snapchat distribution boxes just
like a big yellow rectangle in the
Southern California area at a major mall
on a Saturday or Sunday where no one's
in line for it oh really
yeah this also they're like around 150
170 bucks or something like that you
know so this is not this is not
something that everyone is really doing
yet because it's also it's a very it was
a very limited specific use case and
that's good that's actually a smart
thing to do
then you don't see all these
snapchatters using snapchat and guess
what guess who is scooping on snapchat
its Instagram Oh big time once Instagram
took on that story thing people are on
Instagram more than they're on snapchat
snapchats
stock is dropping like a tank because
people just aren't using it they're not
making enough money they talk about all
these original shows on snapchat all
this new content but guess what like
people are just doing their stuff on
Instagram now so the Apple AR glasses
will probably have apps like any any
other project they have right you just
download an app yeah I got my Instagram
app I got my snapchat I got my Baba I
know I mean look my niece use the
snapchat all the time with her friends
but I'm just saying whether it's the
millennial generation that I don't even
know what you called the generation
that's even younger than Millennials now
that's where she's at they're using it
but it doesn't mean it's a large enough
segment or cross section of the
population like Instagram she ended up
jumping on Instagram because people are
you know even the young folks when I say
young folks I'm talking about like 12 13
year old yeah they're starting to jump
over to a little bit so we'll see what
we'll see I think the whole idea of
Apple glasses is interesting we saw what
happened to Google glass but that was
like a beta product that they tried to
release and announce as a publicly
viable product which was completely just
a huge disconnect so and I'm not gonna
wear Apple Apple glasses aren't for me I
don't wear glasses man yeah I know
they're not for me but I mean I know
some of y'all that wear like glasses
without the lens hipster so they're
gonna be the ones that are buying the
Apple glasses that's that's what they do
so what y'all do all right um two other
quick little notes carpool karaoke
finally on Apple TV
finally a carpool karaoke there it won't
have James Corden all the time but
they're sometimes matching celebrities
together like we got Alicia Keys and
John Legend they did like Metallica and
another singer um they'll have like so
you know it just depends I'm sure
they're gonna drop in court in here and
they're just so people feel like oh it's
actually the thing it's it's the series
I know like Will Smith is doing stuff
with them and stuff like that
for Apple music subscribers you can now
check it out on Apple music I'd like to
know what you guys think I don't I don't
still have an Apple music subscription
service cuz that's just not my it's just
not my bag baby yeah it looks very I
don't know they weren't even in a car
for a minute there they were in a
carpool karaoke they're gonna be doing
like other things so I might watch the
Will Smith one I like Will Smith so that
would require you to pay for Apple music
justice II Will Smith's
carpool karaoke you sure you're gonna do
that I'm just wondering see ya and I'm
also curious like did they make an
agreement where they could actually put
some of the stuff on TV because of or
maybe like eventually they put it on on
TV oh yeah I got everyone can watch this
it's a really good segment yeah Gordon's
gonna if it's Gordon and Will Smith why
isn't that on the network why isn't that
on network TV guys it's got a trickle
out there eventually
yeah and then because Disney and Apple
and their relationship with Pixar and
there's a lot of cross-pollination there
between the groups I thought this was
interesting to maybe what it might mean
or point to for the Apple TV and what
type of services we might see them on
there the latest report from CNBC is
that Disney is going to pool its movies
from Netflix and will eventually start
its own streaming services now you have
to remember Netflix just got Disney
content in 2016 oh wow they just did
they cuz they signed an agreement so
that Disney movies would be on there and
then I was like I'm kind of like I
thought it was crazy because Civil War
yeah I know it's been like a year but
when Civil when Martin went in America
Civil War showed up on my Netflix I was
like dang like that's kind of crazy
movies like The Jungle Book showed up
like I felt like six months after they
were in the theaters when you saw that I
was like whoa and there's a lot of
people that don't see them look Disney
is going to pull out from Netflix in two
thousand 2018 so it's not gonna it's not
like Disney is just pulling all their
content out right now but what these
announces that they are not only
intending to pull this out of Netflix
but they will launch their own Disney
direct consumer streaming so
in 2019 so it'll be like smart the home
and you know why they did this right
they were like oh crap look at the data
look at how many they you know they have
stream numbers of how many people are
watching Disney stuff on that place oh
hell yeah and they're like um yeah we're
gonna pull out of this and just do like
they seated the public a little bit -
you're like oh well sprinkle some Disney
shows out there see how it does oh yeah
oh whoa it did really well let's make
our own cuz they got they have they have
their animation networks they have
Disney XD not that I know they got
Marvel Star Wars Marvel Star Wars Pixar
Disney it's like the Fab Four yeah you
know that's all you need just put there
somewhere else have someone pay what
seven eight bucks I'm on it's not cheap
I hope it's seven eight bucks so there
the thing is that they're gonna be
splitting off but it'll be interesting
to see you know will they most likely
they'll have this service available on
all devices not just the Apple TV but I
find it interesting because you know
it's just showing how these whole the
world of streaming content from actual
companies that are big enough there's
completely fragmenting off and just
saying you know we're gonna do it
ourselves yeah it seems like everyone's
doing that now and it's like you know
divide and conquer I guess everyone was
just dividing all their content up and
putting it out in different ways well if
you don't watch sports it's really easy
to cut the cord yes yes and so what I
what I also find interesting is that not
only is Disney pulling out from Netflix
they also said in 2000 in 2018 they're
going to launch their own ESPN streaming
service that will include sports games
like MLB NHL and MLS content that's
pretty cool so but the thing is like I
need my MBA oh like if there's no MBA I
don't even care about that come on come
on whoa yeah I didn't hear any PGA Tour
on that list no care though it doesn't
the PGA Tour have their own app that
they stream they stream all their events
yeah it's like five dollars even the
ones on CBS like the Masters PGA Tour
but the Masters yeah gets CBS different
different uh different providers get it
like USA has like US Open and
actually Fox's US Open USA has the PGA
champ so yeah I guess divide it up but
I'm curious to see how they would do
that yeah
all right oh my I think we're gonna get
two calls that's it man
yeah again everybody that's that loves
to chicken and hang out with us the
phone number to call is 1-866-376-8255
that stuff there you go thanks for
taking my question and have a good day
right
I think the honest answer is we still
don't exactly know but the expectation
is that the iPhone eight will be using
the new face detection and then the
iPhone 7s and 7s plus we'll still have
touch ID and we'll be obviously cheaper
that'll be one of the distinguishing
features that make them different from
each other other than the screen other
than potentially the camera and then as
well as this quote-unquote we don't have
an official name for yet face ID versus
touch ID it just remains to be seen how
not only how different it is but how
well it works but all indications that
the 7s and 7s plus we'll still use touch
ID but no one has our I really clarify
that but it look it has a they have a
physical home button just like the seven
so just think of everything your seven
does and maybe a few improvements if it
comes to processor things of that nature
but there's not gonna be wireless
charging on a7s maybe they'll surprise
me but there's not gonna be so all those
goodies are gonna bump up to the eight
yeah the consensus in our YouTube chat
seems to be the touch ID will be gone on
the 7s and 7s plus on the new on oh yeah
oh yeah pretty much yeah it's like all
the stuff that was leaked there is I
mean I'll shave my head if there's touch
ID on the iPhone eight oh you heard it
here shave his head you know what'd be
cool is if you shaved your head and they
were still like a streak under your on
your skin on your scalp oh look turns
match the carpet okay Mexico too much of
remove on hey Brian hey Beach I love the
show you guys have some great chemistry
so I have two questions my first
question and this is related to a
possible Apple October event so we all
know that September will probably be
devoted to new iPhones so my question is
do you think that an October event might
be reserved for maybe an introduction of
a new Apple TV or and I watch or what do
you think it will be devoted to second
question and this is related to the
MacBook Pro so I have to admit I hate
the touch bar and I was wondering do you
think that Apple might release a 15-inch
MacBook Pro without touch bar in the
future and also do you think that the
touch part might be phased out in future
MacBook Pro models okay so my name is
Miro I'm from in New York City and thank
you very much fine okay that was like
four questions that was it - so I'm
gonna I'm gonna try and break this down
based on my memory so yes we kind of
talked about it there's there's got to
be some sort of event how about this I
hope there is for the Apple TV
there will be no event for the iWatch
because the eye watch is not a product
that Apple produces it's called the
Apple watch I'm sure we we will talk for
life on a show like this for 45 minutes
and guess what you're gonna sometimes
slip and say wrong things I think the
last week I said field of depth when
describing the kit the portrait mode
instead of depth of field yeah I got I
got crapped on I got crapped on that's
where Twitter's for exactly I mean
Twitter's always right no one makes a
mistake other than the people that get
yelled at on Twitter so Apple
without a doubt we're gonna see it this
year unless October he's asking is in
October yeah sure why not but if they if
they're coming full if 2017 is this
badass year that they talk about they
should just drop it all they're the only
reason why I would see an an Apple watch
getting moved to next year was just
purely because of battery optimization
issues hmm that's but I don't think
delaying it for a few months is really
gonna make that much of a difference
yeah if they're using the same size
battery I don't think it'll make that
much of difference
um the other question about the 15 inch
book MacBook Pro with a touch bar
without a touch bar I wanted them to
give us that often from the start but
the reason why I don't ever see them
doing that yet unless the touch bar is
so get such horrible feedback that they
completely killed is that based on if
you look at the price points of the
MacBook Pro family
it's very deliberate that the 13 has a
no touch bar option then a touch bar
option and then if you go large you go
15 it's going to have a touch bar it's
it's more that's strategic to pricing
they don't want to get they don't want
you to buy something like $100 $200 in
between the 13 inch touch bar and a 15
inch touch bar they just want you to
spend more money and get the 15 inch
touch bar so that's just pure from a
business strategy economics reason is
why I don't expect to see it do I want a
15 inch with no touch bar absolutely
yeah I know how damn annoying it is to
change the volume or the brightness on
your computer I haven't even tried it
sounds annoying just you even like
bringing that up like you can't just tap
it you got to touch it and scroll it I
mean yeah you can you can custom make
like a default touch bar but it's like
and then there's no haptic feedback on
it so it just feels weird to touch it it
just feels weird so we get we got
another voicemail that we didn't use
today and he was talking about how much
he hated the touch bar so you're not
alone bTW someone in the periscopes all
asking that is there any expectation for
a new iPad pro anytime soon come on they
just released iPad throws I'm sorry
right now as of today the iPad pro is my
favorite Apple device of the year with
iOS 11 hands down cool I feel like
I could talk about it for ages but I'm
not going to there's like two of you use
it okay
all right next call let's call a beach
and telling mrs. Bryant New Orleans with
all the leaks coming out about the the
face detect instead of using such Ivy
it's intriguing it's neat and I know we
don't know exactly how it's gonna work
yet but one thing that I'm a little
nervous I guess I'll use that term about
is um not necessarily just unlocking the
phone but authenticating for payments so
I just think it'll be pretty awkward if
you're holding your phone up to a
vending machine or something like that
have to make sure you're holding the
phone up or the near frequency alert and
then also kind of positioning your face
it's just really easy and elegant just
to you know hold your thumb up against
the touch ID sensor and complete the
purchase so obviously we're waiting for
Apple to show us and tell us how that
will work but if there's no touch ID at
all I wonder if that will affect the
Apple pay usage in any way love to hear
which thanks thanks I think without a
doubt look someone who uses a Apple pay
on a regular basis with an iPhone 7
that's faster than a Beecham's iPhone 6
6s do one more tap yes for someone who
uses it it is super convenient cuz you
just like hold it right on the spot but
again if this space unlock is and this
face ID platform is as fast as Apple
internally thinks it is and is bragging
about and can actually detect your face
at all different at different angles
then that remains to be seen again you
know until we actually use it we just
don't know so I can't comment but if
it's faster well then even putting your
finger in any kind of position yeah then
that's faster if it's like a double tap
to open not even a double tap what if I
just pick it up in because it's within
proximity of a POS system that pings it
and it can see the my face from its
angle you know that's I mean that's like
okay we'll see we'll see I'm like making
up the idea that it's really gonna work
like that
come on someone was asking should I buy
in in the chat should I buy an Apple
watch right now or wait um you should
wait
yeah wait to get the one you can make a
call on man
that's what I'm talking about I'm
curious what the LTE cost would be per
month probably probably standard like Oh
15 20 bucks for one gig 65 for a week
yeah 65 for unlimited data you know
they're gonna do that come on
but on a watch it may not go as fast
yeah wanna watch it may not go as fast
it's gonna be basically a cell phone
plan for your watch yeah and then if you
already have
I think the key that they're gonna try
and work on is adding it to your current
plan without making you pay like a full
65 80 bucks maybe you pay 40 bucks it's
like this is what they're gonna do
they're gonna charge you like not the
same amount as a brand new device you'll
pay a little more but then with that
amount more that you pay it's not like
you're gonna get a ton more data it'll
be like oh yeah this will work with your
current plan and we'll give you like an
extra Giga data just wear your watch
yeah yeah you know yeah I guess I don't
know like that we already we already can
tell that's gonna be a whole thing that
we're gonna have to break down one day
and it's gonna take a lot of thinking
okay next call yo Brian we've seen you
and your girl chillin on vacation going
to Philly and going all these places and
I have a large group of people that just
need to know they can't sleep if you
took all the pictures with your iPad pro
tool point 9 inch we have to know inside
know for the wind I think the new iPhone
is going to be called either the iPhone
Pro or iPhone edition are you have a
good one man homie didn't leave his name
no yeah but that was that was funny
stuff for the record I have yet
straight-up
yet to take a picture with the iPad pro
in public oh wow do you do it at your
house though like around your home I've
used to make movies make videos cool
but you won't go out grownups that was
that was a horrible joke no no I I've
taken pictures with like my nieces and
nephews for fun but not like
yup use it as a damn camera in public we
all know how I feel about that yeah
that's and we all know how I feel about
that big no-no and I like to take
pictures of people who are taking
pictures with their iPad it's it's just
the worst it's the worst that's fine and
they make the cameras better better for
them every time it encourages these
lame-o's all right that's it man that's
it that's all we got okay so yeah I mean
we're pretty much back in effect we've
been on a vacation for a while so we're
getting a we're getting our rhythm back
with us but sometimes you know we'd
rather do a show in the studio together
because it just it's just a better back
and forth vibe
totally then Skype is always a little
distant yeah just no matter what you
can't like I can't peer into your eyes
and read read what you're thinking I
always look at you in this monitor over
here so we don't really make eye contact
a whole lot all right so that's gonna do
it everybody again if you'd like to be a
part of the show call us at</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
