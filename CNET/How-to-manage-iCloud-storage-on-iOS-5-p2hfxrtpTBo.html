to contributor today I'm going to
discuss how to clear up some free space
in your iCloud account with the recent
rollout of iCloud and iOS 5 many users
who sign up for the five gigabyte free
plan for iCloud or finding out that five
gigs just isn't going to cut it and they
don't really want to spend the extra for
more storage so in order to clear up
some free space what we're going to do
is we're going to go into settings will
select I cloud over here go to storage
and backup after this loads will tap on
manage storage and then you're going to
be presented with a list of all the
devices that you are currently backing
up to your iCloud account to view the
data that's being used by that device
you can tap on the device itself and
then you'll see a list of all the data
that is being stored in your iCloud
backup by app if you want to turn an
appt off you don't want to back it up
all you would do is switch the toggle
switch to off and then press Delete if
you didn't want that particular app to
continue to be backed up to your iCloud
account I'm going to hit cancel because
I want to keep wired backed up but I've
chosen already not to have fortune
backup that takes up two hundred forty
four megabytes of space that I don't
really care if it takes up another thing
you can do is when you're viewing all
the devices that are being backed up you
could also view the documents and data
that are being stored on iCloud through
your various iOS devices for example the
iTunes movie trailers app is storing 9.4
kilobits of data what i can do is tap on
the Edit key and I could delete all that
data that it's storming for me
automatically it's not really a whole
lot it's not taking up a big chunk of
space so I'm going to go ahead and leave
it once you're done go ahead and back
out and you've cleared up some free
space now you have to do this on the
device that you want to clear the data
from so for example I wouldn't be able
to go in and view app by appt with my
iphone is storing on iCloud I can only
delete the backup data stored on iCloud
from a secondary device I hope this
helps in limiting how much is backed up
to iCloud and freeing up some space for
you if you're getting near that five gig
