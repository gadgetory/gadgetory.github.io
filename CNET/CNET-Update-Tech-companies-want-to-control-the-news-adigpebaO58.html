which news stories you read I'm Bridget
Carey this is your cnet update social
media isn't just where you catch up with
friends it's where many people are
getting their news first and you're
seeing all the major players facebook
twitter google even linkedin making the
call on which news stories show up in
your feeds the other week Apple revealed
its upcoming news app for iPhones and
iPads and Apple is hiring journalists to
oversee which stories get promoted but
one can't help but question if it'll
limit how much you see about stories
critical of Apple twitter is putting its
own twist on the news with a project
called lightning reports say it will
organize and curate tweets based on live
events such as a sports championship the
Oscars or when a big breaking news story
is developing twitter has always been a
place to go for following breaking news
but in this case the service will be
selecting its own highlights of live
event tweets you would see these
selected tweets in a separate section on
the Twitter app coming out later this
year Google's news lab worked with
storyfull to create the YouTube newswire
it'll be a feed of videos on news events
gathered by the journalists working at
storyfull who also worked to verify the
clips and source material this team is
mining through social media to find what
people are sharing and giving it context
tie to today's news stories it's how
YouTube is going to highlight citizen
journalism but then you have some sites
moving in a negative direction linkedin
a job hunting Network has also crafted a
computer algorithm to pick what you
should read LinkedIn redesigned its news
app pulse and to be completely honest
linkedin roomba app the original pulse
pulled in a feat of all the headlines
for any outlet that you selected I
personally used it to quickly scan
through all the stories from every
technology publication in one screen but
LinkedIn just launched a brand new
version of app that takes away all
control the new pulse tells you what to
read based on your profile picking a
handful of stories relating to your
resume and the people you're connected
to the old pulse app is gone from the
App Store but it will still work for
people for another year before shutting
down such a shame Facebook took a
similar approach last year with its
paper app picking articles it deems as
most important for the day but on the
bright side it seems Facebook may be
giving users more control over the feet
in their main app the network is testing
a new feature called see first a
techcrunch reporter spotted the new
option on their app you can tell
Facebook that you always want to see new
posts from this person or this outlet at
the top of your feed reports show more
people or only getting their news from
social media but if you don't take some
control your knowledge of the world is
narrowed by what Facebook Twitter or
LinkedIn thinks you like based on
calculations of what you clicked on
that's it for this tech news roundup but
there's always more at cnet com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
