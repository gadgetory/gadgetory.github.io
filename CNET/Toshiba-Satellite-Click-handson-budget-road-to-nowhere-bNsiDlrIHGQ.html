world when it comes to Windows 8 laptops
and tablets there are a lot of different
types a lot of different prices and
debatable use in a lot of cases you'd
have to credit Toshiba for trying to
come up with a budget solution here in
the Toshiba Satellite click this sells
for $5.99 and comes with a package it
sounds like a regular laptop four gigs
of RAM 500 gig hard drive and an AMD
processor that's a little different than
the type you'd seen before but wait is
this the perfect solution for you not
really because it's number one it's
heavy this is a four point eight pound
laptop that also converts into a tablet
at the flick of a switch look at that
but this is 2.8 pounds right here it's a
13 inch tablet it is not exactly
pocket-sized feels okay but it only had
about three hours of battery life so
what are you gonna use this for you're
probably gonna dock it right back into
that keyboard and speaking of keyboards
this keyboard doesn't feel as good as it
looks this thing is flat it's cramped it
wasn't fun to type on and there were two
shivah laptops that have been much
better with their keyboards this is not
one of them and the keyboard does have
any ports on the side what what why well
look there's just one USB 3.0 port the
rest are tucked up here in the tablet
and they're all micro HDMI and micro USB
that's not great no Ethernet here so if
you dock this into the keyboard you
can't use this really as a dock there is
a second battery here so you can get up
to 6 hours of battery life but on our
test we didn't quite get that and the
processing power here is not good to put
it lightly the a4 AMD processor in here
was very sluggish you could do better
with a lot of other processors out there
you might even better going with an
Intel Atom processor on a lower end
laptop tablet hybrid if you want to go
there or if you want to tablet get a
tablet go get an iPad go get a surface
go get an Android tablet and maybe just
buy a laptop
by a regular laptop with touch that has
a better keyboard at least that you feel
like you'll enjoy this top-heavy weird
sort of a product feels like it falls
too far in between and is a budget
laptop II thing that you are probably
not gonna want best thing I can say is
it comes with a 500 gigabyte hard drive
which can store lots of stuff so there
you go this is the Toshiba Satellite
click and I don't think it's gonna solve
windows 8 problems or yours for that
matter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
