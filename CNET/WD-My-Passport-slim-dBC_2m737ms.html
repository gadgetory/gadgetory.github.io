my passport slim form deputy but before
we get to it I take a look I have a
bunch of coins here all 11 of them
that's right now EE have made a lot of
dried in my passport family and as far
as I know the slim right here is the 12
so here we go one more that is the fool
doesn't now the reason I use the coin is
not just because there's so many
drive-bys my fingers anymore or because
I work in San Cisco and my office is
surrounded by homeless people that's one
more reason while coins are made up
middle and the new drive here is also
made of full metal casings now that
makes it right not to study and very rug
the pros so very good looking take a
look it's a very nice shiny metallic top
here and on the bottom even though it
looks like plastic it's not it's
aluminum this bio that the drive still
very light just less than 6 ounces now
this is a portable external bus power
hard drive and what does it mean well
over here you can see there is a micro
USB 3.0 port right here you use that
port with this included USB cable and
that's all you need to pack a drive into
a computer nothing else needed how the
Box Drive works immediately with Windows
computer but can also be very easily
reformatted to work with a match once
plug it even see the dryer is preloaded
with a lot of software including the EE
smart web pro now this is one of the
most easy to you and effective backup
solution for home user y design for USB
3.0 the driver also work with HP 2.0 and
in my testing it offer very fast
performance up to 110 megabyte per
second with USB 3.0 and some 40 megabyte
per second with you speed 2.0 there's
one of the fastest not the markets the
dryer beast hi
you know I find the drive here totally
worth is such a surprise that $100 for
one terabyte which is available now or
$150 for two terabyte which comes out
later this year from all the drive here
check out my full review sn.com I'll go
get one I almost want to bet all these
quarter here
you will love it that make no sense so
do what you always do take my word for
it not because I'm don't know and this
has been the first look at the my sport
sleep from WD number with some change</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
