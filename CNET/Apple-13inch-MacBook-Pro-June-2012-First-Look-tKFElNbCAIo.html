wanted to like the 13-inch MacBook Pro I
really did in fact I own the very first
2008 macbook in the unibody aluminum
design and it has been a very successful
very portable and frequently in the past
powerhouse type product unfortunately in
the 2012 iterations it's kind of the
MacBook in the middle we got that 15
inch Retina Display MacBook Pro you got
the cool MacBook Air and then you have
this model that $11.99 it's the same
price as last year for the entry
configuration which gets you a new third
generation Core i5 processor which is
the Intel Ivy Bridge chip set you also
get a 500 gigabyte hard drive 4 gigs of
RAM and you also get USB 3 ports as
opposed to USB 2 what else do you get
that's kind of it
the design is the same the battery life
is still great at 7 hours but the rest
of the feature set is kind of locked in
you have an optical drive you know who
is this for if it's for a pro user well
the problem is that this 13 inch screen
still has a 1280 by 800 display that's
kind of like a 13-6 by 768 if we were a
16 by 9 screen but hey you've got a
Retina Display option now or you've got
higher res displays on other laptops
this is called a pro you're also lacking
discrete graphics now the new intel HD
4000 graphics that are built in are
better than last year's built-in
graphics on the 13-inch pro so that's a
plus but you're not getting anything
more powerful than that and you don't
have any sort of quad core upgrade
option basically anything that would
scream super powered pro is not in this
model now at the $14.99 version you can
bump up to a slightly larger hard drive
more RAM and a dual core core i7
processor but the upgrade options after
that are pretty limited and for the same
price 1199
you can now get a 13-inch MacBook Air
sure that's got a lower capacity SSD
drive sure that doesn't have optical and
short doesn't have as many ports or
Ethernet but it performed in our tests
pretty equivalently close enough that we
call them about the same and maybe you
chalk that up to a faster SSD on the
MacBook Air but the bottom line is the
experience is pretty similar and the
battery
life is better on the 13-inch air this
is a year where it feels like this is a
tweener product if you want something
more powerful
that's a Mac look at the 15-inch MacBook
Pro which has a quad core processor
nvidia graphics a much faster and more
powerful machine or if you have $2,000
to drop take a look at that Retina
Display MacBook Pro if you dare but if
you want something portable and you're
looking 13-inch you probably want to
take a look at that 13-inch air
I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at the
2012 13 inch MacBook Pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
