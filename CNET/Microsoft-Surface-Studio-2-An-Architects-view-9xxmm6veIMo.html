and architect I've had a career in the
arts for the last 20 years most of the
work is large-scale drawings on walls
and I've decided to pull those drawings
off the walls and actually create those
architectural pieces themselves and now
I'm gonna try out the Microsoft Surface
Studio - so this is Sketchup it's a
software that many architects use
lighting designers use it's also an
easier version than AutoCAD or or Revit
which is which are more complex that's
one of the great things about Sketchup
is that it's it's basically easy you can
just play around you can apply like
colors and textures this is nice
actually this feature that I can really
do that but also hold the stylus at the
same time
I had an impulse to turn the whole
screen this way or diagonal so that I
could lean into it a little bit more I'm
a little hesitant to put my hand on it
I'm trying to figure out where to put my
elbow I work on a drafting table so like
for me the drafting table is a lot like
this it's it's either flat or flat low
like a desk or flat raised and sometimes
this is actually quite nice because if
there's someone sitting next to you and
you need to show them a specific detail
or you're making a presentation of your
work then this is actually quite good I
think that it's great for explaining
spaces as if I was designing a museum
this would be like a conceptual idea for
a space or something it could be a
Nature Center or a library or water
treatment be something like that you
know if you're drawing for a large
period of time you know you can get
yourself to sit up and that's something
that that architects and artists have to
be careful of is their postures in their
back like always leaning over so
actually it's quite a good idea to be
like oh I need to sit up this is great
for what you're sketching you're doing
concepts you're doing site planning
programming diagrams I really like the
way that I can zoom in and out in
Sketchup and then I can just select
orbit and I can I can oh that's quite
nice actually I really enjoy how I can
zoom in instantly and and then rotate at
the same time that's that's a great
feature actually this sliding thing is
weird though I wanted to say hey it
isn't it's day I think I have to take it
off otherwise it's gonna like fall on
the floor but if you can but oh you can
also use it on the tee ball so you know
that's fine too
today we tried out illustrator and
Sketchup and I found that the Sketchup
presentation and process of drawing on
it seemed pretty good it was more
instantaneous larger I could see so much
more of what I was doing instead of on a
small laptop or even if I had a dual
screen I really liked the size of the
screen I like that you can move it
I get 45-degree angle or straight up
because then if someone has to come and
collaborate with you at your desk or you
need to show it a quick presentation
it's instantaneous
I do wish that it would go entirely flat
sometimes just because the way that I
draw with my arm and my hand it would
feel a lot more natural I mean I
actually thought this would be more than
what she told me you said like 4k yeah I
thought I would guess that this would be
more than that actually but if it was
less than that I think small offices
would have these more and I also think
universities would have it and that's a
big deal because the architectural
departments and universities really need
the latest software and presentation and
all of these different applications to
you know prepare their students to go
out into a very competitive or world of
architecture
