Bo's would do a Bluetooth sports
headphone and here it is folks the
all-new sound sport Wireless and in your
model that's fairly affordably priced at
a hundred and fifty dollars the old
wired sound sport remains in the line
but now costs a hundred dollars instead
of a hundred and thirty like that model
this new wireless sound sport has an
open design and is very comfortable to
wear by open I mean that you don't Jam
the earbud into your ear
thanks to boses stay here plus ear tips
which come in three sizes the bud sits
loosely in your ear yet remains securely
in place it's worth noting that this is
equipped with a special sport version of
the stay here tips that's different from
the stay here tips that come with Boz's
earlier in ear headphones the only
downside to the open design is that
ambient sound does leak in and this
isn't a great headphone for noisy
environments but if you're out running
or biking you'll be able to hear cars
coming which is why a lot of runners and
bikers prefer their headphones to have
open designs as you might expect the
headphone is sweat and water-resistant
and there's an inline mic and remote
that lets you skip songs adjust the
volume and take and make calls the
headphone comes in two colors at launch
black and aqua and a yellow version will
be available in September
also in September Bose is releasing this
sound sport pulse which costs two
hundred dollars and has an integrated
heart rate monitor that's compatible
with RunKeeper
and demondo and other fitness apps
battery life for the sound sport
Wireless is rated at 6 hours which is
fairly decent for this type of headphone
and 5 hours for the sound sport pulse
both sound sport headphones come with a
simple neoprene carrying case but Bose
will also sell an accessory case that
has a built in battery for on-the-go
charging that will cost $50 the sound
quality is quite good for an in-ear
bluetooth headphone but the real
advantage this has over competing models
from beats j-bird and Plantronics is its
high comfort level it's really hard to
do an in your Bluetooth sports headphone
that sounds good is comfortable and
offers a steady Bluetooth connection
that combination makes the sound sport
Wireless a very compelling choice at its
ice point I'm David Connolly thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
