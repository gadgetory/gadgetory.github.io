CES 2014 and we're taking a look at some
of the some of the watches at the show
that have been the most interesting I'm
Scott Stein I'm Bridget Carey and we
have here Miriam jawar with pebble who
is showing off one of the most
talked-about smartwatches at the show
the pebble steel now there are a lot of
watches at the show there are watches
that we've heard about their watches
with new software updates their watches
that are new startup prototypes now the
pebble steel is a redesign on the pebble
that came out last year but there's also
along with that not just a sexy new look
but there's also an app store that's
finally coming out yeah there's gonna be
available by the end of the month that's
correct so we're gonna take a look at
you've heard about it so we're gonna
just look at it up close and look at
some of its features well thanks for
having me Scott so yeah this is a
suspense-filled it comes in basically
two stainless steel cases one in this
black matte which is finished in a very
durable PVD finish as a high end scratch
resistant finish used in medical medical
and aerospace and then there's a silver
one that comes with normally with a
silver band that's brushed stainless and
both are available with a leather band
in the box as well so i mounted the
leather band on this one to be it a
little more formal and classy looking
well this is a SmartWatch that actually
looks like a watch I mean I mean that
was a big criticism I imagine that's
people you know wanted to definitely
kind of not look too Georgie so you know
as as much as fellow was kind of like a
colorful playful kind of sporty watch we
wanted to really crank it up a notch
like ran up to 11 is really the design
idea behind it and we you know this is a
this is absolutely the level refinement
you'd expect from watches this jewelry
level of fit and finish and materials
it's a CNC machine stainless steel it's
top-notch gorilla glass etc well in the
look of it i mean the screen is actually
the same size physically before but a
feeling that comes in and it also has
this design that feels kind of like a
classic throwback while still looking
futuristic and it you know because of
the glass you know the original the
original pebble was a lil bit curved and
so through off a little bit more glare
sometimes the analog to me when i was
using it felt like more of a regular
watch display
indeed yeah we went for that the
description at about this kind of like
modern yet kind of classic look is
exactly what we're aiming for with this
design and you know it's so it's
essentially the guts from the original
pebble in a smaller thinner but slightly
heavier and more substantial casing but
we've you know we've iterated on
everything the hardware that's in there
is like three generations of us
iterating on the hardware with the same
ePaper display the same one week battery
life the same five atmosphere
waterproofness a same magnetic type
connector it's actually slightly
different connecting the last one it's
right smaller and sticks better we also
have a notification LED that's been out
at the bottom here that can be
programmed by developers once we give
them access to that so that's actually a
new feature technically but essentially
yes it's the same as last year's model
you're itching to play with it oh yeah
gun oh that's a key tell me also about
the app store because I found it
interesting when I was reading about it
that essentially if I want to just check
the football score with the ESPN but I
could just kind of glance at my wrist
instead of pulling out my smoke my smut
my whole smartphone yeah like yeah eps
you know a lot of people are admiring
our heart the hardware we made and we're
very excited about that but for us
actually it's all about the ecosystem
and creating you know creating an open
platform and until now if you wanted to
get apps for pebble you pretty much have
to go hunting around there are some ad
hoc sites that came up and can't
gathered on our content but starting at
the end of the month we'll have our own
app store where we are consolidating all
our content and you know that means it's
a lot easier the discovery in the
searching and the categorizing is going
to be a lot easier for consumers and you
know world salad best by AT&amp;amp;T amazon
were originally we came from the
Kickstarter culture from the hacker in
nerd culture and we're not going to give
that up because we love that because it
gives us all these incredibly cool apps
right the people are wanting to develop
for us it's free to become a developer
anybody can do it but on the other hand
when you buy this off the shelf you know
when your mom your uncle your grandma
wants it they need to find these apps
that are compelling in a central
location and easy way so we're doing
that and and pebble pairs with your
phone and shows notifications and
there's a pebble app on your phone and
that's where the app store resides what
are you
favorite apps so far I've got a bunch
there's one on my iphone is actually I
called a pebble cam which I really
really love if I pull out my iphone it
basically lets you remote control your
iPhone so you know if I if I start up my
phone real quick here and yes and I'm
not dead well the apps are people have
been waiting for two I think you know
there's always promises of interesting
and new new functions yeah hello and so
that's something that people original
pebble on so why should you see this is
a viewfinder on to my camera oh wow so I
can now put this down like this right
get a little portrait of us going let's
see gather round look down a little bit
and we'll see you get really low that's
good a real it's really really close to
my nose I could turn on and off the
flash Island let's see ya I'm obviously
I did it but having a stands interesting
that it talks to the camera can work
yeah this is an example of as you can
see you there's only a bit of us but but
there we are like me ellipse portray see
because we were like this but if I could
prompt up a little bit yes sir I've
managed to get some pretty good pictures
of some people you know here all the PTO
in the same with the same app yeah and
so it's you know you don't need this but
for selfies and group pictures this
comes in real handy when you're also
working with Mercedes in terms of
working on that car app that that it
crackles with contextual awareness as
well as getting diagnostic information
on your cars that's yeah I can actually
show you that right now since i'm not in
my car actually they led me a Mercedes
with which i drove from san francisco to
hear you can actually see where it is
right here you can see things like how
much fuel is left in my car the mileage
on the car the tire pressure and this is
all information gathered when it lasts
connected to the car and then like my
maintenance minder stuff and this is
where my car is that the treasure island
parking lot right now I mean that's a
sort of stuff you hear about connected
things and internet-connected things the
idea of the device is talking that's a
sort of stuff they'll be exciting to see
besides the design the app store we're
gonna look at some other stuff but we
thank you so much for
going thank you yeah so it's the last
thing I want to close with me is that
you know we're one of the big things
about the app store is renounce partners
and you talk to two of them Mercedes
here but there is there is a you know
foursquare Yelp Pandora we have a
Pandora remote which is really awesome
ESPN is another one of our partners I go
pro I control so we're going to
introduce more and more partners as we
go that's that's one of the things you
want to make it anything that's really
compelling can be done really easily on
your wrist as like a micro transaction
we want to do well this is coming out
really really soon so that's a that's a
look at the pebble steel and it's one of
the most talked-about once Thank You
Miriam thank you you should order this
starting now and it'll be shipping on
january 28 great thank you and we that's
not it we also we have whale watchers
one is on my wrist right now and it does
something that not a lot of watches do
and it's actually the hot wash which is
something that we heard about in the in
the summer and is going to be available
very soon starts as low as 1 79 and the
idea the hot watch is not only that it
yeah not only that it has the ability to
run a variety of functions and watch
faces and be able to do fitness tracking
and work with iOS and Android but it
actually has the ability to use as our a
parabolic sound effect to make phone
calls using your hand so right now it's
got a speaker phone in it i'm going to
call cherry Kameda thought watches right
over there and we'll try this out oh
yeah so now I'm actually gonna sorry I
minute hold us up literally like it like
an earphone and try this out like you're
like you're saying I can't hear you it
hasn't like it has a little speaker
right here that throws the sound oh and
i actually have to sit darling yeah I
really are trying we're trying we're
trying to dial just gonna give you go
for us okay sorry about that that's what
you get for live baby live
experimentation well the idea is that
Nick will call once it's paired and be
able to throw that's a feature that you
don't see a lot and when I used it when
you were demonstrating it was actually
it was pretty neat to try out
so now you're gonna go to the phone ok
but they can make that ball now I make
yeah well we will try making their
comment you know it has a touch display
which is something that not all smart
which is that but this time it has a
little it says dialing great gesture
controls that you did from my point of
view after walking around New York like
that I can hear it in my ear right now
you can hear it ringing yes how loud is
it it's pretty good is it loud enough to
battle the crowds at CES hey how are you
doing pretty good I see you right over
there what's your favorite thing to eat
for breakfast what's your favorite thing
to eat for breakfast eggs ok cool well
there we go i get i did hear you talk to
you later breakfast conversation here at
CES yes weird wearable tech in watches

the pebble watch thank you not watch
