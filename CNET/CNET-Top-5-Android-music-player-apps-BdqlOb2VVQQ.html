and about half of all smartphone buyers
lately did exactly that you know it's a
Swiss Army knife of a thing but how are
you with the music player that comes
with it
I'm Brian Cooley with the top 5 Android
music players that'll make you forget
how to even spell iPod courtesy of a
list done by CNET's Josh Goldman number
5 is the Amazon Cloud Player this
freebie is hot new stuff buy store and
play the music from the cloud that's the
internet or you can download the files
if you like so 5 gigabytes of space is
provided to you for free from Amazon 20
gig if you buy just one mp3 album from
them now it's not that well developed as
a player in terms of managing your music
just yet but it's a healthy taste of
where things are going
number four is called mixing this guy
has something akin to the genius
technology you find in iTunes so it's
kind of spooky how it can suggest music
based on just a song or two you feed it
it'll make and tune playlists that keep
getting more and more like you the more
you use it it also has built-in artist
information of direct links out to
YouTube videos of their music videos and
also a graphic EQ and it's free but if
you pay $5 the ads go away
number three is tune wiki now in my view
people are either music people or their
lyric people and this apt is for the
latter it'll show you time to paste
lyrics subtitles while the music's
playing while also getting the album art
up there along with player controls you
can drive it by voice as well through
the Android voice layer and you can use
it to map the locations of other tuned
wiki users nearby so that whole spooky
obsession with lyrics thing that you've
got going on can we got someone other
than just your former friends oh and
it's free number two is called power now
in spite of the title it doesn't just
play death metal it's totally about
quality sound with a
man EQ that sweetens just about every
audio format it plays just about all you
can even set EQ per song which given the
variable quality of most of our mp3s is
a welcome feature bottom line power amp
just sounds great five bucks but there
is a free 15 day trial before I get you
to number one don't think there are just
five great audio players for Android
check out Josh Goldman's full 10 app
slideshow on cnn.com oh by the way if
you have questions about using your
Android phone as your in-car audio
player check out the Android Atlas
podcast that's at 2 o'clock on Thursdays
that's 2 o'clock pacific at
cnet-dot-com-slash-loaded 1 and he knows
how to connect all the dots between cars
and Android ok the number one music
player we love for Android is called
player pro the features what doesn't it
have search download and save lyrics
great tag editing 10 band EQ social
network integration on I love this lots
of really usable home screen widgets and
different lock screen widgets with
customizable control options so your
phone really works and feels like a
true-life I this is the do all player
for Android it costs an odd four dollars
and 51 cents but there is a free 5 day
trial you're gonna love it and want to
pay for great music players for Android
just one more reason the smart phone
will eventually eat the entire tech
industry for more videos like this go to
top-5 cnet.com i'm brian coulis thanks
