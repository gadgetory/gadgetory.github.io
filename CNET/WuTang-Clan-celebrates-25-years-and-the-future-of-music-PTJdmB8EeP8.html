album and looking at it it is the 25th
anniversary which is beautiful and
insane and I was thinking about the ways
your music has grown and changed but
mostly been the same like how do you
feel about all that man it's like it's
very humbling you know I'm saying as I
can't believe it like 25 years it's gone
and a finger snap where'd the time go
but it's truly a blessing you know what
I mean to still have your friends and
the whole new generation recognize your
music and you know your history of what
you've you know contributed to your
gonna make and that's a great thing then
it's a great thing I mean I think we
have grown and evolved but I think at
the same time we have stayed the same
cause humility being humble I mean you
know when you become an artist and you
become mainstream and you grow you're
growing more people know about you I
mean certain things change but then
stay the same as far as who you are you
just reach out to more people but it's
been a beautiful journey man I mean this
was a childhood passion really how do
they how to say I was when you were a
child well it started out for me with
like Mother Goose in nursery rhymes and
a little bit of poetry and then hip-hop
came and you know I was really like
moved by it and you know I was all ready
to be Satan nursery rhymes so hip hop
came in I already had that kind of flow
you know that that Nick that knack for
rhyming and delivering and lyrics in a
certain way although they were nursery
rhymes and home it was just something
that had I had you know interested well
I wonder if you guys have grown as a
group to like and sure it's not the same
and to make it generalize is such a
difficult thing to do
but the flip side like is it kind of the
beat that's leading like the rhyme is
when you guys create the music or it's
like hey I have this great first you
gotta find the music for it like how is
well as an artist you're always writing
so a lot of times I'm writing without
music I don't always have to write
to a beat a to a song I'm always writing
you always thinking you know you travel
you around people so you always get
ideas and thoughts and they did it
they're in your head so you're always
kind of writing in your head although
you're not jotting things down you're
taking mental notes of certain things so
there's usually always a thought and
then the idea before the music but
sometimes you get in the studio or
someone give you a beat and then you'll
match whatever you have to it or you're
trying to flow to it's more of a flow
thing when it comes to the beat and not
the idea to me like I don't listen to a
beat and get an idea listen to a beat
and get a feeling of what flow of what
delivery I want to you know use on this
beam back in like early nineties and I
don't know all the intricacies but you
guys are mostly control of your music
you're publishing and now when we think
about like Spotify and Apple music and
title like it's in a weird way you guys
are way before your time on some of that
but now I'm sure it's paying off right
definitely I mean it's paying off just
to even still be relevant kids and still
be here you know to me that's number one
you know what I'm saying but um yes
brother I mean I mean everything was
definitely a blessing in disguise and
it's like now we've grown to see you
know the tree bear fruit and now it's
time for harvest when you guys are
putting all the music together we
obviously it comes down to like the
beats and the rhymes is there one thing
that you feel the instant music more
than the other is that is that like that
spectral sauce the wu-tang sound
well a lot of times we get the beats
first you know we sit with him for a
little while analyze them on the beats
could come from various producers within
the camp we might get something
mathematics we might get something RZA
or we might even shop around a lot of
times we let the you know the
high-ranked brothers go ahead that got
the best ear to pick those beats some
time and be visitin some time it might
be ray right now we got ghosts picking
all of the beats for the new upcoming
wu-tang album in them and what I heard
so far is cracking the Val yeah straight
like that coming out it's coming though
working on it though we're sitting there
like 25 years after the first album and
there's a big crowd of people if you
want to talk to gets to the show what's
keeping you get done the drive the love
the the passion
you know there's a passion that comes
with this necessarily when we were
especially when we were young there's a
sense it's driven like this passion
that's just nu is this innate thing like
you may see a person that's a guitars on
the on the on a train or on the plane
and he doesn't even have the guitar with
him but he's just like because it's me
he becomes one with the instrument that
way because it's a passion form and in
which there was a passion for a hobby
that we were able to make a career out
of it make money from I always tell
people all the time listening if there's
no listen that there is no me you're
saying somebody has to be listening
somebody has to want it and that's where
the blessing comes you know I mean and
that's very humbling for me you know I
mean so if some I'll camp is ten people
if they want to hear it I'm going to
give it to like what's next to you guys
I mean is it gonna be like you guys
gonna be like the hip-hop Rolling Stones
and me and your seventies and I will
dancing why not you know I mean it's
like I would love that you know to me
but you know right now it's 25th
anniversary is upon us

wheel chain we play an album coming for

things in the works but a lot of things
