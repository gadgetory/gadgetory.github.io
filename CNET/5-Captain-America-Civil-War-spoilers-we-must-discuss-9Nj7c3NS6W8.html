superhero geeks like me and richie r
very excited indeed it's a very
action-packed movie and there's a lot to
discuss so here are the spoilers that we
absolutely have to talk about and as
that title suggests there are going to
be spoilers so you want to stay fresh
look away now what was that about that
was terrible she's I mean she's one of
the most prominent characters in the
Marvel Universe now she has her own TV
show she's been in loads the movies and
they kill her off screen with a text
message that is disgraceful and the only
reason it even happens in this movie is
so that Captain American code to a
funeral and feel sad and make a decision
terrible absolutely shabby way to treat
a junt Carter
do you think they're missed did you miss
them I didn't because I think that you
know there's so many people in it
already and there's a bunch of new faces
and I think they do a very good job of
spinning all those plates and giving
everyone something to do but Hulk and
Thor would probably have a balance it
stark says did you know yeah and Captain
America responds something along the
lines of I didn't know it was him
suggesting that he did know his parents
had been assassinated but not they knew
as the winter soldier was very weak
because it happened in 1991 so he would
have been in the ice and it's like it
was wit I got the impression that he did
know and that was it was that's just a
very strange moment yeah and at that
moment kind of crystallizes like what is
Captain America doing it doesn't really
seem like he's the good guy in this
movie the thing that did make me laugh
though is throughout the whole movie
everyone's like you know what we should
probably take Bucky and for is for
everybody's safety we should probably
like you know let's let's let's let's
keep him somewhere safe and secure so
ever so nobody gets hurt and caps like
never now over my dead body i'm gonna go
rogue for this and then it gets the end
of him and then we get to the end of the
movie and Bucky's like to know what I
think it's probably better for everybody
if I'm just like put somewhere safe and
secure and Cadillacs like oh yeah that's
that make sense yeah yeah I can come
good idea yeah
it feels very much like a young and
naive sort of take on spider-man you
know he's not kind of battle-hardened he
sort of gets knocked around a little bit
by some of the more experienced older
yeah character yeah that's true and it's
great the way he's kind of going oh wow
you've got a metal arm that's awesome
yes yes that's what my was about very
much the voice of the of the ossicles
that's almost a kind of Deadpool esque
fourth wall breaking yeah because he's
the voice of the audience yeah like
that's cool that's cool yeah look at
that and is it is pretty cool as well
the fact that he got his suit from from
Tony Stark that actually does make sense
rather than he just made his own suit
which means that we get the eyes the
girl eyes like in the old car to in the
eyes that yeah it's cool so that's
really cool i like that lot
paul rudd was doing a really good job en
as ant-man and it was just a good
example of I think what those movies do
really well is sort of keeping things
essentially quite light in tone yeah
even when the action and the sort of
themes are getting very very heavy and
and serious yes I thought I was always
just really happy to see a mannequin
that big yeah absolutely yeah I mean
that was that was really fun and that's
kind of what the whole films about isn't
it's about that big fight scene which
it's it's a fight but it's all of them
kind of you know using their fun powers
and just having fun and it's just a big
like fun party it's all about
entertainment they've all got their own
little party tricks no superpowers and
they're playing off each other and
they're quipping and the trading punches
and trading jokes and it's just it's
just really fun you know it i really
like that about the whole about the
whole whole film it's really deftly done
specially compared to Batman vs Superman
which was quite led in if you compare
the two in terms of like how deftly they
kind of interweaved all these characters
and dealt with this heavy stuff that
still kept it you know kept it fun yeah
giant ant man would not know fit in and
not answer only do you think that will
be giant again in the next ant-man film
like is that the kind of is that now
like official past the carrot character
do you think all i know that in the
comics he can also be giant man yeah but
do you think they're just going to sort
of pretend i didn't have internet going
on I don't know is like me how awful is
giant I betcha I mean you basically can
become Godzilla is that too much well
this is this is kind of thing isn't it
that there's all these incredibly
powerful people and you like pitch them
in a fight against each other or near
like well we've got a GOST over the fact
that one of them would probably just
like slam his fist down on the others
but I was a good Empire Strikes Back
reference that was fun that's when like
that lock that was great when spider-man
is showing up John at the legs and check
out man well thank you rich thank you
those are the spoilers we absolutely had
to talk about I feel much better my god
got that off our chests as good in
lighter thanks for watching guys and for
much more on Captain America Civil War
and all things geek culture do stick you
see it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
