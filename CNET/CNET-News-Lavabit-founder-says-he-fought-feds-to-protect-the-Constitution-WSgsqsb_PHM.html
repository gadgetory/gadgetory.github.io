pulled the plug on the service in early
August could you briefly say why you did
that what was the last straw when I
finally lost my fight in court and I had
to turn over the keys I decided long
before that if that ever happened and I
wasn't able to tell people that it was
happening and as a result build the
public support I needed to change the
law then the only ethical choice for me
was to shut down so the decision had
already been made and it was just simply
the act of turning over the keys that
prompted me to take those steps and
finally shut down the service when you
say keys do you mean the master
encryption keys the ssl keys for web
traffic I mean the private keys that
were used for SSL because when I turn
those over I was effectively turning
over control of my network to the
federal government they could see
everything coming in and out of my
network and they could read the plain
text they could see passwords they could
see email content they could intercept
credit card transactions everything that
was at all sensitive and I had
effectively lost the ability to control
my own network and as a network
administrator that just was a completely
untenable position you said you had made
this decision in advance they shut down
the service if this line were crossed
did you tell the federal government that
the agents when you were talking with
them did you say if you push me this far
I'll pull the plug the exact opposite
the only person that I told that I had
made that decision was my lawyer and I
had to tell it to him in person because
my fear was that if the government found
out that I was planning to shut down my
service they would have ordered me to
keep it running and if after that I did
in fact shut down
service it would have been an
open-and-shut obstruction of justice
case you are up against the US
government in this ongoing lawsuit
that's now before an appeals court
you're up against the Department of
Justice which has been called the
world's largest law firm and your
funding this on your own to a large
extent it's not like your Microsoft or
Google our apple with billions of
dollars in the bank how are you holding
up and how are you affording this well
when I first made the decision to fight
I knew I didn't have the resources to
win but I felt that the battle was too
important to give up on it's only with
the support of the public the donations
that they made to the love a bit Legal
Defense Fund that my team actually now
has the resources they need to possibly
win this fight so it's the people who
used my service and saw my story and
contributed they're the ones who are
providing the resources we need to fight
our own government which is a little bit
of irony because they're also the ones
that provided the resources to the
government that they're using to fight
against me you have to remember that
everything our government does is funded
by money that we give them so that means
that the surveillance that they're
conducting on the American people is
funded by the American people's tax
dollars under what circumstances would
you reopen lavabit and launch the
service again would it be if you win the
lawsuit or if the feds withdraw their
demands what would it take effectively
at this point the feds have withdrawn in
the sense that I'm now able to issue new
ssl keys and resurrect services which is
how I was able to put up the download
site the problem is if i were to
resurrect the service itself there's
nothing preventing them from coming
along and demanding the ssl keys a
second time and putting me in the
position of shutting down a second time
so that's why i resolved to keep the
service shut down until the appeal
concludes and if we conclude
victoriously I will reopen service
because that means there'll be a
precedent set that says they're not
allowed to come along and demand these
ssl keys again if I lose what I will
probably do is turn the service over to
somebody who lives abroad in a country
with stricter more protective data
privacy laws and let them run it because
what I've realized since shutting down
is that if I were to move the service
abroad but continue to run it as an
American living in America I could still
be forced to break open the system so
that the government could conduct
surveillance I could effectively be put
in the position where i would have to
choose between breaking us laws or the
laws of the country where the service
was hosted have you thought of any other
countries any on a short list where you
could in theory move this or have a
partner move this my team looked into
Iceland Switzerland and we also looked
into the Bahamas but like i said it
ultimately came down to not a question
of what the laws were like in that
country but what the laws were like in
this country and i just wasn't
comfortable turning over the service to
somebody else as long as I continued to
tie my name to it so if I end up losing
my case what I'll end up doing is
turning the service over lock stock and
barrel and washing my hands of it if I
win my case I'll resurrect the service
here in the US and what's sad is that we
build ourselves as the country of
freedom if there's any place in the
world where people should be able to
communicate freely and in private it
should be the United States so as an
American I find it somewhat
disconcerting that I even have to
consider moving a service like this
abroad with the disclosures that started
with Edward Snowden over the last four
months do you think that your fight your
legal fight is going to be
part of a turning point in the way
Americans view surveillance and will
actually lead to reforms and changes in
the way intelligence agencies operate or
do you see this as a blip and then it's
business as usual afterward what do you
see happening say a year from now I
certainly hope that there's a change I
believe earlier in the summer the
political machine was much more
motivated to make the necessary changes
but as it turns out they were on break
and as we all know when they came back
into session they were preoccupied with
the debt crisis and at least as of late
I haven't heard too many of them bring
back up the issue of mass surveillance
but like I've said in the letter that I
posted on my website when I shutdown I
think we need not only a judicial
present president but a change by of the
laws themselves that make it very clear
exactly what information our government
is allowed to collect and on whom and
what standards need to be met it's
somewhat disconcerting that just by
associating with somebody you can be put
under the microscope it's even more
disconcerting that that microscope can
peer back through years of your own
history and and to have people not even
know that this is going on is even more
disturbing how can I defend myself
against allegations stemming from
something I said five years ago I won't
even remember what I said and who I said
it too and yet all this information is
being stockpiled archived indexed and
searched what is the website for your
legal defense fund we haven't set up a
website specifically for the nonprofit
yet but there's a donation link to it on
lavabit calm and we've also set up a
camp
main on rally org so that we can
continue raising funds right now we're
waiting for the Fourth Circuit Court of
Appeals to hear our case and make a
decision and I think we're good until
then and depending on what happens at
that stage we'll find out if this case
ends up going to the Supreme Court and
if it does we'll have to continue the
drive to raise funds because like you
said we're up against an enemy with
unlimited resources and the full intent
to use all of them at their disposal to
continue conducting this surveillance
and justify it to the courts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
