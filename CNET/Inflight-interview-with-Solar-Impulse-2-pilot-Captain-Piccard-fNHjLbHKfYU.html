here with cnet com and we're going to do
a live we're going to attempt a live in
flight interview with captain of the
Solar Impulse 2 solar-powered airplane
bertrand piccard he's somewhere over the
desert in the Middle East right now and
we're going to try to connect with him
via satellite and I'm going to do an
interview live over Facebook live stream
in YouTube with him with a long delay so
it's going to be a little difficult but
just stand by this is from solar impulse
calm there's their website this is a
live stream they're putting out right
now he's on the last leg of his trip
around the world on a solar-powered
airplane so stay tuned we're gonna get
this going here so hang in there we'll
we'll be right back with you guys
shortly mr. Picard my name is Steven
Beecham in San Francisco with cnet com
thank you so much for taking the time to
talk to us how are you doing yes an old
Steven yes I hear you well now well
things are going smoothly this morning
with the sunrise over the desert of
stamped of Saudi Arabia that the night
was really bumpy it was turbulent you
know the heats there are a lot of servos
of they remade during the night so it
was that the smoothest night I could
have I really have to fight on my flight
controls the area yesterday has been
gorgeous with a desert of egypt the
crossing of the Red Sea arrival of the
mountains of Saudi it's a beautiful
flight i have to say we're able to get
any rest last night last night or no
Lester this morning a little bit just
before sunrise I had the the first night
of the your day of the horizon and the
mirror I could make a few naps but you
know at the end up that's here to sleep
and i'm here to fly the plane i'm here
to bring it to Abu Dhabi so if I can't
sleep of course I I'm in a better shape
that it's easier that's the goal now is
really to finish successfully the last
leg of the round-the-world solo flight
so set the scene for us everyone that's
watching at home where are you right now
and what is your elevation and what is
your airspeed just so we get a sense of
what's going on yes so I am in the
middle of Saudi Arabia over a place
which is just a desert of Sam it's
completely flat they are doing of orange
it's I'm flying a 8003 it slow because
you don't during the night I fly lower
in order to save energy and when the Sun
comes I starts to do climb again and I'm
flying at the speed of 29 dots which is
maybe slow for an airplane but you know
the sailplane is very strange I mean the
first of a kind it's like slowly has a
huge wingspan it is sensitive to
turbulence but the way it is built
allows it to fly day and night without
fuel so I spent the night of the
batteries that were charged yesterday
during the day flight and the now I'm
starting to charge the batteries again
for the next day for the next night so
it's a they could you era in aviation
because of course it's the beginning
it's difficult it's challenging there is
go hedgehog nobody explained us how to
do it we we had to invent something
completely new so you guys have already
set the bench for longest flight it was
five days in the solar and solar-powered
plane correct yes exactly that was the
flight of all the way from Nagoya due to
Hawaii and what is great is to see that
this airplane in several days of all
right now we have when I could be at nap
take it was three days of 39 we had
several slides of two days and two
nights with all the way so you see you
can fly much longer because it has no
fuel because we found
another way to do but before all the
airplanes would be sonar of course there
will be a lot of diamond I think the
first step fluoridation will be to
become electric because electric motors
have much better efficiency of course
batteries are heavier than fuel but i
bet that in 10 years time you will have
electric airplane flying with 50 people
on board for sure to give your whole
slide and this will happen in the next
10 years so maybe that fully solar but
fully electric clogged up degraded of
the airport before taking us which has a
lot of advantages of thousands of
evolution yeah I feel like there's a
renaissance and solar powered planes
right now I mean Facebook Mark
Zuckerberg just launched their playing
the Aquila plane last are in June but
they just released a video of it last
week did you did you get a chance to
check that out and what are your you
know one of your remarks regarding that
yes of course I saw it that I have to
say that the solar drawn or Facebook is
beautiful it is such a fantastic shape
and their plane that this beautiful
always slides well you know melaku well
it reminds me you know 17 years ago it
was just off to my booth flies around
the world when I started to speak of an
airplane flying around the world without
fuel everybody thought I was completely
crazy and now things start to happen
which is good that's the role of
pioneering to open the way and they give
two ways to people to try this is what
is missing in our world today people are
stuck with all devices all the sources
of energy and they think they will be
able to live forever with it but it's
wrong it's completely wrong the world is
going in the wrong direction we are
destroying the planet were polluting the
environment were depleting the natural
resources were poisoning the lungs of
the children who are breathing the air
that we have an absolutely we must do
differently I know I know how you feel
like when I when I put gasoline in my
car I feel like this is archaic like why
am I still putting fossil
my car but you know that's that's the
way life is right now but um you you've
been working on this project since 1999
correct how does it feel to be you're
just hours away from finishing your trip
around the world how does it feel to be
almost done with with this major
accomplishment nopee others if I think
about it they become too much emotional
so when I took off yesterday morning in
Egypt I I i was thinking I'm doing this
right as a pilot not as the shader of
the project I'm doing it as a pilot to
bring the plane to Abu Dhabi to I well
to you enjoy the flight also to give
interviews to speak about the
technologies but I try not still
remember that it's the last slide
otherwise i will have tears in my eyes
and my voice will break that's wait for
up with a bit we celebrate and you know
he is still the day and the night to go
a challenging it's that's because it's
the last flight that with easy I remains
very difficult specially over deserts
where you have fur balls where you have
proven answers I can even below I have
to focus on the task yeah so during this
whole journey which has been you know
the last year more than a year of your
life just going around the world not not
even counting building the plane but
what was the most memorable experience
for you so far on this trip I think they
were two things that were fantastic what
was crossing the Atlantic in the the
solar-powered airplane because I bet
Charles bitburg when I was a child I
talk to happen that's flying over the
Atlantic for the first time with a
solar-powered airplane that was great
because Charles did Bergen go to Paris
to open the way to commercial air
transport them my goal was to use the
symbol of the Atlantic to open the way
too much more implementation of kin
technologies so that was really a
highlight for me and another highlight
of course was where I could speak live
in to ban ki-moon the secretary-general
of the United Nations from the cockpit
of solo
cause when I was about the the Pacific
speaking to the detonation and really
demonstrate that all these new
technologies they are material they can
be used everywhere not just for airplane
that they can be used to replace all the
old systems that are polluting and if
you replace all that you you make profit
to create jobs you'd approve the
industry so you see on what i tol ban
ki-moon is that now there is no need to
be only ecological you can just be
logical using the clean technologies if
this will protect the environment also
what is next for the Solar Impulse team
what are you guys what is next after you
guys accomplished your goal what are you
guys planning next we have a user
experience in our technical team for
solar power plants with high payload and
you know there is a huge development
that direction to replace satellite for
observation for internet and so on and
that we are working of that and all day
boksburg my partner who is leading the
technical team is very keen to develop
that part i would like to also develop
electric airplanes bo transpose or four
passengers because i think it's really
worth it and they're what we will do of
course now is to develop the
International Committee for clean
technologies like a World Council of
technologies that I announce when I was
flying above the Atlantic and this is a
way to give a cupboard voice more power
to the Association institution
organization and they are working in
technologies and renewable energy
because a they are not organized
together as a community and we need is
to be able to advise the gallant dance
and to bring back from the energy policy
so this is really what we call now
beyond the solar impulse Solar Impulse
allows us to do that and now we're going
to do it that's fantastic I'm really
happy to hear everything is going so
well thank you so much for your time
bertrand piccard does pilot of the Solar
Impulse he's above he's over Saudi
Arabia
now flying live this is all happening
live is it okay if I call you Captain
Picard cuz I think that's a thing right
yes but you know that God could because
it's all Trek was named after the twin
brother of my grandfather no way ok the
first stratospheric fly yeah he made the
first photospheric like the balloon in
the US and the creator of Star Trek to
keep as an inspiration for Captain
Picard or it's really funny that's
fantastic well thank you so much for
your time and good luck I'm I'm very
excited for you guys it's gonna be
really cool to see you guys land yes
thank you very much for your support
advisor all right have a go on all right
guys that was Captain Picard in the
solar in place too and he's taken off
he's flying off into the desert check
out all of our coverage at cnet com
there we produce a lot of videos about
the Solar Impulse in the Facebook
playing the Aquila so check out all of
our coverage at cnet com and we'll check
you out next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
