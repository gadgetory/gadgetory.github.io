sitting here before me is the neato
xv-21 robot vacuum now this is a four
hundred and twenty nine dollar robot
vacuum and that's expensive but not
quite as expensive as the Roomba 880 and
the LG home bot which cost a lot more
now this isn't the first nita that we've
tested last year I tried out the neato
XV signature pro and then earlier this
year Megan Walton tested out the neato
XV essential now they all look the same
except for different paint jobs and they
all operate the same - they all do well
this is the neato xv-21 and it's Anita
that's supposed to specialize in
cleaning up pet hair now design wise
there's something familiar about the
look of this vacuum something that I
like something that I can't quite put my
finger on now I'm sure it's nothing all
the neat O's are very methodical
cleaners they use laser guidance to help
map out the room and then navigate
through it in rows and columns this
one's no different it does a great job
figuring out where it's going but I
think it's not quite as intelligent as
the Neos signature Pro which I liked
quite a bit let's take a look at this
video of the rice test we did on a
medium pile carpet now we quickly
determine that there is a bit of a
problem with one of our walls there is a
wide expanse behind it and the nito's
were getting a little confused and
bumping into it while they're doing
their column runs you see this happen in
the XV 21s run and it kind of throws it
off it's doing really well and then it
just loses it it gets a little bit crazy
and can't quite figure out where to go
compare that with the neato signature
pro it has the same problem it seems too
far beyond that wall and can't detect
that there's a wall there and that's not
the nito's fault but after that happens
it kind of shakes it off says give me a
second and then figures out what to do
it finishes the run like normal and is
fine
so the Neos signature Pro seems to be a
slightly more intelligent Neto compared
to the Marquis cleaners you'll see from
Roomba and LG that cost hundreds of
dollars more I think the nito's are all
good values the Neos are not quite as
feature-rich they don't have remote
controls you can't steer them around but
there's still excellent cleaners and to
me that's what really counts however at
the bottom of the pricing tier around
200 to 250 dollars we're starting to see
bargain robot vacuums that are
performing well enough to
justify purchase as a value cleaner the
in the nouveau hobo 510 that I just
reviewed did well enough that I think
it's worthy of consideration alongside
the need oh it only cost about $200 so
if you're shopping for a robot vacuum
and want a value there might be a
cheaper option out there than need oh
that would be good enough for your
purposes overall the xv-21 is a fine
robot vacuum however it's not quite as
smart as the signature Pro that we
tested last year that black and gray
model if I'm buying a robot vacuum ito
is gonna be at the top of my list but if
I'm buying a neato I don't think I'd go
with the xv-21 simply because the XV
signature pro for only $20 more is such
a better value for seeing it I'm right
