today I'm going to show you some cool
tricks for adding lighting to your home
stereo lighting that's going to respond
to your music there's two options i have
here to show off one is an e el wire
sound kit this one's going to be about
50 bucks it uses electroluminescent wire
which you can get to any length you just
plug the wire into one side you plug it
into the wall and the microphone on the
top is going to listen in to any audio
that's in the room so you have to have a
close to your stereo to make this work
but it does a pretty cool job now there
is a limitation on this device which is
the fact that it only really does one
thing which is blinking the light on and
off in time to the music and if you want
a different color you're gonna have to
get a different colored wire another
thing to know about this option is that
it makes a high pitched squeal if you
have really sensitive ears you're going
to hear that so if you turn the music up
all the way it's going to drown it out
but if you're going to keep the music
quiet you're probably going to notice it
now for more advanced option we have the
apollo jammer by elemental led this
guy's 99 bucks it comes with one strip
of color changing RGB LED lights the
cool thing about this option is that
it's silent plugs directly into the
sound source and then routes that audio
into your stereo and it comes with 10
different modes so you can have a mode
that responds to base and load the
response to treble you have a mode that
keeps the lights on all the time it just
switches up the colors now one of the
best parts of this particular system is
that it works with all kinds of color
changing RGB products so you're not just
stuck with the strip that comes in the
box you can get a longer strip you can
get a different product like this color
changing RGB LED puck that you could
mount on the wall behind your stereo or
if you really want to go crazy they even
include a DMX connection on the side
here which means you can plug it into
any kind of professional lighting
equipment like this four hundred dollar
RGB LED wall washer now this is going to
really fill up the whole room with light
completing that virtual club atmosphere
you're going for so there you go those
are two cool options for adding lighting
effects to your home stereo not gonna
make you dance any better but with
enough distracting lights no one's going
to know
