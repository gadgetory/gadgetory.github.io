from my list nope li plus because
include this router right here is called
a lie plus this extender right here now
they look similar but they actually very
very different if you live in a small
home this router here is probably nap
which cost hundred eighty dollars but if
you live in a larger home you might want
to get the li plus set includes both of
them for $300 now doesn't matter which
one you choose the setup process involve
all in this router and when you've done
with this one you are done if you have
the extender to you just have to place
it some 40 feet away plug it to power
and that's it is pre-programmed to work
with the router is accompanies and will
automatically replicate the Wi-Fi
setting of the router so in short the
set process is really short shorter than
that of the google Wi-Fi or the arrow or
the luma yeah that's short and by the
way yes this is the very first Wi-Fi
system I've seen that come with both the
mobile apps and the web interface now
the mobile apps like that of other Wi-Fi
system is fun and easy to you you can
use it from anywhere to check on your
home network filter content pass
internet and even turn on the protection
for the entire network so yeah it's
great for home user on the other hand
the web interface allows you to
customize the home network more deeply
with features such as positive control
then I make DNS and even network storage
sharing basically in my testing you can
cover some 4000 square feet of
residential setting with the sustain
local Wi-Fi speed faster than 100
megabit per second now that is faster
than most other Wi-Fi system I've
attested and most importantly faster
than any typical residential broadband
connection
now the li+ is not perfect though for
one it does not have a third dedicated
band for backhaul the job of connecting
these two unit together wirelessly and
that means devices connected to the
extender will have the net speed just
half of that compared to those connected
directly to the router that's called
signal loss which happen when a ban on
extender had to do both the receiving
and we broadcasting the signal at the
same time
so you know this is an excellent Wi-Fi
system it's not perfect but hey neither
am i which why I did what I always do to
rectify that I got two of them and now
I'm perfect and that's because I'm Domo
and these are the Li plus Wi-Fi systems
