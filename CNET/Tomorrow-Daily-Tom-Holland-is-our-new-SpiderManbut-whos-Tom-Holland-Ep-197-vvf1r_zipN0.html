awake and it's talking to us on earth
also we check out a little tiny
emotional robot that is bringing in the
dawn of the age of robots uh uh oh my
god we finally have someone cast as
spider-man little old spider-man will
tell you who it is
Samar Daley
grading systems of the internet welcome
to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk-show in the known universe I'm
Ashley sceva biggest door from the
universe is described by Cael
I guess I don't get to be spider-man
coolest guy I'm learning today that's
you you know what though you were on the
short list that's always great you're on
the short list I learned how to post
pretty sure Logan taught me how to flip
all right so can we let's let's talk
about let's talk about spider-man
let's hit it it's Tom Holland there you
go why don't they just get right out I
don't even leave it up do we have a
picture or footage of Tom Holland
because some great Thomas although
because I'm sure you don't know him by
name not like there was a sub utter
field who was rumored but here's Tom
Holland look at him spider-man there's
obviously going for a younger spider-man
which is great they're probably gonna
keep him young for like the whole series
okay we're gonna see Tom Holland first
in civil war which is a Marty he's
jumping over to the Marvel Cinematic
Universe for a cameo so exciting and
then we're also gonna see him in his own
spider-man movie in 2017 in July and
summer 27 years on that okay so there
you go apparently you know Kevin Feige
said that Tom Thomas screen test was
special so like it was pretty fantastic
maybe Danny learned some flips from
Logan - yeah we all learned flips from
Logan that's his signature he's he's
he's pretty young but it's gonna be like
two years till the movie comes out yeah
so right now how old would you say he
looks I would Scott I mean I you know
it's cuz I'm an old lady but I would say
he looks like fifteen he looks like
fifteen he's actually 19 years old I
cannot believe this so by 2017 when his
own movie comes out he's going to be 21
yeah well I should mention really
briefly that this footage is from an
interview about the impossible which was
a disaster movie it was about a tsunami
tsunami movie with Owen McGregor and
Naomi Watts so I grabbed this because he
like he was talking about acting with
obi-wan Kenobi and stuff and like so
it's kind of cool that he kind of he
respects all of these like kind of older
actors and stuff so I'm really curious
to see it like a lot of people pegged
him as a really good dramatic actor
really young so maybe he'll bring
something new yeah I guess we'll see
obviously he's gonna be playing Peter
Parker so we're gonna get our classic
spider-man story I think a lot of people
were worried about that then the Sony
leaked had more information about like
that they didn't want him to be gay much
not to be black like but now it's it's
totally okay and the great thing is as
Marvel's kind of sidestepping that now
by because in the thing it says like
Peter Parker has to be white and can't
be but if Marvel indicates in the comic
books that he is anything other than
that then he can be and now they're
saying isn't it Miles Morales is
spider-man like he's they just announced
it a couple days ago like Miles Morales
is spider-man you mean he's not like a
separate offshoot spider-man it's like
he is spider-man oh yeah so it's like
that that was like an official
announcement so now they're saying like
then maybe they'll go forward with that
Peter Parker really only exists to me
currently now in the Cinematic Universe
so this is cool
I think it'd be great to have a younger
looking spider-man instead of them I'm
excited supermodel Andrew Garfield in
college for a triangular-shaped Chris
Evans in like because they're all like
in their 30s and it's like it'll be nice
to have that sort of fresh young blood
into that mix and I think it's been 21 I
thought I still wanted a subletter field
because it's name is funny okay what's
your story I want to kill anonymous well
we've talked about the hashtag of the
day first which is TD Spidey oh and we
want you guys to tell us like is this
good casting decision how did you see
this kid in that movie and the
impossible did you do I have known I had
no idea who he was
do I do you think it's a good casting
decision from what I've read I think
might not be bad he seems to make a
dramatic actor maybe you could pull off
some of the more like heavier aspects of
being a kid who has these amazing powers
and has to deal with that like a story
we all like yeah yeah and so maybe he
can bring a little a little gravitas
here's what I might do um I get to work
on making a son and then I think my son
should be cast as spider-man and I think
it like we're gonna go a little bit more
obviously we got like a
little bit of a darker hue totally so
that may work out phase 5 MC phase 5
I'm gonna Spider anonymous I buy this
I'm gonna play Kraven Hunter I still
maintain I should play Kraven the hunter
so there you go you can play spider-gwen
I would cast you for what it's worth I
would cast you as pretty much dirt oh
thanks I would do it if I was the Kevin
faggy of this earth I would cast her but
you know what there's only one man who
can play great matter and that's kill
anonymous okay cool get kill anonymous
on the phone I'd let you be venom sweet
I would do that
I totally do that I'm cold alright let's
talk about the age of the dawn of the
age of robots because really this is
like kind of a big deal about a year ago
Softbank announced this little robot
named pepper and we have some video
footage of peppers pepper peppers super
adorable inspired by Astro Boy the look
of Astro Boy which is kind of Awesome
but Softbank finally sold these they
went on sale to the public in Japan a
couple days ago and they saw a thousand
of them as the first month run of a
thousand sold out in less than a minute
and these are not cheap robot to you
guys these are like sixteen hundred
dollar robots whoa yeah a hundred and
ninety eight thousand yen so what can
this little guy do so interestingly
enough it's not going to make you dinner
it's not gonna clean your house it's not
it's not meant to be a task robot where
it does a thing for you it's actually
meant to be more of an emotional robot
and I thought this was really
interesting that it looks like we the
public are going to accept emotional
robots first before and and potentially
this is sort of the first time we've
kind of like all embraced a robot that
is meant to serve just be your companion
and so there's a there's an aging
population in Japan there are also a lot
of singles in Japan who choose not to be
with anybody in a long-term relationship
so this is a great option for a lot of
those people who are like well I like
companionship but I don't want to be
bogged down by a long-term relationship
or maybe I'm I'm a little older I don't
really have anybody so I'm gonna buy
this robot and like have it hang out
with me so here's what here's what
pepper can do it could communicate with
you okay
follow verbal commands you can ask it
questions things like that
and it can also read human emotions and
respond accordingly
so it can they Softbank says it can tell
when you're sad it can tell when you're
happy and the little tablet on the front
of it it conveys the robots emotions as
well so if you ignore pepper it will be
very irritated with you and if you pay
it a lot of attention I'll be very happy
so it's available friend or a boyfriend
it develops over time it develops kind
of a little personality over time which
is pretty interesting but I so sold out
in under a minute they're gonna do the
goal is to release these pepper robots a
thousand of them every month for sale
because that's as much manufacturing as
they can keep up with okay so would you
buy one I totally want one good no I
have a Facebook account I already
experienced too many people's emotions
I need a servant robot Rosie that's what
robots are for it's a do thing but don't
you want like a sassy friend robot like
cuz that's the thing I've always wanted
like a cool like Rosie robot did your
laundry and made you dinner and stuff it
was also kind of like she had a little
bit of attitude that was the thing I
love the most about Rosie row but she
had a personality she was cool but you
were talking about both you're already a
servant and I don't need attitude
I also have a cat I got enough attitude
there that's true I like I mean get a
dog right like I guess you can't in
Japan I just think it's a little harder
it's very interesting what you said
about how emotion robots seem to be the
first thing that is gonna pick up and
and and to me that's that's shocking
because like I said you feel like a
robot it's like a servant thing it's
with assembling your cars or you know
waiting on you or and a lot of the
robots that we've talked about have been
never not all but have had an action
they're serving a purpose they're a
rescue bot or they're serving robot know
that's a good point so it might be the
culture like specifically Japanese
culture it might be more willing to
accept an emotional robot like a friend
as a robot as opposed to like only
wanting it for service I think I want a
little both like I want a robot and help
me do some stuff but I also want a robot
with you know just like kind of like a
I see robo robo friend producer Logan do
you need a robot friend did you just
call your girlfriend robot rude no but
she rude but but at least there's at
least again with in with the emotional
robot like there's no real end game and
there's no like future but with the
girlfriend there's a future that you're
you're making you're connecting with a
person you're learning like there's so
much out of an actual human relationship
but - so what I'm saying is a robot this
is this this is filling a void this
robot is filling a void and it's a very
strange void to be filled by a robot or
it's just a really fun like I it's it's
a it's an oddity it's a it's like oh I
bought this to be weird it's like a
little spectacle in my house look I have
a little robot yeah they make like the
rowboat it's an icebreaker it's a
conversation what does it say 1616
Harbor it's not that bad
it's a little pricey in its price so
you're dropping sixteen hundred dollars
on a little robot that is not gonna do
anything for you except talk to you me
how much is this though off-contract
like it's a like eight eight twenty nine
so that's I'm saying is like a cool
little like friend over you know this
god-awful tether yeah sorry
no I get it coming out Emilie's black
mode today you're right you're right
well you're in bat you're in like
fightin crime Batman mode today which
we'll get to but before that we don't
talk about feel a really quickly so we
have discussed on multiple occasions the
feel a lander that went off they
remember they slingshotting and then the
Rosetta spacecraft and then they put the
little Lander down in the comment and
then it died the battery died because it
landed kind of in the shade on two of
its legs and it couldn't get Sun guess
what it's a wake whoo it's so exciting
that it is now communicating with the
ESA it's out there it it so apparently
has now it's still in a spot where it
can get sunlight about three hours a day
which is enough for it to charge up
which is pretty cool and now they're
saying okay so it's awake what's next
let's try to restore enough energy and
communication capability to get the
lander to drill into the comet which was
its original intention and collect data
about what comet 67p is made of because
this is the stuff this is the beginning
of the universe stuff this is you know
they want to know what's in that comment
so they're going to start with non
mechanical tools so they're gonna do a
couple of
maybe some like surface scrapes things
like that that don't take up a lot of
battery power and then try to scale it
up to the big things like the hammer and
the drill and if they can do that
they're gonna be really really excited
yeah accomplish their missions it's a
very short window they only have until
August so this comet is hurtling towards
the close to the Sun right now and so
it's getting a lot of Sun and that's
fine but then in August it passes the
Sun and hurdles back out into deep space
so at that point you're gonna have
diminishing returns on sunlight it's I
mean basically it's like they've got a
very small window time in in the sense
of you know they might have months but
they've got a very small window time to
sort of collect all this data I get
everything done so good luck
ESA good luck feel a I'm glad feelings
alive I was so excited when I saw the
tweet cuz he has his own Twitter guy
he's like I'm alive I'm here I'm still
on the comment I was just like oh I feel
a he's alive yay so it's a huge fan art
out there too there is some really good
humor but that's it for our headlines
we'll be right back it's Tuesday which
means we got to talk about new releases
kale is gonna lose his mind at the first
one because he's already playing it and
and then of course we have your user
feedback and our photogra for the day so
don't click away it's tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show we've returned
it's Tuesday it's time to tell you all
the things they're gonna empty our
wallet and yours it's new releases
now if you're not friends with kale
anonymous you probably don't know how
much he abhors the hype train for
anything
hey I mean this man will not get on a
hype train if somebody put a gun to his
head like no he won't do it so you can
imagine kales feelings when Batman
Arkham Knight reviews started rolling
out and they were like this game is
amazing to nine point five nine ten like
people are going nuts for this game kill
got it last night can I have your non
hype train review it's like one of the
best games I've ever played get kills on
his own hype train now it's so good the
whole tagline that they have is be the
Batman and I've never felt so like you
know like the Batman like it's it's
crazy how you feel like you're actually
doing all this stuff and you feel so
cool and it's fluid and it's fun and
there hasn't been a time when I'm like
that could stop right here and it's like
do something else it's so cool the voice
acting like this is Rocksteady again and
they're just they knocked it completely
out of the park
I can't wait to go home and play it like
I'm gonna go stream it on my own
personal YouTube account it's just it's
so much fun and I don't producer Logan
was deciding whether or not he wants to
like even get this firstly he's not
going to because he's gonna spend money
on a concert but still I think you
should skip the concert even though it's
like a favorite band ever I know I
listen your enthusiasm alone is selling
me on this game like if I have never
seen a lick of game play I would be like
based on kales reaction to this I have
to buy this game so I'm gonna pick it up
tonight I knew it was something special
when in the first shot it starts playing
this old like I've got you under my skin
like and then it's like slowly zooming
into the Joker who's like dead from the
last one and he's just like smiling and
he's on this thing and you're just
sitting there you're like why isn't it
moving forward what's going on and then
you hit a button and it goes and you're
like what and then you hold the button
down he was and you're burning the Joker
like you know in an incinerator but you
didn't realize that it's that much
interactivity
so you know that the second you have to
burn the joke at the beginning that's
gonna be a really cool game that's
pretty rad very interesting and fun so
rad
I love it I love it I I can't give it a
rating but I the lovin anytime you got
to play it you got to play but 11 out of
10 so far I put in about 5 hours I'm
pretty getting it pretty excited alright
well and if you can always go to Cal
what's your stream name so people can go
watch I used YouTube streaming so go to
my go to my youtube channel kale
anonymous kha anonymous super easy yeah

also coming out today is final fantasy
xiv heavensward they it this is the new
expansion people are really excited
about this I play Final Fantasy 14 I
haven't been playing lately because
we've been in splatoon but new jobs some
really good astral ocean there's some
really great new jobs some new rates new
new dungeons all sorts of new stuff I
mean all the stuff you expect from an
MMO expansion and of course you know
it's like all it's all final fantasy
based and and they finally at once again
learn their lesson after the original
launch of Final Fantasy 14 which flopped
terribly they learned the lesson of
people want to see Final Fantasy stuff
that they remember from other Final
Fantasy games they don't necessarily
want like new like crazy I mean there's
a lot of new stuff in here too but it's
like I want to be reminded of all the
cool Final Fantasy games I've played
before and they are kind of finally like
kind of locked into that and it's it's
pretty rad so I'm like I met Syd
as I was leveling up to 50 yeah but
which one well so this is like a kind of
Sid created for this particular world
but you got your airship captain he's
still an airship captain he's still
crazy still like an engineer he's
awesome but yeah it looks amazing I
think I'm gonna pick this up I'm still
waiting like I I'm kind of on the fence
about it cuz I'm like well how much am I
really playing like do I need the
expansion but then we're about to hit 50
so I'm like well I mean I guess I might
as well buy the expansion keep going so
anyway that's coming out and then also
coming up this weekend
counter-programming to all the inside
out and Jurassic world Ted 2 is coming
out this weekend which I'm gonna say
this about Ted 2 like the premise I
think it's funny
it reminds me of Legally Blonde 2
like it's like the raunchy version of
that movie if you've seen both I don't
know anyway
Ted needs to become an act she should be
like declared a person to be able to
have kids with his wife I don't know
he's a teddy bears a lot he does
horrible things you can't you can't just
hate you can't hate on movie like this
it has its place it's summer we need
just our throw like fun summer movie
that you go to and you're bored and you
go and you have like laughs in the in
the trailer I'm not expecting comedy
gold I'm expecting to be like hahaha
funny yeah I'm expecting like walk out
of it and be like okay I was entertained
like I was entertained enough to like
pay for hahaha a fart joke didn't see
that one coming out but I like it
whatever I might see it I might ghost
not seeing theaters but yeah I might see
it I might not it's been beautifully
theater like years here so like for me
to throw that one in there it sucks I
mean it's a real tough you got to really
be choosy about what movies you're
seeing this summer cuz there's so many
good ones what's like a Batman I'm not
gonna that's true yeah he's busy he's
busy being the Batman but that's it for
new releases for this week so with
without further ado let's talk about you
it's user feedback
alright so yesterday we asked everybody
to use the hashtag TDC and tell us what
they would want to be transparent if
they can make anything transparency
through in real life and Lewis wrote in
and said that tall guy that always sits
in front of you in the cinema yeah
agreed 100% anywhere music concerts look
if you can make everybody see if you're
at a concert that we awesome from the
back that'd be scary that'd be pretty
rad you'd be like the only person there
you feel like we you hear all the people
well and then you'd see all the dirt on
the ground that would be either be kinda
gross trash um maybe just make a hurry
headless that would also be really
creepy
Kirk wrote in and said the see-through
hood being demoed on a concept land
rover and then he had a YouTube video of
it so here it is this is this
transparent hood whoa yeah it's like a
virtual prototype that Land Rover is
taking a look at right now but it would
let you see right through your hood to
the to the ground which is pretty
awesome Wow yeah well I don't so much
good augmented and virtual reality stuff
happen
right now like Kelvin kills been towing
this line for a year just like guys it's
gonna blow up and now it's blowing up so
Kayla's kills been right this whole big
deal listen to me your kids come on
but yeah you guys said this is good user
feedback and then of course there's a
very our very final piece of user
feedback which is always our phone
talker for the day Dan Roden good old
Dan I'd like to I like to pretend that
we're literally longtime friends with
every person who writes into this show
Dan writes in and says hey TD I took
this a couple weeks ago are my trusty
Galaxy s4 at what's basically the end of
my road in Brighton England I work from
home with only my cats four colleagues
and was going a bit stir-crazy so I went
for a walk to clear my head this is what
I found Brighton Pier with a funfair at
the end it reminded me how awesome it is
to live by the seaside and cheered me
right up then I went for ice cream by
the sea that helped more may the force
be with you always
dan dan from Brighton thank you this is
delightful photo I hope that you also
after or after or before your ice cream
by the sea you went to the fun fair and
either maybe rode some rides or did some
fun stuff played some carnival games
they're really laying it on thick with
the funfair it's a fight yeah I'm like
looking at the end of this pier and I'm
a little skeptical about how fun that
fair looks but you might have been
really far away maybe there's some
really great stuff there like what would
you want to see it the funfair funnel
cake that's what I would go right for
funnel cake fun okay I don't want ice
cream I don't want funnel cake okay get
a funnel cake at a carnival it's so
delicious yeah okay yeah I'm scared of
funnel cake as much as Ferris wheels
kill anonymous terrified of Ferris
wheels out which one more which one more
probably Ferris wheel since I've had
nightmares all right good yeah oh there
you go okay cool thanks for showing us
your terrifying fun fair yeah no but
it's good was a really great photo like
the seagull like the seagull looks fake
