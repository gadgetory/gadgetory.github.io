me is the new 13-inch macbook pro with
retina display from Apple a year ago the
Retina Display MacBook Pro is hit in
both 15 and 13 inch varieties and they
were expensive especially of 13 for what
it packed it was 1699 as a lot to pay
compared to the macbook air but a year
later the macbook pro with retina is
back and it costs 12 99 I'd say only but
there are a lot of affordable laptops
out there that caused eight hundred
dollars or so in the Apple landscape
that is actually pretty affordable in
the sense that it's only a two hundred
dollar upgrade over the macbook air
which starts at 1099 in that 13-inch
model so now you got a choice maybe you
make the retina MacBook Pro your retina
air of sorts there is no retina equip
macbook air but the 13 inch pro is kind
of a substitute for that it's three
point four pounds so it doesn't feel as
light as the slight lender three pound
air but it does feel very compact but
point seven inches thick and so it will
slide very easily into a bag and it
actually has a smaller footprint than
the air so you've got a pretty pretty
solid feeling pretty nice form and the
same great keyboard and trackpad that
are in the air and you are getting that
display 2560 by 1600 that used to be
something you would never see in a
13-inch laptop what you're getting here
under the hood is a new fourth
generation Core i5 processor code name
has well it's also got four gigs of ram
and 128 gigabyte flash storage you've
got two Thunderbolt 2 ports you've also
got HDMI and you've got the two USB 3.0
with the only thing you're missing is
ethernet no ethernet here Apple does not
believe in Ethernet in these thin
laptops we got 13 hours of battery life
on our test which is pretty fantastic
the 13-inch retina MacBook Pro feels
like a pretty good package to me I'm
Scott Stein and that's a look at the 13
inch macbook pro with retina display
