a little flame shape bulbs look nice but
every time one of them burns out you got
to drag a ladder into your living room
and climb up to change it and if using
incandescent like we are here in this
light that could be every year so
wouldn't it be better if you could use
LEDs that last decade or two decades and
save you the trouble we wanted to take a
close look at your options so we bought
up every single 40 watt equivalent
candelabra LED we could find all in all
it took us about 18 hours of testing in
our lighting lab to get a good look at
each bulb and you certainly got a lot of
options I've got six of them up here
from fight Phillips and Cree even a
walmart store Brad bulb and these range
in price from seven dollars each to
eleven dollars each none of them are as
affordable as I would like and none of
them work perfectly a dimmer switches
either which is kind of a problem when
you're spending this much to upgrade
your lighting the best value among
dimmable candelabra LEDs that I found
was this seven dollar bolt from EcoSmart
it was the best performer in our heat
management test and it also performs
well in terms of brightness and
efficiency if you don't need your bolts
them you can get this non dimmable
Phillips bulb in a three pack for about
10 bucks at Home Depot to sum it all up
he bulbs aren't bad but they're not
quite there categories still has some
catching up to do in terms of value and
performance for that reason I wouldn't
blame you one bit if you wanted to stick
it out with bulbs like these for another
year halogens incandescent are still
available still very affordable you'll
have to drag your ladder out again the
next time you need to replace them but
hopefully by then holds like these will
be a lot better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
