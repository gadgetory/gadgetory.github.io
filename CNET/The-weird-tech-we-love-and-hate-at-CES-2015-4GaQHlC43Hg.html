cnet's live streaming coverage of CES
2015 coming to you all the way from the
south hall at the Las Vegas Convention
Center I'm Bridget Carey here with my
co-host the great Jeff Bakalar and we're
here at day three of the consumer
electronic show we made it to day three
it's amazing i don't know i need to be
sitting because if i was standing I'd
fall over we've had days of press
conferences and endless product demos
we've talked about 4k and quantum dot TV
smart home technicals to strap on but CS
also has plenty of strange and bizarre
tech and before this year's show comes
to an end we have to highlight all the
weirdos stuff yeah so we picked a few
gems from the show we're going to call
this the tech you just can't forget
maybe it's something you really want to
take home today and something you just
never want to see ever again have no
imagery the ladder all right so Jeff why
don't you kick things off so yesterday I
got to check out dancing drones or as
we've recently decided to call them
dancing droney go check out this video I
thought these things were kind of absurd
it's and wear it yeah over at the parrot
booth was there's only a few feet away
um there they go I you know I didn't
realize this is where we were gonna this
is the direction we were gonna go with
drones I thought it was for like spying
but now there's like really interesting
choreographed dance routine new Olympic
sport synchronised drone flying yeah I
was a pretty surprised that the amount
of effort you know I when I saw this I
was joking about I was making a lot of
fun of it but I secretly fell in love
with it just because if you look at the
the bottom of that platform there that's
how all the drones were working they
were looking at the colored sort of
markings on the ground through this
whole sort of intricate Wi-Fi
infrastructure they had set up it's
pretty impressive to see the other show
that involved also rolling drums and
they were jumping on to the stage there
they were they would come out to a
platform below that and they would jump
up at one point don't get me wrong a lot
of them a crab trying to get up there
sometimes they were just smash earlier
this year Disney invested in a drone
I'm not surprised that that has
potential for theme park entertainment
they're just gonna slap like you know
the like Olaf on it and they'll be like
oh it's the Olaf drone you know and
that's and that'll be that and they'll
sell 40 million of them I was speaking
cute things I got something really
adorable on my list okay what's this
first off adorable name sopo soposed Oh
balls maybe my cat and it's gonna be
like your next little robot pet it's a
robot that can bring drinks to you more
than just drinks you can hook up a
wastebasket to his back as he goes by
and becomes your Butler for the party
it's kind of sad looking you know he's
so programmable you can even have a red
eyes as you saw there for a second which
is a little scary he's like a party
little buddy too yeah like a party like
the battery honest lusting I think he's
like the perfect dorm buddy you know
like he's definitely a party animal but
it's also educational so what do you
mean it's pre-programmed with kids book
stories oh and you simply put the image
of a what the book you want to read is
and they'll start reading into you like
a futuristic teddy ruxpin of sorts did
you get to see this up close and
personal I it's over at tech West so I
haven't had a seat yet I still some time
but oh my gosh I want him I'm gonna like
just shake i'm not a boom yeah he's what
i use a small enough you know looks like
look over there all right next up uh we
had a very interesting demo here that
left me well drunk uh the pico brew Mike
not a bad thing the pico brew Michael
microbrew home brewery system this was
pretty intense I know like so a lot of
people try and you know make beer brew
their own beer in their bathtub it's
sort of like a breaking bad situation
yeah you're not it's it's kind of messy
this automates the entire process and
pretty much makes it foolproof and
anyone adding the ingredients pushing
the right button it even has the sort of
access to the internet all these
different kinds of recipes you can
download to the brewer itself I see how
the micros not it's easy to clean I
guess it takes five days so basically
start to finish takes five days to get
from point A brewing it having it
ferment five days later you can have a
jury
do you think it's safe from being able
to screw it up like I be afraid I messed
something up I don't know there really
doesn't seem to be that much room for
error cuz all of the science you're
removed from that so it's good yeah only
problem though eighteen hundred dollars
so how many times will you have to brew
your own beer to sort of make up the
cost of that Chris's just going on a
beer run yeah they're like all right let
me spend ten bucks and get a six pack
and call it a day yeah all right there's
one gadget that goes into the band
forever pile the tech you just don't
want to see again sometimes there's tech
just for the sake of tech I introduce
you to bail t-bell T is something we saw
on the first day here where it's a smart
belt they put smarts and a belt and it
simply squeezes and releases depending
on if you're sitting if you ate too much
it's measuring your way so when you get
into a steak house and just instantly
loosens up see that is a little useful
but except it's so heavy to begin with
it's like a superhero utility belt I I
wanted to have to keep it behind plastic
like it's gonna get out I don't
understand it don't touch the glorious
belty oh man get over yourself smart
belt let's let's not you know they the
company had a couple of phrases they
said the belts experience hasn't changed
in centuries yeah for a reason nobody
can and then it's not just a wearable
it's a wearable a wearable stop it we
have to move on I can't spend any more
time smart belts speaking of stuff I
really just have had enough of its the
dream sleep text sort of stuff this
products called dream science uh it's a
device that will supposedly lull you to
sleep organically or wake you up in a
non-offensive sort of way it does it
does the problem I have with these
products is that they sort of promised
these gigantic you know a scientific
sort of you know lofty talk and this
thing says it has brainwave tech in it
that's weight from afar it's measuring
my brain weighs apparently sort of like
sensing the vibes of your sleeping
environment
on right I mean it's an alarm clock
that's what that is that's an alarm
clock don't tell don't try and make it
something it's not oh yeah almost it
like gently opens the curtains and sort
of like rubs my four inches jet and
whispers in my ear it's like Jeff get up
you know this thing's just not gonna cut
it I'm sorry that's just how we that's
how i feel about dream tech sleep tech
yeah check out of the dreams all right
well I'm going to go on to something
that I need right now but I hope they
can make a little bit of a tweak to it
okay all right sony introduced a smart
headset so not only is it play music it
measures the heartbeat in your ears and
here's the little kicker it talks to you
there's a coach inside that while it's
measuring your heart rate while you're
on a run it's letting you know how
you're doing because it's measuring if
your hearts like just simply racing to
the point if it's gonna explode or not
you know and I could use I could use a
little voice in my ear because i do not
work out I i can't i have no motivation
some sort of because I'm like whew i
feel i feel a little a little flush I'm
good but I need I need someone to yell
at me though so here's this week I need
Sony to have a mean setting I need I
need it I need something to get tough
with me maybe another Sony can be yell
or just yelling yeah like do you really
want to still be so decide though I
really think this sort of stuff is the
future where people you know even in New
York when you walk down the street
everyone constantly has their headphones
on right like that's the thing you're
gonna need that thing to constantly kick
you in the butt yeah right so that's
always gonna have to be around your neck
or whatever it is so much tech now is
nice though it's like keep going only a
mile to go now now just be masters and I
ball by that gadget to work out because
I can't do it myself yet there's a
reason moving along what else we got
okay there is one that is dorky but I
totally love it for similar reasons it
is the one wheel you might have seen a
you have seen this I did a demo with
them on the floor yeah it is it is that
giant rubber tire in the middle of a
skateboard right and kind of like a
Segway the sense that it keeps you
balanced you just kind of go by moving
forward and back there's a lot of these
devices that like it moves forward
you just stand still but this one
actually looks like i can live that
dream of being a skater even though i
don't know how to skate i cannot fall
down because i have no coordination
skills all right what's amazing role
look I I think it could work but the
fact that it's I think it's something
like fifteen hundred dollars let's bring
that price down just bring that down
just a little bit i mean i'm only
getting one wheel yeah so I mean Luke
here kind of looks like a professional
he just tried it out for the first time
he did he doesn't skate he said so he
made it work but he also said it was a
little bit of a workout sure you have to
like balance your core it's a big thing
yeah so you know the one wheel $1,500
later you have something that can take
you around for three hours at a time I'm
not graceful but I I trust myself with
that I get that alright finally what do
we have alright there's another there's
some tech that I fear fear yes totally
fear fear tech okay like saw for the
first time late yesterday Nick see Nick
see the wearable drone that also flies
back to you like a boomerang you strap
this thing on your arm flick it out it
takes a selfie and comes back no that's
cool what if there's nothing scary about
that it's good it's it's coming back to
you in flight oh it's is clean I don't
need drones bling and people with sole
reason I I feel like you could use that
in like a setting where you'd need
someone to pass you something that maybe
you couldn't throat it you know like hey
give me that drink and you just sort of
place it on your way you're a gambit or
something that's awesome they like bring
it to another level there's actually
hold things it's interesting you bring
up the fear stuff nothing really like
shockingly scary rapping in the grand
the photo you know I do sell me on to
know
it's more like a big brother fear I
guess it's like the electronic like
Falcon you would have Go Go Joan go oh
that's cool that's what i want i need a
drone companion like that a little
parasite to sort of i'll take my Soviet
my back up I'll take the non-flying so
if you look at drunk robot yeah I love
it all right wow that does it for its
latest emotion and say it's good it's
been a pleasure doing this this has been
a lot of folks in a beautiful time thank
