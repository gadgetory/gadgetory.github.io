show you how to take ordinary halloween
decorations and bring them to life with
some music and animation to do this I've
got some plug-in Halloween decorations
like this strobe light and a spooky
light-up skull and some green lights I
also have some plain household extension
cords some wire strippers a momentary
switch some cheap speakers and some
Halloween music and sound effects on my
iPod but the key to this whole thing is
this it's a relay switch sequencer also
known as a key banger this one's the
monster guts nerve center you can find
it online for about $70 we're gonna plug
in our Halloween decorations here on the
back and then use the interface to make
a sequence of them turning on and off on
command and it's going to be awesome the
first step is to hook up the connections
on the back of the nerve center these
are two basic relay switches they're
like the light switches in your home
only they're connected to a little
computer inside here that automatically
switches them on and off to make this
easy we're gonna hook these up to
extension cords so for that to work I've
got to graph this connector onto the
extension cord so that I can plug it
into the nerve center first we're gonna
make sure our cord is not connected to a
socket yet I'll use a screwdriver to
split the cord near the socket end then
I'll make a cut on one side doesn't
matter which one next I'll expose about
a quarter inch of the copper from the
cut section of the wire now you can give
this a twist and run it right into the
relay block and screw it down but for a
more durable solution I soldered the
tips here to prevent the wire from
fraying
so now you've got two pieces of cable
but three places to connect so what
gives well one side goes to the con on
the far left then depending on what
effect you want the other side can go to
the normally open connection to turn
things on or normally closed to turn
things off in this case we're going with
normally open which means that anything
I plug in here by default is gonna be
turned off one of these connections will
give you one thing that you can blink on
and off but there are two on here that
you can use independently so why not go
all out and hook up two extension cords
all right so we've got our two extension
cords hooked up to the nerve center now
I'm gonna plug in our decorations I'll
plug in the strobe light over here on
this guy and plug in our skull and our
green lights and to the other cable
alright now we still need to get
power to the extension cords the nerve
center is not actually providing power
to these cables so we have to plug them
in now don't be afraid
hopefully you've made your connections
correctly we're also gonna plug in the
nerve center finally alright so
everything's got power let's move on to
adding some music or sound effects I've
got some spooky music here on my iPod
the nerve center came with this mini
jack cable to connect these together so
that I can record my sounds directly
into the controller I'll plug in my iPod
here using the cable hit the menu button
one time so that it reads ES one hit the
start button and hit play on my iPod I
can record up to two minutes of music
but mostly I'm just going for shock
value here so I'll fade out my iPod
after a few seconds alright to hear it
back we're gonna press the menu button
again so that it reads AC one we're
gonna plug in some passive speakers into
the speaker output jack on the front
here now when I press play we're gonna
hear the music come out we like what we
hear we can move on to the next step
which is going to be programming the
relay switches that control the
decorations now the term keeping and got
its name because we are literally
sequencing these actions in real time by
banging on these keys
this Keys gonna operate whatever is
plugged into this cable and this Keys
gonna operate whatever is plugged into
this one so we're gonna hit start here
the music
now when we're all done we'll hit the
same button to stop things we're all set
all right now to preview everything
you've done hit the menu button one more
time so we see a p1 then hit the start
button it's working the music's playing
the lights are blinking everything seems
extremely awesome I can hit the stop
button and everything's gonna stop there
it goes now if I didn't like it if I
wanted to redo the music or redo the
lights
I could go yeah I could use the Menu
button to go back to that particular
menu and I can rerecord and keep moving
on but I'm pretty happy with that so I'm
gonna hit the menu button a couple times
until I see SC one which is going to be
the live mode for this controller now if
we controlled the whole thing from the
nerve center that would be pretty cool
but not that great for surprising people
instead the nerve center gives you a
trigger input on the front you can hook
up to a pressure-sensitive door mat or a
home security sensor but in this case
we're gonna hook it up to a momentary
switch this deluxe one comes from
monster guts but I also have a few that
I wired up myself for just a few bucks
you're gonna hook the ends of the wire
to the far ends of the block here on the
front we're gonna plug the block back
into the front and now when I press this
button everything should activate right
all systems go all right so that's one
cool way for taking your Halloween
decorations up a notch this year there's
