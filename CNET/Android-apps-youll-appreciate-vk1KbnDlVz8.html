welcome to tap that app the show where
we feature the juiciest pieces of app on
planet earth now if you know me then you
know I'm an Android enthusiast but the
thing about android is that they're like
a billion apps with like a skillion more
getting at it every day and not all of
them are cool this means that finding
the right app the one that's perfectly
tailored to your needs could take you a
thousand years literally well today I'm
going to help you cut through all the
clutter with an app that actually helps
find the right apps just for you it's
called the appreciate personal app
market and it's essentially an app
recommendation engine to get started
just download appreciate and log in with
your Facebook account you can also log
in without facebook but going that route
as you can imagine gives appreciate less
data to play with the home screen is
where you get your daily recommendations
that are based on your profile info the
apps currently installed on your device
even your Facebook friends if they're
using appreciate to you can also see
daily new games new apps local favorites
at a bunch of other categories it's
really a lot of information when you
look at a recommendation appreciate will
tell you whether it's a strong match or
simply a good match and it will even
tell you why or sometimes it'll give you
a nap and say take a chance which
essentially means it's not a match at
all one feature i really love though is
appreciate shopping cart whenever you
come across an app that you're
interested in just add it to your cart
then when you're finished browsing you
can go back to your cart and install it
from there what's interesting though is
that the cart actually says install all
hitting install all doesn't install all
of the apps at once you still have to go
in and install each of them individually
so if you don't want to sift through
literally 50 trillion android apps then
try the appreciate personal app market
it really works trust me also it's free
and it's available now through google
play that's it for this week if you've
got a fine piece of app that you want to
show me holler at me on the twitter
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
