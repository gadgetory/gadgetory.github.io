another robot but this time is really
really really tiny a new 360 VR camera
that beats google and GoPros take that
and a pothole that tweets its problems
hashtag deal with it tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best ski
talk show him in our universe I'm your
host Ashley skillet joining me as always
kale anonymous um it looks really good
you can't even tell it's fake thanks
it's 3d printed Oh 3d printed yeah it
also has a Wi-Fi network ain't that the
truth here's that lines you had no idea
you're completely caught off guard no
that was that was on my level of bad
puns like that was way down in Ashley
ville punt puns ville it's bad so good
Ashley Phil population population this
girl right here um let's talk about this
puddle it's a bit a sh leave ill does
not have oils we're starting with a
pothole the other one we got a little
robot we got a potholing out via oh yeah
okay uh la cote with general is a
Twitter account but it's a pothole
pothole has his own Twitter account
great now everything has everything has
its web account but there's actually
purpose to this it has over 3000
followers it's in Panama it's as I said
a real pothole and it has a little
device inside that looks like a like a
hockey puck but with a hashtag symbol on
it and there is there are pressure and
motion sensors inside the paddles
apparently potholes are a pretty bad
problem in Panama like people complain
about them all the time alright yeah so
after your car there is a daily news
show in Panama called telemetry Oh
reporte and that's the tweet that's
that's the digit tweeting pothole so
they have a bunch of them all over this
city and they were like it makes every
time a car runs over them and the
pressure sensors or the motion sensors
detect it's been run over and hit by a
car it sends out that there's an RF
transmitter inside it sends out a tweet
officially on Twitter that says things
like and they get creative with it too
which is hilarious it says I feel
terrible I just cost tire damage to an
old lady's car oh wow so it gets
creative with the tweets like I'm sure
they have a whole bunch of different
ones that they have like loaded up for
when people hit them and they
they've made a really big deal out of
this on this news on this daily news
show and they do a segment about the
tweets of a pothole they're like guys
like this is serious problem try to keep
away from me so I'm tired of being
blamed every time a car crash happens
when drivers try to keep away from me
Wow repair the streets and it tweets and
it tags the it tags the ministry of
public works every single time the car
hits it so it's like at like and it tags
the ministry so it actually is working
these potholes are getting repaired
which is pretty funny oh nice there is a
there is a google map you can access on
this daily show's website that's a there
yo so they're getting them fixed that
has a gue it's a google map of all of
the locations of the different tweeting
potholes and they are getting fixed
which is pretty cool so and even the
Minister of Public Works came on this
daily talk show and and talked about
this issue and was like I mean there was
some blame shuffled around worries i go
it's this and here's why we can't do it
but they are getting fixed so pretty
cool using Twitter to solve problems in
a really weird this progressive the
second time we've seen someone try to
resolve the pothole issue with some
clever way like spray painted like
genital like yeah yeah he's and the
people and the city was like we can't
have that bottle let's fix it up so yeah
this is a great way to go public shaming
via pothole it's like public puddle
shaming I love this so and I thought
that it would be really fun to talk
about the hashtag of the day which would
be TD pothole and we could discuss what
you guys and what we think what kinds of
issues that we could maybe get solved if
we did something like this like what's
an issue it's like a issue out in the
city then easy it solved like farting in
elevators oh that would be a good one
yeah sulfur sensor the sulfur sensor
that's pretty good in the elevator maybe
it could pinpoint who it was well that's
I'm saying where it's like it's that
girl but I'd say Alex series voice yeah
okay so go ahead no I like it I stop
farting Ashley yes yeah I don't think I
can do a series really good serious okay
what about you I want to say littering
like it feels like we could do something
with littering where there's motion
sensors are
trash cans like so if you throw
something and it misses like it's got
like it may be oscar the grouch like
yells you from inside the trash cans
like hey straight subway I need that I'm
hungry very fun though oh man so the
trash cans are hungry Jose like hey pal
feed me like someone walks up here near
it and are like feed me like real quiet
fee or they could make it so that if you
throw it at the trash can you miss it
like it makes like a booing audience
like a basketball or sad trombone yeah
that's gonna be amazing so yeah TD
pothole that's your hashtag get creative
with it tell us what what social Civic
issue would you like to fix with uh with
tweet shaming which I'm I'm assuming as
a thing right tweet shaving sure alright
VR okay so Google i/o sucked ah what I'm
gonna say except for the the fact that
they're trying to integrate a little bit
more into the VR world everybody is kind
of getting in the VR world biggest issue
is how you're gonna record VR right like
right how I gotta capture that VR 360
view well well that jump was so
expensive well yeah the jump is really
expensive well this this group has
decided they pumped with an easier
solution okay and what google introduced
which was the jump at their I oh okay
this is an omni polar camera it only
requires six cameras and apparently it's
going to be a lot cheaper okay okay
let's walk through this how do we owe
this so basically this this camera has
six six cameras with three fisheye
lenses both on the top there's three on
top three on the bottom and then it has
an algorithm that like system built in
so that it it kind of blends all those
cameras together all the fisheye lens
cameras very nice okay together this was
unveiled at the i-x symposium in
Montreal is designed by Vincent choppa
choppa d'alene culture and Sebastian Roy
yeah so again special software algorithm
allows the camera to capture 3d video
instead of just the 360 right like a
like a photo sphere kind of thing yeah
right catches it's like a actual 3d
video that you can you know kind of move
around the space and if you're wearing a
headset is awesome so each camera each
one captures its own image and that its
digits or um okay so the thing is what
they're aiming for here is
cost because look I'm not gonna buy 16
GoPro no for the jump I'm not even gonna
rent 16 go for the sugar so they're
hoping that it's gonna they can get it
to like a couple hundred bucks that's
which it doesn't look like it looks like
its cost more than a couple hundred
bucks it feels like it needs a housing
like look at this so if we're looking at
it right now like it's got three other
cameras and a triangle shape on the
bottom as well it feels like this needs
to be Houston something but I get that
you have to be able to capture all the
images around you unobstructed so I
guess maybe not yeah well you know a
couple hundred bucks I mean it's feel
like it's still an experiment they don't
really have a release date so I mean you
can't take it too excited maybe looked
at least it's an idea yeah I think
that's probably where they're going they
might just cook it some virtual reality
and let's toss them by a never getting
Apple in here elbow Apple hasn't even
touch the VR market but they did just
buy an AR company they just bonding our
company right we're gonna skip the VR
market they might just do it yeah
probably should do a microsoft microsoft
web viable buyer I mean this is a really
I love this because Google talked a lot
at i/o about getting people like they
were saying oh you can experience these
like life events like what if you could
instead of having just a picture of an
event like live through a family event
or whatever and it's like I get that but
you're not going to spend eight grand
for those GoPros for hero fours 16 hero
for is plus a microphone plus the the
jump rig like you're not going to pay
ten thousand dollars for that yeah and
so just to have it up like your wedding
like I mean sigh maybe some people some
rich people will fine and that would be
really cool but you know this is an
opportunity for me and you to have a VR
capture system which I would love I
would love to do wouldn't you love to do
one episode of trauma daily and virtual
reality there be so rad I would love
that I feel like we could just put you
in Virtual Reality permanently we would
never see you in person it yeah just
digi kale yeah did you kill did you kill
you so you can just shut me off it I
like it you're just like power you down
good um okay I want to tell you about
this robot you're gonna flip out when
you see this video Kayla's not seen this
video yet you might freak out so MIT we
talked about Robo cheetah yesterday this
is the untethered miniature origami
robot and it is exact
what it sounds like it is not connected
to any cables here's the robot right
here oh it's cute it folds itself up
into its own little robot you can see
that's five times the speed so not
terribly quick a sped up video but still
definitely sped up into doing and then
it goes around and does stuff it
completes tasks it can walk on a
trajectory it can get can be given a
path and can walk around on a path it
can do things like climb carry objects
it can walk on your skin it can swim it
can dig through stuff that's scary okay
it's so cool like it's gonna deliver
this block into that little into that
little enclosure Oh many splits goodbye
see you later there he is swimming he's
like we like I love this little robot so
much he's only this robot is only 1
point 7 centimeter square it can carry a
load he can carry some stuff it needs to
deliver things my god this thing is so
cute here it is climbing it's climbing a
little slow jumps off the edge this is
like I mean it's like BASE jumping but
for the little robot feel like he's like
we thought he takes off it's
entertaining itself okay it can dig it
through stack so here's it did digging
attack that it's so crazy it's creepy I
love this uh I get any so cute he's
adorable and so here's and then very
lastly it fully dissolves in acetone so
the robot good i believe that you can
fully dissolve in acetone ok so it's
powered by small magnet and for
electromagnetic coils that create
magnetic fields that enable the robot to
move around and do tasks so the point of
this is and this is I know we always
talk about goals here there is an actual
in-game yeah besides an adorable little
roadsides just being the cutest robot
ever mit wants to make even smaller
robots that are based on this kind of
idea they want to get to the point where
they can make these really really tiny
robots with an injective extra sensors
on them that can be and also can
dissolve in water so that they can put
them in your body and do things like
some of the examples that i was reading
online were like clean out your arteries
and kill like target cancer cells insane
insane stuff so to keep us healthy which
so someday the descendants of this
little origami robot may in fact
be injected into your bloodstream to
clean out your arteries from eating all
that delicious delicious chipotle you
got every day for lunch yeah kels
already freaked out I already see a
supervillain like a gym oh it's too late
bond I've already put millions of micro
robots in the water supply and them now
making no way do humans bodies and
breaking them down from the inside wow
haha any already freed himself and say
Bella I think you just gave up a plateau
Specter in fact I think that is actually
the plot of James the new James Bond and
if not it should be and we need right
this is like the third little robot type
thing that they want to inject in your
body that we've seen right there's a
biodegradable biodegradable box these
sort of like grit the gripper bought
that we saw that was smaller than like
the edge of a nickel like we've seen
like a lot of these robots that that
science is working very actively on that
are intended to be injected in your body
or complete a task and then either
dissolve self-destruct or otherwise like
disappears I think the artery thing
could save a lot of people well yeah I
mean what if she's you guys I eat a lot
of fast food so I have like I need that
robot to fit into my arteries so that I
can clean it out so you just take a
bunch of robots instead of vitamins just
eat robot you're you're having and all
the bread all comes with little robots
that you eat after those meals God weird
this is such an American conversation it
is a terribly American um but yeah so
that's it that's the little little
origami robot which I thought was
amazing i love that it just assembles
itself and then just takes off but
that's it for headlines will be right
back it's tuesday so we have a whole
batch of new releases a bunch of stuff
movies TV we're not movies TV movies and
video games some good stuff this week
and then of course your user feedback
and our firm tiger for the day so don't
click away it's tomorrow daily
my god nope I know fall you're you are
fall outing really hard today I didn't
even you can't see our camera but I got
my fallout 101 volatile it here pull
your boat shoes yeah go ahead pull it up
wow do you do yoga do you even yoga bro
what hello excuse me um but there you go
yeah got my fall out to use a pit boys
shirt you could call a necklace necklace
I mean you're literally like I'm
surprised you don't have jump suit pants
I have a jumpsuit I know you have a job
word on this I'm on the show I'm just
very sure you did alright alright let's
talk about new releases its tuesday
doesn't good stuff this week talk about
new releases well first of all uh we
don't have this we don't have graphics
for this but Ark is out which is that
yes dinosaur taming game yes I didn't
realize it was out today I thought it
was like last cuz i was on twitch alpha
it's out an alpha today yeah so it's
free they gave you free to some
streamers dinosaur second most extreme
thing yesterday I don't know about to
the crazy dinosaur games out today who
go ahead first up heroes of the storm
out today which MOBA categorized but a
blizzard likes to call it a hero brawler
they're like it's not really mobo cuz
it's like got some different play
mechanics a MOBA it's a MOBA so it's
they like called hero brawler here's the
storm out today it's a freemium game you
can literally go download it for free
and that what they charge you for is
what they do is very similar to if i'm
not mistaken league of legends where you
have a set number of heroes and then
they rotate the available free heroes
over time like every once a week or
whatever it is like every patch of
rotate I don't know how often they
rotate but you get a set of heroes for
free that you can use with standard
skins and then you can pay
microtransactions for extra skins like
for example my Diablo has Merc hablo so
it's dressed up like a murloc from World
of Warcraft it's delightful it's more
about unlocking characters that aren't
in rotation right I'm so you can pay to
unlock other characters that are not in
rotation if you have a favorite
character that you don't want to see go
into the lock you can unlock them
permanently all that stuff so yeah how
many characters are there total a lot
and I don't I know yet today they
released Johanna which is like a diablo
3 character which people were pretty
excited about they just announced like
they have the lost vikings they've got
kael'thas i mean these are all of your
favorite like blizzard heroes not i
cannot play with the Lost Vikings are so
hard they're really hard I used to play
Sabbath ER but then I just it really
takes a special player to play as abitha
I'm like I really love and you get like
mounts and all this stuff so guys like
if you can check it out if this is
anything that you're interested in like
here's a star was pretty fun also out
massive chalice massive chalice is out
another realtime strategy i'm a really
neat rows obviously you guys know I'm a
really big double flying fan I backed
this full disclosure I back to this on
Kickstarter it is fine
out officially I have a house in this
game house I haven't you were able that
was like the tier that i picked where
you were able to like put in a family
crest and all this stuff so the point of
massive chalice is like it's sort of a
you have your kingdom and it lasts four
thousand years and so for example if you
have a hero you have to decide if that
hero is going to stay home and make
babies wait and and continue your
bloodline with this like great warrior
or you can like send them out into
battle and it's really fun and the
graphics are cool and it's super
enjoyable so if again if that's a type
of game that you're into a genre game
you're into so you guys really enjoy
this yes it's real time strategy okay
real phone charger so that's really fun
and then we got some movies coming up
this week big time we got entourage
coming out this week so what's the game
what game lego jurassic park oh no
that's next week no it's this week
that's not what i saw in the calendar
i'm gonna double check ok GG may be
right entourage is coming out this
Friday if you missed the the adventures
of our gold and crew I've never seen any
episode so I have literally never seen
an episode of entourage as well people
seem to be excited about it I you know
it's like bro code I guess but yeah it
looks funny enough there was a really
funny thing with Ronda Rousey that I
that made me laugh really hard where she
like beets she's my beat-up
what's-his-face that's her stick in
everything well yeah I mean that's like
what she does she beats up beats people
up so I but yeah this if you're
interested in Entourage and go see that
also out a movie that you've seen spine
last week which is Melissa McCarthy
Jason Statham Jude Law like this looks
really funny um you saw k i'll give us
your review i'm not a fan of melissa
mccarthy's comedy to you know
traditionally I'm not like you like woo
yay but she has somehow fine-tuned every
single aspect of it to the point where
she's solid and after seeing this I was
like she's a star she's a comedy she's a
comedy star especially and it was great
and Jason Statham steals the show every
single time it's amazing yeah it's great
you'll be surprised by this if it's one
of those weekends r you get kind of like
bored not sure go if you're bored go see
it you'll have a great time I wouldn't

what am I thinking premiere sure like
screener I was I was shocked as I was
like at first I'm like I don't know

believe like believer yeah um so I I
will take that and I will go see it and
then also out this week is insidious

support i do my homework it's all like
everything except pc i'm sorry well it
makes you sad um but you know it doesn't
shouldn't make you sad our amazing
viewers who wrote in to us it's time for
user feedback I'm gonna make you happy
right now nilesh wrote in and said happy
birthday producer Logan hashtag TD muy
money muy pronto hahaha do that Logan
yes hey dead nice so thank you he did he
did get song is great these are one
person to do it fantastic so thank you
very much we asked you guys use a
hashtag TDI o to talk about what you
were missing at Google i/o a lot you
guys wrote in Rick Rhoden said I was
really hoping to see a finished product
of project ara a working modular phone
with all of its modules but we got
nothing no they did have a press
conference project ara what Tim Stevens
and I walked by there and they had a
whole bunch of like they had a big pin
board wall where you could like put in
modules like these things like door
hanger looking things I was like what
smartphone would you build and it was
really cool but there wasn't anything
actually like usable but they did say
that they you know they're still working
on everything they did have a booth at
Google i/o even though there wasn't
anything really substantial to look at
so just as an FYI Dustin Rodin said TDI
oh I was hoping for an advanced AI
integrated into a smart self driving car
hashtag Knight Rider hashtag next year
LOL
I like that google i/o 26 to a grand
Knight Rider year year the Knight Rider
Dane wrote in and said self-driving
plane okay that's a bad idea that's
Skynet right there that's nothing much
yeah that's actually exactly so that's
kinda so like Skynet and then lastly pin
emailed us our good friend pin wrote and
said ello SE and kale not not a terribly
long email i promised i was expecting
google new now it's a greater leap of
innovation in the development of Google
cardboard eg use of the smart phones
back camera to implement a our
integration of Bluetooth game controller
for vr gaming integration of leap motion
like device mounted on the headset to
incorporate hand motion vr gaming so
some sort of leap on the headset and
then also not only confirm the rumor
that Nintendo's next gaming devices
built on top of Android but also built
on top of Google cardboard Mario car be
our baby which by the way Nintendo just
this morning said nope not built on
Android no not we they're like we
normally don't respond to rumors but
since this one went global we're
literally squashing this right now and
saying definitely not built on Android
platform so NX will not be an Android
based operating system and that's that
was our user feedback that I that I
really enjoyed but now it is time for
very last PC user feedback which is
always our photog refer of the day
did a picture fall out and I wish it was
you know what though you could imagine
if fallout happened what this picture
would look like in the future could we
do that I do that every day but yeah
let's see fair enough kales kales eyes
are actually just a are goggles set up
to make everything look like a
post-apocalyptic wasteland I just just
FYI everybody here's a special pair of
contacts are they in raw yeah it's gross
little fallout that's the name of that
project to the labs through Lex labs
gene wrote in and said hi guys I want to
share a photo I took of the monstrous
Sears Tower in Chicago on a beautiful
sunny day from a pedestrian perspective
which I work right next to to be honest
my main intent was to test out my new
samsung galaxy s6 edge didn't supposed
it amazing camera I think the result
speaks for itself but I thought it was
still a good shot regardless hope you
enjoy jean p/s love the show keep up the
great work yeah great picture it really
really is it's so good and like I love
that the sky is not totally whited out
because you know sometimes when it's
backlit like that the whole sky just
looked white this you can actually see
this beautiful blue sky the green it's
like so rich and I mean this is a great
pair I'm really impressed with this
camera it's our first our first s6 edge
I think so yeah this is our first s6
that's a cool looking phone too it does
look really neat i like one in a wallet
case and it looked really weird cuz you
could see the little like side stripling
yeah i still don't get the point of the
sides like i'm sure you but it looks
cold you can use his purpose it's got
this no no you don't really eat it but
it looks awesome it looks totally cool
you whoa dude yeah I'm freaking out but
yeah it's a side edge but that's it so
I'll stop they're all amazing we all
carry little computers in our hands it's
pretty cool um alright guys if you want
