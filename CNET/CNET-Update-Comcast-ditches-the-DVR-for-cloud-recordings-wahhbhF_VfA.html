little more cool I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your C net update more people
are ditching their television
subscriptions and instead just using
streaming services like Netflix and
Amazon Instant Video but to combat that
trend cable providers are trying to
improve your TV viewing experience by
adding new features Comcast just
unveiled a new platform called x2
it saves recorded programs online in the
cloud and these save shows can also be
watched on mobile devices its new
channel guide will also make
recommendations based on what you're
watching and it ties into social media
for example while you're watching a live
show you can read what people are saying
about the show on Twitter there will
also be the option for voice commands
for those that like talking to their TV
Time Warner Cable is also updating its
channel guide with personalized
recommendations and customers with new
Samsung Smart TVs can use an app to
access on-demand content Cox
Communications also is rolling out a new
programming guide later this summer that
also improves recommendations and that
lets viewers switched from watching on a
mobile device to the TV for those that
want more camera in their phone Samsung
just announced a new phone called the s4
galaxy zoom it's an Android smartphone
with a 16 megapixel point-and-shoot
camera that sports a 10x zoom lens
this is different from the Samsung
Galaxy camera which was mostly a camera
with an Android interface this is being
sold as a real smartphone it's coming
out first in the UK this summer but it
won't hit the u.s. until the end of the
year and no word on price yet don't be
surprised if you start to see more
features in Google Maps that let's just
see where your friends are located
because Google just bought the social
mapping and navigation app Waze and it
could mean Android users will have a
more social experience when using maps
right now Waze gives real time driving
alerts based on users that tell the
network about traffic conditions like if
there's an accident causing a jam ahead
the app also lets you share your
location with other friends so you can
let them know how to meet up with you
and myspace is still kicking the network
debuted a new eye
phone app to go along with its website
now out of beta myspace has a focus
around music and so does the app with a
future called my radio yep you can
create your own radio stations to stream
on the go and the app lets you create
and share animated gifs yeah the
excitement is just too hard to contain
and now all classic myspace accounts
have been updated to the new website
platform that's your tech news update
