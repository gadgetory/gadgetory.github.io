faster than he'd ever been before faster
than the other team he had that races
mindset that he wasn't happy unless he
was in the lead it's a mindset that
carried on with his company McLaren and
it's why the 650s exists the 12c or to
use its original name the McLaren
mp4-12c was McLaren's first go at a
sensible road car the f1 of course was
its first proper go for the road but it
was a little mad anyway the 12c was
lauded as being a brilliant car even by
me but many said it felt a little solace
a touch flawed and a bit wanting McLaren
was on its way to making something
golden but it needed a bit more and
that's what it reckons the 650s is
here's the vital statistics the 650s is
3.8 litre twin-turbo v8 pushes out 641
brake horsepower or 650 PS if you live
in Europe it also manages 500-pound foot
of torque that's a bit of a way off of
the 12c that managed 616 brake
horsepower at 413 pounds fern speaking
of the 12c he wasn't a slow car not 262
took 3.1 seconds in its top speed was
207 miles an hour in comparison the 650s
will hit 62 in three seconds dead and
its top speed is also 207 miles an hour
but this isn't really all about top
speed because the boys from working have
been
far more than you'll ever know yes
there's the look of it which borrows
from the p1 hypercar fair bit but it
also uses dumper similar to those found
on said p1 so there's that the
suspension has been fiddled with us as
the steering to make the 650s a little
sharper a little harder and more soulful
than the car that came before McLaren's
taken a Silicon Valley approach with the
650s there were things about the 12c
that needed fixing or upgrading or just
found a little bit wanting that could be
adjusted to make a better car but they
couldn't be fixed with me a software no
they needed proper hardware engineering
and so that's exactly what McLaren's
done it's how the car world works but I
feel with McLaren there's a bit more to
it there's the impression that the next
big thing the next fix is waiting in the
wings there won't be such a thing as the
perfect car and I like that the brazen
ability to look back and go know it can
be better and that's something old Bruce
left by now at MacLaren's UK HQ there's
this thing called the boulevard and
along it are important race-winning
McLaren's from years gone by and at the
top of it there's a little red Austin
seven
that car was bought for Bruce by his
motorcycle sham dad so his son could go
hill climbing unsurprisingly Bruce was
very very talented and so to get a
competitive edge up the hill he started
fiddling with his Austin Seven doing
things like flipping the suspension for
an extra couple of tenths of a second as
he got better his motorsport career well
took off it's well documented he was an
exacting man he had very high standards
one day he was out testing one of his
new cars he was quite works to see that
the fuel filler cap hadn't been replaced
by his pink room as fluffing about in
the wind now initially he was quite
annoyed by this but then it's a man
Manson figured well if I Drive really
quickly the wind will go over the car
and push it now so he went quicker
but the wind didn't push the cap down
all it did was making waggle more it was
just flapping all over the place and
this is when Bruce learn all about
aerodynamics he figured there was
another airflow underneath the flap and
that was what was causing all there you
know flat penis when he got back to the
pits he lept out of the car took some
shears to it and made his own
aerodynamic adjustments and instantly
started putting in better lap times I
like to think there was a similar Eureka
moment when the 650s became a thing
someone went but if we do this and lo
McLaren decided it was better now to put
the car in context the 12c was an
incredible bit of kit it wasn't showing
or flashy though it didn't scream money
as say a Ferrari does it was the start
of a long journey for McLaren the p1 was
a massive leap so the 650s should be
leagues above the 12c was a stunning car
it was brilliant I adored it it was
everything I'd hoped it would be yes
people didn't
think it was as good as a Ferrari or
have you and maybe it was lacking in a
few areas and I've heard that the 650s
is what it could have been if it was
left simmering for a little longer
that's what's been said about it
and I'm inclined to agree because what
McLaren's done is it it's giving it more
feeling it is a once more with feeling
kind of car the steering's been adjusted
that the dampers are those fairly
similar inspired by the p1 project the
front end yes it does 8 the look of the
p1 yes that's now a family face but
McLaren being McLaren it's not there
just to be pretty its function all the
carbon fiber bits and all the the
grooves and what have you that's there
to add downforce the car this now has
way more front end grip than the 12c did
not that the 12c needed more grip
because it handled unbelievably well but
this now means well it'll go around
corners quicker than you or I could
possibly imagine you may have noticed
down the side of the car there's two
carbon fiber sills those aren't there
just to put a 650s budge on know those
help guide air down the side of the car
to make it extra slippery the spoilers
been fiddled with as well now it's
already awesome because well its a
spoiler that goes up and down you can
use it as an air brake so when you're
really tonking it and then slam on the
anchors it will raise up completely
it'll go pretty much a vertical from
where I've been sitting only downside to
that is when that does happen it
completely covers the rear window so you
can't actually see out the back so if
someone is quite close to you and you
break quite hard by the time the spoiler
goes down they might be a bit closer
than you'd imagined
it's a thinking car this it thinks for
you it works for you to flatter you to
make sure that you can get the best out
of it at any given moment to win that
with McLaren's amazing ride one of the
best things about the 12c was it eerily
serene ride and you could easily I
reckon just bimble around in one of
these days two days shouldn't be too
much of an issue apparently it's been
tuned to be a little bit closer to track
because in the 12c it didn't offer quite
as much
supercar silliness that some owners
would have liked I want to talk about
the way this car delivers his power
press the active button press menu or
and then the car goes into your control
so I don't have control the gears the
gearbox is super sharp super quick put
it in third find a straight bit
Jesus Christ good lord this thing is
fast mclaren doesn't do feeling it
doesn't do big shiny flashy emotion it
doesn't do
he doesn't do in the Italian Way the
Ferrari thing it's all me everything is
very beautiful that it feels very lovely
it's all done because our way Ferrari we
have all this great emotion and great
passion and all that and i'm not saying
mclaren doesn't have passion doesn't
have a motion far from it but it derives
its passionate emotion not from artistic
flair and artisanal wonderfulness it
derives it from being the best
engineered car out from going quicker
than the other guy this is a function
car it's not a form over function the
function dictates the fall and it
happens to be that the form is bloody
crazy there is nothing on this car that
doesn't need to be here and the interior
reflects that this car would appeal to a
very certain type of person and I would
bet any money that
probably engineers engineers and
absolutely love these things one is
always going to be incrementally faster
than the other one is always going to
have fans that the other does have is
always going to be staunch supporters
what I'm pleased that there's that
little race going on the Ferrari is
pushing McLaren that McLaren is pushing
Ferrari that each one ups the game just
a little further each time so they can
say our but we're faster than the other
guy because what that means that the end
product
will please everybody I'm not sure what
anyone's expecting other than brilliance
from a company like McLaren but still
the 650s isn't the only way you can get
your mclaren road car kicks if you're
one of the lucky few who has the keys to
a p1 then good for you or there's the
675 long tail which has 666 brake
horsepower and a slightly longer spoiler
than the 650s or the 911 fighting sports
series might be the one for you and all
of them without doubt a brilliant to
McLaren just like Bruce simply wants to
be faster be better than the other guy
unlike Bruce though it's unlikely to die
trying Bruce McLaren himself had this to
say on that very topic to do something
well is so worthwhile that to die trying
to do it better cannot be foolhardy it
would be a waste of life to do nothing
with one's ability for I feel that life
is measured in achievement not in years
alone and you can hardly say that bruce
mclaren or mclaren itself has hardly
achieved anything can you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
