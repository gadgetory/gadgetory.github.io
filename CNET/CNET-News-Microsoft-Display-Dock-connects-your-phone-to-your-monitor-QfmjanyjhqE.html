couple ways up here you can see my
signal bars I only got one because we're
in this deep building I'm gonna open up
this mail app now and actually click
though my gosh y'all are blowing up
Twitter I forgot that my demo account he
is my twitter handle that was bad let me
scroll down there cool here's my mail
from Todd and you can see I have a
couple couple documents here what I'm
gonna do now is just open up some stuff
to get ready to get productive i'm gonna
open up word with a double click because
there's something in there I got to get
to to do and now once that Lowe's member
this is look this is the word universal
mobile app word mobile it's now scaling
this is the one that comes on the phone
it's scaling to look great on this
screen and look all the functionality
respect is there the Welcome Back
messages there with one click it takes
me to our where I was in this document
last right and I want to go back and
open some other stuff so how do i
multitask more PC like experience look
down here my taskbar has my icons like
you'd expect the one that's running is
highlighted like you would expect with
one click on outlook I can jump to that
app and utilize it like you would expect
on a pc except this is actually a what
it's our phone that's right so i'll
double-click powerpoint now to open that
up so i'm getting my stuff ready you got
to get this deck done because Todd's
texting me in the middle of this so it
must be super important and right now I
just want to pause this is pretty cool I
showed you the taskbar but look I can
bring up this task switcher and also
bring that up who's use this task
switcher on Windows 10 right now it
looks the same ok now I'm going to pause
before I do the actual cool office stuff
that i'm going to show you with the copy
and pasting just to prove to you that my
phone is is is powering this we're gonna
cut now to a side-by-side i'm going to
show you while I'm doing this my phone
is still a phone you can see up here I'm
connected to my monitor but look I can
go back to my Start menu I can navigate
things I could open up and start texting
people my actual phone experience is not
broken while I'm utilizing the desktop
experience of continuum and neither is
the one here each experience is in the
independent and uninterruptedly front
but the phone is powering this whole
thing now while I have this open side by
side I want to show you something kind
of cool i talked about the power of
these universal apps how they can scale
the screen sizes watch this right here
on my monitor the phone is pushing the
outlook universal app right watch this
i'm going to open it on the phone and
you're actually going to see it collapse
and scale down to the phone
that's the power of a universal app in
action this app does not care what
screen size it is it just adapts in real
time it looks great what do you think of
that yeah but now I gotta do some stuff
in PowerPoint so let me let me get into
nitty gritty actually show you this I'm
gonna jump over the word cuz I have to
put a table in the middle of this deck
that's what the mail said so look at
this here's word I want to put this
table there guess what I can select it
and even though my phone is powering
this I can use all the keyboard
shortcuts I'm familiar with so actually
on my keyboard now we're going to cut to
a camera you can see my hand make sure
that comes up there I actually want to
do old controls see and guess how I'll
switch how about I try a little bit of
alt tab just to jump over the powerpoint
I'll tab on my phone to switch between
office apps that's insane and I'll just
go ahead and do ctrl-v to paste that
table I am not fitting the purple even
though I'm wearing it so maybe I'm a
little bit of a hypocrite I'm going to
jump to the little slate there and get
the rich formatting at the table the way
that I want it easy to move it into
place okay is that insane the phone is
doing this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
