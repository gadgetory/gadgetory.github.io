welcome to Google licious for everything
Google you could think of the Google
pixel 2 and 2 XL we're riding a wave of
momentum last week initial reviews were
high to Google pop-up shops opened up
over the weekend but the Google pixel
2xl their flagship phone is reportedly
having screen burnin issues now Android
Central's Alex Adobe first reported
seeing faint outlines of the navigation
buttons against a grey background on the
bottom of his pixel 2 XL
that's after about a week of use and
multiple outlets are now reporting the
same thing with their pixel 2 XL phones
now this could be more of an image
retention issue instead of actual screen
burnin but all signs are leaning more
towards burnin and it's not good either
way
now here's Google's official statement
on the issue the pixel to excel screen
has been designed with an advanced P
OLED technology including qhd+
resolution wide color gamut and high
contrast ratio for natural and beautiful
colors and renderings we put all of our
products through extensive quality
testing before launch and in the
manufacturing of every unit we are
actively investigating this report so
they're looking into it because they
better now I'm kind of glad I wasn't
able to get a panda pixel to excel
because they didn't have any and we'll
just have to wait and see how this
resolves itself now there was even a
little controversy before this screen
burnin issue about the pixel to excels
display with report saying that shifted
colors to a slight bluish tint when you
rotate the phone in your hand at a 45
degree angle the LGB 30 had the same
exact thing with its P OLED screen I've
tried the pixel to excel in person and
come on it's really a non-issue to me
because you'll always be looking at your
screen head on then people were
complaining its colors were washed out
and not as vibrant because a lot of you
are used to the saturated look of the
galaxy OLED screens now the colors look
more natural to me most people will only
even see this side-by-side and again
come on it's another non-issue for me
but then most people complaining online
about this are blowing it up and have
never seen the phone in person now in
another official statement from Google
they said we designed the pixel display
to have a more natural and accurate
rendition of colors this year
but we know some people prefer more
vivid colors so we've added an option to
boost colors by 10% for a more saturated
display we're always looking at people's
responses to pixel and we will look at
adding more color options through a
software update if we see a lot of
feedback you know it's never a good
thing when you have to make two
statements in less than a week about
your new phone
now the screen burnin that's a real
issue but these other complaints to me
are just over exaggerations either way
it's been a tough first week for the
pixel too but they didn't make it any
easier on themselves when it came to
they're made by Google pop-up shop now
there's only two in the entire US one in
New York and the other in Los Angeles I
checked out the LA store it looks great
and these two guys were lost daydreaming
but more than a handful of people left
the store without a pixel two or two
Excel phone specifically because they
were only selling the Verizon version of
the phone and not an unlocked one but if
you really wanted one you could sign up
for a three gig prepay plan for 40 bucks
then pay a $20 activation fee and once
you do that you could then pop in your
AT&amp;amp;T or t-mobile chip and use the pixel
- but Sprint still won't work until
their network is upgraded come on who
wants to do that instead of just buying
the phone outright
bottom line come on don't let people who
want to buy a phone from you walk out of
the store that one make it easy I saw
several people who left the line on AT&amp;amp;T
and t-mobile who were ready to buy one
but they didn't because of this so you
combine this with the screen burnin
issues and I'm sorry but that deserves a
Buddha and I know it hurts but it's been
a really bad week for you especially on
launch week and knowing how competitive
the smartphone landscape is you just got
to do better Google in fact they might
have saved some people for more
frustration depending on how this screen
burnin issue plays out now moving on I'm
not a big fan of these let's see what it
takes to destroy a phone because most of
this never really happens in real life
we just want to get some video stream
views but jerry-rigged everything did a
little more sensible test to see how
durable the pixel 2 was deliberately
scratching it in different ways and yes
if you bend it really hard in your hands
it will Bend now the other test by foam
buff is also a little more realistic if
you drop it on its backside it survives
pretty well especially compared to an
iPhone 8 with its all glass back if you
drop the pixel to
on its screen it will crack good to know
and in another pixel to excel story that
is likely to make the rounds 9:00 to
5:00 google has found that the top
speaker on the flagship phone is about
10 decibels quieter than the bottom
speaker now they discovered this by
using a noise meter app on an iPhone and
an Android app that allows you to
control which speaker sound is played
from for the pixel to excel 9:00 to 5:00
maket earlier heard from their sources
that a pixel to excel Hardware defect
was being fixed where the top speaker at
louder volumes was causing vibrations so
they decided to turn it down with
software now Google also tried turning
down the bottom speaker but it made the
overall max volume level too low overall
for their liking
so tested this out and their tipster was
right on the money the top speaker is
louder than the bottom one 2/3 now no
this is not a deal-breaker but you know
what it's just another thing to add to
the list of annoying little things
happening around the pixel to excel
right now lesson making phones is as
easy all and I sure as hell can't do it
all right that's it for this week you
can email me at Google issues at
cnet.com or tweet me at Brian Tong
thanks so much for watching we'll catch
y'all next time for some more of that
