tonight's commanding this concludes
operations former one spacecraft ID 253
and on behalf of the entire mer project
we'd like to thank the DSN for over 15
and a half years of outstanding support
from launch until tonight that support
has made is one of the reasons why this
mission has been so successful and once
again the DSN has helped us to make
history
thank you and the station for today on
behalf of the network thank you for your
comments and thanks for all of us 14 you
are released and poor thank re mer
project Austin this is a celebration of
so many achievements and I'll just start
by saying you know when this little
rover landed the objective was to have
it be able to move 1,100 yards and
survive for 90 days on Mars 90 Souls and
instead here we are 14 years later after
28 miles of travel and today we get to
celebrate the end of this mission so
it's it's an honor for me as the NASA
Administrator to come out here to this
amazing facility with so many amazingly
talented people to say thank you for
your great work not just for our country
but for the science that people are
going to be benefitting all over the
world they're gonna be benefiting from
this science for years to come and so
now I'd like to take the opportunity to
introduce the director of the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory Mike Watkins thank
you Jim
spirit an opportunity may be gone but
they leave us a legacy and that's a
legacy of a new paradigm for solar
system exploration a robotic geologist
on Mars and an integrated science and
engineering operations team
all set out together on a mission of
discovery they didn't know what they
would find they didn't know which
direction they would go sometimes from
one day to the next and they made it
work and they made it work longer than
any of us thought possible by both
brilliant scientific deduction of where
to go and brilliant engineering to keep
the Rovers alive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
