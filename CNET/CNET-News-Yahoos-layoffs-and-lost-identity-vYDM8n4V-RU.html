jobs that's about 14% of the company's
workforce this company is sort of
rudderless and struggling to figure out
which direction to go and getting hit it
in all directions of its business
well yahoo began as a web directory it
quickly diversified into several hundred
sites trying to find a foothold as a
search engine mail server and news hub
Yahoo for five six years has been this
company that people keep saying what do
you do right are you in search sort of
but Google is doing that are you in
social they tried to buy Facebook didn't
didn't happen experts say these layoffs
won't affect Yahoo web sites that sees
700 million users a month but too many
consumers it's a non-issue I don't use
yahoo mail at all so it's just not as
cool as Gmail I like Gmail has
everything I need their search isn't the
best but there's still some things that
they're good at rest in peace sort of
unfortunate but it seems like that's the
direction they're heading analysts say
this perception is what could be the
final nail in the coffin Yahoo's
reputation is terrible there's just no
way around it to people around the world
who use Yahoo Mail fine
to people who use Yahoo Sports sites
fine they have plenty of good properties
but as a company and for the people who
work there it's got a bad reputation and
that's not helpful what will a leaner
Yahoo look like we'll find out on April
17th when the company releases its
quarterly earnings statement in San
Francisco I'm Kara Tsuboi cnet.com for
