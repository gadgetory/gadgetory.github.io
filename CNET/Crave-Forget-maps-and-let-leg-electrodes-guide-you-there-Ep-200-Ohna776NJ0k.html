here's what's happening this week on
CNET's crave blog is this the safest
bicycle in the world creator Crispin
Sinclair thinks so the babel bike is
equipped with signaling lights for
changing lanes and braking as well as
rear view mirrors and a loud horn much
like a standard car the custom-made
safety seat is easily adjustable for
comfort and is protected with a roll
cage seat belts and steel foot
protectors the bicycle is a hybrid and
comes with a 250 watt shimano electric
motor to assist the rider with the range
of 50 to 80 miles which is wow there are
so many safety features in this bike and
all sorts of bells and whistles so I
won't list them all here but you can
read more about the Babel bike on the
crave blog and check out their
crowdfunding page on IndieGoGo where
they are trying to raise a flexible
funding goal of 74 thousand dollars the
Star Wars hype machine is in full effect
it was difficult for me to totally
ignore the Star Wars rally that was held
yesterday and of course I watched the
new Star Wars trailer five or six times
but this is taking it to a whole new
level japan's all nippon airways plans
to dress up their 787 dreamliner jets
like r2d2 promote their new service
between japan and houston texas chances
are you might see a giant are two planes
soaring high above the earth this fall
if you'd like a chance to ride on an
r2d2 plane well you just have to buy a
ticket from houston to japan
Elon Musk is all about renewable energy
recycling and saving the planet so why
not build rocket boosters that land
themselves on a drone barge that can be
reused instead of just letting them
crash into the ocean sounds like a good
concept but it's easier said than done
on Wednesday space X attempted for the
second time to land the Falcon 9 rocket
booster on a drone barge landing pad and
it was a near success according to a
tweet by mr. musk on Wednesday looks
like Falcon 9 landed fine but excess
lateral velocity costed to tip over host
landing the second attempt proved more
successful than the first which hit the
drone barge and exploded almost
immediately this attempt according to
video posted by SpaceX in a few vine
videos the Falcon 9 almost makes the
landing but tipped over at the last
moment
moving your legs in a walking motion
there's an app for that a team from the
University of Hanover in Germany are
attaching electrodes to people's legs
and shocking them in the direction that
they want them to walk using an app and
a smartphone sounds kind of freaky but
it works they attached electrode to the
Sartorius muscle on the leg by giving it
a little shock via bluetooth the muscles
contract and turns the user in the
direction desired operators were
successful at guiding 18 test subjects
through a crowded Park steering them
around obstacles max by for the leader
of the project believes that this
technology can help users find their way
using GPS without having to look at a
phone and may also be used to help
disoriented seniors find their way home
aid firefighters maneuvering through
burning buildings and may even help
direct crowds to their seats at large
