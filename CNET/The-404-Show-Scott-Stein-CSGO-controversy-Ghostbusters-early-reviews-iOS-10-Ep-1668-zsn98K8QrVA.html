July 8 2016 you've decided to download
the 404 show on to your car can you do
it on your car yet in your car do you
think they'd actually decided or did
they just have their RSS automatically
do it for them you shut your mouth Russ
they did it because they wanted to yeah
maybe was like 2005 person listening no
made that decision over the 08 but still
have those legacy subscribers
nevertheless you're being treated to the
wonderful tones of mr. Scott son's voice
what's up buddy what no that was me for
he and talk to you I've not said a
single word I was man oh you weren't I
was the one of the wonderful tone what
wonderful dulcet what is a wonderful uh
the dulcet Stein that's my first album
yeah yeah it's just you in a telephone
book a telephone booth just like
reminiscing about is have a smoking a
cigarette in the rain in a telephone
booth talking to you wanna sell that
book from a telephone booth they were
crazy there's net folks those are the
days netbooks I don't know how myself a
sweetie netbook what's up Scott Stein so
word on his reminiscences from 2004 yeah
word on the street is that you are
living a new bachelor life not that
you've totally left your family and when
abandoned them you ran off to Atlantic
City I'm living that classic Louie
episode where he is like suddenly goes
to the bodega and gets like ice cream
and then gets high and what does he do
you've done all that I know but I
imagine what that I would be that you
should I mean look so here's what cut to
the chase your family's in the UK right
now yeah my family country my family's
in France array I do not have yeah
they're there in uh they're in post
brexit decision UK in it their voters
remorse ridden UK there in an area that
voted to stay however yeah and not
London they were there like in their
country yeah yeah but they're an area
that but I'm not gonna like disclose the
location surrounded by people that
regret their decision essentially yeah
so when they go around in and say the
they Eclipse fifty percent voting so
sorry remains going you remain yeah I
got a guy versus going under fifty
percent like the variance is like what
like seven percent
think was last night yeah I'm so what's
the deal like most of London was like no
let's stay yeah the cities and scotland
and northern iowan voted to remain in
the ue you so was it just lightly
campsites voting no I mean it breaks
down actually pretty similarly to the
breakdown of its only exercise is voting
which is to say everywhere yeah rural
areas red and blue vote Republican in
city areas folk at the back arm use it
feels a little different and i'm not i'm
not an expert at all and talk about
these things at the UK it's like if you
look at the map um you know you have a
London and then I fell like you had
everywhere else whereas here were more
coastal so like we are coast there isn't
another Christmas show there's not
another coastal stronghold like London
on the other side of England not to
mention UK is super small G care it's
really right in compared to the US but
you look at it it's like it did feel
more like a lot of the rest of the
country with like tiny little pockets
but um Reza feel here it's the middle of
the country so anyway your your wife is
British my wifey a dual citizenship dual
citizenship which complicates things
even more family lives out there brother
lives in line makes it easier for her
I'm sure definitely um so she took the
kids and she went to the UK and you are
by yourself I am by myself which happens
about once a year so I don't think
peacefully I this is the wild period I
just go see a movie yeah so people don't
have kids or family may not be able to
appreciate the kind of freedom that sort
of means to someone like Scott uh what
are you just getting home every day and
like get it like if I'm you I get home
every day I just take off all my clothes
wrap myself in newspaper guy free
advertising buy some newspapers and I
wrap myself in the newspaper if I would
take a three hour see that seems like
you're wasting a lot of your time poo I
do it while reading on the phone knowing
normal ever interrupt me I would do
things you know what I do is yeah
this is weird this okay we are not that
weird but I like in living room air with
nice TV and everything you i will in
deccan i will instead not even that i
will go upstairs I do have an upstairs
to like because it's the suburbs I go
upstairs to like with like an iPad and
watch shows up there like crawling into
a little cave well as if like why am i
doing that is this like a learned
behavior or do I feel comfortable
because I don't I'm not as aware that
the house is empty I'm not celebrating
its weird do you normally watch stuff
upstairs on an iPad I do okay you're
saying you I have a TV that's available
yeah I nobody's using our you're more
comfortable upstairs and watch on enough
to do that anyway when the family's home
yeah I yes but I did I just continue so
maybe they just means I'd like I locked
it away that which is your habit you're
just like Shawshank Redemption this is
like that when he comes out of prison
right but you're gonna hang yourself but
aside from like aside from the the
sinning with the with the booze and the
drugs what else are you doing that you
you usually that you find different than
doing what are you cracking up the mute
are you listening to old time rock and
roll wraps like risky business stuff
like what's the deal I'm just like okay
just staying in the city because first
of all I live outside the city so if you
you're not that far though you're not
that far yeah about 40 minutes but it's
enough is another decision if you come
home yeah you're not gonna go back
course not so the biggest change in life
you know like you're getting married and
and we're going to add a moment below so
it's not getting married is having the
kids that's yeah that's that's the
change going from one to two and then
suddenly you can't go out and then I
just feel like that that happens more
often so obviously so I am just making
sure I go out and do things right and so
like what happens is that first of all
the most the saddest thing as I'm
working later is like a great victory
for the work for us because all of a
sudden own to run home so I'm like oh
cool I don't have to go home at any time
so now I'm like leaving the office late
and like that was dumb yeah no I
understand why was that free there's not
a fire under your ass to get home right
always I'm always feeling this deadline
going oh crap game business that Trina
miss that train psych
a couple of days now is working late and
then if someone says anything to me like
hey do you wanna do something now I'm
like oh yeah let's do it I gotta forget
flaky and go with the flow any around
the office i'm just kinda like the next
thing I see in front of my face I'm like
oh yeah drink around the corner oh yeah
wander down to the park do this thing
and so I just kind of go into this fugue
state wander around people and at some
point have to catch a train but I've
seen like what did I see i saw one movie
alone so far which i use h1 visa loan uh
it's like the ultimate see a movie alone
movie The BFG why is that the ultimate
alone move I saw it in Edgewater New
Jersey yeah i know that's a good theater
yet is yeah i went to the mitsuo
japanese a supermarket oh yeah it's
righteous like awesome couple not like a
mile away from them yeah got it Hannah
Sookie tempura bowl this is officially
way to specific right now you know this
is like if you are in that area yeah if
you're the second any ball I wait it's a
popular it was like an eight dollar
movie I don't know why yeah I was like
time travel but I saw out at 3pm right
Tuesday yes like it's like the bfg alone
which I mean it's a kids movie right yes
I'm surprised you saw that it's it also
tanked like it made it no money I could
think of any other movie I wanted to see
cuz all the ones I want to see in May
are gone yeah and now there's like kind
of crap movies yeah Ghostbusters isn't
here yet right and we'll get to that in
a second as well yeah so I saw that
alone and it was like mediocre mmm okay
and then I went out for drinks last
night so you're doing it you're making
the best of your time with no
responsibilities I am going to see and
I'm also trying to see some theater
stuff uh I'm not used to a lot of
theater but now there's that then she
fell which is the kinda another show
that's like sleep no more oh really
where's that yeah so that's in Brooklyn
oh I got my news for well it's I know
but I I'd never get to go to Brooklyn
and so for me it's like new jersey at
Brooklyn is like the antithesis of
jurors I you ask you again Queens is
probably excuse my get new jersey seems
like it's easier that to me at least ya
been like going into deep Brooklyn know
all the bets all the Brooklyn folks left
eventually not all of them but a lot of
people left Brooklyn came to where I
live
New Jersey so it's like Montclair area
like there's a there's a connection
after yeah dude I feel like like that my
neighbors are brothers in park so like
it's yeah it's far do you do this far
it's far but you have to switch train
services and that's what so intimidating
about getting the journey catch path no
you don't just switch trains for path
you do if you need to get to a pad like
most people are not next to a path stop
yeah but it runs right up to go to the
city ya know like it's I'm looking for
weird things like that so this ya get in
trouble get in trouble yeah things like
15 people per show and you go wandering
through this hospital and like alison
wonderland ish type thing oh god they

the other hand clothing today yeah
seriously thanks for wearing clothes too
on the other hand r us fresh do ya
breaking into jail yeah just like
jumping on in there into Supermax I'm
just diving right into the shoe getting
married on Sunday i'm getting married on
something what the hell are you doing
here today you know I thought about it
my fiance took today off
uh and I was like I mean there's like
not I need to buy a belt left that's
what I what I have left to do today
because I did the one other thing
earlier today which ended up being the
most intimate experience I was ever
anticipating for the price of two towers
anyone want to take a guess of what that
was uh intimate thing by yourself or do
by myself for two dollars extremely
intimate uh for two bucks mmm that
usually costs about 75 euro eyelash
cleanse I had my shoes shined ocean sang
god have you ever had your shoes
professionally shine no I'm not a
businessman from the 20 yeah once in an
airport in san francisco right when i
was getting off the plane and going to a
wedding and i thought i should get these
things cleaned up a bit and you're right
it was pretty intimate right so into
week two dollars I was Sean on a snipe
you intend this person i tipped the
person a dollar cuz it was two dollars i
was like that's a good tip just so so I
needed my shoeshine for the wedding
dollars that's all so I this is like a
lot of setup is a total time travel I'm
sure it wasn't late let me laid out so I
live in queens as we all know and I was
looking for a shoe repair place in
queens because I knew I needed to get my
shoes clean didn't shine whatever so
where I live in queens is like a lot of
older russian jews so I called around
and all the older russian jews that i
would call it the shoe repair places
were kind of a little brusk with me
whenever I was like hey so how do your
servers like he's like bring in schooi
clean you cleanly school I was like you
know what I want a little more of a
personal experience yeah so I found a
shoe repair place we can talk if you
want no problems like you want a new
customer you'd think they'd like ham it
up a little bit but now they're they're
not super friendly on the phone but I
found new place right by my work office
on 4039 street and it's a shoe repair
place like been there for a while good
reviews so I went in this morning didn't
know how much was gonna cost mentally
preparing for fifteen dollars yeah I was
gonna say who knows max 20 and I go in
and they've got like the high chairs and
I sit in one of the high chairs and and
the guy who is as it happens also an
older russian
but like friendly enough and he's like
you want massage wait what 10 and
without me even say anything he reaches
over and hits a button on the chair and
the chairs vibrating yeah well its got
like one of those rollers like in
sharper image have Mike you know what I
don't really want this is a little too
much so I turn it off have massage and
then he so they have me where my shoes
which I guess is the only like I
initially brought them in a bag yeah cuz
I'm not wearing sneakers today who chews
on you wanted me to wear the shoes and
when I didn't anticipate is just like
how much you feel through the shoes what
they're doing you feel their fingers
legit like a foot massage that you're
getting from this dude like legit super
like in 10 oh weird i know i was blown
away and I'm like what this feels pretty
good like ice is so weird right and so
I'm like you know this is very end and
it's going on for a while he's putting
on multiple layers they probably last 10
minutes in total that I'm sitting there
getting this personal experience from
this dude he's shining it he's buffing
it he's doing everything and at the end
he's like okay you come down here and
and I was like so how much is it he's
like you pay up there two dollars i was
like what two dollars I was like you
guys how is that how do you cut a profit
on this it's like it was five minutes
with all of five minutes no prob I mean
I guess if you work that out to an
hourly rate decide I like it it's not
like they have like a non-stop to flow
pleasure yeah there was no one in their
egg feet tinkle no problem Eddie to
midtown man it's a block away from Times
Square they could up charge like fifteen
dollars for this service it's great keep
it real but it eats its honestly like
they have not changed the price in fact
you want to do it again and and I'm
gonna be back I'll be back tomorrow what
you did good Russian accent there was
literally amazon Russian I can't even be
right I'm like you like them there was a
literally Momo I was like you know this
is I'm gonna do this more frequently my
shoes look great yeah it felt really
nice and you would you talk about oh I
didn't talk about anything
I thought so it was intimate aside from
the verbal communication it was an
emotionally intimate experience I felt
like bonded invite him to the wedding me
might you know sure you have a dropout
eat my child you check your phone or did
you keep watching uh what was I did I
was watching cuz I wanted to see all the
steps of what he was doing it was it
like a spit shine she was like yeah i
mean he he used windex at one point
which I was all weird but but he also
had polish and then you know they had to
kellie lunney see so let me see him I
don't have them with me damn it sorry
but they do look immaculate um really
really good I two towers crazy eyes get
your shoe shine if you feel intimidated
you know I I realize people maybe have
like social anxiety about sitting in the
big chair and the airport as you said
we're in a shoe repair place but chances
are if you look down it like your dress
shoes that you might go to a wedding and
stuff like that they probably look like
garbage it is amazing what a showing how
much better they look after you get you
shot I'm very uncomfortable with the
notion of shoe shining I don't like how
it looks you think I like a class thing
I say it's very it's that's such a class
thing for me especially like I see yes
they do it so at CES if you've noticed
like right outside our booth you ever
been no thank you shining at shoe
shining right outside Arbroath up
against the wall where the bathroom is
and we're yeah and you're just like oh
like this I feel like I don't know
people shouting sure they just like
throw the money at him why take the
money of filthy on yeah but you're the
one not even giving them any money
you're just judging it silently you know
I'm two dollars is crazy hours they
could pay for their Christmas dinner now
haha no I'm saying like it's a little
ridiculous to be like this is a bad
thing I mean it's their job they have a
job no I know I don't bother me it's
weird huh I would say it was a great
experience I highly recommend that
anyone else and I might leave my
soon-to-be wife for this man he's got
magic fingers sorry Alex I met somebody
you know shines a good damn shoe it's
but I spoke to the heart I'd what a
great eye shine death 77 betters of feet
it's a 14 and a good day
are like what u gz it's where you hunted
down the place to look like they're just
waiting for like people do all that well
I mean there are not a ton of shoe
repair place yeah in the city that's
true so just like one thing they do is
like it's like tightening your eyeglass
yeah well you can get like your heat
like if you're a woman and you're
wearing heels you can get your EQ a man
or a man you get hoping that he'll fixed
yeah but it is so much like real estate
of the actual store is like dedicated to
these chairs got good for them and they
somehow have some rent-controlled real
of like an upsell unlike other stuff
that they were selling like umbrellas
also too weird like penn station photos
yeah i wanted to use the penn station
one but i would-wouldn't yeah what about
it I just don't want to sit in that
throne I'd like I need an overcoat an
umbrella yeah to sit like Daniels shoe
repair on thirty-ninth I'm gonna plug
them how about that sick free plug for
them I'm finding a weird sort of like
craft place like that you know what I
mean like some weird odd job ensuring on
Yelp is always such a weird thing we
like read people who take the time to
write a review of a shoeshine play yeah
like what the hell's going on Carol you
know like why'd you take all that time
to write about Daniel's huge it just
made me think of like how does a company
like you know the companies that sell
after shave for four hours and it lasts
you for six years like how do you cut a
profit I don't know it's crazy it's a
good question repeat business yes volume
never people oh you later we below
sometime after the shape all years I'm
coming back you'll be back alright so
before we hit some of the new stories or
stories rather that we outline for the
show I want to get to some voicemails
that we have from last week in response
the stuff we talked about when Peter ha
was here um let's listen to Larissa
talking about Tesla she has a Tesla she
talked about it I don't know if we went
too much into the autopilot stuff a
little bit but she kind of clears the
air as of what exactly is going on in
that thing hey guys its Larissa from
Houston I was listening to last week's
episode where you were talking about
Tesla and you cut lots of conversations
about the autopilot but I just wanted to
chime in in terms of how autopilot
autopilot is my partner and i have a
model s p85 z and we use the autopilot
we just use it this weekend we had a
trip from Gleason to dallas which is
about five hours and so we use the
autopilot for a lot of the time while we
were on the highway because it's just an
open you know highway there's not that
much traffic and it just made things a
lot easier however anytime that you're
using the autopilot every few minutes
the autopilot actually be to you and you
have to put your hands on the steering
wheel and like it has to register that
you're touching that and that you're
interacting with it or the autopilot
shuts off so there's no way that you can
just go for hours and hours on autopilot
it actually requires that you interact
with it like I think five minutes but
don't quote me on that but it's about
every five minutes it'll defeat and you
have to put your hands on the steering
wheel and kind of jiggle it or something
so that it knows that you're still there
so like the video of the guy that was
asleep and traffic like that you know a
lot of people had a lot of controversy
about that whether or not that was like
a doctored video or whatever the case
may be from my experiences and maybe
there's some way to override it I really
got it but that guy couldn't have been
asleep for more than like a couple of
minutes or else it would see feet deep
and require him to interact with it so I
just wanted to chime in and let us show
okay thanks for the voicemail i was
really interesting scroll that did
honestly was open up a couple more
questions for me which is to say well so
before you get to that yeah he did
follow up with another one and say I
mean we were kind of joking around but
we suggested the notion that like you
could just pop in a GPS address into the
Tesla pop your kid him and send him her
like now it doesn't work like that we we
kind of figured that but but I
definitely uh no more about autopilot
than I did before okay so here's a
question yet that brought up to me let's
say you're using autopilot on the
highway and it beep beep beeps and you
don't touch the steering wheel what hand
wash yeah because they pull over to the
side of the highway me like to see if
you're when it check to see if it's not
gonna just turn off yeah cars not just
gonna stop or like oh like spin out or
maybe that's unlike real autopilot
engages I mean if that's the one you
need you need someone to be driving so
we would have to literally pull over to
the side of the highway to be the only
safe scenario I yeah but there's not
always a safe place to pull over so that
is a good question like what happens
yeah maybe it's they're talking to like
alert people nearby that the like person
is not touching it also i feel like
people would are going to invent like a
fake hand to just like latch onto your
stealing steering wheel so i can just
nah man needs a pulse yep but like what
about a kiss style it probably does but
what about like the stylist that like
you know works with the touchscreen yes
that's the thing or you could like I or
someone to like touch your steering
wheel over love we're gonna say Scott I
just had warm fake and that's all i'd
offer deeper all it is is a weird thing
it's weird well it's really just an
assistive but it is weird it's weird
that it exists i've only one gone for
one ride with autopilot on a tesla rent
yeah I'm then I've only satin 1 i've
never been in one in motion it's bizarre
he just casually was like hey he gave me
right to we went to jets-giants game
last year and he was like happen have a
tesla and he's like okay cool let's go
for our show you here's autopilot and I
was like this is actually happening on
the road like wow this is I mean it's
it's kind of a more advanced version of
what happens with like a proximity
awareness I feel like yeah cars were you
know let you know if you're too close so
you can lane change except in this
instance it makes the lane change but
only on when you're moving on highways
where the where the lanes are there like
it wouldn't doesn't work any sort of
residential situate it works obviously
you're staying on the same highway for a
very long time but if you're looking to
take exit that's not gonna sounds like
that's right i fused by dis kinda like
and i only saw once in action was i
guess it's like
only gonna put you forward right it's
not gonna make turns its know it's only
a lane change yeah so so it does it
change lanes yeah yeah that's what so it
I mean it'll it'll keep you in the lane
and will also change lanes and that's
the part that's crazy I would not move
yeah I wouldn't want to do that that's
weird um but I like the idea of a
feedback awareness thing where you know
when you're driving it'll give you a bee
but like they already do to let you know
if you're too close to something yeah to
help you get into Lane just in case
there's a blind spot but then the
problem is you start relying on it and
it fails goes weird then you know it's
it's just like when you have a backup
cameras and then you don't make sure to
just turn around and just double back
from all your angles because you just
get reliant all you can do like a speed
thing or you have a background you know
the camera looped the video feed loop
that Mike didn't state didn't exactly ah
spyhunter it felt like spyhunter
actually yeah a little bit so my dad
just got a new car you got a new caddy
and the last one he had i think was like
a 2013 or 2014 yeah uh and this one's a
2016 and the amount of accident
awareness prevention tech in that short
amount of time has skyrocketed this
thing beeps if you if you change a link
if you start if you have your blinker on
yeah they're very BP they're very BP
they interrupt the the audio on the
radio yeah um they'll they'll be like
now don't don't go in that Lane you
can't use the R it's not safe it's not a
safe move don't do that another thing I
guess is not well maybe this but it is
part of that safety feature set so when
he was backing out of the driveway he
but he drove me into hoboken on Tuesday
morning we backing out of the driveway
it looked like the angle of the car was
a bird's eye view what yeah so like he's
backing out and you in the in the view
looked like he was like what 20 no way
yeah it looked like it was 20 feet above
is costing a virtual recreation so what
they do is they laid on the map yes oh
no has so it's not the map but what they
do is they must so there's cameras that
cover 360 degrees around the car right
okay
sensors set no cameras really as we saw
like the sidewall no mailbox like
therefore is so there's 360 degrees were
the cameras I'm sure it's maybe like
five or six cameras sure can't be that
and they stitch an image together and I
guess they just sort of like are able to
just make it look like it's looking down
on my god cuz like you could tell where
the butt of the quare that rear bumper
was eating the world they you're like oh
we're just about to cross over the
street like you know my god that's
amazing I I feel like my dad didn't
realize how cool it was till I explained
like nutrition was happening there like
there's no camera up there like you
realize there's not a drone following
your cars no idle turtleneck like what
it's google maps right they got like no
that's not other words like you shine
your shoes turtle the clouds like a
camera a nice so there's that and like
there and then even when you're going
forward mind-blowing yeah even when you
put the car and drive down start moving
with this is brilliant they show you the
front for a little bit because when you
when you when you first drive away you
can't see or something right now he is
like a cat or there's a cat or a
squirrel or a baby yeah you know like
lets me read babies get a workout watch
out for the street babies say babies I
know they are a thing uh you know babies
you can choose you a little bit of
inside of what's going on around all
four tires of the card all that stuff is
optional right uh I don't know I want it
there's no way that comes standard I'm
kind of not cheap car like feel like
yeah it might be 2012honda and crv it
has a backup camera right shoe sitter
fancy which is all I did read is going
to be standard in every car ever oh
right I'll by 2018 I want to say that's
all i have is back up camera and i got
cameras cutie but yeah the cameras great
yeah it's very cute i feel like my car
is now like disconnected from the world
compared all these advanced cars oh yeah
I I feel like I bet technological blind
spots yeah I'm paired to thee I guess I
mean a 60 camera car it's just like I
couldn't believe it like this like going
from power window or like manual windows
the power that kind of a jump is is like
shocking the amount of stuff that's
available in that car
so I a thought that's pretty cool I want
to do one more voicemail this is uh our
buddy talking about I guess we could
call it like airplane boarding hacking
yeah well we're talking about etiquette
airplane etiquette last week right oh
nice which which got into a bit of a
feedback here let's listen to this
voicemail hey for for this is a la from
Nick finished up less except said about
the airplane thing gots to comment first
one is 15 over my kids I got a gun and
airplane first it just takes longer plus
does any of you hear me I know people
aren't I want to sit there they don't
want to be my feet by my screams get
that makes travel by myself I am the
last person on the airplane oh yeah even
if i have a check back just like you
said Jeff curbside check or web points
I'd check it's free it's great also look
up with a little board uses any up and
nem any extra empty sheets if they're
extra seat to the last one on board to
consider anywhere you want exit row find
out first class b shirt anywhere you
want nobody outstanding question this is
like hop into the the first last night
nobody here nobody here don't head can
you can you they really show you like
how many seats are open on a plane I'll
when I flew version 2 l.a weird they
they let you change your seat up until
like the second you get on Oh crazy but
because they want to keep it up up pay I
think they want you to all pay and they
also like want you to be able to change
your seat like they give you they could
see them the illusion of choice try that
yes you should although that's the thing
like not too often am I on a plane where
there's like more than one empty seat I
mean it it depends on when you flogged
us a and if you're fine airport and
we're flying like the busiest airports
in the country during the busiest times
and yeah or like that's what it is I was
so seeing I was thinking like how first
I thought how nice of that guy like if
he's flying alone he's last on the plan
what he don't know that all I do it all
the towel really I don't I don't I mean
I rush to get on but I don't I'm not
like know everybody else go on I'll be
less but then I thought oh there's
something in it for him yes kid wasn't
doing it generous know and also I hate
being the passenger we're like you're
you know you think everyone's on the
plane you got that comfort level where
you're like there might be an empty seat
here yeah and then you got like that
he's that person the last person to get
on the plane and he was like mins your
20
like cherry picking is that someone's
gotta be the last one on the plane but
like we have those five left that that's
like them people coming right before a
show don't be that guy I don't know
about that any care about how late you
get on the plane like you at some point
you wanted I never not wait too long how
about this I'm never the last one on the
plane we're like no one has gotten on
right before me do you mean like yeah
not you know waiting around right you're
right now waiting around that's
something you don't want to be that
pretty I don't want to be the guy
resisted oh but I'll be right there
right just making sure i got the prime
seat options you know what I mean that's
a dick move no we're not a prob wanna
try just randomly singing in a business
class there at the very own odor and
just being like certainly to say oh
sorry I didn't realize sir get the hell
out i mean they will instantly stop you
and that's sort of what i was wondering
was like if you sit in a bulkhead are
they gonna like i'll bet they would
maybe say like is this your sheet you
have to pay thirty dollars extra if you
want to sit here you bring a cash just
be like what if I just gave you yeah no
one's using the seat advice give you
like 50 m will you just bribe them yeah
yeah exactly I'm into that you want this
book do you want to you all my girl
my bag i bought this copy of wired how
about this get some candy uh i bought
this copy of seen at the magazine it's a
that's right we've seen that magazine is
a i can either hit you over the head
with it or you can take it as a bribe
it's up to you sir check out this issue
let me sit here ah so ghostbusters is
quickly approaching by the time you
listen to our show next week it'll be
already out in theaters yes super views
are not out the embargo fur reviews is
sunday by we are getting up we're
getting some some fields were you not we
know some people that have gone to
screenings and the general vibe is a
positive one um I haven't heard anyone
that was like gangbusters over the moon
crazy about it but some Buster's for
Ghostbusters gangbusters a good headline
but the yeah so far it sounds pretty
positive um so I'm kind of encouraged I
know Jeff didn't love spy but I actually
quite like spy and if it if it comes
close to that I'll be thrilled spy I
actually watched spy half watch spy with
my mother-in-law again on Saturday night
or sorry huh yeah why would you watch it
again if you didn't also i was on a
laptop
doing stuff and she was just watching
the movie yeah and I kind of looked up
there's there's plenty of scenes in the
movie that are not that like Jason
Statham actually is kind of hilarious
that movie yeah um and what's his name
Zack woods from Silicon Valley is really
funny has a funny little cameo yeah uh
have you seen you haven't seen Scott no
no I want to I worth checking out it's
good it's it's a silly movie um can I
wanna watch the rest of freaks and geeks
yeah do that act is also good anyway
much like five of those episodes people
have seen it Patton Oswalt tweeted out a
couple days ago just on early screening
of ghostbusters it's fun it's scary it's
terrific stayed till after the credits
well that's good to know that I was a
what are they call stinger stinger oh
that's a name okay I think so ah bonus
bit I didn't stick around the end of bfg
for the stinger someone else someone
else weeded who claims to have seen the
film Jennifer Brett I'm not familiar
with who she is I just saw the new
Ghostbusters I liked it better than the
original and I saw the first one like 75
times when tag I ain't afraid that is a
bold statement that is double G to say
but hey if you liked it better than the
original tell people how yeah if you've
seen it that many times you you know
exactly we had someone right in on the
Beast cast 34 year old from Australia
had never seen ghostbusters sure they're
like do I even do it like oh yeah you
obviously see the film yeah uh I was
more curious to hear that person's
impressions like if you if if 34 year
old Jeff you'd say I'm same age this guy
like if I saw goes with a versa I can't
even wrap my head around what it would
mean like I can't I can't understand I
think most of the humor is not timely so
which is to say timeless so I think it
would work for someone watching it I
know but like if I maybe there's a movie
from the 80s that I've never seen I'm
sure there's plenty yeah that like maybe
has that kind of a legacy that maybe I
should watch for the first time and sort
of see what's that vampire movie with
Kiefer Sutherland oh yeah miss lost boys
boys around that time I've seen that you
know maybe just because I've seen back
to the future a lot too but I not seen
Ghostbusters in a handful of years and
we just saw it the other day here at the
office like they were playing it late at
night just I stuccos my partner
you freedom how resistant random watch
ghostbusters in the office weird it's
like that's what happens when you're
older and would you think you're for the
first time in a while uh it's still held
up so well two things were it's also
very funny yeah it's super funny yeah
it's also like really nicely paced
sci-fi action movie yes and um it has in
a good way an old look like you forget
that the city has like a lot of boxes
very old school new york great news i'll
yeah yeah and even more so i feel like
that other movies that error maybe cuz i
don't know i'm thinking about like a
Back to the Future to me as a as a more
polished look to it you know
Ghostbusters has a grittier there is a
great yeah there's like a dime film
original unreal shot a lot of shot
obviously in New York itself yeah okay
but there's movies that came out right
around that time ghost was also shot in
Canada bunch yeah obviously they but
they shot you know at alum bia in the
library and i also forgot about the dan
Aykroyd being being seduced in the dream
oh here we just talked about let's
forget what was weird about help getting
undone yeah what's weird about that as
is that a dream sequence within a
montage yes it's not a dream sequences
it is it's a dream sequence in a Monta
no I don't know natural is real I don't
think it's a dream what makes you think
is he's sleeping yes i know i don't
think so cuz they have less fuzzy wavy
they did play chimes during it that give
you that sort of dream i do not make
it's a dream see but i think that's
really i think it's real oh oh oh wait
oh wait i think it's a dream i think he
might be right rip baby cuz they show
he's a dream cuz he doesn't wake up
after no but they show him like turn
over and fall out of bed yeah your kids
wait so something it was a weird man i
could have asked him last week I had
Ivan Reitman right in front of it out
again yeah it's like what what is it
going to buy by the by mr. Wrightman it
felt like a dream sequence anyway I felt
like are there other montages that have
that had like things that fell like
dream sequences within them yeah that's
a weird one that was the weird part of
ask well anyway
that was like it struck me about
Ghostbusters more than anything seeing
it is but it is the most blue joke in
the entire movie so that's probably why
it stood out to you like the rest of the
movie is relatively tame when it comes
to like sexuality and stuff right
although it is I don't know there's some
scenes with Dana Barrett they get kind
of hot and she's wearing like you know
whatever loose lingerie close its yeah
but but that's like a legit blowjob
scene like a legit look at sea in a
pg-13 movie I think that's a PG movie is
it pj was sort of in that period of like
well like i was allowed I don't think
there was a pg-13 actually when it came
down you might be right um but it held
up really well I felt grab that Ernie
Hudson's final line like the one moment
he gets is I love those a town which is
like not a strong lot like town it just
felt like the wrong oh no I kind of I
think I loved Ernie Hudson and I loved
it but I wanted to even better line I
wanted something even more punch with
you like more let's let's really work
that I don't know it's like I love this
town I think the idea like that okay
something I like that he calls it a town
I do I just wanted to be hmm well this
was like your here's what I'm in that
mode Geronimo his character is such a
like a downtempo like she'll character
compared to everyone else the everyman
he's the everyman he's like very kind of
low-key so I think the idea is showing
him with his burst of emotion it's books
but it's a nice mode is the nice moment
that's I think the I wanted more of him
and then that's great he's such a late
arrival I felt like I forgot that when I
saw the movie you know come into like
fifty percent through and they were just
feeling a lot like what were they trying
to do it that's just not at another
ghost buster that's what I couldn't
figure out i watch is it it was like
business was booming if we just have one
more employee was that we've got an
extra program proton pack will grow by
likely speaking at like a bunch of
employees it was like if she'd had one
more it would really round it all out
yeah just felt like we're like you
should they should have done like a
bunch of hiring yeah like double this
apparently that's what the third
ghostbusters was gonna be about that
franchising that yeah okay anyway enough
with that because next week the reviews
will officially be in and maybe we could
talk to jordan hoffman
sure has seen it or we'll see it very
soon let's talk about Pokemon go Pokemon
stop seriously if you can't get online
so I I know nothing about Pokemon I know
like three of them so what is pono three
pokemon yeah what are they uh squirtle
yep yep Pikachu you and like bal basore
huh you don't even know it's Bulbasaur
Bulbasaur and then lobster face ok
Charmander you know him try sloppy joe
sloppy joe very popular sharma jarred
urge you loved by all yeah because my
duck who side up no you don't know who
that is that app is there Snorlax
Snorlax seems like a Sesame Street I am
Snorlax I don't know anyone guy
fair enough see you could make up a
Pokemon name now and be reasonably have
a twenty percent chance and I think so
with injury for your cereal I believe it
could be real spelt spelt yeah there's a
great public bread yeah spell tea um so
Pokemon go came out on mobile this week
sort of sort of it came out on Android
and iOS and it launched actually I think
it launched what was it two nights ago
yeah during ghostbusters when I was
watching ghost bust while you're
watching go supposed to actually very
appropriate and and what the hell is it
basically it's an augmented reality game
where you walk around your neighborhood
and you'll get alerts on your phone
being like hey there's a pokemon nearby
and you pull out your camera and through
the camera you'll see obviously your
environment but you also see a Pokemon
in that environment oh so that's I've
seen people doing so you see photos of
people were going to be like a pokemon
like I took one of Charmander like on
the edge of the subway platform looking
like he's about to fall off so that's
where I saw the charming does it work
does it does it work well it works okay
so you would you do then you take a
photo of them oh you throw pokeballs at
them to try to capture them any idea is
to capture as many as you can and then
you gotta catch them all and to get more
pokeballs you have to like walk around
to different nearby like spa to sink
this doesn't seem safe especially man it
seems super unsafe
I really do not encourage the spots or
molar walking or big landmarks general
yeah it'll be like a police station or
like Chucky approaches a lot of torches
you know walk inside yeah you don't have
to walk inside you just walk past it I
guess son of a bitch all right so but
it's broken it's yet no one can log in I
tried logging in you couldn't like it
worked like a username I've gotten in
like twice but in how are you born um it
yeah it's bad and for the people that
have been able to get in it's sort of
coming to the obvious realization that
like the game is not super great like a
one-trick pony yeah you're not doing
anything with the Pokemon you're just
collecting them it's like oh I found
this one yeah but are you generally take
over basis I haven't even gotten I don't
there might be but I don't actually know
actually Saigon sorry to plug but
polygon has an explainer of like to all
the mechanics see we did write a little
bit too but yeah you guys did in we
Australia are seen her Australia group
had done a little yeah and and people
were over the like going crazy like
trying to figure out how this game works
for that presumably there are people
that can still play it but yeah it's
apparently not a great game um but you
know I think there you have the benefit
of being very social friendly which is
to say like for the last few days you've
seen a lot of foot I saw someone take a
photo like outside a plane wing and like
Bulbasaur was on the plane wing that's
kind of cool which was pretty funny a
little Twilight Zone moment yeah
Bulbasaur way i wasn't i mean the the
issue that i have is like nintendo more
and more like as they release more and
more these mobile games it's just like
totally destroying their reputation as a
game making company well they're somehow
unpolished they are it was a buggy it
was a third party but they license now
published in Pokemon to a third party
and approved it like bacon nintendo
could have said like no this is garbage
we're not publishing this it's how
people start thinking of the brand
because they may not even played the
game right now they're like pokemon
equals this weird unwrapped you
automatic really mietek Nanta collabs
the one that made this also previously
made ingress which is that um android
thing right android thing in iOS now
where you capture territory in a lot of
ways its own pokemon go is kind of an
ingress with
yes right because there are basis it's
kind of a similar idea yeah so trying to
be more appealing but that's the thing
is that i found the login really
problematic because particularly this is
meant to be a social spontaneous game
yes so it's meant to be like oh let's
look around I'm not gonna look around if
i cant freakin log on that happens to me
four times i'm not using yet exactly
there's gotta be on board already like i
did the magic I was kind of into it but
not anymore is there some sort of game
where you can like paint things in in AR
and then like have people find them
probably like a geocaching art that'd be
cool epica that there might be there
other will or we just invented yeah good
work Jeff let's go make it for tango
let's go do it for your tango phone yeah
I like it I had a really interesting
periscope experience the other day can I
say one thing is that you can see live
things final coded to Pokemon yeah I
actually fact like I found a real life
Pokemon but it was a squirrel there's a
turtle squirrel it was an owl when I was
walking when I was walking to work uh it
was a new jersey yeah there's no I'm
saying here uh yeah exactly i was like
just walking in along the tree there was
a by the tree near me I it was like a
branch hanging over me and I was like oh
there's some feathers I almost walked
into it and I was like what is this is
somebody throw like a hat or a furry hmm
feathery toy into a tree this can't be
real and then I saw was like wings full
yeah I put a picture on music on Twitter
and cuz i found this thing i didn't know
what to say so I just said hello is what
he say to an owl probably nothing it's
an advisor now I'd be like yeah by the
way if you search al sounds on google it
also gives you plenty of other towns
wait the google soundboard I never knew
about this yeah yeah apparently
yeah I can do it got any deep cuts Oh as
loud this is a nupe design ever
discovered this partnership always
something whoa okay a bowhead whale
makes this sound wait let me try it I
wanted to see how close I can get that's
the sound I made to the owl he was
featured in BioShock yeah so I went I
just said hello and then the owl turned
around and just stared at me between the
leaves is like I'm supposed to be
sleeping now right with us freaked out
looking look like a baby and I want to
make sure is OK I tweeted with like a to
my local news area site i just said what
do i do I did you train it way way way
way he said you all you just waited to
see w11 that's a turbulent to Briston
net which is like the local news II
website okay and they're like did you
call and I did not call animal control
animal control um when I could and I
felt awful about it when I came back
home I walk down the street looking with
a flashlight see if i could find the owl
make sure is OK the owl was gone um but
it but was there a little like chalk
outline of an owl on the ground but I
felt like the moment I'm gonna put it up
somebody said did you throw a Pokeball
added or something cuz it felt like a
wild like a wild Ali appeared er um
whatever the name is Oh rowlett is the
new owl rowlett it's one of this new
starters come on between you and me yes
you know too many polka mins that's
probably accurate I call them polka man
i know you're you're my son loves polka
man's yeah they're cool it's all the
cards so let me tell you about my
horoscope oh yum moment I don't use
periscope really not really log in to
periscope or watch people's periscope
unless it's something kind of cool
happening there's this band I like ok
they're called balance and composure
sure and scream oh no well no a little
anymore uh so hey I introduce you some
good stuff a couple weeks have a Shannon
um so then had a record in like four
years and people are starting to be like
what's up with this band like rumors
that they were playing new stuff when
they were touring so all of a sudden a
Tuesday night they tweet something out
and they tweet a periscope thing out and
I go in and I'm like oh it just happened
to catch me at the right time I saw at
my feet I hit play and it's like
a still camera facing a flower vase okay
and the flowers are like they look kind
of shitty they look like a little dead
but they're like vibrating so now so I
don't know if the guys like throwing a
fan on it or whatever yeah or he's like
using like a speaker to make them
vibrate with bass or something like that
so in the background though there's like
really creepy Silent Hill esque piano
playing and like I'm like oh my god it's
a weird video these guys as far as I
know have nerve never periscope it's the
they're putting out this really creepy
vibe everyone so there's like 300 people
watching it everyone's like it's just a
new album is this the new album what's
going on what's going on and like it was
really fun okay i'm watching this thing
I'm I look it's already been 10 minutes
and like we're still all watching this
weird creepy yeah flower vase with the
piano playing and then all of a sudden
like a ball rolls through the screen
like whoa what was that was actually
record what was that what was oh my god
well you can kind of tell like
somebody's monitoring cuz there's like a
few shadows ka in the point of view of
the camera and like after like 15
minutes of Mike I'm freaking watching
this stupid ass yeah let's go 15 minutes
people are chatting like what's going on
and then finally right at the 20-minute
mark a little sign comes from the top of
the frame and it just says tomorrow whoa
so I was like all that was cool what
happens to my sauces and then they wound
up debuting like the announcement of the
record and stuff okay that like I don't
know I was like that's a great way to do
it like that's cool it definitely played
into the horror stuff I love with like
Silent Hill yeah and PT and stuff like
that but I was again good job guys that
was really rad yeah that's not bad it's
not a big thing marketing patients to
the totally disturb building it up and
like they peaked at like four hundred
viewers and by the time the 20 minutes
and they were only down like 175
mr. boat on relief asian you know like
who's gonna watch this for 20 minutes
but raising people I think next Facebook
live is just gonna be vibrating flowers
and puppets it's not a bad idea man I
want to do that it works it apparent I
love that that's like indie theater it
is it was art and its finest I kept
writing I'm like is this art uh all
right before we say goodbye for the week
Russ brought the attention of the story
up and it's a crazy story you know the
cs go thing yeah right it's about a game
called counter-strike you've heard of it
this actually requires a fair bit of
setup but I will get through it as
quickly you not you know what you want
to pump no I think it's interesting okay
so there's this game called
counter-strike which you guys maybe from
a very popular shooting game of course
it's um the original came out like back
in two thousand as a mod and it's a mod
of half-life and this new version came
out around two thousand eight I think
more recent maybe 2007 whatever yeah it
since become like one of the biggest
eSports games in the world very very
popular competitive very competive and
they recently well not that recently but
they added a system wherein if you play
the game at random intervals you'll be
rewarded with keys inside the game and
you use these keys to unlock skins
weapon skins in the game they very
popular idea very popular mechanic in
online yeah multiplayer games yeah now
it's worth noting that the skins do not
give you any advantage they just look
cool cosmetic their cosmetic but they
some of them are extremely rare and
valve the owner the creators of
counter-strike and they own steam allows
you to sell skins that you find for real
money so there's an actual economy based
on the rarity of these switches
bloomberg reported was worth 2.3 billion
dollars in 2015 it not at all surprising
because a considers there's zero
overhead and I'm sorry that was also
like the gambling aspect yeah so we're
gonna get into that so you have all that
baseline now you need to know that some
of these skins sell for upwards of two
and three thousand dollars apiece again
that's got a skin for a gun a weapon
skin for a gun two and three thousand
dollars
swallows you feel like I could just go
out and do anything this week goodbye
you have two weeks to try any of my
frivolous activities don't add up to
that I've got a friend Brian who works
at polygon his son spent his allowance
on a weapon skin on a knife skin for
sixty dollars for CSKA for CS co so what
kind of skin was it it was like a rusty
I asked Brian he was like it just looked
like an old rusty knife like it didn't
even look special for sixty dollars so
Miley upsetting so I clearly don't have
had so we have all that background apply
some csgo keeping all that in mind
websites have come out and they're
called lotto sites counter-strike lotto
sites and one of these is called ciesla
a csgo lotto and the idea is you put all
of your skin's or a certain a number of
skins into a pile and other people put
their skins into a pile and essentially
the site flips a coin and somebody walks
away with everything your that's a
gamble that's a gamble now there's I'm
not a hundred percent sure of where the
money gets made and like how do you
transfer it in I'm we don't have to get
into that but you can do it yeah you can
do it essentially there's a way to like
link your steam account got you these
sites so these sites exist is there's a
number of them they make a lot of money
because again there's no overhead it can
just like we do with with reckless
abandon now with all that in mind
there's a few youtubers one of them in
particular this guy called tmartn who is
very very popular I don't know how many
subscribers he has you might want to
check but it's I think it's at least
five million subscribers she's very he's
one of the biggest gaming uh yeah it's
funny that all the links are to this
news story I've got 3.2 million
subscriber point two million subscribers
which is a pretty stash send me a few of
his videos before uh no that's not it
that's not the guy I said you oh no I
thought cuz he plays a lot of Lockheed
he does play a black ops as well so um
he a couple years ago months ago started
putting out videos and one of the videos
it's him basically like hey so this
company called csgo lotto came out and
they reached out to me to like do a kind
of like give away with weapon skins so
we're gonna go check it out i think the
sites really cool i love using it it's
but you can unlock tons of really cool
stuff right so we're just going to do
this stream of meet Ron
like wind stuff all right well I follow
ut-martin right and you have 3.2 writing
subscribers are you did I'll go to that
site you know what you're talking about
I think the title of the video was like
win thirty thousand dollars in five
minutes okay playing CS colada or
something to something to that effect um
so that happened and then just a couple
a week or so ago this another youtuber
basically did some digging and found out
that this guy tmartn and another
youtuber who is doing the same thing own
csgo lotto they are president and vice
president of the website csgo lotto that
they had been promoting but secretly
they actually own the site so they were
essentially using their delivery of the
3.5 million subscribers as a way to
promote this other business we're going
I'm pretty sure is illegal which is
illegal as I understand it you need to
disclose any potential conflicts of
interest you also need to be very
careful about promoting this stuff for
minors one of the big issues and why
this stuff's really scummy is because a
lot of the people as i mention with
Brian's son that are using these sites
and spending this money our kids
effectively it's a gambling site for
it'd be like a kid signing onto a slot
machine site because this stuff is worth
real money right and you have kids
essentially gambling so you're promoting
this gambling site and you know separate
of the fact that you did not disclose
the fact that you own this site and
you're clearly financially benefiting
from this I mean they were acting like
there was no relationship rather than
site asked me to do they were once I k %
be no I'm a CEO yeah oh my god it's
crazy it's crazy nuts um so if people
found out about this it was a huge blow
back against these people tmartn put up
like a really apology video
which was since taken which was since
taken down and it's just like a total
mess and honestly what's crazy to me
about all this stuff is that it's
nothing specific to these guys a lot of
youtubers do some really shady a
lot of them are totally cool and do fine
I would say most of them are totally
cool do fine but a lot of them
shady and do not highlight um you
know where they're getting money from
companies that like they're speaking
well of their company they don't talk
about that stuff they really do some
like sketchy stuff that is not really
legal or cool it's just a lot of gray
hair and what I think is craziest about
all this not to bring up Gator gamergate
but like if you wanted to bring up
ethics and game room ilysm you missed
the boat entirely because that is one
hundred percent the shadiest that's
going on right now in the world of
gaming is youtubers taking money from
publishers to speak nice about their
games like I've been working game
journalism for over ten years never once
in my life has a game publisher come to
me like will give you 10,000 hours to
review this game positively and was
never happen this happens to youtubers
all the time day in day out that's crazy
and it isn't I'm glad that people are
waking up to it because it's not an
authentic way to get news from a lot of
people right you need to know who to
trust and it's very difficult on YouTube
to know who to trust and who's being
paid it's it feels a Larry Wild West now
it is with what YouTube is bringing to
the table and again like I like you know
this is not something that we're like
really raging against it's for the most
part i mean i think the pros outweigh
the cons right but there's a lot to
really second guess it just needs to be
disclosure like if you're gonna do is a
disclosure and i honestly hope that
there's some legal action brought
against these guys because that's the
only way you're going to solidify the
rule set is for you to make an FTC thing
I think it is I yeah it would probably
be FTC right I mean I we're not experts
but I'm and we're just positing but I
feel like that would probably fall under
some sort of FTC regulatory needs to be
clear when something is an advertisement
and that's actually why originally they
used to say and now to the commercials
round television right now it's very
clear why when you flip through a
magazine it says advertise monster
content whatever always labeled it has
to be labeled can't blur that line
exactly problem so a very sketchy I
hope I hope somebody you know take some
action against these guys because it's
really it's not cool not cool well
that's uh that's intense that's watch
where your kids are spending money on
I'm telling you they might be
like his very unaware of all that stuff
at this point where are they we are are
they well check your bank account
balance lately now we own a lot of skins
known a lot of weapon skins womany we
have so many skins real quick I built
that soon that I mean he's gonna he's
gonna eat this year layup it's getting
there fast it's happening you know I
just hope by the time he does know about
he doesn't know about all the extra
things you can purchase yeah this stuff
you can buy minecraft too yeah that's
scary scares the hell out of me he plays
the wii u and the iOS versions speaking
on iOS real quick before we got to say
goodbye you've been playing around 210
beta right yes so I OS 10 beta wrote
about this week Apple gave us one that
was loaded so I actually need to go
through and install it too because
that's a whole other things people go
through complications with that but
first of all you don't you can read
about it and read about the features
that you can currently use in public
beta you don't need to download it will
mean like you don't have to experience
it you don't have to experience wait
you're saying wait i'm not a huge fan of
playing around with betas if you look I
work in a field where I gotta write
about tech so I'm trying to look at
right going on in this stuff i put the
android beta on my phone I kind of dig
it you do it's one thing screwed up but
now that's the thing is that like what's
the knee I don't know I'm always like a
last to hop on board yeah when it comes
to stuff because what's the need like
it's if it's a brand new thing like when
VR came out I could see people when is
your lights drama or even buying like a
DK 2 or one of those things and and
playing around with it before the rift
became avail because you're looking at
brand new tech cutting-edge yet the
point is is not brand new tech now this
is old old tech like change the icon I
mean won't tell us what is the most
significant change I mean this is 10 do
you want nobody's double dating is
different to me you try and visit me see
sounds so I I wrote a little thing at
the thing I liked the most was bedtime
why does bedtime I mean that's like
maybe it's a sign bedtime is just a
little simple bedtime and wake up or
minor thing that's within the clock app
the reason I like it is because it's
really clean very simple way to count
like the Fitbit stuff asleep reminders
and we're up music the shine understand
what it does
it just here it's I can even buy money
you're gonna see this on thing but it's
basically like a little I don't have the
beta ten here but it's like a little
clock you set the it recommends what
your bedtime would be huh and it
recommends your wake-up time based on
that it how many hours you want to sleep
or it starts at the starting point I
think of like when you like to get up
and then it goes backwards from there
and it's basically setting a little
gentle reminder in this whole like nine
gentle musical notes like music gets
louder and louder and it's fine this is
not exciting stuff but the reason I like
is this I but I do think that does that
yay yes so it's a native Native one that
does it the only reason I like it is
because it is contained and clean and in
iOS 10 as has been happening with with a
lot of things in phone os's stuff gets
very complicated and things don't quite
work or something zoo for instance the
biggest thing in iOS 10 is probably the
fact that the lock screen is more
present that's the best that hell does
that mean so you mean like there's more
stuff on the lock screen if you used an
iphone before like it was so fast to log
in with with touch idea that you
basically are just trying to zip right
in your phone right you know it's like
click I'm in yeah this it's all about
slowing you down um you pick up the
phone now raise to wake and the screen
lights up like a droid does sure but in
order to log in fully you gotta click
the home button so you can't tap and
swipe to get in okay so it means that
you're staring at the at the lockscreen
more and then there's more 3d touch
savings you can do in there so it
basically means you might fiddle around
more on the lock screen and there are
some extra things if you're doing smart
home stuff you could start adding things
but don't get me started on that because
I don't have any smart home home kit
ready accessories right Apple most
people don't to know most people don't
and they still need to make a lot of
work there's a new app called home so
that's a great idea because you need to
start people off and be like hey if you
want people to understand this start
with an app that can help you sure but
once I load the app it started scanning
for accessories and said Oh can't find
the accessories well what do I do now
how do I start well no answer so I
didn't add anything and most people are
not going to I don't feel are going to
be compelled to go out and get one now
we review a lot of stuff on sina and
they were always pointing out that you
know if you want to read up on smart
home stuff is a ton of
use a home kit there are a lot of things
you have to buy separate products
Italian a home kit is a billion it just
needs we need a lot of help amazon echo
is easy to use that's why people like it
doesn't even have to be selling this in
your smart home but game back to iOS 10
sure there's that there's like I there's
a new I messages with all the weird
lasers and bubble cat what the hell they
goes it's like a snapchat thing it's
snapchat there they added a whole bunch
of bells and whistles where you can you
can send messages with different
textiles so it's like I could you could
send it with a slam or you can send it
with a loud or you could add balloons
that rise up when you send your message
like those lame current transitions when
you're editing video right but you can't
do balloons and slam it's like this
weird Portlandia sketch it's like you
you can't do you want balloons a slam
know you gotta slam or balloon but that
relates to what we're talking about with
periods and texting whether you period
like it's now the new period it's like a
slam like oh my god I got slammed that
must be Sarah it's interesting yeah so
they're trying to do that there's
stickers and apps their apps aren't
available yet the point the reason why
you don't need Iowa stands the biggest
potential is for Siri and other things
to get third party app support for maps
to get third party app support for more
widgets to show up in apps basically
you're waiting for the apps those apps
are not here you go to developers
dependent on the developer yeah the
developers are all working on it that
stuff's not going to debut right at the
app store until iphone 7 or whatever in
the fall so you're just looking at a
handful of features and it may break
some things that you have and even the
stuff like Apple has um again this is
like Facebook and Google they have a
photo feature info called memories yeah
right that it's kind of cute it's just
like all the stuff you've already seen
it collects it collectors up they claim
the machine learning is happening on
your phone not in the cloud which is
impossible for people to that's weird
colloquy high fiber yes sir is that if
you'll see the pie like a rabbit hole it
says zero kilobytes well look I you
heard it here first so betas are
 yeah yeah and and you know if
the this is helping Apple to so you are
doing this you can also give them
feedback then that's the whole thing
with betas it's not like a game where
game
you might get to play a few levels of a
really cool game in exchange for now
reworking behan gain see the game what
are you really seeing here i would say
wait um read about it if you really feel
compelled to player to do it on a second
device do it on to do it on the house
second I've right do I want to encrusted
seekers who has a second device yeah but
if you if you do but then you probably
don't and we tell you you're fine
waiting alright that's that's the
takeaway wait wait yeah why wait wait um
that's a story alright well thanks for
the iOS 10-8 a preview uh we are going
to send Russ off into the end of
bachelorhood sunset yeah he's over I'm
