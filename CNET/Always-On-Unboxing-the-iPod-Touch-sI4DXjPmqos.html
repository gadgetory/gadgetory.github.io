iPod Touch now I have a couple of them
here because we bought various versions
for various torture tests and I have to
point out right away
that I'm kind of in love with how the
packaging has a little colored Apple
depending on what color you buy like we
got a red one and a green one and
there's a blue one somewhere I think we
already broke it but we're gonna unbox
the black one the 32 gig model now the
iPod Touch I wasn't that into it when it
was announced but we got so much mail
from you guys wanting to know if we
would unbox it and specifically torture
it I think because it's such a popular
kids device that I went ahead turns out
one of our producers is already in love
with it even though I thought if you
have an iPhone or an iPad why would you
want it okay yeah I was wrong
simple packaging of course just comes
right open there's a sticker here I
think the black is probably also called
slate whatever it's actually really
pretty it's kind of more of like a
charcoal that's nice it has the matte
back which makes the bezel look even
smaller on the black one that's actually
pretty fancy let's have a look at what's
in the box
pretty straightforward just your little
Lightning charging cable no brick here
no power brick just the cable and then
of course your ear pods and then and I
think this is wise and I think you'll
see why when we do our torture test it
comes with a little wrist strap right
here and then watch this there's this
like clever little thing on the back you
pop it out like that slide your wrist
strap on
and give it to your kid cute all right
let's go through the specs on this
little guy the bad news about the iPod
Touch I think is that it starts at $299
for the 32 gig model it's 399 for the 64
gig model which is kind of what everyone
wants since this is basically a media
player it runs iOS 6
it weighs 3 point 10 ounces it's just
basically really small and light there's
a 4 inch Retina display just like on the
iPhone 5 it is an 11 36 by 640 pixel
resolution it has Wi-Fi only no built in
LTE because that would make it a phone
it has bluetooth 4.0 there's that
Lightning dock connector like I
mentioned the touch loop there's a five
megapixel rear facing camera that takes
HD video and a front-facing HD camera
that takes 1.2 megapixel photos
performance wise it gets a dual-core a5
processor that replaces the last
versions a4 so it should be plenty
speedy for playing games which is
another selling point for those who want
this for their kids now no question the
iPod Touch is a super nice device the
screen is beautiful the size is
wonderful it's just such a weird
placement now it's $30 cheaper than the
iPad Mini and it's not a phone like the
iPhone but apparently I am wrong about
these concerns because people are buying
iPod Touches in droves I do admit it's a
lot lighter and easier to carry than a
tablet and the battery life is really
good too so alright maybe you guys are
right about this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
