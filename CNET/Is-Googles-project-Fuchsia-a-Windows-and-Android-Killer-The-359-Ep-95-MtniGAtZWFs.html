the CNN studios in New York City with
Roger Chang and Michael Sorrentino for
episode 96 of the 359 podcast good
morning guys
morning good morning welcome viewers
happy Tuesday is Tuesday right okay yes
you're not listening to the last 10
seconds no no I kind of blank out there
during the intro welcome to how you make
a podcast welcome to the 259 we're about
to get started shortly with me as you
notice it's not been Fox Rubin it is
Mike Sorrentino hi our social maven or
social experts oh wait Ben's the Fox is
a wolf like sleek IOT I've if you watch
the open tab show I basically make up
maybe been making drinks for last
several weeks so maybe I'm Michael
bartender Mike the bartender like the
bar tiger a bartender Sorrentino all
right lenz gonna be pissed that we stole
his nickname stick oh I know
um all right so we're gonna be talking
about Google's project fuchsia fuchsia
fuchsia fuchsia I keep getting that
wrong I don't know why boosha boosha
books yeah what the fuchsia all right
we're asking we're talking a little bit
about virtual reality videos come out
with a series of chips that hopefully
will get v are capable laptops in your
hands soon and then lastly and we kind
of hate ourselves we're talking about
this but we're gonna talk about Justin
Bieber Mike is gonna just touch on it
but we'll go through the rabbit hole
really quickly well you're gonna go to
the rabbit hole because I'm not I know
there's a there's a beef between Justin
Bieber and Selena Gomez and that's about
all I know I one of the details from our
social expert a definition of first
world problems standing by for all your
hate comments oh I'm watching your
YouTube chat so send those hate comments
there yes and as always if you have any
questions about anything ranging from
project fuchsia to Justin Bieber or why
three grown men are talking about Justin
Bieber yes leave them in the comments
section our producer Bryan or Mike will
pick out the best questions and we will
as always do our best to answer them
Apple adrenaline Ori says what's fuchsia
will tell you shortly I'm gonna tell you
really shortly gonna be awesome now
let's get started let's get started
let's do it
audio rolling and in three two
welcome to the 359 we talk about the top
technical day and all the other crap you
want to throw in I'm Roger chain and
with me is social maven Mike Sorrentino
hi man hey there Wow welcome oh you just
caught that man and then I pulled back
should we uh let's start that one ah no
problem
that's my apologies our YouTube that's
alright that's that's why that's why
this is taped three - welcome to the 359
where we talk about the top tech news of
the day and all the other crap we want
to throw in I'm Roger Chang and with me
is social maven Mike Sorrentino aya
Roger how you doing good thanks for
being here the two words have been
buzzing around the interwebs over the
last few days and they are project
foucha yuusha now this project fuchsia
is a Google experiment they're trying to
build a new operating system from
scratch it's designed to power modern
modern phones and personal computers so
does that mean Google's trying to
replace windows and its own blockbuster
Android OS we don't know yet but it
could be it really could be but it makes
sense because if you look at Android if
it's based on its origins are in a way
kind of old now yeah well I mean it's
based on the Linux kernel which has been
around since 1991 so it's it's based off
an old platform granites open source
people been building upon it for years
that's that's why it's as stable as it
is but for I guess for Google this is a
chance to start start fresh you know
with it with a brand new operating
system right and we never know what
other product lines they could be
considering down the road that maybe
there's going to be a smart home push
and maybe Android and it stands isn't
good enough for that so maybe need
something little more customized it's
not nothing new either they already have
the Chrome OS right amiright OS this
might be the answer to that that issue
they've had between Android and chrome
androids have been phenomenally
successful on phones and tablets chrome
has been
not so much I mean it's kind of like
lukewarm and even seems like Android is
going to be there in any day right so
maybe maybe project fuchsia is their way
to kind of blend the two operating
systems into one basically a universal
OS for all devices but we'll see I mean
that's a perhaps it's gonna power smart
sprinklers spring what did you write the
Internet of Things that's I had
everything about thought about that but
yeah it's look it's right now it's a
project it's experiment Google loves to
experiment with all kinds of things we
don't actually know if any of this will
actually come to market but it's an
interesting it's an impossibility that
Google is even want it sort of
cannibalize its own Android OS and put
it out there enough that they by putting
it publicly we know it exists we know
some of the people that are working on
it yeah and just go to see where it
comes out that it's just puzzling and
curious no it's it did impressive resume
of people in terms of what they've done
you know the the what BOS the danger hip
top operating system Q and X webOS you
know a lot these execs or the key that
could put together it's got a lot of
experience between the four of them mmm
so moving on NVIDIA has unveiled its new
GTX 10 series graphics chips
normally I would fall asleep when
talking about something like this but
they're significant because these chips
are powerful enough to run virtual
reality for laptops so it's a you know
it's a baby step forward for pushing VR
into the mainstream but a big one
because many people don't want to get a
giant desktop yes for sure and virtual
reality's biggest hurdle I think has
been money people don't want to pay a
lot of money it's extremely expensive
it's a big investment you really have to
want VR you know buy a whole new rig as
well as the VR headsets systems to
really get it going so but minecraft
just came out on oculus and that to me
is enough reason to get in and minecraft
isn't that powerful of a game
no no so like if it that could work out
cheaply and easily then run around
castles and everything alright lastly
stop the presses Justin Bieber has
deleted his Instagram account yeah yeah
Mike you you you've been all over this
rep I had to follow the rabbit hole when
I saw was trading on Twitter
unfortunately and embarrassingly so why
why is Bieber off Instagram Bieber and
singer Selena Gomez
to date and according to tabloid reports
and whatnot
first Justin Bieber puts up a photo of
himself and his um another girl um Sofia
Ricci rumored to be his girlfriend sure
and she writes a comment back he he gets
hate over that okay his own fans okay
she writes back don't hate your fans and
maybe go off there were instagrams and
ultimately he's just decided to delete
delete it which in some ways is actually
responsible because if you don't if you
don't want your life on social media
pull yourself off of it yeah let me cuz
he feel like singer I feel like this is
stunts and he's gonna be back on very
shortly yeah they're gonna need it from
market lastly just a shout out to
Jessica dull courts Galaxy Note seven
review if you've been waiting to see
whether or not to buy that phone you
just check it out check out that store
and more on cnn.com I'm Roger Chang I'm
Mike Sorrentino thanks for listening and
that's a cut on the recording and I take
a look at some of the comments here oh
I'm eagerly awaiting these comments well
Apple adrenaline is actually just
stating how they're very interested in
the in the fuchsia project I'm curious
why Apple adrenaline would you elaborate
on this in the comments you know I would
say that Android has been around for a
while I think people even iOS has been
around for a while people are probably
hungry for a new take on an operating
system but the you know the big thing is
it's hard to create one right I mean
BlackBerry has learned this webOS with
palm has learned this Windows Phone
Windows Mobile you know these are all
operating systems that big companies
have poured a lot of money into and they
never really took off right yeah and
sometimes you just need to develop for
all we know fuchsia uh could be like
something that gets merged into an
existing system right maybe overtakes it
in time sometimes when uh back when I
think there were the time we're think my
Apple had a different chip in their max
yes and then when I move to Intel chips
it ended compatibility for some program
yeah yes yeah and so like Google maybe
in the down the road sees they'll need
to take a step like that in order to
yeah better
yeah I mean look this is all speculation
it is speculation our own Stephen
Shanklin who wrote the story he also
noted that you know if project if you
want to give project future a leg up you
build a bit of compatibility into
Android right making it sort of somewhat
backwards compatible that would kind of
prevent from a true fresh start but at
the same time if you've got sort of that
that built-in audience of Android
migrating to fuchsia that would
definitely help with that that push I
know one thing I think some app
developers would love but I don't know
if it ever going to happen when a some
sort of platform that would make it
where developers can make an app period
and then maybe make it for one thing but
then it ends up being compatible to
everything else Windows was sort of was
saying they were gonna do that but it
never had you know html5 was supposed to
be that like holy grail like not not
like a true native app but super web app
like build an html5 app and I'll run in
and literally could run on any phone
that never would to golf I'm kind of
disappointed with that because it you
know that whole idea of build one app
and had to run on every platform it's
sort of dream for developers this z4x
person in our chat mentioned how Samsung
needed to make their own operating
system in with Tizen yeah they've been
doing that just they've been using Tizen
for fridges instead of phones well so
they had a phone by the way they did
have a one phone that ran Tizen it was a
phone for the emerging markets a Bluth
sold in India it didn't sell well and
they sort of they changed gears and
switched over to it being sort of an IOT
type platform it's because again it's
very difficult to push an operating
system onto consumers who are used to
one or two main mainstays and shared
says that we should look to a new system
so that the Android King can be put to
rest
Wow Wow that's that's harsh that's kind
of an overarching sentiment coming down
the was earlier underdog feeling like I
was really into Palm webOS cuz I really
got a support a third platform sure but
then it just didn't peter out
unfortunately yeah it was it was a good
operating system I think it it was
hampered a bit by hardware that was not
so great and I think if you remember the
original Palm Pre was kind of a cheapy
phone
touchpad but it was on the clear did you
buy the yeah I bought it
let's go $50 how much was it was $100 it
came out 500 I remember and then when it
went down to 250 and at the time I was a
close was a clearance sale price it was
250 250 anything like that
I remember agreeing like I bought a
little more quick I remember hitting
like a hundred something and people were
freaking out hmm maybe I think maybe it
was around there remember being easy and
is horrible at that point you couldn't
buy it because like it was everyone sort
of stampeded and bought the hundred
dollar touchpad yeah I got it for my dad
for the holiday and he got a good few
years out of it even after the they
pulled support completely over the
operator I mean if you if all you do is
you know browse the web here you're good
right and I back to kick started to put
Android apps onto it but a number of
steps involved became a little too
commented yeah yeah
Shane Thomas is calling out speculating
that the future of the OS will be led by
Microsoft continuum Google fuchsia and
Ubuntu convergence interesting old state
interesting the Apple is not in that mix
at all interest very interesting after
the last few days that we've been
talking about what they're doing with
their tablets and phones and how it's so
underwhelming retz not an unpopular
something right now yeah I might have
peaked and they've did distinctly kept
the Mac OS or it's called Mac OS Mac OS
iOS separate and and and there doesn't
really seem to be any indication that
they're working on anything beyond that
so if any company can find a way to
connect everything and connect
everything well that is absolutely
something that could overtake any of the
walled gardens but that's the problem
they usually have trouble having that or
one of those walled gardens will buy out
that competitor right right right I
would I would say Microsoft continuum
Google fuchsia or good guesses a boon to
I mean that's always been a nice
operation system I don't really see that
with a very dedicated niche audience
sure dedicated hardcore but niche is the
key thing like I'm I don't know anyone I
don't like my parents are never gonna
buy Naboo to power anything no but I
mean when you're a die-hard fan your
life
longfang right but and that's the thing
I think this is who we were talking to
for sure
absolutely and I appreciate that but I
don't know if the feature OS is gonna be
led by boon to this person Scott says he
would really like it if there was an OS
that was a Android and then when you
docked it became like Chrome OS which
was sort of what Asus had a line of
tablets that did kind of a tree yeah
have a dog and then write bigger I mean
I think they're just gonna have to like
dump Chrome OS and just turn Android
into something that they could work on
to a laptop and I'd like it leave that
or they've got to take elements of
Chrome OS put it into Android having
those two discreet operating systems
just seems like too much and I'm
watching Brian put in a moji yeah until
because our friend ap 74 pointed out
some linguistic issues with the
terminology of fuchsia and how it
translates and I can't repeat them on
the air uh and I thought it was rather
quite aside and yeah because I am Dutch
so thank you for that all right I'm
going to go back the comments look at
that any other questions or comments uh
well I mean hunter Miller's pointing out
that Samsung tried and it failed on this
front yes
Tizen was a I mean they're still using
Tizen for what TVs and modern
refrigerators there's a post life to a
lot of these things like LG's webOS LS
is now an LED TVs yes but I mean Google
is a colossal giant you think this could
really be a flop even if it was a flop
uh they could have some projects of the
wazoo yeah I mean this I don't know if
it's a flop I mean it really just
depends I mean the transition from one
sort of one generation of operating
systems to another can always be tricky
look at Microsoft right it went from a
super dominant player to really
basically giving away Windows 10 to get
people to use it so you know Jacob says
that Google needs more continuity in
their products and with any luck fuchsia
would be that good counterpoint
that's a center point that's a really
good point I mean one of the biggest
knocks on Android is it's hugely
fragmented right like there's just all
these different versions of Android a
lot of the older and cheaper phones
still use outdated versions of and
that don't have the layers laid security
patches
maybe fuchsia provide some sort of
consistent experience for everyone I
don't see Xander is making a really good
Lord of the Rings reference saying that
if Google was to partner with like LG or
Samsung they could create an OS to rule
them all but then there may be no
competition yeah and also I don't know
Samsung and LG really want to work with
Google to like create their own kind of
OS yeah just made me giggle
ya know I could not hear that and yet AG
and Elle's voice we as consumers nearly
always win when there's fights too
because then they'll be forced to make
better feature yeah no competition is
always a plus Simon wants to know your
favorite OS both of you my favorite was
hmm I bounced back and forth between
everything I mean my phones and iPhone
but I have a work phone with Google and
I use Google services on that iPhone all
the time so like the minute that there's
a good iMessage FaceTime thing on Google
and that would get me to talk to all of
my friends then I might might not matter
at all yeah I mean I have I have an iOS
phone I'll have an iPhone as well as an
Android phone I bounced back and forth
between the two I tend to use iOS old
and more darkhorse I really always kind
of liked the Windows Phone operating
system many other I kind of it I would
I'd never really wanted to buy one but I
always thought that it was uh it was
kind of slick looking OS even though no
one actually used it I use one as an mp3
player
Konoe there you go all the Zune stuff
which Zune I really like I really before
I love the Zune actually I was a big fan
too soon and all that all that's still
in there a little the tiny little zoom
that was really thin and you might not
want to advertise that the operating
system do s behind it I mean that's what
Windows Phone became and it was actually
a slick looking OS fair just marketed
poorly I just did it oh yeah and keeps
losing app support every month right
that's right a whole other thing but as
a music player I was fine with it
mmm do you think they should merge
Chrome OS and Android could it work yes
I mean I but I think Android would
cannibalize pretty much all I think it's
more taking elements of Chrome and
putting in Android so it works better on
larger displays yeah that's sort of the
trick I think
merging the two it's probably that's a
pretty tricky tricky proposition but
they're already like there
to put their putting the Android apps
onto Chromebooks yes that way those apps
can be downloaded and just run better
than if they're streaming through a
Chrome browser all the time right and so
it's really close it just seems like one
day they'll whip up beat up up and
announce that android 8.0 is for every
single platform period if not if not
even nougat yeah from Xander I remember
there being talked about Google having
more control over Nexus more like Apple
and their specific OS could their new OS
be exclusive like iOS as to Apple no no
no way that's not Google that is Moe
that is not Google's away an exclusive
OS would piss off all their partners and
they do you know Google is powerful but
they do care about what their partners
think you know big guys like Samsung and
LG HTC largely that's how Google got to
where it is it's by escalating their par
exactly and to create like an exclusive
OS for just as phones know what I can
imagine happening is Google maybe I know
adding software enhancements not maybe
to the operating system but maybe apps
or features that you know that are run
on Nexus but I can't imagine them being
exclusive either like you could probably
download them on your normal Android
phone too so I could imagine them one
day being more imposing on their
third-party partners and be like you
must update the earphones at the same
time we're going to make it as easy as
possible and then your customers well
yeah yes and no par the problem is it's
not just it's not like it's just a
debate between the OEM or the handset
maker and at Google it's Google handsome
maker plus the carrier so like unless
Google somehow exerted full control over
everyone which they can't they can't
tell Verizon 19:18 T that they like
hurry up with these updates we need
these updates on the phone that's not
going to happen right they have their
own individual testing processes and 18
teams Verizon like No mm-hmm well we
take our time so we got to wrap it up
soon but we've got a longtime fan first
time comment or Sam Mayo shout at the
Sameach for not winning us and getting
involved how hard would it be for Google
to create an OS that works for all
platforms like a universal idea
Microsoft has been having well hmm they
want it they'll do it yeah anybody comes
to it up all products like just like
would run on anything like any that's
what it makes it sound like
yeah so like you could get this on an
iOS all right mo windows 10 idea where
the Microsoft says that it's windows and
all platforms but that's not entirely
true
right if Google would do that yeah I
think if Google poured enough money into
it they could probably figure it out
yeah yeah will they logically maybe
that's what project fuchsia is yeah we
have you have to really find a help we
don't really know it's a it's the the
lining is very gray yeah hint of purple
look so we we we do know that's it's
again for modern computers and phones is
the sort of the terminology they gave in
that magenta kernel description but I
don't see maybe maybe it'll be extended
to more things because it seems like
everything those computers are kind of
limiting and everything can be a
computer now - true true raspberry pi
sticks I mean there's a smart sneaker
yeah mmm everything is yeah I reviewed a
smart sneaker it didn't make me play
basketball any better so God totally
killed that's another conversation for
another day
all right let's wrap things up that's
that's good point to end it if you like
anything you saw or heard here check us
out on CNET also our podcast is
available on itunes google play music
soundcloud Feedburner
tune in radio and that's it yeah all
right comment away anywhere you see a
comment box yep see you all tomorrow
