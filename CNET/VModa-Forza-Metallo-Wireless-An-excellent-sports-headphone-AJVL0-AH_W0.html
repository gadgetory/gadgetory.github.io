headphones out there right now but this
the motaz or so metallo wireless is one
you should definitely check out if your
looking for top-notch sound quality and
a secure comfortable fit that works well
for ever to use as well as sporting
activities not cheap at $170 but it's
superior to the beats X and most in your
wireless headphones I've tested like
with the wired versions of this
headphone it's easy to get a secure fit
using one of the four included ear tips
and remote as well designed
patent-pending sport fins keep that tip
snugly in place sealing out a lot of
ambient noise you don't have to use the
sports fins but I kept them on at all
times whether I was working out or just
walking around and yes this headphone is
sweat resistant and you can run with it
for long distances without a problem the
only downside is that it's got a noise
isolating design so you'll have some
trouble hearing traffic around you which
some runners and bikers consider a
safety issue battery life is decent at
10 hours and the headphone works well as
a headset for making cell phone calls
the battery and most of the electronics
are stored in a module that's designed
to sit on the back of your neck
occasionally that module slid down
between my shoulder blades
but overall the headphone is pretty well
weighted and you'll barely notice you're
wearing it when the earbuds aren't in
your ears my only design gripe and it's
somewhat serious is that the headphone
cables were a little long for me I felt
that could be a couple inches shorter
you're a bigger person with a bigger
head that extra cord length shouldn't be
an issue but for medium-sized and
smaller folk you may find the cord
dangling near your face at times and it
may bother you a little it wasn't a deal
breaker for me but it's not ideal that
cord gripe aside the headphone as I said
sounds great it's very clean sounding
with tight punchy bass and nice detail
in that sense it doesn't have the
typical v-moda sound profile which tends
to accentuate the bass and can lack some
clarity this headphone is more
articulate and well balanced as an added
bonus you can customize the look of the
headphones with optional 3d printed caps
caps are little expensive and I
personally wouldn't bother customizing
my headphones some people might have
some fun with it I'm David karna for
cnet.com that's the v-moda or so metallo
