hollywood whose home debugging the
world's first gps buoy diaper locator
welcome to the buzz report first our
gadget of the week this week the first
gadget of the week with a lineage to a
double 07 villain phantom 337 isn't she
Goldfinger who drove a 1937 rolls
phantom today's rolls-royce phantom is a
little more pricey starting at three
hundred and thirty three thousand
dollars and rising quickly with options
like $10,000 rear seat video screens a
three-thousand-dollar front bow camera
and this trick double oh seven ish nav
screen but here's what I like best if
you own and drive one of these you can
actually go to a party in mutter know Mr
Bond I expect you to die and people
might actually not think you're a total
dork I'm not making this up by the way
we had one here at CNN check out my
brand new video in the car channel here
on cnet TV now the news the scale lies
the mirror lies the camera lies but your
printer you betcha a new study just
found that when many inkjet printers say
they're out of ink they're lying and
that's expensive tuv did this study at
the request of epson which wanted to
prove that its single ink cartridges are
less wasteful so yeah the results
labeled lexmark Canon an HP all as big
ink liars telling you to toss the
cartridge when there's a bunch of at
least one color left and one printer the
kodak easyshare 5300 lies like a rug
wasting sixty-four percent of its ink
but here's the worst part Epson printers
from the company that commissioned this
study waste twenty percent of their ink
do they really want a printing merit
badge for that okay time to dig into the
goofy things Google does folder it's a
thick one the company has just kicked in
10 million dollars to incent development
of plug-in hybrid cars these are hybrids
you plug in at night to get even more
electric driving range an MPG of near a
hundred now there's no business goal
here the 10 million came from google's
charitable arm and you may scoff at
funding plug-in hybrids but for me
anything is better than one more Silicon
Valley billionaire launching a damn
rocket ship and this fall's new version
of grand theft auto GTA 4 is going to
offer to downloadable episodes available
only for the xbox 360 the execs at
Microsoft paid 50 million dollars for
this but reportedly left all the
creative control in the hands of
take-two interactive so gameplay like
Busta 40-ounce then relieve yourself in
Google's lobby or empty your mac-10 into
a Sun server or chillin the crib with a
copy of windows server 2003 those were
all taped tues idea or so I'm told I'm
Brian Cooley this has been the buzz
