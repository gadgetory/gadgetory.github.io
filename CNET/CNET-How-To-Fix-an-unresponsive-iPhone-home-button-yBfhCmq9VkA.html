iPhone there is a chance that eventually
your home button will crap out just look
at all the Apple forms filled with users
complaining about a home button that
slow to respond or just doesn't work
Apple did redesign the home button for
the iPhone 5 to prevent this from
happening but if you have an older
iPhone that's out of warranty like mine
here are four things you can do to fix
that defunct button okay the first thing
you want to try is to calibrate your
home button this is something that Apple
does recommend doing especially if your
home button does click but it's just
slow to respond okay open up an apple
app like the clock now hold down the
sleep button until slide to power off
shows up as soon as it does hold down
the home button the app will close and
your home button will be calibrated
check to see if that fixed it if your
home button still doesn't work try this
next trick there is a chance that
through normal usage wear-and-tear the
docking port got misaligned moving the
home button along with it before we
continue beware that if you're too
feisty with your iPhone you can damage
it okay
get an iPhone USB cable and plug it in
now push down on the top just a little
so that the 30-pin connector pushes up
behind the home button then tap the home
button and remove the cable for many
people this little hack will do the
trick but if your home button is still
not responding well enough gives us next
of a try
considering this is a physical button
you have to remember that there's space
around it where dirt can get stuck for
this fix you'll need 99.99% isopropyl
alcohol which you can find at a hardware
store do not use rubbing alcohol because
that has water in it and will further
damage your phone okay using a cotton
ball tissue or eyedropper apply a few
drops of the alcohol directly on and
around the home button avoiding the
screen
once you do grab a pencil or other
narrow object and tap tap tap the home
button to allow the alcohol to get in
and around the button give it about ten
minutes to completely dry before
checking to see if the alcohol solve the
problem I'm sorry that it had to come to
this but if the three previous tips
didn't fix your home button your final
option is to enable the on-screen home
button this will put a small button on
your screen that'll do everything your
home button would normally do let me
show you go to settings down to general
then head on over to accessibility here
scroll down to assistive touch turn that
on and you'll see this new button show
up on your screen now when you tap it
you'll get a choice of actions like home
will take you to your home screen or you
can even activate Siri from here if the
button ever gets in the way just drag it
somewhere else
the solution is hardly ideal but it
could hold you over until you're ready
to buy a new phone or get it repaired if
you have any questions or ideas let me
know on Twitter and check out more
