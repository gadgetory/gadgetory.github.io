Esqueda and your team is money which is
why we're gonna look at the news in TV
movies and video games and let you know
whether you should buy or sell your fan
investments let's kick things off this
week with oh my god Deadpool three news
tell me more Ryan Reynolds I don't think
there will be a Deadpool three
oh I think going forward it would be an
x-force movie okay I mean I guess I
could accept an x-force movie in the
place of a third Deadpool movie but
there is something really important that
we should discuss here and that's the
fact that Walt Disney is going to own
21st Century Fox in a little while and
that means that this man right here
Kevin Feige is gonna have a lot to say
about the future of the Merc with a
mouth I like to think that maybe 21st
Century Fox will become the r-rated
superhero arm of the Disney superhero
machine but we'll have to wait and see
so for now you gotta check out Deadpool
- on May 18th I will definitely be there
at the theater checking it out and while
we're waiting for Deadpool - to hit I
think we can easily say the first
Deadpool is a 100% buy buy buy you got
to get out there what get out there's
all your chimichangas watch Deadpool
it's gonna be so much fun if you're not
interested in watching Deadpool every
night for the next few weeks why not try
for at night Epic Games announced it had
released season four for its super
popular battle royale game fortnight and
a freaking comet hits which is always
super cool it created a brand new area
in the game called dusty divots and on
top of that there are these sweet things
called hot rocks that when you grab them
give you low gravity jumping and that is
really fun and of course the season for
battle pass has tons of cool things to
check out we need to talk about my
experience playing for tonight though I
think it's very key I decided to
download the fortnight as the kids are
talking about that's you you young
children and I was really excited got
the foul bus I parachuted in and I
immediately died to somebody who had
literally picked up a thousand million
guns before I could even find I don't
know one stick of wood it was ridiculous
and oh my god the building you guys the
building I'm constantly building a
freaking walls to get away from people
it's absolutely outrageous I can't win
at this game I can't do anything right
in fortnight and I'm sorry Epic Games
but I am
selling all of my fan investments in
fortnight I am going back to splatoon to
and overwatch where all the old people
play video games because clearly I don't
get it
speaking of old stuff remember Arrested
Development
series creator Mitch Hurwitz announced
he had recut season four of Arrested
Development into 22 more traditional
episodes for you to watch why
syndication cash that's right everybody
Hollywood runs off the that's what it's
all about and he renamed it Arrested
Development season four fateful
consequences and it's available right
now on Netflix so that's a bye everybody
that remix also includes Ron Howard who
came back to do some voiceover to sort
of smooth over some of the rougher seams
and edges on this recut also I am really
looking forward to seeing the Bluths
again in season 5 which herve it says
it's coming soon like real soon like if
you knew when you would not be wrong to
be thinking why are we all just hearing
this now honestly Netflix might just
surprise us all and drop season 5
alongside the remix and if that's the
case I know exactly what you're doing
this weekend you're watching Arrested
Development it's a bye and if you're
Mitch Hurwitz and you're watching this
show guess what MIT service you gotta

fences talk to insiders and generally
get as much information as I can about
this upcoming delightful Star Wars park

who are in the know and I think I know
just where to find them

also exciting

tell anybody else though can i no sorry

couldn't exactly sneak in and the only
information I was able to get came from
a wookie who swore me to secrecy but
overall I'd call it a success we did get
to see some of it from the peaks of Big
Thunder Mountain and we only have a
little over a year to weigh as well I'm
gonna call this trip of success may the
