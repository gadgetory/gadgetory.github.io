we are taking a look at the Z box Z base
4/20 this is a budget price sound bar
that's currently selling for three
hundred dollars now Z Vox originated the
pedestal sound bar design which lets you
place a sound bar under your TV rather
than in front of it it's a great look
with a lot less clutter and you never
have to worry about the sound bar
blocking your TV's remote sensor the Z
base 420 s cabinet is made out of wood
and it has a boxy look with sharp edges
that's a little less sleek than some of
the other pedestal sound bars that are
on the market now one of its great
features is its front panel display
which is hidden behind the speaker
grille and it's only visible when it's
in use a lot of sound bars don't have a
front panel display at all and it's
really nice on the Z Vox to get some
visual feedback when you're adjusting
the volume or making bass and treble
adjustments the included remote is a
slight step up from those thin credit
card style remotes that we're used to
getting on sound bars but it still isn't
that much of an improvement
the buttons are mushy and they're pretty
cluttered so you may end up replacing it
with a solid universal remote around
back are the inputs including two analog
inputs one optical one coaxial plus
there's a mini jack input up on the
front that's more inputs than you get on
a lot of competitors although you may
end up not using those extra ports if
you use your TV as a switcher cell
quality on the Z Vox is a bit of a mixed
bag on the one hand it delivers a big
rich sound particularly on movies and it
clearly outclasses the more expensive
bow solo
it also has an excellent dialogue
emphasis option which boosts dialogue so
it's easier to hear voices over
background sounds and music on the other
hand the Z Vox did occasionally distort
at high volumes which is something that
never happened on the other pedestal
sound bars that we tested along similar
lines the cabinet of the Z Vox has a
tendency to vibrate and in our setup it
actually made the TV audibly buzz at
times now that's not going to happen
with every TV but again it didn't happen
with any of the other pedestal sound
bars that we tested so ultimately that's
why the Z Vox eBay's 420 is more of a
mixed wreck
it has a bigger sound than the bows and
it has a great budget price but buyers
should be aware that it can sometimes
vibrate and distort luckily XIV lakhs
has a 30-day money-back guarantee so you
can give it a shot in your setup and see
how it works I'm Matthew moscovia and
this is the Z box Z base for 20</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
