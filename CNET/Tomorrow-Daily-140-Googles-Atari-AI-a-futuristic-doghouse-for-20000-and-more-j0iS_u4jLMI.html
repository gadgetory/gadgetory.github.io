how robot dinosaurs are coming and I'm
going to tell you about a robot that's
gonna beat you at video games pretty
soon and I'm gonna tell you about a dog
house that's so cool you're gonna kick
your dog out and living it yourself
we're both going to tell you you're
watching tomorrow daily yeah
attitude attitude grading citizens of
the internet welcome to tomorrow daily
the best geek talk show in the known
universe I'm hero stash Lee's got to
join me as always filled with attitude
today kill anonymous I'm kill onymous so
what who cares get over it deal with it
kill you you should brought sunglasses
you do deal with oh no it's okay yes I
could do given really let me down on
yesterday's Photoshop I'm just putting
that out there I didn't see any lasers I
didn't see any large Jeff Goldblum I
didn't see any of that in my feed you
guys blew it especially you Stefan Roger
Oh Stefan o our regular just affect me
oh you were just anything ok so anyway
when actual someone out an actual person
ok guys we have some really fun stories
today so let's not waste any more time
let's hit the headlines so the EPFL
which is they've been working on this
project we've seen a lot of robots that
sort of mimic animals right so they've
been working on robots that behave like
animals for a while now and this
particular project I think they've been
working on for over a decade so it's
been ten years in the making this is
kind of crazy they've unveiled plural
bot so here comes plural bot you can see
in the video oh god this is a salamander
esque robot it looks very similar to a
skeleton of a salamander crawling around
um it can walk on land and swim on water
it has this boy there it has a help of a
date has a suit a little diving suit
that goes into and then it can like swim
in the water cuz it needs to be
waterproof um so here's how they built
it and it's really impressive to watch
move because it looks really lifelike
right right so okay they tracked 64
different points on a salamander
skeleton using x-ray they filmed it
under x-ray so they were able to see
exactly how the skeleton of this
salamander moved and they were able to
sort of figure out how many joints the
robot needed and which ones needed to be
active based on all of the different
postures and gates that the salamander
showed off like while it was moving so
um they said that this is so cool they
said that if they were to apply
neural patterns to both the robot
salamander or a real salamander like
neural patterns that you would apply to
a real life salamander it would do the
same things that is this robot sound
hundred that's how accurate it is way to
go like it's pretty accurate would
respond and move really similarly to the
real thing which is awesome so this is
remote controlled though yeah like they
have they like I would imagine it's got
some servos in it that lets it kind of
walk itself um and some sensors and
stuff so this is my favorite part for
you kill okay the next step is to use
they say the EPFL says the next step for
this project is to use the same methods
to bring robotic dinosaur yeah I found a
way that's awesome no I'm really
impressed they were able to like
actually take the exact same you know
movements as a salamander very glad and
copy them and they're just straight up
their goal is dinosaurs so I'm gonna
pull an Oprah right now and say you get
a roto robot dinosaur you get a robot
dinosaur everybody gets a robot dinosaur
ok now go with my own ok that's cool
pretty awesome that's pretty great I
can't possibly go wrong I don't like
that they put a mouth on it oh he talks
to you like a box I mean they can play
audio from the mouth of the valve like
Oh what are the sensors in the front by
the way I you know I'm not a hundred
percent sure I um the article that I was
reading about it was more focused on
like how they built it ok so in it but
it really so cool and also you know
robot I saw robot dinosaurs and I was
like okay well we gotta cover this
mm-hmm so there you go kales waiting
what are you gonna name a robot dinosaur
uh gizmo gizmo yeah oh and buddy's gonna
kill no smoke kill kills me there you go
good i like it can't can't possibly go
wrong skills mom i'll take delivery of
my dino of my Robo Raptor uh my Robo
velociraptor any any day now so I
full-size full scale I don't want one of
those small ones you can buy at the
store already I don't want that alright
so moving on to another one of Cal's
favorite things need so over that the
geniuses over at the
Google at the google deepmind have
introduced an AI that plays video games
all right now stick with me because this
is both very cool and very intimidating
all right trust me okay so this is a
robot playing break out which is a one
of 49 Atari games that this AI learned
to play now as you can see you're doing
pretty terrible it's really bad it's
really bad at playing breakout blowing
air however the cool part about all this
is that the AI learns okay doesn't it
it's not taught the rules of the game it
learns and it gets better and better
just like the human brain after you try
this game at times you start to figure
it out I see in the video it's saying
like 100 training episodes 200 this is
400 that we're seeing now and it is
better it was better right so it's it
the thing that it's trained to do
however is remember and learn from
previous rounds so as you can see it's
doing multiple rounds and it's going to
learn and get better and better
attempting to improve its core so that's
how it's basing its its movements like
oh if I do this I get better score so
for instance as you can see it thinks of
new ways to exploit the game at like
yeah how do you trap the ball on the top
that's a trick we all know but it
figured it out it took it like 600 times
but it figured it out figure it out I
tell me 600 times baby hey I'm still
ever figured it out so that's a sneaky
sneaky trick that it learned up but this
is a proof of concept the goal the goal
how is it goal is to start a successful
YouTube gaming channel okay great twitch
I'm just I'm just kidding that's not the
goal the actual goal is that they want
to show people it's possible to create
an AI that can solve general problems
and gems we promise I he's probably hard
right as you as you can see like I think
because it wasn't taught the rules it's
able to kind of think outside the box
where is Owen yeah as opposed to being
specifically programmed to play one game
at a time like here's the rules here's
how because if you find an exploit in
the game you're gonna use that exploit
room and you're not gonna follow the
rules so the next thing they're good so
they're they're hoping it'll like learn
things like if you want to go on travel
you could just yell at the AI and be
like oh here are some prerequisites like
when I land I
go eat here or I need to be here by this
certain time or I like to make it this
time and it'll be able to like work
within those me great travel that's the
only real example I'm sure you could
think of a million uh-uh but right now
so there's other next thing after they
taught it all these like sorry games is
that they're gonna teach it 90s games oh
good so moving the next decade Larry the
next decade obviously there's more
difficulty rather than just bouncing
balls around so there you go if they can
teach it to beat contra then I'll be
impressed and ghosts and gothic out the
konami code ghosts and goblins as well
Kosan Co because that's easy stop it
like to get out I good all right well I
I gotta tell you about this dog house
okay about the dog you're gonna see this
video you're gonna freak out I just am
warning you in advance um we've seen the
Barbie Dream mansion Malibu dream
mansion whatever that is now your dog
can have a dream mansion to this is very
futuristic so here it is this is the
samsung a dream dog house Samsung has
put together this very futuristic crazy
dog house that first of all I just want
really bad um 12 designers and
fabricators worked on this thing for
about six weeks to make it real there
are lots of her things as you can see
there's a dog treadmill there is a hot
tub figured it'll kill a dog hot tub ok
we get the Jets going he can hit a
button and feed himself some treats ok
automatic feeder in there right they got
some beautiful lighting they have a
samsung galaxy s tablet inside the dog
house oh good they have a designer
interior look they got one and they owe
you can see there's pictures on the
walls look they got pictures of their
dog friends and family they could have
dog friends Valen there's the tablet
right there so they can watch a little
telly they can they can call you and
call you on skype Doug skype with you
whatever you want um and yeah that's the
the samsung dream dog house that's that
is a real thing it will be on display at
crufts I know air you face palming just
so hard it's crufts is one of the
biggest dog shows in the world and it's
going to be it'll be there so people can
see it which makes me laugh where's that
I didn't I noticed that there wasn't
like a place for them to relieve
themselves well
to me the main thing that dogs do in my
experience that's a really good point I
was thinking on the treadmill it has
like that fake grass maybe they would
just go there and then run on the
treadmill just keep right I don't know
don't dogs like no I will see ya you'd
have to have what I will know and that's
then you just go by that little fake
patch of grass that they want was there
I I mean so so was there a goal for this
was there like it the goal is luxury for
your dog that's the goal sometimes candy
doesn't have to have a point kale that's
why it's called candy oh it's to its to
stimulate stimulate your dog is luxury
you're putting your dog in the lap of
luxury literally like luxurious that dog
has a nicer house than I do like that
dog that we just saw my dog would rather
lay on a pile of dirty clothes this I
was gonna say my dog likes to roll
around in like sticks and mud so I can't
imagine this would be a thing they would
even want to spend time in hey Samsung
make a kale sized one of those yeah make
me a house that size would be good and
uh no do you want to guess also I need
to be able to go to the bathroom do you
do you want to guess how much it is okay
wait wait this is good guess at home
guess it gets at home how much forget
your guesses at already had a treadmill
I had a spa I had a self-feeding thing
at had a tablet tablet built it I had a
door after just beside I'm gonna say
three thousand dollars three thousand
okay I'm gonna I'm gonna translate this
to US dollars because yes at home
guessing home because okay so you might
be guessing a little low oh no you're
beginning a little low a little love
okay okay um 20,000 British pounds which
is uh that's like 40,000 that was like
38 thousand dollars lot i'm calculating
right now let's say done go british
pound u.s. dollar there will be 30
thousand US dollars 30 grand 30 thousand
four hundred as of today we're than a
mini cooper like a mini coopers let you
buy your own car like eighteen thousand
dollars you could literally buy one of
those old VW but buses and like to make
that your house you could buy a boat you
were a houseboat for less than thirty
toughened father there's so many things
we've talked about on this show that you
can be spending your money on
and then thirty thousand dollars for the
dog house of your dreams you could buy a
robot dog you can literally build a
robot dog from school yeah you could you
could actually just pay I what do you
think most of the money went the
designing or like what do you think I
think that's a part of that I think the
custom fabrication is like the big thing
where it's like and the loved the end
the hot tub I think the hot tubs pretty
pricey ok here we go cubs are you come
to me and you give me twenty thousand
dollars which is $10,000 one-thirds the
price less I will build you something
way cooler and it'll have a place for
your dog to pee yes it'll have a hole
that's right i'll have a hole in the
ground I come yeah yeah so maybe you
maybe you buy this charge your dog rent
that's good until they pay it off maybe
that's the thing like we get him a dot
dog model job can you like do that get
it as a dog model so it pays for itself
like the house pays for itself so if
you're like jay-z or something like that
it'll make sense sure yeah d if your
Blue Ivy get a little dog Blue Ivy
you're like I want a dog and then
Beyonce's like it's gotta be fabulous at
flawless and so she buys it you a
flawless dog and then it's gotta have a
flawless house that's how it work but
they are selling them is what your
transom ah they're not selling them yet
but it'll be and maybe we'll see if
there's enough interest at this dog
shelter they might actually sell them I
don't know where's Jojo crust is in the
UK I like that it's crossed crufts
that's all I thought it was like rough
no a hashtag hashtag a day though TD pet
house and I want to know pick an animal
and design it a dream a dream house so
pick your your Dino you're a robot your
robot dinosaur what kind of help would
it have my robot dinosaur first of all
it would have the Jurassic Park date
kills mo kills motel Code Red everyday
dress apart gates of an open up and it
would say welcome to Jurassic Park okay
and then you get inside and it would be
it would be actually a big game of
thrones though okay so they'd had like a
little thrown them he could sit on I
like it yeah alright and yeah and then
be but it would be deadly to get to the
throne they all movie trap it would be
like Indiana Jones but it's so it's only
for my dinosaur got it so there you go
nah it's just a bunch of Spielberg
movies
should I go but just mash there's a
little Spielberg red dinosaur dream out
yeah so what about yours I think I would
do mine for I feel like I'd pick it pick
like a I think I pic like a pet bat I've
always wanted to pet that okay they're
really cute you better go where I think
you're going with this what do you mean
I was I would like to do it like a
portal house oh that's pretty cool yeah
like where they can fly through it like
listen if money's no object i'm sure i
could figure out portal guns so you just
have them fly through spaces into other
parts of the house like it oh so we just
make crap up then yeah isn't that the
point of the right spot in mind he gets
a rocket pack you're a robot dinosaur
and you think it's the well the robot
dinosaur we just saw that okay you're
sorry all right okay if we do the portal
gun on the show yet I mean he'll
probably do it in like two months
actually an apple releases the Apple
portal gun I know right the apple portal
with NFC with yes NSE scanning this has
been a fun segment I'm glad to be a part
of this work Katie chat house TV pedos
what would discourage ashby and then
what would the pet be they gets picked a
peck yeah pick a pet Pickett's house
tell us what the most wild feature in
the house would be well craziest feet no
pet kales though yeah no pet kels no pet
Ashley's thank you robot ko-ro-ba kale
okay robot everybody robo totally good
on that note we're gonna take a quick
break it's thursday so we have rounded
into it we have user feedback and our
phone tire over the day so don't click
wait it's tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show the robot is
watching you yeah robot is always
watching doesn't have any entity senses
me so so now it's it's Thursday which we
do every Thursday we like to talk about
things were kind of a little bit
obsessed with this week so it's time for
into it all right you go first this week
as it like it's just like crack me in
the face I remember you like bring your
hand up so high is like wow knocked out
just pretend to pretend I didn't even do
anything you're just on the floor like
help anyway so this week as in all weeks
I am always obsessed about some video
game and sometimes I like to go back and
play an old one especially because i'm a
pc gamer because there's mods yeah lots
make everything fun mods mods are great
for that's why i like be a pc gamer so i
decided to get into the left 4 dead 2
mods up on the brett on the steam store
so they have they have the workshop and
so one of the ones that I've been
wanting to play for really long time is
the disneyland by lets you play left 4
dead killing zombies as you go through
disneyland this is the great not really
well done it's really it's like it's
like they took a blueprint and made it
now that is a really really good replica
running for me that I spirit and there's
like a whole backstory because there was
like apparently that that was a safe it
was posed to be a safe ground for the in
feel like against the infected ok and so
you're supposed to be able to get like
injections there but it ended up getting
infected but anyway it's it's a blast
it's super easy to download and this is
just one of many mods that up that I've
installed of I had one where my whole
team the four survivors were from
futurama I had one where I was a hit sue
me whatever that that Japanese pop star
Harley Quinn you can change the guns i
had a chainsaw that was from lollipop
chainsaw but it made the sounds that
Homer makes when he does it change I
guess hey Bart you would see my new
chains on hockey mask anytime I took it
out but it's really cool it's a lot of
fun so yeah I guess if you're I guess if
you want to watch me I'm gonna play it
maybe friday night so if you guys want
to see has the stretching portrait are
you a night the haunted mansion
I even got enough are damn i cut away
okay uh that is amazing and if you're
just listening at home that is super
detailed and you should definitely go
look that up because it's it's really
impressive yeah huge Disney fans here oh
yeah big time thank you killing our big
Disney fans I'm so you actually brought
a prop for you I did I brought a real
life cig you're listening you're missing
this is what I'm into so here it is this
is the grand Budapest hotel it's a book
and it's a very large coffee table book
and it has pictures and interviews and
stuff from the cast I'm going to try to
bring this or it's like really unwieldy
I story gigantic um but yeah it's really
cool and there's all kinds of great
stuff in here that you can check out
they've like interviews the costume
people and scripts tough and pictures of
all of the production and set design and
I mean it's just it's really cool
concept art I just really love it so
that's because there's like a lot of
models this thing won a ton of Oscar was
for costuming and and set design so it's
such a cute it's such a great movie like
it's a really whimsical just charming
movie if you haven't seen it i highly
recommend it it was one of my favorites
of last year might even have been my
game I movie of the year last year if I
ran the Oscars maybe I would have given
it to that but I like I really like
movies like that kales just like you are
I would have given it to lego movie well
yes justice whimsical cheerful it's the
same type of thing like it I get it I
get it but yeah so that's what i'm into
i really like it it's it's super cool i
think was like 20 or 25 bucks on amazon
it's hard cover is it smells amazing i
love the smell of a new book so it's
smell so good um but yeah that's a
that's what I'm into this week I am
really enjoying it I told Kayla like
taking my time with it I don't want to
like rush through it and like eat it all
up and then and then be done with it and
be like okay my copybook tables all over
so I'm kind of like going through a
couple pages I think I throw it away
after you well yeah i'm just gonna
obviously burn it you burn your books
after you're done with them right yes
light them up yeah yeah of course as one
does no no I'm tent and you both never
use it all in and that's how you get all
the words let's see you the words and
all the content super okay yeah you take
the books power this has been the best
episode
oh um no it'll be a really nice coffee
table book once I've done but I I'd like
I'm trying to pace myself and enjoy
sometimes i will read through books
really really fast and then I feel like
maybe I didn't enjoy this is a picture
book yeah yeah exactly so um so yeah
that's what I'm into uh but now sigh
wait how about you didn't tell you how
much it was I said it was like 20 or 25
okay so we're on amazon that's I got a
awesome um okay it is now time for what
you're into which is your user feedback
yesterday we asked you guys use hashtag
TD school to tell us what class you'd
want to take who you'd want to teach it
after we told you all about the free
Stanley comic book class which I have
registered for now officially like crap
i forgot to do that yeah you gotta do it
when the deadline it's the class doesn't
start to like May 5th so it's your good
you got time um so and I think because
it's on the internet there's like no
maximum can't really do that yeah uh
Tony wrote in to us and said I would
like to learn of martial arts taught by
Bruce Bruce Lee oh man that'd be the
hardest class in the world it would be
oh he's so like if you mess up he'll
just do the the punch right they're like
yeah that launches us a room but like he
never ate and he worked out every waking
it's hard more that's not a class that's
a lifestyle that's like way does like a
hundred times more intense and climate
and then the end at the end of the
course your test is that you have to try
and be in the crow yeah it wasn't the
crow and then you know what wasn't the
crow how do those Brandon Lee oh sorry
that's nobody's okay fun I got to be in
the crow and he got to turn you have to
try not to that Steven wrote in and said
a theoretical and practical history of
modern drumming taught by a younger
Ginger Baker I dig it I'd take it finish
your Logan probably low that one
producer producer Logan is cheering for
you right now hey-soos Rodin and said
the fundamental structure of space-time
a course taught jointly by Stephen
Hawking Emmett Brown and the doctor oh
that's fantastic I like that that's
pretty good i like that you picked more
than one teacher at Neil wrote in to us
and said I want to learn to be an
absolutely terrible person taught by
Joffrey Baratheon hahaha little ish cuz
we can't swear on the show and then TD
school Wow
you wouldn't he that would not be a fun
class no like you well but what if
you're like teachers pet where you were
so horrible that he was like oh you're
great like you're my favorite student
it's almost like that would almost be
like learning the dark side from Darth
Vader there would only be one student
speaking of which Oh Robert wrote in to
us and said a couple of things he said I
would like to have a class taught by the
legendary Harry Houdini as well as other
famous magicians past and present and
I'd like to learn about the birth of
magic close-up escape mentalism my
fictional class we taught by Luke
Skywalker on using the force I would
like to take a class with the Star Wars

lightsabers blasters speeder bikes t16
Tie Fighters x-wings etc the final exam
will be a dogfight and a laser tag
battle using paintballs Robert I got to
tell you you you had this whole
wonderful world built up of like I'm
gonna learn how to make a TIE fighter
I'm gonna learn how to do so and then
we're gonna be paintball 5dn know if you
have all that stuff of a su you get out
there and you use those Tie Fighters you
have a real life tie fighter Doug I
didn't see any lightsaber battle
involved in their real-life lightsaber
battle you do it so we're on board I
like it yeah I like where you're at like
we're heads at that's what I'm saying um
all right guys it's time for a very last
piece of user feedback which is as
always our photog refer the day
just saying I think we're out of control
today and I got I would like it yeah uh
Andy wrote in to us and I thought this
was a very interesting email and II
wrote in and he said Ashland kale hi
love your show i have an auto download

to us while walking on a treadmill
haven't missed one yet come back to us
look at kales super excited producer
Logan come back Wow look at all the look
at all the edges hey look at that that's
50 inches this is pretty crazy you go

twenty-dollar phone with a 3 megapixel
camera not bad it's not bad pretty good
and I love this picture of like all
these they're like basically balloon
secrets a sea creature diorama but it's
like life-size dude by the way these are
huge like I saw the he had like a like a
bunch of pictures and one of them showed
kind of the scale of this and like those
little statues are like people sighs
