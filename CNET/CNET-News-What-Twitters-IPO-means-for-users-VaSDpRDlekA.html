today with a simple tweet ring but top
may have been appropriate twitter shares
opened at $45 more than seventy percent
higher than the twenty-six dollars per
share price Twitter set with that
pricing twitter is now valued at more
than 30 1 billion dollars the initial
price poppet came about an hour after
the opening bell rung by three twitter
users Star Trek actor Patrick Stewart a
nine-year-old activist Vivienne Harr and
a Boston police officer the IPO made
instant billionaires of its founders who
were at the stock exchange and instant
millionaires of some of its employees
many who celebrated from the San
Francisco headquarters and the event was
of course shared on Twitter launched in
2006 Twitter both surround 232 million
monthly users worldwide everyone from
the Pope to President Obama to Taylor
Swift and have made the term hashtag a
pop culture phenomenon hashtag is it
friday yet but twitter has yet to make a
profit this highly anticipated public
offering comes a year and a half after
Facebook's disastrous IPO initially
selling for thirty-eight dollars a share
a dip to a low of seventeen dollars and
took more than a year to rebound back to
its IPO price one of the Facebook's
biggest problems was that they hadn't
figured out how to make money off of
mobile twitter on the other hand is a
service is really built for mobile and
it always has been and they've got a lot
of advertising on mobile now that
twitter has shareholders to answer to
will users be seeing any changes
certainly you're going to see more
embedded videos and you know ads that
will be at the beginning and probably
the end of videos so if people want to
get that rich content on twitter they're
going to have to look at more
advertising now investors and twitter
we'll wait and see if in the long run
the stock is hashtag successful in San
Francisco I'm Kara Tsuboi cnet.com for
