overlords I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your scene that update will artificial
intelligence be the end of mankind some
of Technology's biggest leaders
including Stephen Hawking Bill Gates and
Elon Musk have spoken out against giving
robots AI warning that super intelligent
machines can pose a threat to human
existence musk the chief executive of
SpaceX and Tesla Motors has gone so far
to say that AI is potentially more
dangerous than nuclear weapons and we
may end up facing a scenario portrayed
in the movie Terminator when robots rise
up against us we're faced with those
concerns again in the upcoming Sony
Pictures movie chappie in the near
future crime is controlled by a robotic
police force and when a programmer gives
one of those robots consciousness it can
think and feel for itself it doesn't
turn on humans it trusts humans like a
child would trust their parents the
chappie robot isn't so far-fetched when
you look at what's being done now in
robotics DARPA's walking robot the atlas
has a power source on its back it can
walk without needing support arms and
legs have a range of motion and strength
Google created a robotic dog named spot
that doesn't fall when you kick it
google also has a team working on
artificial intelligence the team
revealed they created a computer that
can teach itself how to play Atari games
from scratch without instructions so
perhaps this is the perfect time for a
movie like chappie to come out I got to
sit down with the stars of the film Hugh
Jackman Sigourney Weaver and Charlene
oko plea to get their thoughts on a
world with AI robots
you all choppy yeah did the movie change
your shape your opinion about AI I think
when a movie has a bad computer in it it
to me it's just been programmed by the
wrong person I think if anyone is to
blame it's humans behind the robots when
it comes to the robots in the movie is
there a certain line that you would draw
on what kind of robot you be comfortable
with having in your home perhaps it
mustn't have weapons let's just let's
say that it must have a very easily
accessible off switch would you want to
live in a world with robots that have AI
yeah I'd be totally interested I'm
someone genuinely who thinks that most
of these advances will helps not destroy
us you know it would be difficult to
have like a surly robot then I would
take it back to the store I also worked
on Wally and to have a lovable robot is
sudden you would enhance your life so
much chappie opens in theaters Friday
that's it for update from our studios in
New York I am Bridget</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
