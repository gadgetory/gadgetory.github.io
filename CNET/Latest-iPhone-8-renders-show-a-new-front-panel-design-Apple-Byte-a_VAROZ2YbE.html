to the Apple buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple let's
start off with Amazon's new a smart
speaker the echo show and don't worry
for those of you thinking hey this is an
Apple show because it will all tie back
to Apple
now the echo show was announced this
week and it's an echo device with the
touch screen and video camera that can
be used for video conferencing or a home
intercom system at 230 bucks now in an
interview by gadgets 360 with Apple's
Phil Schiller just a few days before the
echo shows release he was specifically
asked about Amazon's echo and Google's
home Schiller replied my mother used to
have a saying that if you don't have
something nice to say say nothing at all
seriously Phil as the VP of one of
Tech's biggest companies that was your
response you ever wonder why people
think Apple is a Khakee company that's
full of themselves and why we bring them
down to earth with those bad apples it's
exactly because of this the smart
speaker just happens to be one of the
most exciting categories in the consumer
tech space that you have nothing to
offer two years later with rumors
claiming apples actually working on a
series speaker of their own Schiller in
fact pushed for voice assistance to have
a screen saying there's many moments
when a voice assistant is really
beneficial but that doesn't mean you'd
never want a screen so the idea of not
having a screen I don't think suits many
situations well Phil they just brought a
screen thanks to your wisdom and insight
now I'm really curious how much better a
series speaker will actually be from
Apple they have the ecosystem folks
that'll be great but the first thing
they need to do is make a smarter Siri
because you're behind Google Amazon and
Microsoft's Cortana when it comes to
voice assistance now in other Apple in
Amazon you just feels like an eternity
but a report from recode says Apple and
Amazon are close to an agreement for the
Amazon Prime video app to finally be on
Apple TV the report says Amazon
employees are expecting the app to be
available on the Apple TV in the third
quarter of this year and the catalyst
was a meeting between CEOs Tim Cook and
Jeff Bezos and that deserves a good
apple yeah finally now we know Apple
continues to tout its focus on health
and wellness with the iPhone and Apple
watch it looks like they're adding
another piece of that puzzle after
beddit and iPhone connected sleep
monitoring system announced they have
been acquired by the big a now bed it is
a thin flexible sensor that's placed
under the sheet and on top of a mattress
it collects and analyzes sleep related
data like your heart rate respiration
movement and sleep time but you know my
readings keeps showing a lot of late
night vigorous activity yeah yeah yeah
it's actually not happening now all the
collected data can be viewed through the
beddit iPhone app and it looks like
Apple is still planning to sell it in
their stores and it can be utilized in
the future with the Apple watch all
right the iPhone is doing just fine
according to Strategy Analytics new data
shows the iPhone 7 was the top-selling
smartphone in the first quarter of 2017
even if it had a drop in year-over-year
sales you can see the breakdown iPhone 7
sold 21.5 million units while the 7 plus
sold 17.4 but the surprise the Oppo r9
slid into the third spot but you won't
see the galaxy s 8 here which didn't
launch until this quarter all right
y'all ready for iPhone 8 news you know
you love it but it can also be redundant
with the same stories over and over
you've seen a lot of these but new
renders of the iPhone 8 from on leaks
and here India show up the best look at
the new iPhone based on the latest
schematics I'd like to take a moment and
really thank Tim Cook for doubling down
on secrecy you'll still see the vertical
camera the touch ID sensor on the rear
is up for debate but if you look
carefully there's a new detail included
on the front panel where the cameras and
sensors are located that has been
circulating now it's not a straight line
at the top and designer Benjamin Gaskin
makes it more clear how it will look
like based on the current rumors where
the camera and sensors on the front will
stick out when the phone is in its lock
screen but the OLED screen will create a
black bar when the phone is in use now
it's a little surprising to me if this
is really what happens because that just
isn't the clean apple lines were used to
seen and I'm actually hoping they just
keep the top edge as a black bar
entirely but we'll see and a few more
quick iPhone 8 rumors JPMorgan reports
the new iPhone will get an Enhanced
receiver with further improvements to
the waterproofing and stereo sound
quality for the phone let's just get
this phone up to an IP 68 rating for
dust and water you know so it's in line
with other phones that still
have the headphone jack and an ip68
rating and this one has been a popular 1
kg I report that iPhone production
ramped up will be delayed as late as
October or November missing its normal
September timeline due to production
difficulties which gives us an extra
month or so to talk about another extra
month of rumored delays now Apple still
has a big chunk of time to show us the
new MacBooks new Macs in general iPads
Apple watch more so there is plenty of
stuff they can throw at us until then
all right that's going to do it for this
week you can email us at the Apple bite
at cnet.com or tweet me at Brian Tong
thanks so much for watching we'll catch
all next time for another bite of the
Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
