today I'm about to attempt something
that is going to merge the old and the
new school of art I am going to learn
from the master himself bob ross and i'm
gonna paint on the ipad pro using
procreate I've only used the iPad pro
and the Apple pencil for about a couple
hours and I'm not a very good artist so
we'll see how it goes today I thought
we'd do a fantastic little painting
maybe that's maybe it's deep in the
woods and it's very dark and Misty and I
think you'll enjoy them
yellow blue satin green got it thanks
Bob Ross well I feel pretty good about
that
use this search pressure in switching
we're gonna make this small these are
the worst trees I've ever seen a while
they're green nope lighter green that's
pretty good
this it's this garbage
trees not doing so hot okay wow there's
a lot of trees happening here I gotta I
gotta get on this guy add some more feel
like I did that okay
oh we got a happy little Bush I did make
a waterfall so far so good
I think that pretty well gives us a
finish little painting so there it is
I'm I think I think I did it overall I
think I did a serviceable job it's not
great but it's not the worst piece of
art I've ever seen in my life I'm
definitely not an artist if you are an
artist really laughing at me through the
screen right now but hey Bob Ross taught
me how to make a happy stream with happy
trees and I'm okay with that
come all of us here happy baby
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
