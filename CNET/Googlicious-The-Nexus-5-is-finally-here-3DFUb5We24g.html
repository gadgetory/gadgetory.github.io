welcome to Google licious it's all the
Google that we can pack inside of a show
each week and there's a lot of it let's
get to the show and the Nexus 5 is
officially here even though we already
know pretty much what it looks like
smells like and tastes like so let's
check out seen its first look of
Google's flagship phone powerful stylish
and yes once again very affordable
Google's flagship phone of the season is
finally here hello everybody I'm Lynn LA
from CNN and today we're going to check
out the unlocked Nexus 5 at four point
nine five inches the five has the
biggest screen of all past Nexus
handsets the display features 445 pixels
per inch and like the Samsung Galaxy s4
and HTC One it has a 1920 x 1080 pixel
resolution images and videos are bright
and vivid and look razor sharp now even
though the display is bigger the device
is still comfortable to hold and
pocketable in fact it's actually thinner
and lighter than the previous nexus 4
inside this handset is a powerful 2.26
gigahertz snapdragon 800 processor from
Qualcomm this is the same blazingly fast
cpu featured in the LG g2 with this
processor the Nexus 5 is a beast of a
handset especially when you consider
that both the gs4 and the HTC One our
speed demons themselves and run
snapdragon 600 processors the five also
has a non-removable 2.3 ampere hour
battery as a Google branded device the
handset will get OS updates as they roll
in and not surprisingly it runs the
latest mobile OS Android 4.4 KitKat
KitKat comes with a number of new
features you can move entire home
screens now and there's a deeper more
seamless integration with google voice
search ok Google what's today's weather
today's forecast for san francisco is 20
degrees and clear google also brings new
features to the handsets cameras which
by the way include an eight and 1.3
megapixel shooter for instance it has
optical image stabilization which cuts
down motion blur that may result from an
unsteady hand and there's hdr+ which
fuses together several exposures and
shots to make one ideal picture despite
having all these components though the
Nexus 5 is still very affordable the 16
and 32 big models cost 349 and 399
dollars respectively for an unlocked
phone of this caliber that's an
incredibly competitive price point not
only would Android purists find us
attractive but just anyone looking for a
solid handset as well thanks for that
Lin now googs is always up to something
in SmartWatch rumors have been heating
up according to The Wall Street Journal
the g men and women have Google's own
watch ready that could go into
production within months supporting
previous reports Google now the voice
assistant that powers Google glass will
be at the heart and the report adds that
they're working to reduce the power
consumption of the device 2014 it's the
year of wearables and Tekken we're still
waiting to see a concept that makes tech
worth wearing Google now is the
foundation of this looks like the best
idea so far onto google glass it keeps
evolving in the team posted on their
Google+ page that the hardware will get
an update later this year a new mono
earbud has been added for better sound
outside and the revision will also make
glass compatible with new lines of
sunglasses and prescription frames now
explores will get their choice of colors
if they're interested in swapping to the
new unit and the exchange program looks
to start up sometime in November and it
looks like glass will still take some
time to figure itself out in the public
space a California woman was recently
ticketed for wearing Google glass while
driving cecelia body was ticketed and
told the law states do not drive a
vehicle equipped with a video monitor if
the monitor is visible to the driver and
displays anything other than vehicle
information global mapping displays
external media player mp3s or satellite
radio information this might come down
to what was actually being displayed on
glass at the time she was ticketed but
in other public spaces some bars and
workplaces have already banned glass and
the UK
indicated they plan to make it illegal
to wear while driving now google also
recently had a morning with Google+
event where they tatted 540 million
active users of the service still
nothing close to Facebook's 1 billion
and change but Plus isn't nearly as
annoying now they announced some new
features the biggest one being the
integration of SMS into the hangouts app
which is expected for Android 4.4 KitKat
hangouts also gets location sharing and
allows you to click a small icon before
posting and most importantly really
important stuff their support for
animated gifs as well you'll also be
able to schedule hangouts on air and
promote it with a dedicated watch page
the video experience has been improved
with fixes that also enhance a webcam
lighting and a bunch of new photo and
video features like auto awesome movie
that cuts a bunch of your related video
clips and puts them together for you in
a fun presentation and check this out
google motorola is partnering with
phonebloks creator dave hakkens who set
the internet on fire with his modular
smartphone concept that allows you to
swap out different smartphone components
by fitting them to a base motherboard as
needed or desired really just blow your
mind amazing idea now Motorola is going
to call it project ara they want the
phone to be open source and they say
they want to do for hardware what
Android has done for software creating a
vibrant third-party developer ecosystem
Motorola will presumably build the main
endoskeleton of the product and
third-party developers will be able to
build and release their own modules for
the phone now with motorola's backing
this is really a platform that we're
gonna see happen and it's really
exciting to see how this all comes
together in the end all right that's
gonna do it for this week's show what do
you think about project ara email us at
Google licious at cnet com or tweet me

your comments next week i'm brian Tong

Google goodness this week and we'll see
