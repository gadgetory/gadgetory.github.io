one of the categories biggest names with
its impressive receivers leading the way
hi I'm ty Pendlebury and today I'm
looking at the onkyo TX NR 636 receiver
it's the company's latest mid-range
receiver and while it continues the
impressive work of previous years it
also hasn't changed that much and this
could be to its disadvantage the NL 636
is a 7.1 channel model which features
pretty much any feature you could ask
for the latest decoders including Dolby
Atmos which is coming onboard Wi-Fi and
even a turntable input the onboard Wi-Fi
enables music streaming from services
such as Spotify and Pandora and this
also comes with Bluetooth support
design-wise this is a pretty macho and
intimidating looking machine but the
inclusion of direct source buttons such
as DVD and game are a big help for
usability connectivity includes seven
HDMI ports which interestingly includes
support for the latest 2.0 and hdcp 2.2
standards there's no such thing as
future-proof but this does get near to
it as far as usability is concerned the
remote has a few too many buttons
especially when compared to the sleek
Sony remote and the bare-bones menus are
harder to read the most on any size to
screen when it comes to performance
though the six three six does very well
with both convincing surround and
musical performance the ability to
stream and playback high res audio
capably means this is a decent choice
for audio files too at $600 the onkyo TX
NR 636 is a little pricey but it offers
a lot of features and solid performance
but if you're looking for sound quality
first I recommend the cheaper Sony TN
1050 instead this is ty Pendlebury for
