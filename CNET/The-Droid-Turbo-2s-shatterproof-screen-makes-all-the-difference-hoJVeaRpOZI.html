just dropped this phone from about four
or five feet onto a hard rock surface
and the screen looks pristine this phone
has been through the wringer mind you
already our New York editors have
dropped this phone smashed it against
surfaces this thing has a giant bend in
the phone already scratches all around
the corners and yet this screen hasn't
cracked once instead of having a single
layer of glass that's laminated directly
to the screen for optimum clarity it has
five layers for protection there's a bit
of an air gap between the droid turbo 2
screen layers so it can't transmit quite
as much light as other phones it doesn't
get quite as bright especially outdoors
the other thing is because it doesn't
have that gorilla glass on the front it
can't necessarily resist scratches to
make up for that Motorola has actually
built a screen protector onto the screen
and you can buy a new one for $30 if you
scratch it I actually like it to design
a little bit better than the Moto X pure
edition and some of the previous
Motorola designs we've seen recently
it's got a nice set of metallic buttons
here that are indented into the frame
for easy grip I love the ridges that
Motorola uses on the power button and
you can customize the whole thing with
Motorola's motor maker website and while
you can't replace the droid turbo 2 S
battery motorola does have a removable
SD card slot in here speaking of the
battery that's the other reason you
might want to consider this phone
motorola promises 48 hours of battery
life on a charge while we didn't get
quite that in our tests it's definitely
one of the longest-lasting phones we've
used you plug it into the included
charger that comes with this phone and
it'll charge up 1/4 of the battery in
just 15 minutes
you can plop it on a wireless charging
pad and work at home or in the car and
it'll top it up the rest of the way that
it's gotten both forms of wireless
charging built in the only other company
that does that is Samsung on the galaxy
s6 line I don't need to tell you the
droid turbo 2 is a blazing fast phone I
don't need to list off its specs this
Snapdragon 810 processor the 3 gigabytes
of RAM the quad HD display other phones
have those things
but they don't have unbreakable screens
so we decided to cap off this review
with little something special as soon as
you're done watching this and back to
cnet.com you won't believe what we did
to this four phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
