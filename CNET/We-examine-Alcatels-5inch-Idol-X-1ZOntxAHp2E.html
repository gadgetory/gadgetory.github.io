tew/cnet here at mobile world congress
2013 we're taking a look at the alcatel
one touch idol x now the alcatel one
touch idol x may not have the snappiest
name but it does have one of the
snappiest processes that your money can
buy specifically it's got a 1.5
gigahertz quad-core processor which
should mean that this phone is capable
of handling intensive apps or
graphically demanding games for example
if I spin it around on the back you can
see it's got an 8 megapixel camera now
there are actually going to be two
different versions of this phone one
with a single sim card slot and one with
a dual SIM card slot the difference
between them is going to be the single
sim card slot one will have a micro SD
card slot as well and the 8 megapixel
camera while the dual-sim version is
going to have a 13 megapixel camera but
won't have the micro SD card slot
instead it's going to have 16 gigabytes
of built-in storage the design is quite
nice this bezel around the site is
extremely narrow which gives his phone a
very classy look and it looks as if the
actual display is very close to the top
of the glass which I think always makes
a phone look quite classy if you spin
this on its side alcatel is very proud
of the fact that this phone only
measures seven millimeters thick so it
should slide into your pockets without
any problems the luxury doesn't end with
the hardware though this phone also has
a very recent version of android
specifically it's running version 4.2
point 1 which is a very recent version
of jelly bean the screen looks really
good it's colorful it's bright and this
is a 1080p display so everything looks
really sharp that's going to make this
phone a really good choice for web
browsing because text will look very
crisp and it should handle high
definition video without any problems so
it looks like quite a nice high-end
phone i would say that there's nothing
about it that i haven't really seen on
other mobiles but that said it's nice to
have everything tied up neatly in one
little package can it compete though
with devices like whatever Samsung's got
cooking up next door maybe the google
nexus 4 i'm not sure you'll have to wait
for the full review but for now there's
some stuff to look forward to hear it's
going to be coming out worldwide before
the summer so keep an eye out on the
west road to cnet's and this is the
alcatel one touch idol x
