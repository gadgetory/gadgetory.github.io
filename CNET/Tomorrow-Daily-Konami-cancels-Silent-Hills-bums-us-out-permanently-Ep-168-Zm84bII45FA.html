and a little tiny robot that can pull
two thousand times its body weight and
there is a ton of drama happening over
at a major studio including game
cancellations that are making a lot of
gamers cries so what do we need to talk
about that it's tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I'm
Ashley sceva and Ruby's always anonymous
a long weekends long weekend a lot of
controversial stuff I mean the Joker
thing happened this weekend's there was
also a huge tragedy yep and this ah can
we talk about that first really briefly
so before we kick things off today we
our hearts are with Nepal the earthquake
in Nepal took the lives of some very so
many people I think it's over said
almost 4000 now yeah so many people and
it's going to be more and if you can
please donate to groups like the Red
Cross who are on the ground helping
people there we just we can't believe
something this terrible happened and and
it just sucks sucks we don't to bring
the show down but important hopefully
you're able to do something I know that
we all don't have access and and
hopefully if you know anyone from in
that area from that area or doctor our
thoughts are with you on that too yeah
really I mean it's very crazy and just a
sad tragedy terrible right we wanted to
make sure we address that before we got
started because it's super important oh
so hopefully you can donate be good
humans yes be good humans uh but let's
let's talk about really quick before we
get in a headlock oh this weekend
another thing happened the heroes of the
dorm uh oh yeah competition shout out to
Michelle morrow she did a great job um
and so heroes of the storm was broadcast
on espn2 and it was this big college
tournament and the winners ended up
getting a college tuition for the rest
of their college career amazing super
awesome um so blizzard was kind enough
because i was on a local radio stations
weren't talking about it was kind enough
to send over some beta keys for heroes
of the storm for our lovely tomorrow
daily viewers to to capture that's you
that's you so if you're listening to
this and you want one we have 10 so um
the I think what email I think email cuz
then that we have time stamps we can
pick the first 10 oh okay I think email
us email us tomorrow at cnet com and we
will get you a key if you're one of the
if you're the first 10 callers like for
send email
ours gets a beta key will create a clan
and will start to team well we'll get
college tuition so there you go so yeah
email us you saw that you saw the lower
third now send an email get it get a key
code new data now it's time for the
headlines no sorry so many things that
happen this weekend so they did yeah
what's okay okay since they're just show
so all right yeah all right first off
this is this about Konami all right lots
of stuff is happening over at Konami
it's got a lot of people scared there's
been a lot of rumors or what's going on
but let's just I'm just gonna get right
out for the first thing is that silent
Hills has been canceled no silent Hills
is a continuation of Silent Hill tread
tragedy uh trillith like a g-series and
it was it was super exciting because
Norman Reedus was going to be in it
garen lo del Toro was involved and so is
click today Okajima who does the Metal
Gear series but and everyone was excited
about how to demo out and it's been it's
been cancelled officially as of this
morning Konami relationally got released
a statement this is this is just the
beginning of the shake ups that people
are worried about over there okay I
Konami because there's been going on for
like a month since I think I have it
here as April nineteenth okay um or
march 19th March 19-19 okay so couple
mine so much so uh about about a month
ago a you today Okajima it makes metal
gear he's working on phantom fancy his
metal gear yes I guess metal gear he's
making metal gear solid 5 right now and
so that's what he's working on with
Konami okay well about a month ago uh
Kojima Productions was changed to konami
digital entertainment which led to
rumours that he was going to be leaving
ok well the Konami came up and was just
like no no no we're just trying to make
sure the konami's name is up front well
then they canceled Silent Hill right so
he'll sorry and then on Friday on Friday
they took their the Konami took their
their their name out of the new york
stock exchange oh they delisted their
company delisted the company from the
new york stock exchange still in the
Tokyo and London Stock Exchange this is
still that's a huge shake up over there
too
and then uh yeah and then then some
people were like then he started taking
a coogi misnamed off of their website oh
wow I feel like the metal gear cuz I
heyday Okajima yeah on the branding and
stuff like that what is going on over
there and then there was like a
confirmation from Koji Kojima that yes
he's going to follow through for Metal
Gear so there's a lot of questions about
what's going on um there's obviously the
about the new york stock exchange thing
their actual they have like make slot
machines and that apparently is the most
profitable part of them i did not know
that i learned something new so it's
like they're thinking that like maybe
there's some change ups that are gonna
happen obviously they're not focusing on
silent house anymore which is a huge
franchise yeah a lot of buzz around it
kojima is one of their is there big dog
so they're pulling that out so like we
have no idea what's going on what do you
think is going on i think it's i think
it's good i think kojima is like he's
out he's dies out I think he's out do
you think he wants out or do you think
Kaname is sort of done being associated
with him if you this is total conjecture
percent speculate at this could just
completely off kale speculation yeah I'm
not not completely off of this i think
you know they're trying to make a metal
gear movie mm-hmm so I think maybe
Kojima's just like I could you know like
I'll figure out a way to do this myself
hmm they're just good Konami just wants
to have their name there instead of like
if Kojima leaves that that his name will
still be there another sort of deal
going on over saying the gaming thing I
don't know I don't know it seems like I
mean a lot of times when these companies
delist themselves from the new york
stock exchange it means some kind of
restructuring is and they happen they
kept dropping that they kept saying
restructuring that bitch is never a good
it's like a fancy way of saying bags see
it's like a bad way of saying like we're
in trouble um but again this a lot of
speculation just because there's a lot
of things going on this is such a
general term because it's all in stocks
exchange and people leaving moving and
but it's it's a huge tragedy that we
lose silent Hills potentially in the
gaming world that's a sad thing and
potentially
kajima I mean if he leaves Konami then
like what are they wear how do you go
forward without that like you were
saying like that's their big dog like
that's their dog in the fight it's like
we have Kojima yeah and kijima has been
all about like hey this is a this metal
gear 5 is like a refreshing of the brand
from big bosses standpoint and whatnot
I'm heavily invested in the Metal Gear
series that's kind of like my one of my
bread and butter yeah could you so many
gamers like there this is a huge this is
a legendary game franchise I mean this
is not small potatoes this is a big deal
and gaming so but this is this is a
story that is still developing oh yeah
so even as weird saying this now there
might have been something that happened
yeah and there may be something that
happened tomorrow because like I said
Friday was the announcement of the of
the stock exchange thing month this
morning was a silent Hills officially
cut crazy stuff all the shows tell us
how you feel tell us i co that's our
hashtag of the day is TD Konami we I
want to know your unbridled conjecture
and speculation what do you think is
going on over at Konami and and where do
you think you know what do you think the
outcome is going to be is it gonna be
that Konami Lee is kajima leaves is it
gonna be that maybe there's something
different in the cards for Kojima how
you know why do you think all this stuff
is going on aside from restructuring
because I have a feeling we all kind of
know that that's what I'm never gonna
get another Castlevania to is that what
we're now listen Konami just release the
rights for Castlevania just somebody
Simon Belmont in super smash brothers
thank you yes let's do that thing cuz
that's I love science Simon Belmont
something I would play smash brothers a
lot more I where's my Simon Belmont
amiibo that's what I want stop putting
me buzz all rights just sign no more me
can we just do the next door okay so
yeah all right help us out here I want
to tell you about paper pulse paper
pulse is really interesting because it
is it uses conducive ink cartridges so
you can actually like put it in
cartridge inside a printer and print out
sort of a circuit board because it's
conducive ink so like here's a guy using
a in playing a little game on paper with
LEDs cool so to be fair these are layers
like there there are layers involved in
this obviously the top layer is like the
fun design the game or what
it is that you want to do so maybe like
a business card or they had other
options other things in there that as
examples that you could use but so you
have this bottom layer that is printed
out with conducive ink and then you put
these stickers to act as they're sort of
like components for your for your paper
they show you and the printout is really
cool so this is like a drag-and-drop
interface and it you tell it what you
want it to do what you want the paper to
do and it creates the code for you
generates it automatically so you don't
have to be a coder to use this and you
have a you have a microcontroller so you
have like a little tiny micro controller
and then what happens is is you print
this thing out with the conducive ink
and it shows you exactly where to put
all of your components including your
microprocessor and then you put the top
layer on it after you lay out all the
stuff so see those are the those are the
different layers so you attach all your
components it shows you like oh yeah
okay we're going to cut out the middle
part and put the microprocessor in the
middle and here's where all the stuff is
and basically like so you build this in
conjunction with that with that app so
you say well here's what I want all my
lights to be and then it shows you
exactly what the blueprint needs to be
on the second layer which is kind of
cool yeah so it makes in essence it
makes your paper it makes paper
interactive so there's this is like a
really cool thing so it generates the
code for you so you don't have to do it
yourself you you plug in your
microprocessor via USB and automatically
like sends that code to your
microprocessor so knows exactly what it
should be looking for it actually offers
suggestions on how to fine-tune your
code like let's say you only have a code
for a light to go off if you press a
button but maybe or like to go on if you
press a button but maybe you haven't put
in the code for the light to go off if
you release the button so this is like
hey maybe you want to put in that code
so it helps you sort of like make things
more fine-tuned so what they were saying
is that technology like this we always
like to talk about goals yeah what's the
goal so goals could be really neat stuff
like interactive packaging so we could
go to the supermarket and there would be
on your cereal box because these are
very inexpensive components the ink is
just about as expensive as a standard
inkjet printer the conducive ink and
then also all of the part of the pieces
and the parts the the components the
electrical components are pennies on the
dime if you buy them in bulk
so you can just crumple up a project and
just throw it out and just keep the
microcontroller which is pretty neat but
they were saying yeah like maybe you
would have like cereal boxes or so these
like little games and stuff like that so
this guy's like playing a game where you
get to the top of the tower if you tap
the things diet tracking cards you can
say oh I've had three servings of
vegetables and vegetables today and like
you have this little card and these are
all super early prototypes but they were
saying that they are developing more
sophisticated ways and more complex ways
of using this tech and they're saying it
so someday we might see maybe business
cards I was going to say I liked your
business card idea I do not like this
Gangnam style card though yeah that's a
little not a big fan of that but no um i
like i like the business card idea
that's really cool it is pretty fun so i
thought that was really neat so
interactive like computerized paper so
kind of cool and then the second story
okay so you got another story I got one
more is super strong robots but they're
tiny so it kind of reminds me of ants
how they can care lift and carry a lot
larger mass of their weight as we all
learn from honey i shrunk the kids um
yeah said bugs life yeah and bugs life
um so this comes from mechanical
engineers at Stanford University this
look at that little tiny robot on the
wall climbing is it's carrying all that
stuff at the bottom what yeah so these
are super strong robots that can pull up
to a hundred times heavier than their
own weight so these ones are actually
going up a wall which is pretty
impressive but it's a hundred times
their way it's pretty awesome and how
this works is they have adhesive on the
bottom of the robots feet that let'em
grip walls kind of like a gecko and when
the weight increases the surface area of
the the sticky foot actually expands so
the surface area gets bigger it makes it
easier to grip that's incredible yeah so
they took nature was a lot they inspired
a lot by nature here so these are some
of the other bots that go horizontally
across the surface one of them is called
you tug and it can pull two thousand
times its weight is this you tug right
here I this might be you this is Utah
this is you chug right here for this is
incredible so yeah they're dragons
things and then there's little tiny ones
that can you that's a robot at the top
and that's pulling a paperclip because
it's a hundred times its weight isn't
that nuts so um these robots are
really cool and they were saying that
they could be used in emergency
situations yeah for example getting a
rescue like a rope up to somebody in a
burning building they could also be used
in situations like I think my favorite
one was construction and hauling so
they're like if we needed to get some
like blocks up a building we would build
bigger robots I can carry heavier
weights and we just send them right at
the size of buildings-- crazy there are
so many possibilities so many and why I
think my favorite fact about that you
jug robot is it can pull two thousand
times its body weight cool if you don't
have an idea of what the equivalent of
that is for a person it would be like
kale pulling a blue whale behind him
that's how that's how much more weight
these BOTS can pull pretty good I know
you can't what you've been doing
Crossfit it's what I train with a lot of
blue whales but that you like that's to
encourage so many so many possibilities
with this yeah it's their Super sure on
robots and it's just really neat i love
that they're going up buildings and like
across surfaces and they're basically
they're saying the next step would be to
build bigger versions of these robots to
carry their weight yes maybe how the
Egyptians made the pyramids is maybe the
exact way that it was course we know
aliens gave them that technology
obviously otherwise they just would have
never happened but uh yeah I'm gonna
assume tiny I'm gonna assume tiny robots
we couldn't even see help anjaneri the
block you're like trying to bring in the
groceries you just have your little
robot thing and then pop that thing on
the ground just like brings your
groceries in like it yeah you need to
tow your car somewhere I'll be where you
imagine opening a little like first aid
kit you need to tell your car somewhere
it's just this robot that's like this
big and you just put it in the fridge
I'm saying it's small and these guys are
awesome I like to do what are they going
for Stanford University oh great the
camp engineers at Stanford so yeah good
job guys guys you should have placed
should have played here as the storm try
to gear tuition paid for ouch I heard
it's not nothing I don't think they
would have made these robot that's
probably true yeah you probably wouldn't
have had time to make those robots so I
guess it's a win-win for everybody
involved thats it for our headlines we
will be right back with a round of back
at her hackett something i think you
will be very interested in and we also
have our user feedback and our phone
target for the day so it'll click away
it's tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show it's Monday
which means it's time to look at a
particular crowdfunding effort that we
are interested in tell you if we would
give our money to it or not it's time
for back adore Hackett kill I'd like to
tell you today about the couch 'let okay
all right do you know what that is can
you tell what that is based on the name
the couch lit it sounds a good little
couch it's a tiny little couch a little
couch a couch lip well am I wrong you
are wrong okay good this house done at
the sound of the couch lit is actually
um so you know how you're sitting on
your couch maybe your binge-watching
daredevil and your battery's running out
of juice cuz it's the end of your day
and you don't want to like usually on a
couch there's no outlets really like
right nearby unless it's up against a
wall so kind of a beverage outlet got it
yes it's a couch outlet so we have some
video of this pretty interesting they
did this video or they're like oh if
you're laying in bed like which this is
actually true for me I have to really
reach for my phone and I don't get to
take it very far because it's you know
to third so this is the couch lit it's
this little tiny device that you you can
wedge between your couch cushions and
it'll stay there and it's two USB ports
so you can just like plug in your phone
right there and you can stay on your
couch or use it in your bed so they also
have this like little hinge that you can
flap out to make an L shape and then you
just sort of slide it under your
mattress so that it's stable like it
doesn't like flop around or fall over
and yeah see there you go so you put it
in your couch cushions you stuff it in
there and it's got two USB ports you can
plug in your phone whatever and then
it's got it comes with a six-foot-long
at us because obviously you do have to
plug that into something but it comes to
the six foot long USB cord so you can
plug it into a nearby wall outlet a
walmart back it you're you're in you
don't even know much it costs I don't
care this is something that should have
existed a long time ago I agree no I
think even couches we built with that
stuff in it I was talking that this oh
yes just yesterday I I don't say yelled
at but had had a confrontation heated
yes discussion cuz my girlfriend thinks
that it's okay to have the wires going
from the opposite wall cutting straight
through the living room and I trip on
them every single time that's not it was
like there is an outlet fire hazard I'm
gonna get to that there's no it might be
I on the couch plug it in there but
anyway you're it should be more
convenient it's Milton it actually
should be more convenient because this
is the world we live in now what do you
like it or not you're getting bored
you're going in your phone yeah I will
say this though I am worried about fires
because you definitely some sort of that
Fang even with surge protectors there's
chance of a surge and it being right
next to a flammable material on a couch
made of rubber in it can start a little
fire yes from experience because I had a
fire in my house as a child's burned up
all my stuff that's not good it was
through a surge protector Ohio it was
supposed to not even do that but it
started a fight in so this is a
potential be careful risk but I'm still
back said yeah I still take my chances
to my chances um okay so they wanted
thirty thousand dollars it's on
IndieGoGo again couch 'let is the name
of it they asked for 30,000 they
currently have over 45,000 with like 40
days left so they're definitely gonna
make these they're gonna go into
production people love them like they're
they're just like you either like I'm
and I I need an outlet near my couch
there it is thirty dollars 24 of them
right now 24 bucks right now gets you to
early bird soul free cheap Wow and then
I think it's like three dollars shipping
or something like that and that's one of
those things your friends come over and
they're like a charge my phone you're
like yes Mickey it's my hair in between
Lee I was just telling my husband this
week and more we're watching daredevil
make you know what I think I think we
need like a USB hub Knicks next to our
TV just as like a charging station for
our friends and stuff like that feels
like a thing we need to have now feel
like I just want a couple of couch let's
put them on each side you're good maybe
I'm too easily impressed but I think
this is genius pretty good idea I feel
like you undersold it from the very
beginning you don't understand that this
is gonna change the way you charge your
phone I everybody's charging your stuff
alternate at home I know even last night
I was sitting there with one percent I'm
just like I can't I was too I can't make
it to the low I'm like worried you gotta
browse reddit I got a tweet wasting time
I know it was terrible oh what a Logan
he's in three three out of three there
you go back it back it all around good
find by the way yeah I go go signs you
get better on Kickstarter
yeah i think well indiegogo they let you
keep any amount so they could have
gotten less than the actual amount asked
for and then they would still be able to
keep it and develop it but it might take
longer okay so they're saying that they
hit their goal which means they will
deliver by december and there you have
it okay well then that's even better
Chris now I'm gonna buy a buttload they
had a six-pack of them for like for like
forty dollars is so cheap and then they
those were sold out they did that for
like the first day or two but they're
still really inexpensive like the tears
are really i am buying it i am buying at
least a hundred dollars worth of these
i'm not even kidding because i know i
like all my family getting for christmas
they're all tech heads and i just think
I'm just gonna be like the stocking
stuff everybody has a smartphone so it's
like that's a no-brainer or gift I mean
that's a pretty easy gift I'm sorry if
I'm Way too excited about this you can't
on you like we're gonna be yep it's
pretty cool i'm stoked on that i liked
it thank you actually you're learning to
this there you go yeah this is great
you're welcome alright guys I we got to
talk about what you think about NASA's
modular robotic vehicle that we talked
about last week so it's time for your
user feedback okay so i know you're
buying couch lay on the couch we got to
talk a little bit about the TDM RV
hashtag we asked you guys use less we
tell us how you would use NASA's modular
robotic vehicle which was so cool and a
lot of you guys came up with some good
answers so Neil wrote in and said
automated mrv as an emergency vehicle
that can get to patients quickly that
normal vehicles can't reach like that
yes good one yeah I'm a horse Christian
wrote in and said I would like to see a
pacman themed mrv chasing ghosts themed
em rvs for endless autonomous fun cuz
AJ's can drive themselves so you just
have them like you know I just randomly
like stopped it like la cienega and
you're just so used to see you like your
back man chasing a bunch of ever be this
year's like really los angeles absolute
Fauria i know i wrote in and said okay
go the band okay go with the mrv would
just sit be simply awesome i would love
to see okay go do a synchronized to
music video with for mr vs that would be
amazing yeah that's create they should
hire you is there a next music video
creative director who
director knows who creative director
Noah you know uh and then also dave
wrote in to us and said us an email but
doesn't have to do the mrv he said hey
guys thought kale could relate to this I
see this on my kitchen counter at least
once a day oh my god and it's a high
just wrap up and splenda packet oh my
god okay have you ever been have you
haven't been following along there's
been the epic saga of my girlfriend
leaving sugar packets right next to the
coffee machines for the trash can
bouncing this weekend too I love getting
pictures from this weekend and guess
what date was his name Dave Dave Dave
also found something it's an epidemic
this thing is spreading like wildfire do
not let this happen in your house people
this is not good oh my god oh my god so
I just love it he said can we pull like
route can we pull it back up again Logan
can be pretty sure we have the the
picture again he says you actually says
our kitchen is set up a little different
kales you actually have to turn around
and walk a couple feet to the trashcan
oh hang in there Dave look at this it
doesn't go make a nice to just well it's
just like one little small packet I love
how upset you are by it's just
ridiculous it's every day it's like
that's like that's so funny it's like if
somebody left a little note on my desk
every day that was just like I hate you
you're the worst it's just a H I'm just
like come on I don't leave that little
note don't do that come on hang in there
Dave hang in there Dave yeah solidarity
splenda solidarity we're with you bro
all right guys we're gonna talk about
our last piece of user feedback which is
always our phone target for the day
so this is actually not from Scott Scott
emailed us but this picture was not
taken by Scott this is by Scotts
daughter Scott's daughter took this
picture he wrote in and said my
nine-year-old daughter took this on a
school field trip with my iphone 6 plus
sad to say that my daughter takes better
pictures than I do looks like it owned
can I can I can I just suggest maybe
that this is a family of pigs that are
on a school field trip so that Scott and
his daughter are also like sentient
piglets like Charlotte's Web or babe
that's terrifying no I think it's really
cute babe was adorable what do you mean
you want to think that far males are
watching our show yeah alright fair
enough I really like that you're so much
stuff mostly a trap yeah I'm they went
to another farm okay oh they saw their
relatives how they were going to visit
some relatives it really is a good I I
like that she got all closing circle c
and i bet you scott wouldn't i got all
close and personal with it he wouldn't
