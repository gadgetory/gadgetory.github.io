Bakalar and this is your cnet update
yesterday google introduced keep the new
mobile and web-based note storing
service that looks to aim at products
like evernote boasting a simple
easy-to-use interface keep will work
with google drive so that all of your
notes are synced across different
platforms can stay on top of your world
by quickly and easily organizing
everything you want to remember no
matter where you are finalized or list
users can edit their notes from either
their phone or the web and information
will be saved everywhere you can also
use voice dictation and photos to help
enhance each note you take the
blackberry store has topped 100,000 apps
30,000 of which were just added in the
last seven weeks the milestone arrives
just in time for the new z10 to land on
store shelves and notable apps to the
store include offerings from kindle CNN
opentable skype and viber among others
the store has been criticized in the
past for a lack of software so this
should help ease those worries still
blackberry has a long uphill battle
ahead of it though as Windows Phone 8
slowly begins to gain popularity all
behind of course Android and iOS
speaking of app stores Google Play might
be getting a major overhaul pretty soon
screenshot photos have surfaced on
Android enthusiasts site droid-life of
what's being called Google Play
four-point-oh they show a much sleeker
interface and simplistic theme
throughout though it's not totally
confirmed that this is in fact the new
store we'll update you on the latest
once we get word well we might as well
continue today's mobile app theme show
with news that pandora has now hit
Windows Phone 8 the big news here is
that the app will be free and stay ad
free for a limited time new adopters
will get all of the premium freebie
features including unlimited streaming
those perks will end in 2014 when it
goes back to the four dollar a month and
free but ed supported models and finally
YouTube has just announced a major
milestone of one
billion monthly users this is pretty
crazy put it like this if YouTube were a
country it would be the third largest on
the planet behind China and India that's
pretty impressive so why the recent jump
in traffic it's because of the amount of
multi screen users those of us who
consume YouTube not just on our computer
screen but also our phones and tablets
so why not join in on the fun and check
out our youtube channel and that's at
youtube.com slash cnet that's your tech
