report this week craigslist turns on us
Apple turns on us and white people turn
on themselves but first it's the gadje
of the week the gadget of the week is
the international dance party it's an
art installation in Berlin created by a
guy called Nicholas Roy it uses radar to
sense dancing near it and then it opens
up to reveal a disco ball flashing
lights loud electronica music there's
even a fog machine LED sign displays
instructions in over 20 languages what
are the instructions simple dance to
start the party now if you keep dancing
the international dance party will reach
its highest level of intensity rewarding
you with a blue beacon on the top and
grout effect below it's pretty crazy
device the only problem I see with it is
that you have to be dancing near it in
order to activate the music so somebody
had to be dancing before the music
started which pretty much means that
you're throwing a party full of crazy
people and now for the news the
Department of Justice this week approved
a merger deal between XM and Sirius
meaning the two struggling satellite
radio companies can now become one giant
struggling satellite radio company an
Oregon man lost almost all of his
belongings this week after a nasty
craigslist hopes someone posted a phony
ad saying that Robert Salisbury had
moved away and left all his stuff
including his horse for the taking
Salisbury got a call about the ad drove
to his house only to find people hauling
away his stuff and refusing to give it
back he said that when he tried to stop
them they actually just showed him the
craigslist ad as proof that they were in
the right and yeah I know the same exact
thing happened in Washington State just
last year see this is all because the
Pacific Northwest has this little-known
common law it's kind of similar to
possession is nine-tenths of the law
it's a craigslist post at 716 to the law
and that's good note for us this week
Apple has been taking a lot of flack for
including safari in its Apple update
program there
basically attempting to install an
entirely new browser on your system and
kind of pretending that it's just a
software update not cool and you know
all this got me thinking about Apple
again I think I finally figured out my
problem with them Apple is my bad
boyfriend check it out here's Apple he's
like this crazy hot really good looking
bad boy rebel type he's got money he
drives a fabulous car we go to all these
great parties together he knows all the
coolest people he's like the guy I
always wanted but the longer were
together I just kind of feel like it's
kind of a jerk I mean he's always
telling me how to do things like no you
can't transfer one photo at a time in
iphoto you have to do them all at the
same time what are you stupid he's like
pushing me around telling me what
applications have to install what cell
phone carrier have to use and he only
cares about how I look like he wants me
to have these fancy outfits but he
doesn't care if I have enough
accessories or if I'm too cold or if
these heels hurt my feet as long as I
look good you know it just doesn't feel
like a healthy relationship I just think
I have to start doing what's right for
me and I'm gonna have to dump that jerk
no matter how hot and Richie is
sometimes it's better to go with the
ugly nice guy and now it's time for
what's blog in the team's this week it's
everybody's favorite new blog stuff
white people like this blog first
appeared about two months ago and it is
all the rage the authors even landed a
book deal already the site is basically
a vicious satire of the stereotypical
white person it's got this list as of
presstime of ninety two things i don't
know i mean i've been reading it i'm not
sure how accurate it is like i went
through the list not only matched up
with coffee farmers markets organic food
wes anderson movies to yoga gifted
children travelling microbreweries wine
Wrigley Field snowboarding daily show
colbert report breakfast places arrested
an element mats like sushi public radio
Asian fusion food whole foods you guys
should collapse touch and gadgets Oh God
Japan knowing what's best for poor
people I totally do I just do expensive
sandwiches recycling being the only
white person around Oscar parties
bottles of water musical comedy
multilingual children hating
corporations outdoor performance clothes
dinner parties and ten Francisco god
it's my shame on display I'm Mollywood
