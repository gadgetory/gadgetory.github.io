Goodwin on the floor again at the 2013
Frankfurt Motor Show and today we're
taking a look at the Toyota Yaris hybrid
our concept and I know what you're
thinking when you see Yaris and you see
the letter R that you're just talking
about maybe a body kit and suspension in
about 113 horsepower but in this case
the Yaris hybrid R is actually powered
by a 1.6 liter version of Toyotas racing
engine that Hybrid Synergy Drive system
is actually going to be worth 300
horsepower to the front wheels but
that's not all they're also two electric
motors worth 16 horsepower apiece on
each rear wheel bringing the total
system power to 420 horsepower that's a
lot of power you've also got the
consummate suspension upgrades and body
styling that kind of looks like a Toyota
Yaris a - pfft
you got that sort of a trapezoidal
grille that was very forward light now I
can't even imagine it with 420
horsepower in a Toyota Yaris with
all-wheel drive even feels like because
there's really no precedent for this in
Toyotas lineup it's nothing like it
they've never built moving lights before
and I'll probably never get an
opportunity to experience it so they'll
probably only make this one the whole
purpose of this Yaris hybrid our concept
is to attract attention to the more
standard eco friendly Toyota Yaris that
they get in the world market now we
don't get that car in North America just
yet but hey keep your eyes peeled so
we've got a really big hybrid push
coming up and anything could happen
we'll have an answer on goodwin on the
floor of the 2013 Frankfurt Auto Show
taking a look at the Toyota Yaris hybrid
our concept it's crazy
