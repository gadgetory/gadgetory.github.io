year right and and this year I have two
one is to run 365 miles so an average of
one mile a day and then the other one is
to build that is not a challenge yeah I
got my lit a I know so that's that was
that was the easy one yeah you're doing
this to build an AI that controls my
home okay that's a little more challenge
yeah you know doing something physical
is good in order to offset all of the
sitting that I'm gonna be doing right
now fighting miss AI so the AI is going
pretty well I can now I can now
basically talk into my phone and tell it
to turn off the lights or turn up and
down the temperature good let people in
through the gate you know the new thing
that I'm working on is we have this
camera at the gate and it can now look
at who's coming up and even before they
ring the doorbell know if I want to let
them in so you know if you know take
like my wife for example she's a good
one to let in right so you can just walk
up and it's a caper so I come in right
so that um that is you know that's a
pretty fun one that that that we're
working on and you know maybe I'll do a
live in a few weeks demoing some of this
right isn't it funny how we work so hard
to just eliminate a little bit of effort
I mean to get the door it's not that
much work but we are going to put in a
tremendous amount of work to just save
us walking to the door and opening it
yeah you know this one is the challenge
is more about the practice of writing
this code having it right you know I
mean in a few years I think there will
be better technology that can do a lot
of the stuff but I enjoy the process of
writing something that can understand
the language and understand voice that
can you know do the vision processing of
like as someone's walking up to the door
can try to figure out who it is and you
know that that part is interesting to me
and I think you know in running Facebook
you know the technology company it's I
think also good practice even if I'm
completely out of touch with the stuff
that people here are doing then I'm
probably not going to do that good of a
job of running the company so so there's
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
