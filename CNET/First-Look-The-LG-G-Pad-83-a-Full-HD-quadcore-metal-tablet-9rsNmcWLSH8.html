ephah tech show in Berlin this time I'm
taking a look at the LG G pad 8.3 now as
the name suggests this is an 8 inch
tablet from LG a full HD screen
and a quad-core processor the G pad is
only eight point three mil thick and
weighs just 338 grams so you won't
struggle to carry it around with you the
weight it does have does make it feel
satisfyingly premium something that's
definitely helped by the old glass front
and this aluminium back panel it's eight
inch size does mean that it's not going
to easily slide into your jeans pocket
though the screen has a full 1920 by
1200 pixel resolution as a pixels had
been squashed into quite a small area it
means that things look satisfyingly
crisp it's bright and very bold too so
is at least good enough for watching
Netflix movies under the hood is a beefy
1.7 gigahertz quad-core processor with 2
gigabytes of RAM now it should be more
than enough juice for any tasks you're
likely to throw at it it's running on
Android 4.2.2 jelly bean and LG has
chucked in its cue pair app that
connects you to a smart phone to display
phone alerts on the biggest screen LG
has said that the G pad 8.3 will be on
sale before the end of the year although
it hasn't yet said how much it will cost
if it's going to be competitive against
the new Nexus 7 it's going to have to be
quite affordable but we'll find out a
lot more near over time make sure to
keep it seeing it for all the latest
tech news
I'm Andrew Hoyle and this is the LG G
pad 8.3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
