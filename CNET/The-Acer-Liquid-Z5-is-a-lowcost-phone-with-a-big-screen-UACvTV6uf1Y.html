are at CES 2014 taking a first look at
one of the new phones that was just
announced at the show it's the acer
liquid c 5 smartphone and you know this
device it looks pretty nice it has a you
know very sleek looks a unibody
polycarbonate design big 5 inch screen
and it's running Android 4.2 too now
that acer liquid z5 is very affordable
despite its very classy good looks on
the on the back here you can see it has
a 5 megapixel camera as well as this
button which is a dual function button
that allows you to you know turn the
phone on just by tapping it once jump
straight to the home screen and you can
also you know have contextual control
within app so you can say okay i want to
you know turn the volume up or down or
pause play pause tracks and do you know
certain apps specific controls within
whatever after using now if you look at
the screen you can probably tell it's
not as high res as something you'd like
to see it actually is an 8 40 x 320
resolution display 5 inches and it has a
special filter in here that is supposed
to make it viewable from you know
different angles but it's still not as
high end as some of the oled displays or
LCD displays going to
extremely expensive phones but this
device is actually very inexpensive it's
supposed to cost 169 euros and is going
to be available probably by the
springtime and probably in Europe and
Asia so sorry American acer fans the
acer liquid z5 is not going to come to
the u.s. it's only going to be available
in europe and asia i'm brian bennett and
this has been a first look at the acer
liquid z5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
