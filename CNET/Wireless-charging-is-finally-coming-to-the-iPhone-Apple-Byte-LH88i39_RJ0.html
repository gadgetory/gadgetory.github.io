the Apple bite for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple
it looks like wireless charging will be
finally finally coming to the iPhone
let's just forget that it's three or
four years later than it could have been
now Apple is officially one of the 213
companies that are part of the wireless
power consortium that promotes a single
standard for wireless charging called Qi
and no it's not pronounced Q I now
previous patents have shown Apple's
desire to use long-range wireless
charging and older patent by them even
showed off using an iMac as the central
charging station is one idea but they
just couldn't wait on it any longer now
this doesn't mean Apple will support the
Qi protocol that every other company
uses in fact Apple already uses their
own tweaked version of it with their
Apple watch and that's why it actually
doesn't work with any other wireless
charging pads the thinking is that Apple
will do the same with the iPhone because
guess what their Apple now the report
also jives with more rumors about the
next iPhones digit times now claims the
current 4.7 inch model will have an
aluminum casing the 5.5 inch iPhones
material is still not determined but the
premium 5.8 inch iPhone with the OLED
display we keep hearing about will have
a glass casing reinforced by a steel
frame but the big thing here that glass
casing will allow it to support wireless
charging now who will likely benefit
from the move to OLED displays
come on Apple's best friend and rival
Samsung according to the Korean Herald
Apple has purchased 60 million flexible
OLED display panels in a multi-billion
dollar deal with Samsung now Apple also
reportedly purchased 100 million in
April from Samsung bringing that magic
total to come on you kids can do the
math 160 million OLED panels that would
likely make Samsung the main supplier of
displays for the iPhone x8 or future
whatever they end up calling it but
maybe they even just screw with us and
jump to 10 because it's the biggest jump
Apple has made in the history of the
iPhone see you can't even make this
stuff up that's literally what they
would say Samsung has provided Apple
with plenty of components for iPhones in
the past so this is nothing new
let's just make sure they don't have
them May
the batteries Oh burn all right for all
you Samsung owners who just got mad I
did that get over it or some messing
with you and as for the idea of paying
for a $1000 plus premium iPhone from
last week's show the majority of you
said you wouldn't pay that much but at
least a third of you had no problem
dropping the dough so here's what some
of you said zorb on twitter says I've
seen apple trees but not money trees
Jarrod sparkin on YouTube says you mean
the same $1000 that I paid for a 256 gig
iPhone 7 plus yeah he's definitely in to
remote says he'd be down if they don't
put courage into this and actually do
some innovation that's real talk right
there Jonas says Siri find me the
nearest banks that are easiest to rob
yeah I don't think she can do that Jonas
and Eric is probably the smartest person
out of all of us if my dad will fund it
I would most certainly use the iPhone X
all right after teasing us as far back
as fall Apple is finally showing us
their two new shows coming exclusively
to the Apple music service they unveiled
the first trailer for planet of the apps
think of it as Shark Tank Meets The
Voice meet screen app developers app
traders will make their pitches to
celebrities like Jessica Alba will.i.am
Gwyneth Paltrow and entrepreneur Gary
Vaynerchuk each judge will then mentor
their picks to make a final pitch of the
app for that venture capital moolah now
all the app developers are hoping to
make their dreams become a reality on a
reality show apple also released the
spot for carpool karaoke a spin-off
series that will pair different
celebrities with each other singing and
doing other wacky things James Corden
most likely will appear in just the
first episode to get things rolling now
plan of the apps looks intriguing and
can have some real drama carpool karaoke
will always be a good romp but the real
question is would you actually sign up
for Apple music to watch these two shows
now I asked the Apple byte nation on
Twitter and with over 500 responses only
8% of you said you would sign up for
Apple music while 75% of you said no way
and 17% of you already have Apple music
I would most likely check them out see
this is just the start but it'll get
really interesting once Apple gets
enough
a few musty shows and then you're
getting a streaming music service on top
of that for 10 bucks that's when you
start getting my attention but until
then I'm still Team Netflix and before
we go people are sending me pics of them
wearing ear pods you know what it's kind
of becoming a thing like my man here a
poet on Twitter he says you can hate on
ear pods all you like but I make these
look good
all right poet I see you but I don't
hate ear pods I really don't also you
have something in your ear brah okay so
in the spirit of all this I love you
Apple byte nation to send me pics of
yourself rocking your ear pods looking
good and I have this stack of ten I
phone seven and seven plus cases from
spec I'm gonna give it to you if you
think you can top arm and poet shoot
them in landscape that's sideways
include a caption and let's have some
fun here will showcase the winners in a
future show all right that's gonna do it
for this week you can email us at the
Apple bite at cnet.com or tweet me at
brian tom thanks so much for watching
we'll catch y'all next time for another
bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
