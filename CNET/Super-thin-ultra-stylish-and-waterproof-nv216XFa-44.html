and right now we're taking a first look
at the Sony Xperia z4 t-mobile the
Xperia Z is Sony's current flagship
smartphone and packs all the bells and
whistles the legendary japanese
manufacturer can muster the handset was
first showcased back in january 2013 at
the CES trade show sony later put an
unlocked version of the device up for
sale on its Us website but for a steep
six hundred and thirty dollars the price
has since dropped to five hundred and
seventy dollars but that's still a lot
to pay upfront thankfully the Sony
Xperia Z has officially made it to a US
carrier beginning july seventeenth
t-mobile will sell the Xperia Z for the
price of ninety nine dollars down plus
twenty four payments of twenty dollars
per month so what do you get for
committing to this price plan the Xperia
Z runs Android 4.1 point2 jelly bean
with Sony's own software skin layered on
top that means you'll find the Google
now advanced search in virtual assistant
on board the phone itself is powered by
a speedy 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
Snapdragon s4 pro processor backed up by
two gigabytes of RAM at five inches the
Xperia Z's 1080p HD LCD screen is big
bright and sharp to above the displace
it's a front facing camera for snapping
vanity shots and self-portraits plus
conducting video chats you won't find
any physical buttons on the front of the
Xperia Z just three software keys for
controlling basic android jelly bean
functions around back is the phone's 13
megapixel camera with LED flash the
xperia z's camera app features lots of
settings and scene modes to such as
burst and sweep panorama there are also
eight filter effects to choose from
which range from classic options like
nostalgic and fish I to Wilder ones such
as sketch and kaleidoscope in keeping
with the Xperia Z's luxury styling and
super thin chassis the back of the phone
is made from tempered glass another
design feature which sets this handset
apart is its durability rated to meet
the ip55 and ip57 durability standards
