cnet.com and I'm here with the ultimate
ears boom wireless bluetooth speaker
ultimate ears is now owned by Logitech
but this speakers fully branded as a UE
speaker and follows the well-received
Logitech UE boom box and UE mobile boom
box which will remain on the market the
list price for the speaker is 1 9999 so
it's fairly pricey but it's being touted
as a more powerful and durable version
of the Jawbone Jambox and has a special
acoustic skin plasma coating that makes
it water and stain resistant that means
you can wash it should it get dirty and
you is marketing it as a speaker you can
take with you everywhere you go indoors
and outdoors at 1.2 pounds it's not
heavy but it's also not light and has a
little bit of heft to it it comes in two
different colors and is designed to sit
horizontally or vertically a one end
there's an audio input as well as a hook
so you can clip the speaker to a
backpack with a carabiner
if you unscrew that hook you'll find a
threaded tripod mount the speaker it
charges via USB and gives you about 15
hours of battery life which is very good
for a portable Bluetooth speaker there
are volume controls on the speaker
itself but most people will simply use
their smartphone or tablet as a remote
and the speaker like the jam box has
speakerphone capabilities behind the
fancy fabric covering the speakers are
21.5 inch full range drivers and to
two-inch passive radiators ue has
designed the boombox to have 360Â° sound
so it sounds the same whether you're
standing in front of it or you're
standing behind it I've listened to a
lot of these compact Bluetooth speakers
and the boom plays very loud for its
size if it has a deficiency it just
doesn't deliver a ton of bass though a
few if any of these small speakers put
out great bass well it's expensive to
buy two of these speakers it's also
worth noting that you can daisy chain
two of them to help fill a larger space
with sound or you can have one speaker
act as a left speaker and one act as a
rice bigger to provide real stereo
separation I still need to test it more
outside but I like the look in
Fila the speaker and it certainly plays
loud at $200 it's a little bit expensive
but the fact that it's water-resistant
it offers 15 hours of battery life as
well as speakerphone capabilities
makes it certainly worth considering if
you're looking for a compact bluetooth
speaker for both indoor and outdoor use
I'm David Carr noise and that's the UE
boom thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
