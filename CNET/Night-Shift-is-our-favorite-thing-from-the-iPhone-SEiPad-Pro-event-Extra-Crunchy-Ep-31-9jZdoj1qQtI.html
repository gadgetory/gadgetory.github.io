francisco in hiding out in a secret
bunker at his fiance's house in Los
Angeles it's the apple byte extra
country with your host Bryan Tong that
was a long winded uh-oh Stevens Pete
knit it was good having a breath left
for the Red Michelle bro yeah that was
uh that was my memory from the script I
wrote up that I left on my desk so good
I love it welcome everybody to the Apple
white extra crunchy I'm in LA today
Stephen is back in the city by the bay
this is episode 31 um what is it 31 deep
and clearly we are going to talk about
everything that we heard or we thought
about apple's keynote also will be new
stories here but i wanted to start off
the show right off the top by letting
people know okay I don't hate Apple like
when people saw people if you watch our
recent episode the actual vo episode
people like why do you hate them so much
and i am come i have to explain to
people that don't get it all the time I
mean coming from the perspective of a
long time Apple user that enjoys
technology but feels like the company is
letting us down as of recent I never
really said it after year one but I kind
of wanted to wait for Tim Cook and
company to get their stuff together and
give him a couple of years give him two
and a half three years before I started
throwing out what I have felt because
you don't want to jump to conclusions
you need to show a history or a pattern
and so that's why I talked about the way
I did and to be honest it could have
been a press release so I just want to
let people know I don't hate apple I'm
not in love with Apple I'm a long time
Apple user but those of you who get it
and get the conversations were happening
understand where both Steven and I are
coming from right yeah i mean this this
has been like a narrative in tech in
tech in the tech world for the last two
years that apple's just you know they're
kind of just stagnant right now so it's
no surprise and it was a bummer we had
the big apple keynote nothing really
happened you know so what you gonna do
Zack what are you gonna do except make a
dang good music except talk about it
comment that's our job talk about it
comment too
at it make an awesome jodia awesomeness
so again this show is all about you all
we want you to call us at one eight
hundred 61 62 63 eight leave your name
where you're from your comments or your
questions we have I think four or five
legit calls that we're using this week
again we get so many that we can't put
them in but we appreciate you all
participants um great tweets and stuff
so keep it rolling because you guys keep
the show rolling so let's just jump off
right here ipad the things that were
announced really the biggest piece of
tech that had the biggest improvements
or new tech enhancements the ipad pro
nine point in out during our live show i
was crying inside because you know they
improved my ipad 12.9 inch just four
months later just for yeah but dude four
months like waiting for months come on
you you have the right to be a little
like frustrated after four months right
definitely i was frustrated after six
months when they made my third
generation obsolete so you know dust has
settled and i still I I don't feel as
bad because it has been revealed now
that at least this new 9.7 inch iPad pro
that they have although they claim it to
have the a9x processor it's slightly
slower it's clocked a little slower than
my 12.9 so I was like yes still love it
and then also the 9.7 inch iPad pro has
two gigs ram instead of the beefy four
gigs of RAM there you go that my bad boy
ipad pro was rockin like covers my face
so I felt I was like I felt good beach
like I was sad after the keynote but I'm
feeling a lot better but I do wish that
we had a 256 gig option on this iPad pro
the the other things though that the new
iPad pro has that is quite honestly just
flat-out better it has a better camera
know that it also has the m9 processor
inside it which allows you to say I'm
gonna try and say it quietly hey Siri I
said it's two separate words I don't
want to set people's phones off so it
has that ability where you can use your
voice do that and then the biggest thing
is that ambient light true tone display
I
that for me because I read a lot of
content on there is gonna be stick and
that's the thing I really wish that I
had my iPad pro just four months later
again just four months Duke brah brah I
know feel your pain i feel your pain now
during the keynote apple also really had
a moment that I'm glad people reacted to
because I thought I was the only one
that kind of sensed it but they had a
statement where Phil Schiller was
talking about oh how it's so sad that
there's 600 million pcs that are five
years old and you need they were using
as a compelling argument for people to
replace their pc with an ipad pro but it
just became it came off as so like
narrow-minded and elite me you they
showed a shot a cutaway shot of the
entire Apple exact team and one of them
was looking like disgusting the other
one at that moment put his head down
into his hands like the classic they've
saw it and they just went I can't I
literally can't and you saw this you saw
all their expressions and then then they
made another joke about it and you saw
the audience which was made me meet
members of the press but also apple
employees clapping about it like
laughing about it and it just came off
is um tone deaf and very elitist of like
wait so if that's the mentality of Apple
you're telling me that basically any
computer that they produce in their mind
is going to be obsolete not only by five
years but less than that yeah I mean
they want us to buy a new device every
couple years and people just can't
afford it you know I'd like to my
laptops coming on it's more than four
years old it's a it's a PC it's a
windows laptop and it has a touchscreen
which Apple has not made it's a 2012 so
I mean like why would i get rid of my
awesome touchscreen laptop if it still
works and it's still relevant have
Windows 10 on it now so it's just kind
of funny of that I I wanted to put my
face my hand when I heard him say that
too I just think it speaks to Apple
still thinks they're the cat's meow from
a standpoint of there's still
have arrogance within the company hear
it that's what that's what it indicates
to me more than anything that there's
still a lot of arrogance there so that's
those are some of the points from the
ipad pro but some are summarizing it all
up and putting in a nice little bow the
ipad pro 9.7 inch is honestly a killer
upgrade for anyone who has an ipad air 2
has an ipad that's two or three or even
four years old I honestly think if
you're an iPad fan who has been fine
with your iPad and says you know what
maybe I do finally want a reason to
upgrade out of all the years this might
be a compelling reason to actually do it
if you've been kind of on the fence that
I think the I'm jealous of the 9.7 inch
in some aspects but that's good because
that means for people that have been
waiting whoever you are it would be a
good upgrade definitely are you gonna
upgrade yours there were no no no I
can't afford it right now my iPad that
is still fine it still works great no
problems no complaints yeah it's it
exactly see you Apple made the products
too good that's a good app for
everything sound good Apple listening
thanks Apple yeah I do say positive
things about Apple guys and gals when
does that come out to it came out in
like 2011-2012 so I think yeah that's
been 12 yeah yeah I've had it for four
years almost almost rocking rocking
behind look rockin baby let's talk about
the iphone SE e that also came out in
our reactions look we talked about it to
death on the podcast a lot of times i
can't fit everything into the video and
people like why don't you complain about
16 gigs on a4a phone that shoots 4k
video and i think we've talked about it
billion times already but of course
obvious i don't want to make the whole
show all bad apples all the time too but
obviously this is an iphone that design
looks exactly like the 5s the bago
missions here though that it has says
tech inside and it's great this is not
it this phone to be clear was not made
because of innovation this phone to be
clear was made because 30 million iphone
users still use a 4-inch phone that's a
lot of money that is sitting there that
Apple needs
get on an upgrade cycle that hasn't gone
to a six inch or sorry a 5.5 inch screen
phone or five inch screen phone they
haven't funds that larger size because
they don't want it so this is a smart
business decision by Apple it's not
about innovation also there's no 3d
touch on the actual iphone SE so it is
really their entry-level small screen
phone hmm no I yeah it's and I'm sorry
the whole music video that we put
together just speak to that like my
phone has the greatest technology ever
and someone said about what about 3d
touch and then it really sparked my mind
and I just said well what about 3d touch
we look at the iphone 6s line and I was
super excited about the success line not
because its form factor stay the same
but I personally was a champion of 3d
touch I still think it has the potential
to be great but after apple's recent
keynote they released two devices and
they're only two new piece of hardware
that don't support 3d touch the ipad pro
9.7 inch does not have 3d touch in it
the iphone SE does not have three
touching it and you know I Steven even
you you don't really even use 3d just
don't I don't and it's sounding like
more like apples using that as like a
premium feature in their premium
products and that's fine if they want to
position it that way but there's a few
things that make 3d touch difficult okay
first of all I my bet beach the reason
why you don't even use 3d touch all the
time is a there is no indicator tell you
which apps actually have 3d touch that's
true yeah I don't even know like when to
use it really sometimes it just happens
on accident i'll press it on me like oh
okay that's kind of cool and no one
wants no one wants to no one wants to
poke around on their phone mean like
okay that oh that app has it but there
is no like little indicator or icon just
like a dot or something on the corner of
the app that lets you know it's 3d touch
okay so a that's a problem then be the
fact is that there are existing devices
that don't have 3d touch and what Apple
used to be
dad is having a future work across all
their devices in that same space but
that doesn't happen anymore so now
you're sending the only thing that's
going to really have 3d touches the
current iphone the next iPhone which
comes out in September but no iPads will
have it and the iphone SE will not have
it developers the big apps have really
joined on board I checked out the app
store there's something like about 50
plus apps that are promoting the fact
that they use 3d touch these are
third-party apps but again whether it's
because the screen is expensive and hard
to make whether it's because the screen
is hard to make in a larger size for the
ipad pro i love 3d touch but i wonder if
it might be one of those features that
just dies because it doesn't have
support across the board on all of
Apple's iOS devices and therefore people
aren't going to use it and people that
have a phone like you beat them aren't
you see ya honestly I'm just I'm not
used to and also I'm like used to a
behavior that I've been using my you
know I used my phone in a certain way
and now all of a sudden have to learn
how to use it in a different way and I
just I'm not interested in doing that
you know like learning new like with
that palm the old like palm handheld
devices we used to have and had to like
learn a new language to basically write
on it like that was always really
difficult and that's kind of it feels
similar you know today I know yeah you
don't want to you wanna learn how to
write any language no no not not ideal
not ideal I mean not like an internet
language that you know is gonna adapt
and change like in the next couple weeks
oh yeah so just another thing about the
SE we know that it does come with Apple
pay it has the touch ID sensor on it for
the iphone SE in the kind of an
interesting side story Rico does report
that Apple pay will be coming to mobile
websites before the holiday shopping
season and why is this important for
Apple right now only one out of five
people use Apple pay and that's not that
high but then in addition to that
they're competing against paypal for
mobile pain
and so I would say that if Apple pay was
integrated into some of the sites
sometimes I just jump on a nike com and
I just buy something and I hate having
to like you know put in my credentials
and all that stuff having Apple pay
through the mobile sites enough or
places like that that you all go through
would make it nice and easy oh
definitely yeah there's a paypal he's
got to make this stuff could be its yeah
it's gonna make you convenient and then
just a quick thing a core base you know
these two products iphone SE and 9.7
inch ipad pro they are both available to
pre-order now I know there are people
that do want these gadgets so 31st of
marches when they will be shipping but
as of now y'all can go to the apple
store and pre-order the goodies I think
it's today the 25th right now I don't
know yeah sitting with 24 yeah I can't I
don't even know the days right now um
we'll just transition over to iOS 9.3
another big thing I tend to get the most
out of these iOS updates so I'm really
juiced up for WWDC iOS 9.3 a small
update best part of it hands down for me
night shift I use it on my iPad I use it
on my iphone job you been using it all
definitely i set the alarm so it just
automatically goes that like ten o'clock
at night changes back at 7am it's
perfect do you have that setup no it's
beautiful oh I just met you know because
lately I've been trying to be a good boy
and I've been trying to go to sleep
earlier oh you have the man I manually
turn it off grandpa's going to sleep
grandpa tongs going to sleep I like like
honestly even like eight o'clock I'm
like let's turn on let's turn on the
night shift right let's trunk shifted
eight o'clock but it's it's really nice
and so because I've been using it on all
my on the mobile devices and again yes
we are all blessed to have these
multiple devices it sounds so like silly
manga I did all my ipad i did my iphone
it's not like an apple I sound like
Apple saying pcs have been around for
five years that's like the horror horror
but if you want to do it on your Mac an
iMac or MacBook Pro your mac mini
there's a really cool utility you guys
can just go to this website it's called
just get flux calm it's efflux actually
but it's just get flux calm and there
they kind of created a a jailbreak
screen temperature thing for the iphone
but Apple kind of said Nene on that
because it's a jailbroken thing but they
have a utility for your Mac it works
pretty well I totally turn it I totally
use it I totally views it ever since I
got night shift even though I'm very
even this webpage is soothing man it's
like haha the color so so i would i
would say you guys and gals go check it
out efflux just get up let's calm and
it'll be worth it i'm so all up on this
night shift if there's any good apple
it's all about night shift I I'm I mean
it's kind of sad that after the keynote
that's the thing I got most excited
looks like a real tangible thing that we
can use so yeah I mean but when you
think about it it's like wait what was
the best thing out of the keynote and
it's night shift they change color
temperature my phone so awesome I think
you would agree to right oh yeah
definitely I mean I'm happy it's here I
am guilty of staring at my phone in the
darkness when I gotta sleep yeah that
blue light stuff it messes with you okay
just a quick update about the app oh you
know what sorry let me just jump back
real quick iOS 9.3 I'm sorry I scrolled
down on my laptop I'm a boo-boo uh Apple
is temporary pool though the iOS 9.3
update for older iOS devices so here's
basically what happened originally when
they sent it out users of the ipad 2 and
even as far back as the iphone 5s we're
affected by this breaking bug so then
Apple released an update for older iOS
devices to fix that but then again they
you basically have to it's in the update
sign into your apple account your
username and password to basically
authenticate you ask me and then I'll
allow the update to happen well it's
some people that have forgotten it or it
just wasn't working have prevented
people from updating their phone so they
pulled the iOS 9 point
three update to the original release and
said it'll be another couple days before
a new update to the update of the
original release of iOS 4.3 o good messy
over there man does you that have no
idea what I just said that's how bad it
is makes sense you're gonna update the
update man we had a bad update now we
gotta look like you know update that
update to i could get you the better
update so I'm dying right now oh
man and nugget that a lot of people
wrote you guys saw the keynote and
there's a video about Liam which is that
robot that dismantles your phone so that
the different parts can be recycled for
the environment which yes I am about the
environment people thought i was like
anti-environment cuz i didn't talk about
in the show sorry guys sorry little bit
of people were like that there's yeah
right like this is so boring the
environment oh my god where I live where
I drink my water cause is so boring
anyways in that video they actually
showed off an iphone right before is
about to be dismantled it had the
antenna lines but it had a rear flush
camera like there is no a camera nipple
on and people like whoa what is that
what is that phone and I don't know one
knows could it be an iphone 7 maybe
could have apple just put in a renderer
there that actually wasn't a physical
phone possibly but i just wanna let you
know that it definitely shows a iphone
6s body potentially 7 with a completely
flush rear camera completely plush why
don't i have that everyone freaked out
sorry I didn't get that video for you
guys tony was not have that because like
it's like two seconds it's no wait
here's a picture I do have a page he's
gotta go hang on here we go here we go
there it is zoom into that seem like
it's flushed ain't no nipple on there
his flush well maybe he removed that
part already Liam maybe he had already
taken that part off well you technically
Liam would have to be a super Bob
because he would have to remove the rear
shell casing before he gets to the
actual camera piece I'm just saying I
didn't mean like rain on your parade
beach my first reaction when I saw Liam
was like great now they can just fire
a bunch of people save even more money
than some robots it's so true it is so
true how many Liam's are out there too
that's what I want to know yeah it's
probably just that one maybe maybe they
just they basically just made that sexy
video yeah for one single robot um just
fill you guys in on the latest with the
Apple versus the FBI this one is
interesting the FBI has basically
stalled or said you know we know about
the Congress hearings between upon the
FBI the story about FBI wanting Apple to
make a version of iOS or help them get
into the phone of the terrorists from
the San Bernardino terrorist incident
and shooting now the department of
justice on monday has indefinitely
stalled the court proceedings that had
been scheduled for tuesday just in case
you didn't know Apple had their keynote
on Monday they were actually supposed to
go to court on Tuesday to continue these
hearings so instead of turning to the
court where the Justice Department
forcing really trying to force their
hand to make apple turtle bit for me the
Justice Department is going to try a
technique it's heard out to crack the
iphones encryption without apples help
they don't want to go through the court
process I find this really fascinating
it's called NAND Meereen and what this
does is it basically requires copying
part of the iphones actual memory so
right now the iphone is made to wipe
itself clean after ten attempts and then
it just goes forget it but with a copy
of the phones flash memory the FBI can
continue to just restore the data and
then continue to indefinitely type in
every passcode combination and through
that long period of time then try to get
access to the phone this is from a third
party company that's doing this right
and israeli there an Israeli company so
and so this is this begs the question
what will take longer go through
Congress hearings or try every pass code
known to man to get into that phone and
I'm probably gonna leave I think I'm
probably gonna lean that the court
hearing to take longer yes definitely
no I don't even know how many depending
on if someone used a four-digit passcode
or the six digit passcode that's more
secure nope the cording Arians most
likely would take longer if you put them
like side by side definitely so the FBI
the FBI is definitely looking out for
themselves they're there they're being
smart about this they're clearly being
smart about this yeah so um that's
what's going on with that we just want
to be updated you know what beach I
think that just with all the time that
we have I think we should just jump
ahead and go into the phone calls are
you cool with that yeah let's do it
thank you guys all for calling you have
a few phone calls let me jump to that
real quick and the first one comes to us
from Michael and he didn't say where he
was from but here is this call hey Brian
it's Michael Vaughn I have questioned
regarding apple carplay maybe like this
week or next week in episode you could
go over what exactly is like it's
supposed to do or what Apple is going to
bring it to the table for iOS 9.3 um
when it gets released like if they're
going to do anymore other features know
what I plugged into my like plugging my
phone all I have that I'm ever going to
use his like math and stuff and maybe
once in a while the Apple music at the
con but really it's like useless but
like when you go to Annapolis and stuff
there's a browser application so that's
for google i select for the Google store
so it's like pretty confusing um yeah
alright thanks lo the show all right our
good buddy makes a great point because
look carplay first of all is still in
its early phase where they're trying to
keep it really simple basically like you
said maps and some multimedia at the
same time they're not trying to add a
whole lot of new features in there
because you don't want to be a
distracting yeah yeah exactly hey good
point break right oh you mean because
you're driving because you're out radio
massive vehicle that's dangerous that's
moving
so quietly whether it's our pay or on
Google Google's Android platform in cars
first of all you're going to need a
vehicle that supports it right now
there's about a hundred cars and more
coming that support it but beyond that
it's not going to offer much the whole
idea of it is really to allow someone to
get access to the content that they have
in the ecosystem that they've purchased
it in through their car but I if you're
looking for something like a
full-fledged kind of revolutionary
platform for cars I don't think you're
gonna find it yet I think when you if
you really expect to see or feel like
app gonna give you a real quote unquote
Apple experience in a car it's going to
be when Apple actually broke this is
their car right now a lot of the
manufactures are looking away to bridge
the great stuff that is on our phones
into our car because that just seems
like a natural progression but at the
same time they're not going to give us
all the apps that we want it's mostly
going to be music apps that have to be
you don't have to have a partnership to
get loaded on there like a slacker or
should you know a skype even for skype
calls like a last of em things like that
those need to be worked out on their own
but you're not going to see anything
like watch movies on your phone yet or
our onion your car yet or um what's
another app like order food from your
car that's just not really gonna happen
other than beyond may be some sort of
voice assistant but beyond that I
wouldn't expect much and it's not that
exciting and I thought it would take off
a little better but it seems that
they're pretty keeping it pretty limited
alright thanks myself we have another
call from Archie Boca Raton Florida
hello Brian in the beach this is Archie
calling second time caller hailing from
the birthplace of the pc boca raton
florida and i'm calling in for some mac
advice brennan have heard you say that
who are in the market for a macbook that
it would be a good idea to wait until
the skylake processors come out but i
happen to be looking at an imac
specifically the 21 inch retina model
and I'm wondering if drop or their
desktop models would also be worth
waiting for a processor upgrade or are
those new features for the new
processors not as big of a deal for a
desktop line by the way I will be
planning on using this computer too in
addition to regular internet stuff and
processing would also be using it to
record music demos thank you very much
look forward to hearing from you
excellent so first up just to let you
know the imac line was updated as
recently as november of last year and so
they do have guy like processors at them
the the main a really advantage of sky
like though is energy efficiency as a
music recording guy it'll still have
more than enough power for you but i
think the main advantage you're going to
see in sky lake is if you have a laptop
it's supposed to be really
energy-efficient where we might even get
not only one hour but maybe two hours
more battery juice from it and it'll
allow for slimmer designs but from the
desktop standpoint the games will be
nice but just not nearly as dramatic
from that standpoint so again they did
just update them in november so if
you're looking to get an imac you're
you're safe you're in the clear at WWDC
i think it's going to be all about the
laptops it's gonna be all about iOS OS
10 watch OS we might even see another
preview for the next Apple watch
potentially at WWDC we'll wait and see
but that's where they announce all their
new OS stuff and sometimes we even get
good indicators of what the new watch
will have so I would give you the green
light to getting an imac if that's what
you're in the market for right now cool
and I wait I would suggest to look for
refurbed also in the mac store so that's
just me refurbed and then bump the ram
up oh yeah audio that that's big time
for bump the ram up is agree is a great
kind of way to optimize what you're
spending yeah you'll save some money big
time okay and Calvin and Anthony called
us in the middle of an argument so let's
no Anthony that it look Tom Rachel this
is Del humber the happening and the
dental oh hello containment man we're
arguing about whether or not you're
going to be a 256 gig option when the
iphone 7 comes out what did you guys
think about it yeah well there won't be
they did the same thing with the 128
iPad it came to the ipad first it's not
going to make it to the iphone 7 Kelly
you know maybe 27 x they did the same
thing with 64 gigs right out come on man
y'all just need to happens on your show
next time we examine sister brother I'm
telling you because these debates go on
and on y'all have no idea what you're
doing i'll show we just argue about the
stuff anyway so wait did they say there
are ins there from san francisco yeah he
said they're both in san francisco so do
we do are you able to save that line do
we have that fig yeah i can get their
phone number yeah i might talk we'll
give them a will give them a test run
over the phone and see but Calvin
anthing first oh uh you guys were in
your car when you call having that that
was definitely a car call I could tell
that but here the reason why I saved
this for the timeliness of this is that
Anthony was arguing they haven't even
put 256 in the ipad yet and my argument
before the keynote is that someone asked
will we see 256 in an iphone and i said
once they put it in the ipad then
there's a strong chance we'll see it in
the iphone but that being said I still
don't know if Apple will actually pull
the trigger or if they'll be jerks and
only give us a 256 gig efficient on a
phone in this rumored iphone 7 pro model
which is different from the iphone 7
plus model and different the iphone 7
model right that's rumored pro model
with potentially a dual camera lens if
they did it for any phone and if that
phone came out that's what they would
save it for so right now the answer is
TBD but the step
are in place for them to actually
consider doing it you guys are still
gonna have to fight this one out maybe
you guys should just do like an
over-under of when it actually happens
like doesn't come on the iphone 7 or not
blah blah blah you guys got to figure
that out for yourselves but I'm not
gonna give I'm not gonna I can't commit
to any answer right now but this they
laid the foundation for that to happen
Apple has done that so fellas have that
yeah maybe we should have him on a Skype
guest or something that might be fun
dude we should just do like Beecham and
bryan vs. calvin and it what happens so
happens all right this is job we got a
little more yeah thanks guys okay this
is eric from Los Angeles hey this is
derek from LA and I had a couple
thoughts on the most recent apple
keynote first of all I really love the
new night shift night shift feature but
I think it's kind of weird that it
doesn't work on low power mode because
that's exactly when everyone wants to be
using night shift at night when your
battery's dead you know I hope they can
fix that soon and I also thought it was
interesting that they dropped the price
of the Apple watch do you think that
means that they're gonna release a new
Apple watch anytime soon no thanks the
show all right i love this call i do
think it's interesting because i do
think it is a good point but at the same
time I'm just like you know nice shifts
night shift sometimes you just have your
phone plugged in at night anyways right
like I feel like night ship is made for
those um 10 or 15 minutes before you go
to bed then you check your phone versus
like being out at a club using night
shift when you know I could see I can
see being out at a club using nite chef
just a little softer you not like you
know maybe in a movie theater if you're
a real ale but I can see it yeah I mean
I think it's a valid I think it's funny
cuz I'm on cannabis and like yeah it
should work honestly yeah it should work
in low parmo but then low power mode
kind of is specific to like hey we're
gonna turn off as many features as
possible just to save your battery lap
and may be nice if didn't make the cut
yet I don't it doesn't seem like it's
using more energy to actually do night
shifts up
maybe they will fix that in in iOS 9
point for what we will find out as for
the Apple watch question look the fact
is that the Apple watch is about it here
is it here almost it's almost a year old
and apples only dropping the price
because that tell me that they're trying
to make sail the kind of move units oh
yeah a because of because a new one will
be eventually coming out but typically
here that look at this psychology
normally Apple only drops the price of a
product when new product comes out
mm-hmm the fact that Apple impels has
dropped the price of the watch before
new Apple watches mount tells me they
aren't selling as well as they want them
to that's your hope to yeah definitely
so that's that's reading between the
lines of that whole situation and I'm
not here to bash the Apple watch because
people think I hate it it just wasn't
for me and I want it to do more and
until it does I'm still gonna say that
the Apple watch is so-so hmm what you
see in that song Apple watch ain't doing
what we wanted to yeah it was like like
apple looks like Apple watch a do it
what we hope for that's and then and at
the end I said gimme Apple watch with
facetime that's dope cuz that would be
doing and I don't care if FaceTime on a
watch is kind of useless to someone
Apple used to put these crazy-ass
charming be sorry crazy charming
features that may not necessarily matter
you're like it's the only device in the
world can do that and that's what makes
it cool and they have missed that
because they have decided to take a
strategy of let's do what smart for a
business let's make two phones with two
different sizes because that's what
people want and that sells units let's
make a four inch foam because we've 30
people with forage phones that need to
upgrade they're not doing those things
that make you go oh my gosh this is the
greatest thing ever if the Apple watch
had a FaceTime camera in it and I don't
care if i only use it once or twice the
fact that i have it and no one else has
that makes it cool mmm that's how i feel
about all that that's all so nice ship
is very cool yeah cool okay we have one
more call from naffy here he is well
Brian my name is Neffe and home I want
to know um
what do you think about the iphone 7 not
having a major redesign got that sorry
did you hear that yeah I got it yeah I
heard iphone 7 sorry guys and gals
sometimes a little disconnected what
we're not in the same room but uh naffy
iphone 7 quite honestly having a totally
revamp design these days doesn't bother
me nearly as much that I thought the
iphone 6s was a killer upgrade to the
iphone 6 I thought it was one of their
best upgrades arguably for me but the
iphone 7 doesn't need a new body but it
does need to do new things that are
compelling to us and that can make it
special that's going to be up to Apple
decide I think the whole idea of slimmer
is better no one cares about that now
people just want better battery life if
only Apple could make a phone that could
last over two or three days that would
be the biggest story and people would be
like Thank You Apple they wouldn't care
about anything else but they refuse to
do that so until they do something that
really makes us turn our heads whether
it has a new body or not it doesn't
matter will I upgrade to the iphone 7
probably yeah that being said so um a
new body doesn't change how I feel about
the phones personally yeah kind of pop
kind of past that good alright man I
think that's all we got that's all we
got it's time yeah alright so we just
want it's oh man it is a friday so again
we'll be back in the same room the same
bat cave next time next week but keep
the calls at one eight hundred 61 62 63
