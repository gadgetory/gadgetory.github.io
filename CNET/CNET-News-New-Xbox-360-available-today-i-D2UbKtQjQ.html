and we designed it to be a great place
to play games then and well into the
future today I'm excited to share news
building on that commitment let's start
with a console itself to better fit into
your home and into the Xbox family we're
going to update the Xbox 360 console
with a modern look and feel based on the
Xbox one design this is the new xbox 360
it's smaller sleeker and as quiet as
ever and it's available starting today
our commitment to the xbox 360 has never
been stronger and it's not just the
console it's gonna get better we're
gonna make your xbox live gold
membership better too as a reminder if
you're a gold member on 360 your
membership carries over to xbox one but
we're also going to roll out a new
program for xbox live gold members
beginning july first up through the
release of xbox one gold members new or
existing are going to receive two free
game downloads yours to keep and to kick
off that program to kick off that
program I'd like to share just two of
the titles we're gonna offer over the
next few months assassin's creed two and
halo 3 finally speaking the games as we
look forward to the next several years
you're going to see literally hundreds
of new games coming to xbox 360 and the
next 12 months alone you're gonna see
such hits as splinter cell blacklist
lightning returns final fantasy 13
batman arkham origins and of course this
September the highly anticipated release
of grand theft auto 5
to give you a glimpse as what what's to
come I'd like to show you three new xbox
360 titles the first is a personal
favorite it's taken the gaming world by
storm tough gritty competitive and it's
never been available on any console
until now let's take a look
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
