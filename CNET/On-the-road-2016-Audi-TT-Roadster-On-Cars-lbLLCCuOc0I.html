smirking Lee as this little ladybug of a
thing among sports car purists not
anymore
this third generation gets an awful lot
of things right and puts an edge on the
product technologically on the road and
to the eye let's try this all-new 2016
third-generation TT Roadster and check
the tape
howdy was kind of sneaky with this one
back in January of 2014 we got an early
look at what would be the style of the
new TT but it was in a concept mini
electric station wagon the front clip
though arrived almost unchanged on this
new car and I gotta say it's the
handsomest TT yet in three generations
and unlike a lot of complete generation
updates this one's dimensions don't
meaningfully change anywhere length
width height even weight all about the
same as the outgoing car
we have a roadster with the cloth tough
there's also a coupe it has some little
tiny back seats in there our car instead
where the back seats would go is where
the top does go that coupe by the way
can also be had as a hotter performance
TTS
the Roadster doesn't come that way your
first reaction when you get on the new
TT is where did everything go
it looks like we're back in the 60s it's
a blank - with some vents that's because
the star of the show is the virtual
cockpit over there in front of the
driver
that's a twelve point three inch virtual
all LCD instrument panel the gauges are
virtual and they can either be full
front and center like you see or with a
click of a button they move backstage
and you can go full map for example
pretty impressive driving all this is a
quad-core NVIDIA GPU and they've added a
couple of new interesting buttons on the
wheel
those get you into submenus and one of
the first thing your passengers are
gonna say is wait a minute where's my
ability to control stuff you actually
can see that screen pretty well from
here but it's far from optimal this is
clearly not a car where the passenger is
supposed to be fussing with stuff but
instead hanging on for dear life and of
course you've got your nmi controls down
here excellent voice command touch pad
on top of the knob this is all pretty
standard Audi stuff as is the 4G LTE
connection that powers all this
including an excellent online search and
the ability to go photorealistic
on the maps at certain elevation levels
the other interesting part of cabin
craft Audi is done here is to get rid of
your traditional bank of HVAC controls
and instead embed everything in the
knobs on the vents five vents five knobs
the outer ones control your seat climate
and heating and the center ones handle
temperature and fan and air flow
direction it's super clear fast to use
nice system and blessedly Audi's dump
the MDI the proprietary multi device
interface and now uses good old USB a 16
TT is powered by a 2 liter inline-4
turbocharged and direct injected of
course 220 horse that's up 9 from last
year 258 pound-feet of torque that's the
same as last year one choice of a
gearbox in the US a six-speed
dual-clutch automated manual no
six-speed manual of a
here and all wheel drive Quattro of
course zero to sixty happens in 5.6
seconds slightly quicker if you get the
coop faster still if you get the coop
TTS our car weighs about 3400 pounds
including that ragtop mechanism does
about 26 average 30 on the highway
underway three words in this new TT
light bright and tight that's what it
feels like in terms of powertrain in
terms of openness and in terms of
perceived weight on the ground one of
that light perception is from power that
comes on but almost no turbo like I
really if the solutes are put in a
really good job on that
especially when it's a to later for that
it's sitting under that turbo so they'll
have to fall back up but the power comes
on very effortless now when it does come
on it flows in one of the fastest dual
clutch gearbox is out there now we've
experienced this gearbox before and it
isn't good one but what's so great about
it are the lightning fast ships when you
press it and the extremely good table
manners what you don't we've seen how
you drive to select before this I
believe the first time when it can also
affect the logic of the Quattro
all-wheel drive system for example in
dynamic mode which is sport mode it can
tell the Quattro the system to behave
with a bias toward the rear wheels by
default one of my favorite engineering
accomplishments you can't see and that
is this sort of invisible tub that I'm
sitting in formed by the windshield the
header and this power wind buffer behind
me when that's up and everything else is
up around me but tops all the way down
you've got a very isolated beautifully
climate controlled scenario inside of
here oh it's augmented by these little
Nick heaters back here on these optional
sport seats they blow warm air over your
dead bottom line is you're gonna love
fall evenings on the road top down
the top goes up and down quickly about
ten seconds either direction and trunk
space doesn't bury it remains small
issue no matter where the top is but at
least you know what to expect we're
gonna start about 46 for for a TT
Roadster by the time I had some tact
those nice neck heating seats and a
surprisingly affordable piano audio
option I'm somewhere in the low 52 range
the cabin tech is hard to beat on this
car though your passenger may say
otherwise the ride handling and the
power and the delivery and the whole
light bright tight way it drives are
outstanding I love the looks now there's
not much to dislike about the new TT or
cars driven CNET style standing by now
