from Boston Dynamics
this is Atlas Boston Dynamics calls
Atlas the world's most dynamic humanoid
robot and from the looks of it they're
absolutely right
Atlas is a bipedal robot capable running
jumping doing backflips and keeping its
balance like no other bipedal BOTS we've
seen before its control system
coordinates the motion of its arms torso
and legs allowing it to perform
human-like tasks and achieve whole body
manipulation
spot mini is a doglike robot that is
small enough for domestic use
it's armed which looks like a mini
brought two sources head can pick up and
handle objects around the home
spot mini is 100% electrical making it
the quietest robot Boston Dynamics
engineers have built to date
handle gets around on two legs and two
wheels handle is a very agile and high
strength robot its reels allow for high
speeds and quick movements it has the
ability to jump over and even use
objects like a table as a platform or
track as it glides on its wheels
maintaining its balance handles grips
are great for picking up heavy objects
and moving them around handle uses its
handles for balance as demonstrated here
in this endpoint control demonstration
Big Dawg was one of Boston Dynamics
first advanced terrain robots and was
the first legged robot to venture
outside the lab taking on some
real-world conditions
big dog was designed to perform well in
different environments it can carry up
to 150 kilograms and can climb slopes up
to 35 degrees big dog was developed for
the military who passed on the rugged
robot because it was too loud sand flea
is like a small RC car don't be fooled
by its small stature though sand flea
can jump ten meters into the air it can
literally leap onto the rooftop of a
building landing softly
think of it as a high-end RC car
which one is your favorite member of the
Boston Dynamics family and which one do
you think is most likely to rise up and
kill us all
