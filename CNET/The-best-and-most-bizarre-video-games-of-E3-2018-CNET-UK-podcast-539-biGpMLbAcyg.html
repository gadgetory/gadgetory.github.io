has just delivered an absolute wealth of
new announcements enough to excite even
the most hardened gamer old friend Luke
west away from outside extra is joining
us to tell us what really mattered from
the show and what you should be excited
for in a year ahead welcome to the scene
at UK podcast hello and welcome to show
and welcome back to Luke hello it has
been a while since we've had you it's
been too long too long it's been a few
months I think yeah it's all changed
this brick work is new there's a mutant
in video form last time you want to
share we know in your living room I
think what I was stroking your cat's and
yeah you were drinking cup of tea yeah
yeah happy you're tired now I have to
think about my posture when my eyebrows
are because we're being recorded you
didn't ask if you wanted to put powder
on before and we said no it's fine we're
not really a paradise or surface so if
you are watching the video version of
this and you're thinking Luke could look
better just just be aware that I tried I
I tried and I shot it down because I
don't want you to look better than me
because I don't have powder I could have
found adjust both I only wish we'd have
done that man um Luke you have been out
at e3 of course and how was the show it
was good it was a really good year for
announcements actually yeah yeah well
there were um there were a few big
surprises you don't always get surprises
at e3 slow stuff leaks beforehand
yeah but nevertheless there were a few
big shocks there are a few things that
we thought we were gonna be there that
weren't which we can come on to you
later yeah cuz I think that's kind of
interesting as well the things that you
expect that you don't get absolutely
they get withheld but yeah generally it
was a strong show I mean I think for me
I've really noticed that there's been
nothing really talked about in terms of
hardware which is not surprising because
we're not in you know we're not
expecting a new Playstation and new Xbox
we're new swish it won't be long no no
we just had the Xbox one X and the ps4
Pro right like last year year before so
I wouldn't yeah well last year and year
before yeah but but you know they tried
to bring these things out sort of fairly
regularly see I feel like you know
you've got an interest
inside of it I know I've genuinely I
have no insights or smoky room yeah mr.
way let me tell you about the new
Playstation oh yes please
I don't know your way while I'm not cool
in this would you except it being the
cool one you know in this noir scene
that I've mentally seen there at all
which is why I don't get the inside of
the inside outside I think Microsoft in
particular will be keen to get a new
Xbox out as soon as they possibly can
because they have not really been the
winner of this generation as much as the
console wars are nonsense and you
shouldn't buy into it as a consumer from
Microsoft's point of view they have not
really Seldon if you're looking spec for
spec they're not they're not really a
rising yeah and in terms of like they've
not I don't I don't think it's
controversial to say they've not done as
well on exclusive games for the for the
Xbox that was something they were going
like big for this year they're a couple
of tasty-looking exclusive actually new
halo got announced yeah but a lot of
games get announced at e3 in the way in
a way that doesn't really mean anything
it's like do you think they were ever
going to make a new halo of course they
yeah absolutely
we know that was get out so the fact
they confirm that there is one and show
you a logo and like two seconds of not
lovely CGI trailer yeah that sort of
well yes obviously they pulled the same
trick with first of all the same trick
with the Elder Scrolls for six you have
scroll six which is very very exciting
until you think well hang on obviously
they were always going to make one all
they've confirmed is that they are up
shivering it and they probably won't be
until 2022 this may as well have been
announced at e3 2021 as in the next year
or two they will be an Elder Scrolls six
because it will be that long because
they've got an entire other franchise to
come out first but before we get too
deep into that so we say we've got no
real new hardware but you said there's
been some big surprises yeah yeah what
what has been what's taken off your
socks the biggest surprises in your
hands
and my personal cell career yes of
course did you did take them yeah your
when you do tube you get you get
assigned as I assumed as much when one
for each photo did they do no no no used
to be but times of time stylist time at
once oh yeah surprise surprise it's the
biggest surprise the thing that rocked
my socks all the way off was cyberpunk
2077 yeah now this is the new game from
CD Projekt RED - you may not have heard
of because they're not a huge name
really but they are the developers of
The Witcher 3 which one is the most
popular and one of the best games of the
last I know it's a lot easy isn't it
mm-hmm it's a big open world fantasy RPG
it's got swords
it's got monsters it's got magic so
that's something I would love
considering I'm a huge family sky man
the oldest Club I have never played the
which you should you really should
because it's spectacular it's a
brilliant brilliant game it's got
everything that I know you like yeah
I've got that sort of huge world it's
got a billion quests and hundreds of
hours and you can play through it again
and again with different character
builds and stuff like that can you see
like the the existential crisis I'm
currently having having missed out on
such an important is that you can still
play it I can still play when was a
Witcher 3 oh uh oh gosh I want to say
2014 wait to show Theory let's check
that chicken out now 10 out of 10 on
Steam always on Steam I can get it on my
steam account that's great and 5 out of
5 on the Microsoft Store 2015 ok team
that earns like it's worth playing yeah
always
definitely worth playing and the new
game from the developers is looking
similarly exciting but very very
different yeah so it's based on
cyberpunk 2020 which is a tabletop RPG
so like I saw Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons style
game it's set in a dystopian hi-tech
eighties infused
future where everything is neon everyone
is a cyborg there's incredible poverty
mega corporations run America and you
are a sort of a blazer runner isn't it
in the Blade Runner very very blatant no
wasn't this laid run of the RPG isn't so
long 27 2077 a film also remember
quite a few years ago there was a really
awesome trailer of this cyborg woman
yeah horribly killing huge groups of
like cyborgs police I believe or police
and was it was really great it was all
3d done it was very very dramatic and
and it was this I think it was just a
teaser trailer before it was officially
announced it was coming and I thought
that was for a film but I don't remember
if there was it was a teaser trailer it
had a sort of Bionic Woman she had like
mantis cool yeah yeah yeah okay so that
was a teaser trailer for this game that
I believe came out in 2013
that's how laws for this game yeah was
for the case it wasn't for a film that
get their name out that year no no that
was for this get that's how long this
has been on the boil Wow and yeah so
it's been very very long awaited and we
weren't sure we were going to get to see
it to this III or perhaps ever but lo
and behold there it is and it has been
showing off in quite some detail they
publicly they've put out there a trailer
which is a very very cool trailers about
a minute and a half long privately at e3
they were showing members of the media a
50 minute gameplay demo 50/50 5-0 of
which no footage is available anywhere
so although I've seen that I cannot I
can we we can't get that b-roll from you
you can't get that beer up on the pod
you can't see it so you'll just have to
take my word for it mine we yeah we can
like try it it's the first thing I would
mine is this because it's first-person
okay which is a little bit surprising
and you know not typical for our be big
open-world RPGs you can it's got full
character customisation so you can
choose your gender you can choose
tattoos and hair what color your eyes
glow you can choose your backstory like
in Mass Effect so it's it's an RPG down
to it down to its yeah very cool very
modern and but will they still have the
same RPG tropes in terms of it's like
skill tree development and and you you
get bigger and better weapons absolutely
as you get further into the game all the
usual things you'd expect from any RPG
yeah but the setting is this dystopian
modern world yes sort of robots and
that's exactly right it's probably most
akin to Deus Ex if you've seen any of
the Reese
deus ex games but it's got a slightly
different aesthetic it's got a slightly
sort of more madcap kind of amped up you
know wired kind of thing it's not like
Deus Ex is a little bit kind of cool
like neo from the matrix kind of like
yeah or as this is this is more does he
take itself very seriously is it that's
all gay no we're like it's not trying to
make some sort of social statement it's
very much here's just a lot of nonsense
and big bangs and so I think both I
think it looks like one of those those
brilliant games that might be able to
just sort of have it both ways
okay the game doesn't look like it takes
itself too seriously in the in the 50
minutes that I saw there was definitely
humor and satire but it is you know the
story is serious it's not like a game
like Borderlands for example where
everything is like ridiculous and
cartoonish yeah oh yeah it is the story
is quite serious the the stakes are
quite high for your character so okay
it's low it looks really good so that's
one to look forward to and is that due
out this year or is that an answer but
we don't know I think we actually know
the release date exactly so probably not
this year then no but the detail has
been showing off it I wouldn't be
surprised if it was next year
okay okay next year um so let's look
towards some of the other big titles
that have been discussed and last
service - yes I made a splash um do we
know that obviously we assumed as I said
before that there would be a Last of Us
- yeah in some way but had we heard
anything about this before III was it
the first time we've had an official
line on no we'd seen little bits and
pieces we'd seen a couple of trailers so
very moody trailers this is the first
time that we've seen really detailed
gameplay okay
and it looks absolutely incredible yeah
there's there's still a lot of questions
because Sony has this habit and this is
a PlayStation exclusive game which is
why we're showing off for Sony's press
conference Sony has this habit of
putting out these sort of maybe 10 to 20
minute long
gameplay videos with no context and no
narration and nothing else so you sort
of you get what you can see and this is
out there you can watch you can watch
the last of us gameplay thing and if if
you're not afraid of some
traffic video game violence I would
recommend it it is quite strong it's
brutal
it's really brutal but um yeah so that
is out there and you can watch it but
there are a lot of questions so in in
this you are playing as Ellie who is the
sort of sidekick character in the first
game for young girl him no longer or a
young girl no longer a young girl she's
more grown-up now she looks like late
teens so I'm guessing yeah well this is
exactly the thing you sort of you see
this and you kind of you got a vague
idea like oh okay so she's a playable
character probably the protagonist and
she's older but you don't know tell me
how old yeah but she looks she's not
grizzled and old she's not 50 she looks
about maybe that doesn't look 50 yeah
maybe about 20 yeah late late teens
early twenties 20 years so what they
showed off it and you'll be able to have
kind of to show you this is that they
had it's this this nice dance scene
thing going on where Elias I like having
in the middle of some sort of ball fight
post-apocalyptic survivors ball it looks
like and I was a bit of a romance
between there's an unnamed girl who we
isn't the character who we are we know
about no she's not character from the
first game she looks like a new cat yeah
but yeah she has a romance with her and
it's all very very sweet and then all of
a sudden just cuts to Ellie cutting
someone's throat yeah and yeah and it
gets more graphic and more unpleasant
from there yeah but it looks absolutely
incredible
I'm it's by naughty dog who's a couple
who developers are made Uncharted yep
they do a brilliant line in games that
just look absolutely staggering are
beautifully acted beautifully written
and tear your heart apart in motion yes
that's what happened with the first last
of us it was it was it ticked all the
boxes that people wanted for a really
engaging really cinematic game so is
that is this is last of us to do out
this year or is that another announced
this year probably available I don't
think we have really said that they're
gonna be do a quick check well we're
having a look we all I told kaswell
about Tomb Raider the new tomb raider
cuz that is deal yeah at the end of this
year that is out really we've seen we've
seen more in
about that from e3 I don't know that you
had you went to like a hands-on gameplay
fairly recently I think you and Ellen
your co-hosts from yes that extra yeah
she's played it I actually ever played
you haven't paid it but she has yeah
what's the general thoughts of a
sentiment around that that ran that at
the moment I think the sentiment is
pretty positive so the last two Tomb
Raider games have been really good
they're both part of this these new
reboots and this is going to be the sort
of third in a trilogy of that of those
new games okay and it looks it looks
really good it looks a little bit darker
fanatically lara dark like the awesome
it was dark took a twist yeah I think
this one has I think I think we're going
to see a little bit more of character
development for Lara in this one which
is interesting because when they brought
it back they brought it back to her
first adventures and she has a little
bit of a newbie she was a little bit
green a little bit unsure of herself
just to learn how to kill what you did
immediately and then carried on killing
unendingly back tacular aptitude or fuse
loaves yeah it's amazing is it when you
find out what you're good for yeah so
she's like she spiked on full for
president in yeah I love the last team
Raider I played that several times
through because I did it first time we
first came out then there was the
remastered version yeah which I played
and then I was just bored so I just
played it through again because I really
enjoyed it
so I'm really looking forward to playing
this one because the the gameplay clips
I've seen so far do look really good the
trailers look gray and if it's as
engaging as the last one then yep I'm
actually sold and that's how I want to
say September I think I think they just
said fall 2018 which is autumn
yeah it's what you'd call autumn is now
in the next next few months that is 14th
of September yeah Tereza no release date
yet the last no I would say four less of
us ok well that's yeah that's I think
that's cool because as a big fan Tomb
Raider is looking for us playing that
but it isn't a reboot but we have seen
quite a few reboots
yeah because of course Resident Evil 2
hmm
was I think one of the big surprises of
the show yeah yeah surprise yes that is
just that's just Resident Evil 2
yeah but remade yeah it's not it's not
like the next chapter of that storyline
yeah it is and it isn't just a remake so
for example a few months ago we had Dark
Souls remastered which which is what
many remasters are they take the
original game they apply new textures
and they make it look graphically
beautiful this is something a little bit
more involved to remake wise they've
started from scratch almost they kind of
pulled the game apart because the
Resident Evil 2 is such an old game now
yeah you know it came out in the in the
late 90s I believe and you know it sort
of had those like older as an evil tank
controls where you kind of like spun
your character around on the spot and
then make them walk forward so now it's
very it's it's a pretty dated game and
yeah they I think they've from what I
hear my colleagues chain and Andy got to
play the city through it sounds like
they've really amped up the horror and
giving it just a complete visual
makeover it's built in the engine as in
it uses the game technology from
Resident Evil 7 which yeah now last year
a brilliant really really brilliant so
I'm super excited about this I never
actually played Resident Evil 2 so I
don't play the first time around of this
does look good and yeah you're right in
terms of like they're the style it has a
very much got darker like literally
darker I saw the girl Jane and Andy and
they played it yeah and rather than
being this for well lit you know police
station
Louis everything's very dark and you've
got to use lights and there's a lot more
just seems like a lot more threat there
everything about it feels lot more
threatening yeah and then previous
Resident Evil did modern games had this
this like this obsession with with with
the fear that comes from having just
like a cone of light yes a torch and I
have it to explore a room where you can
only solve ever see like a which totally
works cuz Resident Evil 7 honestly
scared the bejeezus house has came out
when he did it was all over the place
and in VR
because I I honestly found when I even
when I play just the game normally and I
played it on my
my gaming laptop and I had to make sure
I was playing in a fully lit room yeah
and I had Parks and Recreation playing
on my TV so okay so when I had just
something to take the edge off that
anxiety because if I just focused on the
game alone I just it just got my blood
pressures got higher and higher and out
until I just had to go and calm down and
in VR that is you I'm you're only in
that world I've really found it too
challenging I couldn't do it I could not
play yeah 38470 MBL i think that's a
sensible move I tried in VR and yeah
it's very very intense yeah it's also
quite hard to play as all VR games tend
to be for more than but this did make me
think though there wasn't evil to remake
because it was last year that I think I
mean even he even gave before when we
had the Final Fantasy Final Fantasy 7
yeah make announced and yet I haven't
heard of anything about that again
nothing about that mother III but I
think that's gonna be a similar kind of
deal it's going to be such a substantial
remake yeah they're rebuilding from the
ground up everything is new you've a
storyline apparently is gonna be vaguely
the same roughly the same but all the
mechanics all the maps all the worlds
all the everything about the game is
being redone and some of that in it
really intrigues me you know I can
really see the whole world coming to
life using modern gravity technologies
but I don't want them to completely
bugger a bow yeah with the battle system
that made final 27 great yeah and it's
like yeah or the plural of yeah got a
good feeling about that area but we
haven't okay everything's gonna work out
fine for her but we haven't heard
anything about that since and so I'm not
quite sure still and in fact we could
Google and we'll carry on talking while
we do but that's coming out and I'll do
a little bit more about Resident Evil 2
yes because I think the fact that they
have taken such a drastic approach to
the remake means that if you didn't play
Resident Evil 2 this will feel like this
will feel like Resident Evil 8 it will
feel like a new an entirely new game so
if you didn't play resi 2 then I think
this will absolutely be worth checking
out and if you did you probably have a
lot of fondness for it because the game
was very good and you'll get an extra
kick out of it there so yeah it was
definitely one of the big surprises of
the show
surprisingly surprisingly fun all I've
all I've got mean having googled Final
Fantasy 7 remake is for a quote from the
director saying development is moving
along more than expected right which
which which is meaningless so there's no
they only they are working on it yeah I
mean you would say that wouldn't you
yeah if you if you had lost all the hard
drives you would yeah oh no it's all
going fine yeah jimmying open the window
to make good your escape that's a shame
cool apparently what I've read here the
direction was pretty much decided upon
and while preserving the atmosphere of
the original the scenario will dig
deeper into the characters including
members of avalanche I may be which is
that the team that joined cloud-like
jesse biggs and wedge who tried to take
down the the reactor the Mako reactors
in the early stages of the game that's
interesting but I'm very sad that we
haven't had any more of that because if
I could have played Final Fantasy 7
again this year rather home to play
again on my phone for another yet
another time I would have been fine play
The Witcher 3 instead of fine I could g7
again or I could talk to you about Forza
horizon for because this is a game but
I'm very excited to see because I love
their force again last Forza I adore
Forza well pretend lives are horizon
series you love Forza and you love the
British countryside yeah no really sings
neatly onto you yeah
the fact that it's set in the British
countryside right this game combines all
your love yeah so we're now in it you'll
be set and maybe there is hey there
maybe you can run bass in a little owl
or fly pass your car you can you can you
can hassle sheep you can drive through
you can you can drive through sheep and
you can drive through dry stone walls
but not small picket fences I saw in
some of the gameplay footage one of
those stops you and the other one
doesn't and it's a wrong way around but
this is the horizon part of Forza which
is the big open world drive anywhere you
want do different challenges on route
rather than the regular Forza which is
pick a race track pick a race car go do
five laps the more prescriptive this is
open-world this is what I love so much
about Forza in the same way as I loved
it background Theft Auto 5 where you can
just take
driving somewhere yeah so I'm very
excited about this the graphics look
amazing as we say it's setting we've
seen Edinburgh we've seen the English
countryside which in lakes there's
seasons and weather so sometimes those
lakes will be frozen because of cold
sometimes they'll be leaves because of
autumn and yeah I think it was really
good so I'm so it was super excited by
this great quickfire list lets me off
some of the new cars that are in it so
we've got the McLaren Senna actually
MacLaren's brand new super light super
powerful race car which was announced
last year which I went to see we've got
the Makati Chiron of course which I've
seen a couple of times and I
photographed and in fact before we
recorded this podcast me and drew stone
from car fection
have spent now 15 hours together
building the new Lego kit of the Bugatti
Chiron and we're still nowhere near done
in fact I'm watching on the video
version I am Andy is gone to fetch his
half-built Lego yeah apologies for the
mp3 version now this most part it looks
like a not very good truck yes but but
you can tell it in the back here's the
big engine we air made from scratch for
w16 engine yeah and here is where the
seats are will be is where the the
classic C shape Oh Shawn isn't that
fascinating and terrifyingly detail it's
insane the amount of effort that's going
to this thing give you actual petrol in
it it would probably go I hope so it
would come to life like Woody from Toy
Story and run amok while you slept but
so those are definitely two cars that
are new to horizon for so I'm really
really keen to play that yeah but let's
move on to the Nintendo switch which I
know is a platformer you're very
familiar with am i before I lost mine on
a plane big disappointment is the amount
of time I put into Zelda and no God
saves I know but I lost it right before
they didn't they bring cloud saves out
isn't that now a thing ah I thought they
brought cloud saves with like was a
Nintendo online thing uh oh it's coming
with the online service but that's not
that's not really yes it's not out yet
oh okay so yeah I've lost it before they
brought that out which is the real shame
so a couple of big things we'll start
with the fact that fortnight
suddenly they announce that for night is
coming to the switch and it's out this
afternoon
yeah so he is now out school so for
tonight is the biggest game in the world
at the moment more or less it's
absolutely huge especially online on
Twitch and on YouTube it is it is a
massively massively popular
live-streaming game yeah the read it's a
little bit weird because the game came
out and it had this kind of base
building survival shooting mechanic and
it was sort of interesting and but it
just kind of came and went then player
unknowns battlegrounds yeah but new pub
G came out which has the Battle Royale
feature in which many people enter a
world and basically fight to the death
in this constantly shrinking arena and
the popularity of that game meant that a
lot of other games have introduced
battle royale noises getting a
battlefield the new battlefields gonna
have one we know call of duty black ops
4 is gonna have one and fortnight
quickly added a mode and fortnight
because I guess they were quickest off
the mark they actually seem to be the
ones who are winning the race because
they've got this massively massively
popular game now so they save they're
beating out pub G are they because I've
not I don't know the numbers but I I I
think so I wouldn't at all be surprised
even though the the battle brow concepts
definitely you know pub G was the game
that made that big yeah on a pub G but I
haven't played fortnight in fact I was
playing poker because I play it on on
mobile I have played a desktop but I've
quite it is what I was playing on my
iPad of a sofa without the sound on so
you can't even hear when people are
around you and I got my first ever win I
might proper my flour your chicken my
chicken dinner and what you actually to
that I'm so for that on the switches is
cool so I don't know how much it costs
but it but it's a download it's not you
don't need to buy a cartridge it's good
because it's a very popular game of the
moment and that's what the Nintendo
switch needs it's been getting a lot of
good third-party support a lot more than
we you intend his last console gods yeah
but it needs games that are not the year
old or two years old it needs it needs
to be while those games are still
popular
still being played and I think also
fortnight and assuming fortnight has the
same general play style as pub Jean that
you you go on and you play like a 2025
minute round yes yes great for I think
the switch where you can let's be honest
sit on the toilet fire up again yeah I
mean that's the dream late but yeah but
while we're talking on the switch then
because the other big switch
announcements yes Super Smash Brothers
ultimate Super Smash Bros Altman this is
this is the thing I'm most excited about
I think probably I'm here and for those
who perhaps aren't aware the Smash
Brothers series is a fighting game
series where a bunch of different
characters from Nintendo's history and a
few sort of third-party characters as
well like Mega Man or Solid Snake or PAC
man's in it now I don't understand the
appeal of pac-man as a I know and sonic
watch is attack just waka waka yeah
basically but yet they have they have a
massive punch up and it's a little bit
different to fighting games like Street
Fighter in that you don't have a health
bar the decreases and when he goes down
you lose instead every time you get hit
you're sort of damage percentage goes up
and the higher your damage percentage
the further you fly when you get hit and
if you get float if you get blasted all
the way into off the screen or off off
the platform that you're all fighting on
then you lose a life or you lose lose
them turn yeah so it's got this really
it's got this really cool mechanic that
has been around for years but only in
the Smash Brothers games really no one
else is adopted even though I find it so
much more fun than then Street Fighter
or normal 2d fighting games and I
absolutely love it it's really fast it's
really dynamic characters can you can
triple jump and an air dodging man is
absolutely
an ultimate has been a long time coming
and it's yeah now we know when it's
coming out it's coming out for Christmas
just earlier December I think cool yeah
what we didn't get at e3 was much
information on what's new in the game
yeah we got one new character and a
couple of new still like fighting stages
yeah including one of the Zelda breaths
the while towers I saw which is super
cool and what a stage from splatoon we
already knew that the
kids those radical inkling kids from
splatoon how I love them they're gonna
be in it when Ridley who's the big
baddie in the Metroid series it's like a
horrible dragon who in the extended
universe probably a samus's parents
that's not nice
don't do that Ridley's like the nastiest
Nintendo buddy ever yeah rizo Ridley is
gonna be a character in it as well
massive dragon versus Pac Man yeah
doesn't really seem like FF well I mean
packed I can barely hold his own against
a ghost so yeah I think it's gonna be an
absolute slaughter good luck a vote to
that is gonna be yeah so what happened
what don't we know then about the games
Eve well so they've announced that every
fighter that's ever been in a Smash
Brothers game is going to be in it which
is cool because that immediately off the
bat gives it gigantic roster doesn't
cloud from Final Fantasy 7 was in it
wasn't yeah yeah if they're all there
everyone and but we do know that by the
time the game comes out there'll be
loads of new characters as well
and though they haven't - no they
haven't said what they are I've really
got my fingers crossed for Pauline from
Mary Odyssey yeah as a mayor of dog city
that's right new dogs young city and
detective Pikachu I really want which is
just a Pikachu with it little Sherlock
Holmes hat I don't know I know
surprising voice thrice more mouths yeah
again very like noir of billions so that
is what I'm hoping to see alongside oh I
have a very long wish list of characters
we don't need to get into now but that's
what they didn't talk about the other
thing that Nintendo did denied us is a
new Metroid because they announced last
year 83 that they are making a new game
in the Metroid Prime series which were
brilliant brilliant first-person Metroid
games all of them excellent and they now
so they were making a new one but we
don't know anything more
there was one of those things like we
were saying earlier whether it's like
we're making it here's a logo and I see
you in five years yeah bye yeah so I
really thought we might get a little bit
more information but absolutely nothing
but one Nintendo did say before e3 is
that there's a new Pokemon game
for the switch you have fledged Pokemon
RPG or whatever you know the classic and
intact Pokemon title yeah so this is a
little bit of a weird one actually
because yeah last year they said we are
making Pokemon RPG for the switch and
then recently they have announced and it
was at e3 in it I got to play it the
these two new Pokemon games for the
switch which is called Pokemon go easy
and Pokemon go Pikachu yeah and the
question everyone's wondering is is this
it is this the thing that was talked
about or is there a more ambitious game
down the line because it has to be said
the Pokemon go Pikachu pokémon go Evie
do not look like very ambitious games if
it's it on the switch it's on you know
it's on it it's not a powerful home
console though if you want a new like
the first ever big pokemon RPG on a home
console you want it to be not top-down
you want it to be like breath of the
wild but full of Pokemon yeah you know a
vast open world you wanted to look
beautiful huge storyline the ark sort of
plays amazing laughs makes you cry makes
you learn things exactly and this
although I think it will probably please
Pokemon fans does not look like that
game it looks like a mobile game looks
like an iPhone game it looks fairly
basic the other thing that they've
introduced which is it's quite a
controversial change I didn't really I
didn't really realize this until I
started playing it but now they've
introduced the pokeball throwing thing
from Pokemon go
yeah the mobile version for when you
encounter wild Pokemon
yeah which sounds good because that's
fun right you like throwing them yeah
who doesn't like catching pokémon that
way what I didn't realize is that that
seems to be replacing or at least it was
definitely completely replacing it in
what I play - III it seems to be
replacing having your own pokemon fight
wild ones so when you catch a Pokemon
all your Pokemon get a little bit more
XP they all level up and get a bit
stronger but they never actually sort of
come out and get to fight so they still
fight when you're like battling other
Pokemon trainers but I didn't realize
how much I would miss that thing of like
trying to get a Pokemon down to I think
just not very much health left which was
the mechanic by which you have
traditionally caught Pokemon in the
games you know you get his health down
yeah so you could try and put to sleep
or get
status effect and then you love a
pokeball right right between his eyes
yeah Wow when it's really mine curd and
it's begging for death yeah you trap it
inside bomb deny it that release here
and make it your Pokemon
so not weird not totally excited about I
feel like I'm a part of the moment it's
a shame it's a shame cuz I'm not really
excited about it but and you've also
stopped playing Pokemon go I believe
whereas I am still playing and do you
have the three legendary pokémon yay
although I saw there was an update
procon go where you can now gift but you
can transfer Pokemon to other trainers
so I could if I want to give you my
spare no ask you know hey will you maybe
maybe we'll have to see how the rest of
the podcasts go play my cards right yeah
we'll just have to see okay um so those
are those are the biggest things I want
to talk about but that and a couple of
other games that the crew 2 is later
this month that looks really cool again
big open world racer kind of like
horizon but yeah it's got this scaled
down map of the US that you can sort of
drive clear across yeah including all
the good food spots yeah my colleague
Mike channel who is a huge racing game
enthusiast is quite excited about this
one he was said he was telling me that
the first crew had the the open world
map that open world map of the US was
really good because you could get across
it reasonably quickly but not so quickly
that it didn't feel like a significant
road trip whenever yeah yeah a car and
drove off what I quite liked about the
crew too is that you can you can be a
plane and you can fly play really high
and then you know in the air you can
turn into a boat and just smash under
the ground yeah yeah yeah if you wanted
to yeah or alternatively can you can you
be about and then become a plane and
think uh are you guys pretty sure you
can turn into a plane while you're a
boat but I don't think you would sink I
can't remember remember what I've done
showdown yeah
but then the elephant in the room as far
as I saw it was the lack of additional
information about Red Dead Redemption -
yeah well that is because Rockstar who
make Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft
Auto 5 and basically the biggest most
successful
name's yeah don't they know it well this
this actually is it they really do know
it they they don't go to III oh they
don't exhibit their they don't have a
press conference Rockstar oh the apple
of the game yeah yeah yeah in the summer
that Apple does not attend MWC or Aoife
or yes that is actually a very very
strong analogy they are exactly like
that they they they they show very
little yeah until they're ready and then
it's a big splashy announcement you know
that it's very sort of closed off yeah
not very chilled out but their products
are extremely good though they are
always that's why they can get away with
it yes because Red Dead Redemption
that's totally Apple it's ready yep read
dead 2 is going to be enormous it's
coming out this autumn is going to be it
will almost certainly be absolutely
fantastic yeah and it's pedigree and
everything we've seen I am so excited
for it because I actually never played
Red Dead Redemption and having taught to
you your colleague Andy hmm about it who
is a massive Red Dead fan yeah and he
just said I have to play absolute have
to play it and then I tried to get hold
of it and I couldn't I couldn't get it
without spending with that it was like
25 quid on on Xbox I just really game
and I kind of just fell and I was busy
at the time so I never bother playing it
and then now Red Dead that excuses it
was 25 pounds
it was 25 grand and I was busy and I'm
still AM I remain busy you remain busy
oh and you really if not more busy than
I was but Red Dead - he's now coming out
so I think I'm just gonna jump in and
start with Red Dead tea with no sense
because it is the prequel to red dead
anyways so I'll be playing it
chronologically you will be yet which I
think's which I think makes makes
perfect sense yeah so that'll be a big
deal that'd be a big deal what else is
83 fallout 76 yes no we have a yeah I
haven't there no control briefing about
that because that was that's probably
most controversial game of the show so
anyone who's familiar with the Fallout
series will know that they are these big
sprawling single-player RPGs in an open
world where you wander around an
irradiated
sort of post-nuclear wasteland
yeah and live your best life and get
cool outfits and walk around modern-day
Ipswich yes no I'll go with that
um yeah the games are brilliant they're
full of like quirky NPCs and really
surreal quests there's a lot to love
about the Fallout games and fallout 76
takes things in a different direction
it's going to be an online survival game
that does not have or at least does not
have very many we're a little bit unsure
that a non-playable characters you will
be one of the people one of the chosen
few in from vault 76 which is one of the
vaults the other sort of opens up when
when the dust is settled on the on the
nuclear apocalypse and you will wander
out you'll build a base you can acquire
nuclear codes and you can nuke other
people's bases yeah it's a survival game
so is it is it more put in is this is
this effectively like the Elder Scrolls
online was to Skyrim no not really it's
a little bit different I was kind of
hoping for that to be honest I was kind
of hoping for a because there were
rumors it was going to be online I was
thinking all good maybe it'll be like
Elder Scrolls but yeah before our
universe but it's not really like that I
think it's going to be emptier than than
that and I think there's gonna be more
of a focus on survival and and yeah I'm
building a base whereas Elder Scrolls
online is very much just about
adventuring there is there's gonna be
cooperative stuff and for that yes
Elder Scrolls online is just totally
Skyrim but yes online I'm not you do
this Gemma saw a quest you go to attend
certain places and that's why I love it
and I still play lots of it so there are
a lot of people who understandably are
not enamored with Fallout 76 and I
totally get that I think there are some
reasons to be optimistic chief among
them the fact that Bethesda is quite
good or online games so I think that
this has a very good chance of being
objectively a good game that's a
corseted Elder Scrolls think it was
exactly but that said I do understand
that
you know people want a particular kind
of game from the Fallout series and it
is not going to be that not even close I
don't think so yeah but this isn't gonna
be this isn't the new direction for
Fallout is it this if it isn't I know
well this isn't this isn't unless it
makes it dead of money yes well yeah but
this is instead of 495 no but then but
but like there's no sign of a 4.5 but we
weren't expecting one at this point
anyway I wouldn't have thought it was
about time some more fallout and this is
what you're getting this time yeah yeah
but that's does neatly before before we
finish this and me we can come back to
other scroll secretory just which we
touch upon in the intro because see if
there's have been busy making this four
times six and I believe they have
another new franchise launching in maybe
a couple of years time yes called staff
stylized sour field
Sophie all day and let me check that are
you almost have started that it's not
Starcraft its howdy yes star field I
have you go ahead and wait what is it
called yeah yes star field we don't know
anything about this really it but what
we do know is reason to be very very
excited we know that it's gonna be in
space we know that it's made by Bethesda
and we know that it is their new IP
which is industry shorthand for
intellectual property which is a really
unsexy way of saying a new series an
entirely new thing and it's our first
it's their time saying before like
wasn't theirs and and elderscrolls
wasn't this well I don't know it gets a
little bit complicated as to sort of who
originated what but this is going to be
this is going to be Bethesda's first new
IP in a very very long time yes so it's
going to be really really really
interesting to see what happens to that
and I am hoping that it is going to be a
single-player RPG in the mould of Elder
Scrolls and fallout yeah but in space in
space yeah and you like space do you
like space I kind of like it yeah I'm
hot and cold on space actually debate
yeah the games I think can be some of
them can be good games and there's
always very much earth my game set on
earth yeah
I like game set on lush planets how much
more of a sort of forests person I'm
Samantha that's why I love you I really
say and the best place I'm better than
the cold bleak wastes of space you don't
worry about oxygen and all that nonsense
bloody oxygen um face who'd have it and
of course the time of their making this
new ipsa is delaying yeah the scroll six
and all we love is that though we don't
know that it's delaying well yeah if
they had nothing else to do Elder
Scrolls six would be oh thanks yeah
let's say but here's the thing they have
they have so much to do like they're so
busy counting their money from all of
the different places that they've found
to sell Skyrim it is true that they have
those who have a mobile game we have
Elder Scrolls blades coming out with a
phone they'll be hoping to replicate the
success of the fallout mobile game which
was I as I understand a real money
spinner for them was it yes so we'll get
all Elder Scrolls six but I was a little
surprised that they announced it to be
honest I thought they probably just put
Skyrim on a toaster or yeah or something
else like that and make all the money
again or the graphic novel or something
yeah as well just fully finished
oh you're making an you do and another
new do you know that give them we've
only just had new day well I knew just
that came out in 2016 honest that was it
okay time for new deem yeah and this one
might be out this year we don't know it
much about it but but doom doom is great
is coming yeah okay so the final thing
before we go yeah of the games that have
been announced and that we know are
coming this year and next what are your
top 3 I get 3 Wow 3
yeah I wasn't gonna ask you for your top
one now do you want them in order so I
want your choice sure sure but he could
have two extras mmm you know my top one
before I went to e3 absolutely would
have been Smash Brothers ultimate
because I'm very excited about that
yeah however I think cyberpunk 2077 has
just edged it okay I'm fully aboard the
hype train for cyberpunk something so I
put number one smash bros number two
yeah
and then it's tricky do you know what
number three I'm gonna give to a game
that we haven't actually talked about
but was it III and that's death
stranding okay I don't know that's
running nobody wanna give us a quick one
sentence okay I'll try so deaths
trending is the new game from Hideo
Kojima who is the the brain behind the
Metal Gear series yeah famously
eccentric games are what he makes very
weird and death stranding is the
weirdest by some margin is going to star
Mads Mikkelsen of Hannibal Fame yeah
it's going to star thingy use names
dropped out my head from The Walking
Dead
hang on I'll get there oh they're with
me the guy Norman Reedus Norman Reedus
who was on the cover of CNET magazine
last quarter let's go and pick it up
newsstands gonna have normal days you
see them um and that is about that's
about all I can say about it confidently
we got seek the first we got to see the
first death stranding gameplay at e3 and
I'm none the wiser as to what it's
actually about my best guess is there is
something to do with there are these
ghosts they're all this rain that
accelerates time when it touches you and
and that's why everyone's carrying
around a little baby in a jar and the
baby is like a clone of you I think so
that if you get got by the time monsters
you die but it accelerates the baby to
be a grown up to the point where you
were when you were killed and that's why
everyone has a baby it's like a little
insurance policy I think and you're some
sort of delivery man and it looks like
it's in Iceland
I like Iceland yeah that's the first bit
of everything all those words you've
just used yeah in that order that I've
been able to kind of latch on to and go
ah yeah got it yeah Iceland I'm not I've
not been I've not played much of the
Metal Gear series I have to say is a bit
of a blind spot for me but seeing the
deaths that seemed like the most
in-depth death stranding stuff it looks
beautiful
it's going to be so
weird and haunting and of course Kojima
hat of course has it in him to make a
really really great game so yeah there's
this number three good yeah I think
actually that's edging out last of us
too for me just in terms of stuff that
I'm curious well that's weird
oh that it is I'm interrogating my own
emotions now on them surprised at what I
find did Hideo Kojima do pt yes which is
absolutely messed up
yeah and terrifying so if he's doing a
game way yeah that was yeah that was a
that was a very short demo that was
going to be a demo for a silent hill's
game yeah by him it got cancelled
I can't download the demo anymore so so
it's actually quite rare to find out you
have to add so but the people who have
it installed on you know from when from
when the demo came out yeah they can
still play it but no one else can I just
looked up that falls horizon for will
launch on October 2nd so for me my games
to look forward to this year for the
horizon for Red Dead - and that says
pick I don't know what spyro spyro oh
they're remaking spires are they okay
let's go Spyro excuse fire I know the
crew - well because if the crew choose

like I should give some give it to spyro
