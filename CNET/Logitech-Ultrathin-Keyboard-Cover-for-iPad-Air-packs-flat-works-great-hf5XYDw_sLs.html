want to use it like a laptop now what
I'm Scott Stein and this is a look at
the Logitech ultrathin keyboard cover
for the iPad air now this is a gadget
that I looked at about a year or so ago
and thought it was the best keyboard
accessory on the iPad that you could
find it was very slim it magnetically
attached onto the iPad so it acted like
a cover and you could dock it in here
type to your heart's content
on a really nice keyboard over Bluetooth
well the only problem is that that older
one the slot doesn't fit the iPad air
because it's thinner and also the
footprint is different because it's less
wide and you wouldn't have this overlap
if you tried to use the old one
well a newly recut iPad air version is
here and thankfully if you like the old
one the keyboard feels just the same but
unfortunately in this landscape maybe
there are a few more covers and cases
out there that have a few more extra
features that this one's lacking one is
auto connect and if you don't care about
that basically it means the moment that
you undock and connect this that the
keyboard would actually turn itself on
and pair with your iPad now there are
other cases that have that feature this
one doesn't you have to flip the switch
on here it's pretty painless it then
pairs once you've paired once but if you
like a seamless use case then maybe you
want to look at things like the Logitech
fabric skin and the Belkin ultimate
keyboard case which have that also this
doesn't protect the back of the iPad no
surprise it's the cover so if you wanted
to have this be a protective case it's
not going to be that it does however
cover the front nicely it has little
bumpers and it could fit well into a
sleeve make sure you have some sort of
cozy for your iPad or if you like riding
dangerously with the back exposed you
know go for it so if your lap typing and
you want to tilt it to a slightly
different angle this only has one but I
really love the keyboard and its
responsiveness I thought this is the
best feeling keyboard that I've seen yet
and it's a very lightweight little
package 0.74 pounds you know but the
iPad air that's approaching the weight
of the iPad itself so it's a no longer
quite as ultra thin feeling but it packs
light in a bag it's pretty low
maintenance and the battery lasts a good
long time that's why I like it although
there are other solutions out there I
think it's one of the best accessories
you can get for the iPad air right now
it is $99 I think it's worth it this is
the Logitech ultrathin keyboard cover
for iPad air
there are several Logitech models out
there and several versions for different
iPads so don't get confused get the
right one I'm Scott Steinberg</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
