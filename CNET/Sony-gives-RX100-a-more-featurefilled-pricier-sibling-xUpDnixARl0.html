Christina and this is the sony cybershot
DSC rx100 too it's an updated version of
the rx100 which is still going to be
available and they added a lot of the
features to this model that I had really
wanted in the lower end model and when I
say lower end yes I know six hundred
dollars may not seem cheap but this one
is 750 and for that you get another one
inch CMOS sensor although sony has
decided to put a BSI CMOS that's
backside illuminated in this model now
that should make it better in low light
but I'll have to wait and see what the
images look like in good light because
that's sort of the trade off with the SI
sensors however Sony does say and they
would know that this is the first 1 inch
BSI CMOS usually they're found in
smaller cameras and smartphones some of
the other features that are added to
this model it now has a flip-out LCD
without and tilt as well as a hot shoe
and the hot shoe can incorporate an
optional electronic viewfinder of course
it takes the expensive electronic
viewfinder that they use for the rx1 the
higher-end full frame camera but it's a
very nice view finder as well as an
external mic into the hot shoe too so
you know I really liked the rx100 and I
looking forward to testing this one to
see if I think it's worth 750 dollars
I'm Lori gruene in and this is the sony
cybershot DSC rx100 to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
