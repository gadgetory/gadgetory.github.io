g-drive Evi TC from G technology now you
can see it is quite huge but for a few
good reasons first he's tough enough to
handle drop from up to 6.6 feet or 2
meter you can also deal with dust water
splash and pressure now if you're
wondering if it can deal with water
submersion well it doesn't have to
because it actually floats and secondly
this is a thunderbolt drive and take a
look it has very cool built-in cable
right here just peel it off and plug in
and you are ready this is a bus power
drive and that means there's no need for
a separate power adaptor and finally in
case your computer does not have a
thunderbolt port you can also use this
drive with a USB port and here's how
just open the case here and take a look
on the inside the drive hoe another
purple drive the evie raw now the raw
here connect to a computer using this
USB 3.0 port right here there's also
this SATA port for it to also work with
other AV products such as this evie
jeang
duck that I have here so if you've been
using the e V ecosystem from G
technology the new drive here will fit
in very nicely now performance Y this
right here did very well in my testing
both with honorable and USB 3.0 with a
top sustain will will copy speed up
close to 140 megabyte per second that is
very fast for a hard drive based
portable drive and that's mean for the
current cost of $200 for one terabyte is
quite a good buy for a drive of this
type now for more check out my full
review sce.com
basically this is a great drive for
those who need a storage device that can
deal with rough dirty or wet
environments and let's mean I don't need
it because my environment is completely
smooth clean and drive ok maybe a bit
much sometimes and that's because I'm
double or this has been the first look
at the G Drive evie ATC from G
technology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
