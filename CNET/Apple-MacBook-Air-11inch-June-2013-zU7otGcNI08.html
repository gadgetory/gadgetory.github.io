new line of MacBook Airs at WWDC as
expected because there are new Intel
fourth-generation
processors that are out there with a
good speed bump and some battery life
advantages to boot and sure enough
Apple's claims on the new 2013 MacBook
Airs battery wise are amazingly
impressive the 11 inch is supposed to
get 9 hours of battery life and the
13-inch 12 we're gonna focus on the 11
here which we've got right over here and
Apple makes some really good products in
the MacBook Airs the decisions and the
movement in these new models is a
conservative one when you consider that
you've got touchscreen laptops and all
sorts of convertible tablets out there
on the market what Apple's providing
here are a series of improvements
internally externally it's the same
exact design as before very slim very
sturdy but if you use the 2012 MacBook
Air or even the 2011 you know you're
dealing with coming along the battery
life boost are those Intel
fourth-generation processors which come
in the form of a Core i5 or you can
upgrade to a dual core i7 just like last
year but with the new models and they're
a better integrated graphics intel HD
5000 graphics which are better then you
might find in some other equivalent
processors what you're gonna get here
our better gaming graphics you're gonna
get better graphics and performance
boosts for photo and video editing and
that's useful Apple also claims a little
bit of an SSD speed boost but between
that and the processor what it means is
you get a lot zippier at startup
switching applications and general
performance the other boost here is
gonna come in the form of wireless
communication because this MacBook Air
has 802 11 AC that's a faster new
standard of wireless networking that
supplants 802 11 n that's been out there
for a while it o to of an AC is showing
up in a lot of computers and with Apple
now they've made the move in the airs
and also in connected base stations and
peripherals like the new time capsule
and Airport Express which now have the
technology to another nice advantage
here is the new airs are a little bit
less expensive you get more bang for
your buck the $9.99 MacBook Air 11 inch
which is the cheapest MacBook Air that
Apple makes it finally has 128 gigabytes
of SSD storage or something we've
weighed
for a while before it was 64 gigs and
that really doesn't cut it so now you've
got that and at the bump up level 1199
gets you 256 gigabytes and it also cost
a little less to get up to 512 than
before so you're looking at about the
$1,500 range whereas before with MacBook
Airs you're kind of pushing up towards
2000 that's about it in terms of really
big changes here you're dealing with
faster and hopefully a really big bump
in battery life and you're paying a
little bit less for it stay tuned for
our full review
I'm Scotts time with the new 11 inch
MacBook Air</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
