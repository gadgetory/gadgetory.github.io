the past year reimagining a simpler more
helpful smartphone experience we've also
been working on some new products to
make your pixel to experience even
better let's start with the newly
updated Google daydream view our virtual
reality headset we kept everything from
last year that people loved and we made
it even better to start we have a new
lineup of colors that complement this
year's made by Google family we also
upgraded the lenses and the fabrics so
the headset has our widest field of view
yet and is super light and comfortable
of course
what matters most in a VR headset is
where it can take you last year we
launched with 25 apps and games and now
we have more than 250 high quality VR
titles we've also seen that people love
going places with VR videos so we're
excited to announce a slate of premium
video content coming to daydream
including multiple new original series
on YouTube VR and on Google Play Movies
you can experience new IMAX movies
available for free to pixel to owners so
you get to hang out with Tigers run
alongside elephants dive into the ocean
with some sharks and blast into space
with pixel twos new front firing stereo
speakers these movies sound as amazing
as they look and now you can even cast
the experience to the TV so your friends
and family can see what you're seeing
the new Google daydream view is the best
mobile VR headset on the market and will
be available for $99</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
