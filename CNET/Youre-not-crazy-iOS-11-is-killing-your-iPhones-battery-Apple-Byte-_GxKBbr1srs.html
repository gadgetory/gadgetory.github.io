the Apple buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple it's the
follow-up after everything that dropped
last week we'll get to the Apple watch
Series three but first up the iPhone 8
and 8 plus now Apple just released an
update to iOS 11 with eleven point 0.1
which fixes an exchange email server bug
but the biggest issue battery life
issues now a recent report says the
latest version of iOS has already been
installed on 25% of iOS devices and a
lot of people are saying battery life is
significant this latest update doesn't
help that yet and yes it depends on your
usage but even research firm Juan Dara
analyzed the performance of 50,000
moderate to heavy users and found that
it took roughly 96 minutes to drain a
full battery in iOS 11 compared to 240
minutes in iOS 10 now I'm hearing the
biggest complaints from people on the
iPhone 6 or success results have been
mixed and some people aren't seeing
these same issues but is this happen to
you and on what phone let us know in the
comments alright in another issue Apple
confirms they are working on a fix for
iPhone 8 and 8 plus where some owners
are hearing intermittent crackling
noises when using them for phone calls
the Cupertino kids say it will be
included in an upcoming software update
and IHS market did their annual teardown
of the iPhone 8 and 8 plus to just find
out how much do the newest iPhones cost
after taking them apart the iPhone 8
plus is building materials came out to
288 dollars and eight cents now after
manufacturing costs are factored in it
was only seventeen dollars and 78 cents
more than the seven plus which is
actually pretty nice when you consider
it has 32 gigs of storage more improved
processor wireless charging and an
improved camera now the iPhone 8 came in
at 247 dot 51 cents that's nine dollars
and 57 cents higher than last year's
iPhone 7 and no this isn't to make you
feel depressed about how much you're
paying after all the overhead like
marketing and packaging and shipping for
the phone and then helping Apple build
this new fancy-schmancy headquarters as
well as paying for Eddy cues colorful
keynote shirts
alright Apple just dropped a new batch
of developer betas for iOS 11.1 watch OS
4.1 TV
11.1 and mac OS ten point thirteen point
one peter pierre payments or cloud
integration with iMessage aren't in the
iOS beta just yet but the watch OS beta
brings the first look at music streaming
with Apple music or your iCloud music
library straight to the Apple watch now
there's also a new radio app that gives
you access to beats 1 radio or any Apple
music radio station as well so
developers they gonna play with that
right now and Mac OS high sierra dropped
this week and to be honest i haven't
updated because knowing apple's updates
i like to give it a few days now the
majority of feedback is that it breathes
new life to 2016 computers with its
speed and I think the biggest feature
I'm excited for is safaris ability to
prevent me from getting hammered by
autoplay videos at every site like I
hate that but a day one exploit found by
X NSA analyst Patrick Wartell shows how
anyone could run malicious code to
pilfer the passwords in your keychain to
everything from your Facebook Twitter
and yes even Bank of America account so
it's pretty much everything that sounds
fun but I don't want you to get too
paranoid about this now Wardle hasn't
revealed the full exploit code publicly
but Apple is expected to patch the issue
eventually as in hopefully like now all
right let's talk Apple watch Series 3
there are plenty things that I like
about it and things that can make it
better I've been using it over the past
week non-stop and will post my full
review in a few days that's really more
in depth that's what's out there because
there are always things Apple just
doesn't tell you about now I love it for
working out it's really one of the best
use cases that can make it special when
you can still be connected to the world
just in case anything happens it's just
all on this wrist but the biggest issue
I've discovered is with messages now
Apple has never said anything about it
and it's been confirmed by many users
like you which led to an official
confirmation from Apple to seen it
the Apple watch Series 3 needs to be
connected to an iPhone to send SMS
messages to non iPhone users now if the
phone is off and you have no connection
and no Wi-Fi but just the watch connect
to the LTE SMS messages will not work
only iMessages you know what that
matters and really to bury that and
after several hours on tech support with
AT&amp;amp;T and Apple tech reps who couldn't
figure it out and then confirming it
with other users to unearth that myself
you know with that guess that's a bad
apple oh but yes I still really like the
Apple watch 33 LT it shines when it
works but you'll get all those down low
with my upcoming review and we'll dig
into all of it alright in a good move
developers like Sue's am are releasing
standalone Apple watch apps that don't
require a connection to the iPhone and
work over LTE there's plenty like
Twitter Instagram and others that still
need the phone to work so hopefully
that's just a matter of time for
developers and check this out the most
anticipated hypebeast phone right now
you know what it is the iPhone 10 might
be a whole lot harder to get than you
think now according to multiple reports
Apple is having significant yield
problems with the 3d sensors used in the
true depth camera module for the iPhone
10 you know all that good stuff tucked
into that lovely looking notch now the
low rate of production of these sensors
is the bottleneck and reports say Apple
is only getting out less than 10,000
units per day now the ten hasn't even
reached mass production yet and
estimates say 10 million phones we
produced by the end of October with an
estimate of 40 million by the end of
this year
now pre-ordered projections are
targeting around 50 million units which
means Apple may not be able to even
fulfill all those pre-orders before
early 2018 so for all of you that see me
cry like a baby on Twitter when I lose
out on getting a pair of Jordans or
Yeezys or even the latest SNES classic
you're all going to know exactly what
that feels like
alright so you might miss out on the
iPhone 10 but I'm here to make you feel
like a rock star thanks to our good
friends at Belkin now since Apple was so
nice took away our ability to listen to
music and charge our headphones at the
same time thanks Apple Belkin is hooking
six of you up with their charged
rockstar adapters now three have a 3.5
millimeter audio connector and a
Lightning port for charging while three
others that I have have a Lightning
audio port and a Lightning charging port
so these will work with the iPhone 7s
eight and tens and many of you keep
asking me what happened to the nine well
did anyone tell you seven eight nine so
so when all you have to do is identify
the character on my shirt from last
week's show tell me which rock star you
want over
or Twitter and I'll pick six of you
randomly so you know what let's get
ready to dum good and we really like to
leave you all on a high note so here it
is
Thank You das bull on Twitter for this
amazing the iPhone 10 all right that's
gonna do it for this week's show you can
email us at the Apple bite at cnet.com
or tweet me at Brian Kong thanks much
for watching we'll catch y'all next time
for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
