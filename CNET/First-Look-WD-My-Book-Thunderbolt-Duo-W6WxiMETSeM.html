I have another Thunder ball device to
show you this is the double D my book
Thunder boom door now after this you can
have to wait for a long time before I
have another one to show you and by long
time I mean maybe next month this new
drive here actually looks very much the
same as previous Drive in the my book
series from WD the only difference is on
the front here instead of a long
vertical big power light you can see a
tiny tiny one and on the back in setup
your speed or five Y or ysera you can
see two Thunderbolt ports that means the
drive here can work with a computer and
also you can plug another Thunderbolt
device to it in a daisy-chain setup now
on top here you can see that there's a
lid that can open to the drive bay it's
actually very easy to access the drive
you'll have to unscrew the top and pull
the drive app now take a look here the
hard drive inside they are the WD green
drive the green dry because they use
less energy but also they are a little
bit slower than other Drive for that
reason in my testing the my book here
actually one of the slowest Thunderball
storage on the market is not really slow
though it's still really really fast
compared with other non a Thunderbolt
Drive but compared mall Thunderbolt
drives themselves it's kind of kind of
slow
now these hard drives are coming either
2 terabyte or 3 terabyte making a total
storage of 40 about or sick Tara by now
if you want to change the hard drive
which you can make sure you use WD green
drive because other hard drive are not
guaranteed to work with this Drive now
similar to other Thunderbolt devices
I've seen the EE my book Thunderbolt
dual here does not come with a necessary
Thunderbolt cable you have to buy this
again by yourself for another 50 dollars
and the cable here as you see actually
really long I'm a salad before but I
don't know why Apple makes this cable
here one size and this law and seriously
how hard that to cut the cable and make
it just right for the drive I'm
sure when Apple will offer that cable
but when it does is gonna change your
life again you can set up the hard drive
of the my book door into either red one
or r80 configuration the drive come with
a software called WD utility that help
you do that very easily rate zero give
you the top amount of space and fast
performance but if one of the drives
die you lose everything red one is the
opposite you have a half of the capacity
but your data safety is doubled now the
final question is how much does this
cost the new W Thunderbolt Drive come in
two sizes 4 terabyte and sick terabyte
that cost signal dollars and 700 dollars
respectively
now that's still quite expensive about
$200 more expensive than other my book
drive of the same capacity that do not
use Thunderbolt but when compared with
other Thunderbolt devices that actually
not too bad for more information check
out the in-depth review at sea calm on
the gate my name is Doug low and this
has been the first look at the double D
in my book
