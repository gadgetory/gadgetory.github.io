Cena I'm here with Andrew Hoyle hello
Andy hello Luke we just got out of
Samsung's Aoife press conference where
it announced this it is the Samsung gear
s 3 it's its newest SmartWatch Andy what
are your first impressions of this thing
I like is a sign of this one I think
that's was really cool um the one you're
wearing there I think that one's called
the frontier that one's designed for
like a rugged outdoorsman sort of watch
people who like kayaking and climbing up
rock faces and diving off said rock
faces and I think for that it kind of
looks cool do you agree you're wearing
the thing I do like the look but we have
to talk about the size I felt like I
mean just look at it it's huge I felt
like this was something we were getting
over with smartwatches I felt like they
were coming down in size the technology
was getting a little bit more slim and
they were becoming just a little less
obtrusive it looks big on you and so
this is 46 mill the previous one was 42
so that's quite an increase and I think
certainly on smaller wrist certainly on
more feminine hands that's gonna look
like a chunk you better care it feels
like a backward step to me size-wise but
maybe Samsung's go for a more niche
crowd make people who just like enormous
watches anyway let's talk about some of
the other features so that the dial
control the dial interface is still
there we mean I was a big fan of that
and it's good to see it make a return
yeah it's a nice way of interacting with
a watch with the Apple watch it's all
about touching that screen which is fine
but you do then smudging the screen and
you know your finger covers up some of
the things you want to touch where is
this it's really quite intuitive and
it's nice and and they've gotten letting
you watch faces as well which looks kind
of cool I guess my real question with
the gear s3 is the gear s2 was brilliant
and the Apple watch is good as well you
know they're good smartwatches
if they if they if they didn't spark
sort of widespread mainstream consumer
interest is does this have any more of a
chance I'm not sure this is really gonna
do it for smartwatches you know what I'm
not sure if it's the watches themselves
that aren't doing it it's just that the
message about what they're doing isn't
really getting out there cuz the watch
is like this is a it's not as not
a totally new version over the gear s2
this is basically the same water just a
little bit better and so really it's up
to Samsung to really tell people why
they should need a SmartWatch like why
they should have it cuz people ask us
that people still come to seen it now
our readers are still saying well why do
I need a SmartWatch I what what do they
do what's the point and it is it's
actually kind of difficult to answer
that question and and so that's what
something needs to do give people a
reason we add in these features that's
given them a real real reason so we've
we've got the features but we still
don't have the reason anyway that's what
we think but we won't know what you
think about the gear s3 SmartWatch so
let us know and check out see Netcom /fo
