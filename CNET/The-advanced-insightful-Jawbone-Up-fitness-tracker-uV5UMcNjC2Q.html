now we're taking a first look at the new
jawbone up24 fitness tracker costing 149
the up24 replaces the previous jaw bone
up as the company's flagship fitness
gadget don't worry though the original
up isn't going away but will be sold for
a hundred and twenty nine dollars meant
to be worn around your wrist all day
long the up24 can do all the tracking
tricks the first up handles for instance
the device measures the steps you take
logs to length and quality of your sleep
and is highly water and sweat resistant
it has the up silent alarm function too
plus a power nap mode new features the
up24 has includes wireless syncing with
iPhones over Bluetooth 4.0 the up24
still charges its rechargeable battery
through a headphone jack only now it's a
smaller 2.5 millimeter plug instead of a
larger 3.5 millimeter connector jawbone
says the device should last about seven
days on a full charge the main and only
button control on the up24 has been
retooled to so that it's bigger and
easier to tap and press holding down the
key kicks the device into sleep mode you
then press it again to return to normal
mode in the morning if you forget to tap
the up24 in the am however the gadget
should be smart enough to automatically
catch on that you're up a week and
walking around paired with a new up
three point 0 mobile app the up24 now
keeps a running tally on short term
progress which it calls streaks
basically when you hit your daily goal 3
5 or 7 days in a row the app will
acknowledge bigger accomplishments to
terms milestones for say when you hit 1
million steps or other impressive
long-term feats since the up24 stays in
constant communication with its paired
mobile app and pays attention to your
behavior 24-7 job on says that after a
week of wearing the gizmo users should
begin seeing Taylor Mead advice for
example a today I will message will prod
you to drink more water or get to bed
earlier
if the up24 thinks you're slacking in
that area other motivational tools in
the up24 s arsenal are ways to connect
with other up users see their progress
in relation to you and get relevant
alerts pushed to your phone I'm Brian
Bennett for cnet and this has been a
first look at the jawbone up24 for more
