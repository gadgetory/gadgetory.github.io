time top 5 laptops as of this
mid-october 2010
you know laptops aren't the other
computer anymore for most folks they are
the computer so don't buy a crappy one
here are five that are the opposite of
that number five is the delightfully
named Sony Vaio
VP cz 128 GX it gets an 8.0 seen that
rating though and big buzz from CNET
users
now sit down this one starts at 2 grand
and our test unit 3,400 bucks but the
design is slick and the hard drive is an
exotic 512 gigabyte solid state drive
and it's just about the most desirable
thing this side of something with an
apple on it we did find the battery life
to be just fine
but it does have switching graphics
that's the hot new technology that moves
between a high powered dedicated
graphics card or a less power-hungry
integrated graphics chip depending on
your task it's one machine that actually
lets you sit down next to somebody with
a MacBook Pro and not feel like a tool
number 4 is the new MacBook Air with an
eight-point-two CNET rating so slim
you'll worry it'll cut you the new air
uses solid state disks only no
mechanical ones so it boots like an iPad
and has major battery life we tested the
11 inch and got like 4 and a half hours
on a charge if you get the larger 13
inch model battery life gets up near 7
hours then it starts at a grand so kind
of pricey especially considering it uses
an older Intel Core 2 Duo CPU and only
the 13-inch model even offers an SD card
reader but you don't buy the new MacBook
Air to win a brag war over specs with
your geek buddies besides they'll be too
busy booting their laptops and dabbing
the sweat from carrying them number
three another slick looker it's the HP
Envy 17 seen that rating 8.2 gorgeous
design blu-ray playback 17 inch 1080p
display HDMI and display out ports as
well as USB 3.0 but the battery lives a
little short and that ati mobility
radeon HD 5850 is your only graphics
choice but at a snick under 1,300 bucks
we're still on board with this guy for
affordable luxury number 2 the toshiba
portage a r 705 p 25 it also gets an 8.2
CNET rating but it's got an editor's
choice attached to it and got big scene
at traffic lately another sophisticated
laptop but not as pretty as the HP or
the sony we just saw so why the buzz
value is the story here at around 900
bucks and down as low as 800 Street it
juggles beautifully the balance of
performance design and cost now know one
thing stands out but it does have a
great keyboard and touchpad you'll use
those quite a bit and Intel's wireless
display technology for that second
monitor and our favorite laptop number
one on the list is the MacBook Pro with
an 8 point 3 C net rating let's face it
these guys invented Loess table design
and the latest MacBook Pro looks no
different but inside is now available a
core i7 CPU and NVIDIA GeForce GT 330 M
graphics that switch flawlessly with the
integrated intel graphics chip for the
common tasks the multi-touch trackpad is
the best in the business it has really
powerful one two three or four finger
gestures including the one you might
just give every other laptop in this
list after you play with this little
ingot of aluminum for a few minutes now
it really should offer HDMI out blu-ray
3G but Apple has instead double down on
what their machine already did well
expect to pay 2200 bucks or so for the
best 15 inch factory config that's what
we tested so there you go
your iPad is now officially a toy again
and you can give your netbook to the
kids 5 really great laptops and the
latest list you can check out from Dan
Ackerman and Scott Stein it's over on
cnet.com or just bounce over to top 5
