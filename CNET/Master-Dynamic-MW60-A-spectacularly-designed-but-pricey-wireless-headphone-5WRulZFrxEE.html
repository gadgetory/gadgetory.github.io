wireless bluetooth headphone which cost
$550 and comes in black or brown in case
you've never heard of master and dynamic
it's a new company that made a name for
itself with its MH 40 headphone the
wired model that this is based on design
wise the MW 60 is a great-looking
headphone that's really well built with
metal parts leather trim and folding
hinges it's also comfortable though
somewhat on the heavy side weighing in
at 12 point 2 elsa's or 345 grams for
those with smaller heads this headphone
maybe a tad large it barely fit my head
but I like the feel of the lambskin
covered ear cups and overall this
definitely comes across as a premium
headphone it also has good battery life
at around 62 hours and maintained a
consistent wireless connection we like
how the wired version of this headphone
sounds and we like how this sounds it's
an excellent bluetooth headphone that
offers clean even-handed sound with
tight base that said it doesn't sound
quite as rich or detailed as
Sennheiser's momentum Wireless which
costs a little less and adds noise
cancelling in the end aside from being
slightly heavy
the only real knock against this
headphone is that it costs too much it
sounds very good but not $550 good but
if you can overlook the high price it's
a beautifully designed headphone I'm
