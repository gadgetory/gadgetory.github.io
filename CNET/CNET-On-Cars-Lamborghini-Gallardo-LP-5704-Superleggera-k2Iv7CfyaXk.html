sight you probably don't recognize your
own lovin these cars are iconic and
they've had this certain look since the
days of the Countach kind of like this
partly open Swiss Army knife on wheels
just edges everywhere this cars a
Guyardo it's their entry-level car if
there is such a thing in their line
let's decode what it's name to
LP is plunge into the now a posteriori
that's the odd way the engine is in the
back in line with the car with the
transmission in the rear of that 570 is
the power output but that's in metric
horsepower 4 means it's all wheel drive
and then there's Superleggera superlight
it's the key to our story that shaves
off 154 pounds bring this car in at just
29 54 that's 355 pounds less than a
Nissan Z which is not exactly a big car
now as you may have noticed the main
course on this Weight Watchers program
is carbon fiber the real deal not those
appliques you stick on your car this
wing this lid this is normally aluminum
carbon fiber here polycarbonate over the
engine as well as the rear back light
the shells of the seats are carbon fiber
with thin Alcantara upholstery and damn
little padding all that adds up or adds
down to 154 pounds saved and all of it
mounted to the same aluminum body shell
and space frame design of a standard
Guyardo that all spells light but it
also spells tremendously strong this
isn't just a fast car it's also a very
safe one that's how you'll get
permission from your wife
yes if you look like this you deserve to
have the world look at you through a
glass cover this is the 5.2 liter
Lamborghini v10 it was actually
developed for the introduction of this
car a clean sheet design not a rehash of
the audi v10 contrary to rumors
this guy has 562 horsepower 398
foot-pounds of torque
big difference there this is a revving
motor not a grunting motor zero to sixty
happens in under 3.4 seconds in the
hands of the right driver 14 20 mpg if
you care our transmission is the much
more common 6-speed automated manual
it's a single clutch design which we're
going to evaluate in a minute you can
also get a manual gearbox in this guy
also with six cogs they're exceedingly
rare if you're a collector that's your
choice if you're a driver Lamborghini
says this is the one you want
now once you wedge yourself into a guard
oh it's pretty tight quarters and you
can't do a whole hell of a lot about it
in this car Superleggera
you've only got basically one seat
adjustment a mechanical four aft no
motors to go any other way
to save weight once you're seated plenty
of things tell you this is a distinctive
Italian car that does things its own way
the power window switches push up to go
down push down to go up huh
your transmission controls are right
here in the center console except for
reverse which lives over here by the
front hood release and when I got in
this morning all that rain water on the
roof was conveniently run not down a
rain channel but down the back of my
shirt and partly inside the seat these
are Italian cars the main event in terms
of Technology in the cabin is this dated
but functional outtie head unit they
haven't used this in an Audi in quite
some time but of course Audie owns
Lamborghini and this is about all you
can make work on the data bus within
this relatively aged car the optional
head unit gets you an iPod connector in
the glovebox and if you pop the screen
you'll find two SD card slots there as
well don't get excited about the DVD
player that's a data drive for the map
not for watching movies this rear view
camera is optional it's one of the worst
I've seen in terms of resolution poor
dynamic range and very crunchy
resolution but you do need it in this
car because well it's the only way to
see out the back but this is not why you
buy a Lamborghini things that connect to
these buttons are here your transmission
controls for the automated manual the a
button toggles between automatic mode or
shift it yourself with the paddle mode
that's their idea of manual sport is a
layer on top of that that's going to
sharpen your throttle response back off
stability control quite a bit and also
open up the exhaust baffling to sound
like some kind of belch from hell
finally there's Corsa track mode that
cancels almost all stability control and
probably your insurance this little
button here is interesting slice of life
with a Lamborghini you press that to
raise or lower the front of the car that
gets you over speed bumps without
leaving 20% of your Guyardo behind
but SD card slots and little blip the
thing is those are not let you buy a
Guyardo this is
so what's it like to drive a Guyardo in
general violent stiff
the car is incredibly light I don't just
mean in terms of weight but I mean the
power-to-weight ratio sometimes the car
Falls a little flat on its face that's
the nature of a single clutch automated
manual they just can't do that ping-pong
thing that allows the car to have
seamless application of power Wow does
it go now you might think this car is
never really at home unless it's on the
track but at signora Lamborghini said
famously years ago we have no test track
our cars are built for the road
and that's the way it should be
this is not a car that you drive to work
every day but on the days you do you
smile from 9:00 to 5:00 just waiting for
the drive home
right before you race down to the dealer
let me help you price out our bumblebee
friend
CNET style bass on a Superleggera is
about 2:38 it's a high-end Guyardo of
course 29.95 delivery charge must come
in a velvet line box or something $2,100
gas guzzler test but at this price you
don't care now the tech toy navigation
Bluetooth and media inputs 35:10 if you
want those painted body color at 850
more if you want the rear camera plugged
into that
that's another twenty six hundred bucks
forty one fifty for the full carbon
fiber kit inside in addition to the door
panels and 15 six for carbon ceramic
brakes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
