the side door is unmarked it's been a
year since the original August smart
lock was released so it's about due for
an upgrade and this is it is called the
August smart lock home kit edition as
the name suggests it is of course apple
homekit compatible with all of the bells
and whistles you would expect including
Siri voice control so you can do things
like ask Siri hey lock my front door
lock my back door you can even be a bit
more granular with her as well and say
hey Siri is my front door locked so you
can check the status of that as well the
smart lock has a lot of the same
features that were on the original so of
course you get full smart phone control
you can lock and unlock your door from
within the smart phone app there is
automatic locking so when you leave the
proximity of your house the door will
automatically lock and you can also
grant other users access to your smart
look as well from within the app so it's
going to be available for two hundred
and twenty nine dollars on pre-order
also on the product lineup is the smart
keypad from August now this is $79 and
you can set a one-time access code say
for example if you're having a plumber
or a bill to come over to your house you
just want to grant in the one-time
access you can do so with a specific
code or you can have a persistent code
for someone like kids who don't
necessarily carry keys so they can
access the house constantly you can also
see through the app who exactly is
accessing your house at any one time
next up is the doorbell cam now this has
140 degree camera it's HD at 96
DP it is a two-way voice system so you
can actually talk and respond to the
person that is at your front door you
can see all of the interactions through
the app as well plus you can grant them
access and it has a motion sensor too so
you can actually see a live stream of
who is at the front door or you could
just want to see what's happening
outside your house you can do so as well
so this one is going to be available for
199 dollars now these all work together
within the August app and there is a
special part of the app it's going to be
released it just in beta with 13 launch
partners it is called August access and
so this gives you a range of different
vendors that can come to the house you
can grant one-time access to including
people like seers post mates or even a
dog walking service so you can see
exactly who is accessing your house and
granting permission to enter at any
particular time so that's been a first
look at the brand-new suite of August
