you might think yeah it's another
surface clone there's a big difference
here actually the Microsoft Surface
sells its keyboard cover what you really
need separately here it's included now
why is that a big deal
that's because with the Samsung Galaxy
you're all in for $8.99 while it's a
thousand now it's plus if you get a
surface pro 4 plus the keyboard cover
which is 129 dollars now the keyboard
cover for the Samsung it's not that it
only goes to two angles one upright one
is further back for couch surfing and
sometimes frankly neither is exactly
perfect whereas the surface kickstand
goes to any angle you want it's a real
plus there however in the galaxy tabpro
s the display is just brilliant it's a
real selling point
it's an AMOLED display which is closely
related to the OLED technology used now
in the most expensive TVs as a
standalone tablet the Samsung Galaxy
it's incredibly thin and light there's
just a single USBC port on it and
there's no fans inside because it's kind
of Intel Core M processor in there so
they can really keep it super slim this
is not the most powerful Windows tablet
around and there's a promise accessory
pen that's not available yet but
especially with that AMOLED screen and
the keyboard cover included for $8.99
it's a really great value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
