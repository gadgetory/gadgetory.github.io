Bridget Carey this is your cnet update
the facebook Messenger app is expanding
into a mapping app of sorts with the
latest update you can send a map of your
location to a friend you can also put a
little pin anywhere on the map to set a
meeting place you'll find this option
under the more button that's the
ellipses facebook says it's not going to
be gathering location data from your
device in the background you have to
have turned on location on your phone
for it to work Facebook has been
criticized recently for how the app
previously tracked location because it
wasn't always obvious that location was
being shared in the background when you
have the setting turned on the periscope
video streaming app is also adding a
mapping feature you can see pin dots of
where people are broadcasting live
around the world in the global section
you can scroll through a map to jump to
a broadcast at any location but do be
careful when sharing your location if
you stream from home anyone can get an
exact pinpoint of where you live
periscope which is owned by Twitter also
now makes it easy to share links to
broadcasts on Twitter as others add new
map features Yahoo is removing Maps the
site Maps yahoo com is closing at the
end of June the company reported this in
a blog post Yahoo Maps has been around
for eight years but the company says it
wants to focus on other priorities and
here's another company changing its
focus lycos is making a health tracking
bracelet and a smart ring yes this is
the same lycos that was big in the 90s
as a search engine it's still alive
although it morphed a little bit when it
was acquired by a global marketing
company in 2010 and now it wants to get
into the wearable tech business the
light coast band is a hundred and
twenty-five dollars and the ring is
sixty dollars both can be used as tools
to unlock your phone and using NFC it
can transfer data to someone else with a
tap so for example you just tap it to
share your contact information with
another nearby phone the wristband has
added health tracking features with a
promise of a battery that can last
two weeks and you can expect Sony to
announce another smartband soon an app
for the new sony smartband 2 appeared in
the Google Play Store and it was soon
pulled off the blog android police was
quick to spot it before it was yanked
the apt description reveals that this
new band has a heart rate monitor that's
something last year's $100 model did not
include it also lists a smart week of
feature to start your day that's all for
this tech news update you could always
