boring fridges with few features to
speak of but here's an outlier the
Samsung are t21 m61 3s are catchy name
right currently selling for 850 dollars
the RT to one offers a couple of
interesting extras that you don't
normally get unless you're spending
thousands on a fancy French door model
for starters you get these nice sturdy
recessed handles that lend the modern
minimalist aesthetic to your kitchen
inside you've got a slide and reach
drawer up top that runs the width of the
fridge which is another nice touch for a
top freezer there's also a feature
called flex zone that lets you switch
the freezer into fridge mode all of that
helps set this top freezer apart from
the competition but how does it perform
well take a look for yourself at the
default setting it manages to keep the
main shelves down below 40 degrees
Fahrenheit which is what you want but
those orange areas are less ideal you
can forgive the hot spots in the butter
bin and the bottom door shelf but the
crispers really ought to be colder than
40 degrees in order to inhibit the
growth of things like Listeria you don't
want that on a positive note that flex
zone feature worked like a charm raising
the average temperature in the freezer
up to about 35 degrees fahrenheit
without affecting performance in the
fridge itself that bottom section of the
freezers stayed below freezing though so
be careful if you're flexing it into a
makeshift beverage cooler at your next
party this is one of the first top
freezers that Samsung has ever sold in
the US and all in all I think it's a
pretty good pick performance wasn't
perfect but it was passable and the
design has enough going for it to feel
more luxurious than it actually is if
you're on a tight budget and want
something simple yet stylish give it
some consideration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
