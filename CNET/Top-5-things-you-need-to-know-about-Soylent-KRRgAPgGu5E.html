to know about Soylent what's Soylent
it's a popular meal replacement drink no
that's not one of the five let's dive
into the five at number five prep what
does it take to have a Soylent meal it
depends on what type you buy you can buy
it in a powder that you mix with water
in a container the instructions say to
shake up the powder and water to get a
good consistency I suggest getting a
hand blender or a paint shaker there's
an already liquid version called Soylent
2.0 and now you're wondering how do I
choose number four tastes the best way
to describe Soylent 2.0 is Cheerios milk
imagine you had a bowl of Cheerios
cereal soaking in milk then get rid of
the Cheerios that's approximately the
taste and mouthfeel of 2.0 the powdered
solids best analog is pancake batter
I find needed to be offensive but then i
exactly mouth-watering at number three
cost one of the ideas about any meal
replacement is that it is cheaper than
going out to get food and that's usually
true especially if you live in a
bustling metropolis
Roza labs the company behind Soylent
says you can get a full Soylent meal for
about three dollars number two nutrition
in theory if you drank nothing but
Soylent in a day you should receive 100%
of the FDA approved amount of vitamins
based on a diet of 2,000 calories there
is no cholesterol in the Soylent powder
or to point out however the overall fat
content per serving is pretty high add a
fully fueled by Soylent
could pack 100 grams of fat the FDA
guidelines suggests less than 65 grams
of fat for a diet of 2,000 calories of
course fats are complicated you break
out harmful fats like unsaturated fats
or trans fats you'll find Soylent is
well below FDA guidelines which is a
good thing and that number one effects
on the body
pretty much everyone wants to know what
happens to your body when you drink this
stuff well some people have complained
about gastrointestinal issues personally
I haven't experienced those as a result
of Soylent your how do we put this
delicately leavings will appear
different and maybe smaller there is a
concern about the cadmium level in
Soylent while the level is lower than US
federal standards the cadmium level
triggers our labeling
in the state of California under
Proposition 65 Rosa Labs insists the
levels are in no way toxic there are
more meal replacement things to try out
I will test them out and then maybe even
rank them in the future for more top 5
check out top 5 cnet.com am i as act
hard i'll see you online
