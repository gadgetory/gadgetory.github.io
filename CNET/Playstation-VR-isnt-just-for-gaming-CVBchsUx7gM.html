PlayStation VR and this is cinematic
mode where you can watch movies with
your VR headset you don't just have to
play games with it here we're seeing a
16 by 9 aspect ratio movie it's not
really VR you know or 360 but you can
actually watch your movie through your
headset and also use your PlayStation
use the menus with your headset and it
all kind of looks like you're in a movie
theater it's a wider screen there's a
whole bunch of cool new features that
are coming through VR that are not just
related to gaming and the PlayStation VR
headset will work with any existing
PlayStation 4 so you can use it with
regular games it also feels like the
game moves with you and the headset a
little bit more so than just playing on
my TV Oh freaky it's not exactly like VR
but again we're not playing a VR game
we're playing a regular PlayStation game
do you feel like I'm a little bit more
stuck into the action and it takes a
little getting used to for sure this
isn't like a typical game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
