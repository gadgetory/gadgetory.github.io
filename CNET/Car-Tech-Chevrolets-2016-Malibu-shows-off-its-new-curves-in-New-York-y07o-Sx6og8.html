new york international auto show and
welcome to this the 2016 chevy malibu
and the malibu has long been Chevy's
entry-level full-size sedan and this
year it gets even more full-size growing
almost 4 inches in wheelbase it gives a
lot more room on the inside but somehow
magically GM has actually reduced the
weight of the car by some 300 pounds it
means better handling and better fuel
efficiency to motors will be on offer
starting with a 1.5 liter turbocharged
ecoboost engine there's also going to be
a two liter 250 horsepower engine the
basic engine option will be a 1.5 liter
turbocharged engine those looking for a
little more power can step up to a
2-liter turbocharged engine with 250
horsepower but the real talking point is
the new hybrid model this uses volt
power train to give you a 1.8 liter
motor up to 45 miles per gallon combined
that's Prius level mileage the car that
is a lot bigger than a Prius on the
inside we've got some new technology
some new driver aids adaptive cruise
control lane departure that sort of
thing there's also a new team driver
mode that will send reports to mom and
dad about how fast teams have been
driving how far they've been driving
they'll even give them a report of how
many times they wandered out of their
lane which is a little bit scary Chevy
isn't saying exactly how much the new
mal was going to cost but expected to
start swimming too low to mid-20s I'll
be in dealerships before the end of 2015
I'm Tim Stevens and this is the new york
international auto show taking a look at
the 2016 chevy malibu
