the Apple buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple and I
promise you there will be no Miley Cyrus
twerking on the show I know I'm sorry
guys but we'll announce our monster DNA
headphones winners so let's get to the
news and we're just two weeks out from
the rumored September 10th Apple event
Bloomberg now claims that the expected i
phone event will include the
introduction of new iPads as well now we
talked about it last week and I'm hoping
it happens because that would leave
October open for a possible new product
announcement watch o airs really dry in
here but honestly do they really need an
entire separate event for a refreshed
iPad line that won't be a major update
especially with Samsung expected to
announce the rumored Galaxy gear
SmartWatch at the ephah Consumer
Electronics Show on September the 4th
now Apple they just need to come out
with something and I get it Tim Cook has
shown he knows how to run a company with
mature products like the iPhone and iPad
but can he successfully deliver a whole
new product category because that's what
Apple is all about the 2013 has been a
real snoozer so far now the flood of
iPhone rumors and stories isn't stopping
anytime soon is pretty much a given that
we'll see a gold iPhone but sunny
Dixon's blog recently posted pictures of
the alleged graphite iPhone 5s giving us
possibly four colors for the next phone
then repair shop mend my eye not my I
posted a comparison photo showing off
volume and power buttons in four colors
including the gold champagne and
graphite colors for the 5s now you know
it's never a good thing when different
iPhone colors and a cheaper phone are
being talked about more than actual
features on a phone and since we're
talking about the cheaper iPhone 5c if
you don't think it's real this picture
from microblogging site sina weibo shows
dozens of iPhone 5cs being put through a
testing process and according to
Engadget the photo was taken at a
Pegatron plant in shanghai by a woman
who recently joined Pegatron Quality
Control Department
and if any of you really want to see and
feel what an iPhone 5c might be like all
you have to do is just go to ebay you'll
be able to find a prototype 5c enclosure
in multiple colors and it's just like
the real thing all right thank goodness
one feature that's getting talked about
is the rumored a7 processor chip inside
the 5s now there been claims that the
iPhone 5s will be roughly 31% faster
than the current a6 and there will be
separate chip devoted to motion tracking
for gestures like the galaxy s4 has 9 to
5 max says they've heard that the big a
has been internally testing 64-bit
prototypes of the a7 chip for smoother
animations transparencies and other
visual effects in iOS 7 but it's not
clear if we'll see any of these features
now while we wait for applet come out
with a brand new product it looks like
they've added a little extra start to
Siri so when you ask her ok glass that's
the verbal prompt when you use Google
glass Siri responds with something like
this or this Oh snaps oh my gosh now
that's been the Apple way of the past
but come on it looks a little desperate
when you're mocking a company who's
innovating more than you currently are
and that's a bad apple so don't hate
innovate all right on to the quick bite
so the Cupertino kids have added new
Apple TV apps including the VEVO music
video channel The Weather Channel
Smithsonian Channel and to Disney TV
apps Disney Channel and Disney XD yay a
new Apple job posting spotted by 9 to 5
max shows that the company is looking
for a new senior materials engineer to
its iPhone and iPad materials team to
create new plastic parts so who else
here can't wait for the iPad 5c and have
you seen this at your local movie
theater
it's a MacPro teaser trailer being shown
in theaters with a fall 2013
announcement and honestly would you
rather watch this
or this
does it get better just focusing on the
kids today with you this feels like the
first time I've looked up now I like the
Mac Pro but uh I'd actually like to find
out more about the other movie hold on
make note to self
hashtag safe-haven all right
let's announce our winners for the
monster DNA headphones giveaway I asked
you to send me a video of you doing a
crazy dance and so many of you came
through like look at this a lot of you
really embarrass yourself for us now I
can only pick two winners so congrats go
to Chris Price who is getting down with
the homies all right and the weirdest
one by far goes to Chancellor Perez who
really committed and stick around to the
end of the show and you'll see what I
mean but congrats to both of you we'll
be in touch and Monster is still doing a
killer deal until August 31st to get 60
