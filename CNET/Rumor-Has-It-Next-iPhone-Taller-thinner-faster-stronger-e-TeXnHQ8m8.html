Dreyfuss and welcome to rumor has it
this week rumors abound about a new nook
iphone of course and windows 8 and we'll
vote on which of those sounds legit and
which one is a pipe dream the best part
is that you guys can vote to our first
rumor is that Barnes &amp;amp; Noble is prepping
a 7-inch tablet with a revolutionary
screen according to trusted sources
speaking to our very own tablet editor
David Carly so this next-gen nook would
be barnes and nobles way of competing
with the Nexus 7 and the kindle fire
which the nook tablet really failed at
exactly when a little jab at Apple in
there all other revolutionary screen the
source tells seen it that the screen
technology was developed in-house by
Barnes and Noble and that we haven't
seen in any product ever before we've
been predicting that barnes and noble
would release a new tablet he'll
everybody has it's like they have to
exactly and i think that we both agree
that there's a new tablet coming but i
don't think it's going to be
revolutionary I think the nukes are
already great for reading books but they
need to be great for watching media as
well if they want to compete and in
order to do that the screen needs to be
crisper and higher res I think that's
all this will be C i disagree i think
barnes &amp;amp; noble has shown innovation in
the past with the new color screen and
they could have something really
different up their sleeve hey if it'll
be 3d or oulad PR right if you're
watching on Cena you can vote along to
using the thumbs up thumbs down right
next to my head in the interactive
player you have the next 30 seconds to
vote in the meantime we went to the
streets of San Francisco to ask people
what they thought
so there is a new rumor going around
that Barnes &amp;amp; Noble is coming out with a
new tablet and that the screen is going
to be revolutionary so what do you guys
think a revolutionary screen man's or
maybe one that won't crack is easy just
something that you can probably also
read in the sunlight be easy to read in
the sunlight with less reflection maybe
it has touch you could feel something it
would have it would have it would be a
responsive tablet that would give you
haptic feedback 3d I guess an easy our
keyboard to use or something like that
like one on the touchscreen perhaps it
can compared with with cinema with a 3d
cinema so looks like 3d seems to be a
popular answer I don't know about that
let's go inside and see some more rumors
our necks rumor is about Fancy Pants
windows 8 Microsoft is going to do away
with the full retail version of the OS
and will instead only sell upgrade
licenses at a promotional price of 40
bucks this is actually really cool it
basically means that Microsoft doesn't
want to price couch anymore they figure
that if you want windows 8 it means
you're either upgrading or you've built
your own pc and either way you shouldn't
have to pay with your firstborn child or
250 bucks right why is it so expensive
sorry to bring this up to all you Apple
haters out there but OSX upgrades are
usually only thirty dollars way to join
the rest of universe Microsoft okay we
want to catch up on iphone rumors real
fast there have been a ton as we're
speaking more probably piling up behind
us first supposedly screen prototypes
leak showing a longer taller iphone
screen case then the japanese blog
Macotakara believes that the iphone is
already in production sources third any
who need sources then the wall street
journal with no sources chimes in
insisting that the next phone will
actually be even thinner do we believe
any of that who knows another person
says it won't even be called the iphone
wait what listen all's fair and iphone
rumor land okay so let's get back to the
barnes and noble room on the scenic
council is composed of five Cena experts
who cast their votes anonymously
opinions org estimates expressed by the
cnet council are not an endorsement by
cnet or CBS interactive obviously
because these are rumors folks so we
asked them will
screen in the rumored new Barnes &amp;amp; Noble
tablet be revolutionary and the cnet
verdict is nay it was four to one that
the term revolutionary is too broad and
too sweeping and no great our comment of
the week last week goes to fly guy 29
who writes regarding the possibility of
an Amazon phone it would do well if it
was one subsidized to the point of free
and no contract to six months of free
media 35 hundred and ninety-nine dollars
in free amazon credit to make you feel
better about using a shopping cart as a
phone instead of a real phone from
samsung HTC or motorola five hundred
ninety-nine dollars in free amazon
credits that's pretty specific and he
probably never going to happen but we
would take a free phone from amazon sure
yeah that's our show everybody share
your rumors that rumor has it at cnet
com or call us at 1 800 750 Cena and
tune in next week for more tech rumors
