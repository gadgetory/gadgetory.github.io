offices in london with the tablet z
let's take a look the first thing that
sony is very proud of is that the
interface is the same as the one on its
flagship phone the Xperia said with a
lot more screen real estate sewing
doesn't offer a standard Android
experience that adds a bunch of extra
apps for music photography video and
more if you just want to pick up the
tablet and use it with your Sony gear
that's a good thing but the downside is
that you'll have to wait longer to get
the latest Android software updates if
that doesn't matter to you though Sony's
software looks pretty useful the Walkman
app contains a bunch of EQ settings that
lets you tweak the sound that comes out
of the four speakers until your heart's
content there's a simple clear audio
setting that punches everything up
automatically or you can override it
with some faders until you're happy with
the sound you're getting in the battery
settings switching on the stamina mode
turns various functions of the tablet
off so you can eke out the battery for
longer sony says up to four times longer
if there's an app you want to continue
to function as normal say one that
automatically notifies you when
something new has happened you can just
add it to a list sony says it's been
working with its camera division to
bring some of its technology over to the
tablet z and that includes the camera
menus there are very short cuts to
things like burst mode picture effects
panoramas and more plus when you look at
the pictures with Sony's app there's a
cool effect when you zoom in and out of
them a universal remote app works with
the built-in IR blaster to control TV's
blu-ray players and other home
entertainment boxes sony has a large
database of products already loaded onto
the tablet so you should be able to
select the manufacturer and model of
your product from a list and everything
will just work but if you're TV isn't
there you can add it manually finally
there's TV sideview an app that displays
an EPG of what's coming up on the TV
channels you receive it also lets you
control the apps on certain Smart TVs
and search across different sources for
a program including YouTube and Sony's
own content network so that Sony's
tablet said it's out in May i'm jason
jenkins vecina see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
