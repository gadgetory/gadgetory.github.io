that buried beneath these slopes is a
complex web of pipes right where we're
standing there's pipes all over all over
the mountain all over the mountain
holiday like most major ski resorts
North Star California in Lake Tahoe can
keep trails open even during a drought
with sophisticated snowmaking equipment
the life of a machine-made snowflake
begins where all those pipes originated
at the base of the mountain there's
these big air compressors and they
compress air and that air is transferred
up the mountain in these pipelines and
there's also water pumps hoses
transporting the water and compressed
air are hooked up to different types of
snow guns here's a stick gun and this is
a fan gun it uses a big fan on the back
and in front of the gun at the nozzles
there's a bunch of water nozzles in the
front okay so the fan just forces air
out water interjects into the air stream
and it just falls to the ground of snow
it's equipment like this that's
transformed to Sochi a subtropical city
same stuff in the Olympics that they use
we're using here at North Star and
they're using other tricks in Russia
they like it a little firmer because
it's faster there in the speed so they
do two things they water the course at
night and let that freeze on top of
natural snow or man-made snow and they
mate you know if it warms up during the
day they may add a little salt to it
makes it set up during the day so it's a
little bit firmer chilly temperatures
definitely help the colder it is the
more efficient snow guns become North
Star typically fires up 125 guns nightly
but they're only turned on when the
mercury drops below a certain
temperature how much snow can this stick
gun generate this is about 14 to 75
gallons per minute and it runs 24 hours
a day when it's cold and so it it will
cover this area right here in three or
four days you could ski this area when
you put a snowcat on and groom it out
over the past 10 years snowmaking has
become highly automated to the point
that the snow guns on the mountain can
be controlled with an iPhone app you
start compressors and you start water
pumps and actually you can adjust these
guns whether your iPhone
which is really pretty cool an antenna
enables communication with the guns
which have built-in intelligence to it's
got a computer on board it monitors the
outside temperature relative humidity
calculates wet bulb turns the water up
makes more snow when it gets cold turns
itself down when it warms up and if it
really gets warm turns itself off as you
might imagine this is an expensive way
to keep lifts running it does cost money
to run snowmaking because you have the
power bill you have all this machinery
and labor but it's like an insurance
policy if Mother Nature doesn't kick in
this winter it's not just California ski
resorts that are depending on snow
making technology it's also athletes
going for the gold in sochi in Lake
