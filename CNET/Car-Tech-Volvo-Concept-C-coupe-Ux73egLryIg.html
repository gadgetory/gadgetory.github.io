Volvo made a sports car it was held at P
1800 but since then the company has
become known for SUVs wagons and some
pretty stylish sedans but now here at
the Frankfurt Auto Show we see the
concept coupe this is a really sharp
looking new coupe sports car rear-wheel
drive and it's actually got a hybrid
powertrain drives the rear wheels with
400 horsepower
that's sad electric motor combined with
a 2-liter engine that few liter engine
actually has a turbocharger and a
supercharger in the cabin we've got a
portrait style touchscreen LCD on the
centre console that's very much like the
Tesla Model S and Volvo says that's kind
of the direction they're going with our
infotainment systems that's of a head-up
display to give the driver information
about vehicle speed and turn-by-turn
navigation and stuff like that now this
is a really good-looking car really nice
design
unfortunately Volvo says it is only a
concept they brought it here to show off
what they can do with their new vehicle
architectures this is actually built on
the same platform as with anyway XC 30
as you can see there are a lot of very
concept the elements on this car the
headlights have these LEDs the interior
doesn't quite look like a production car
it's one of those things though that you
really wish they would put it into
production because a lot of people would
want this car but for now it's only a
concept</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
