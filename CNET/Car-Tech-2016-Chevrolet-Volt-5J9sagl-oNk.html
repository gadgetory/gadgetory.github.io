love the car or you don't get it at all
their owners are incredibly loyal and
behind me is the first redesign they're
going to have to digest this is the gen
2 Chevy Volt first thing you'll notice
is a very different look
generation 1 certainly didn't sell on
looks this one might this is a nice
looking car now a few important
differences the all-electric range has
gone from about 38 miles to now a rating
of 50 of course the vehicle runs in
various blended mode it is a range
extender with a gas engine and electric
motor what's happening here is trying to
play more to the strengths of what the
Volt does for its passionate owners GM
depending which press release you read
says that their owners drive either 63
or 80% of their miles in the Volt's in
pure evey mode so they want to see more
electric prowess they're also saying
you're gonna get more of a drivers feel
from this car this time less of
utilitarian field and notably it now
seats three across the back row they're
four or five in the whole car last time
only seated two in the back because the
battery hum kind of stuck up in a bad
way
both sales weren't a thing of beauty
last year they came down to about 19,000
from 23,000 a year before
in contrast a Nissan Leaf sold many more
and is trending up so they've got some
work to do this generation 2 car could
go a long way toward accomplishing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
