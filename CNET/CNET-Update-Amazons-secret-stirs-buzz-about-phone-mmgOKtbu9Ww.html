a secret I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update amazon has a secret
project and it's got people wondering if
it's an Amazon phone that's because a
former manager for Windows Phones is now
working at Amazon his name is Charlie
Kindel and he wrote some cryptic
descriptions on his LinkedIn page like
how he's working on a secret project and
it's something wonderful he also wrote
he's building a new team for a totally
new area for Amazon and he's hiring
cloud and mobile developers we've heard
rumors about Amazon tinkering with
phones for some time now and this seems
like another clue that it could be
happening not to mention how poetic
would it be that the company behind the
Kindle hired someone named Kindle to
make a new Kindle device some exciting
news in the world of syncing your files
Amazon Cloud Drive updated so now when
you upload a file you can access it off
other devices when signing into a drive
account that means it's more like Google
Drive or Dropbox and speaking to Dropbox
yahoo mail users can now access dropbox
accounts from the email inbox that means
you can attach a file from dropbox to a
message or save attachments into dropbox
look at yahoo getting all sappy for
those looking for a new top-notch
android phone a teensy and sprint
announced the HTC One will be available
in stores on April nineteenth starting
at two hundred dollars with a two-year
contract but eager fans can pre-order on
Thursday at AT&amp;amp;T and on Friday at Sprint
t-mobile will also be selling this all
aluminum-bodied phone and not to mention
the HTC One is 50 bucks cheaper than the
new Samsung Galaxy s4 so that might
influence some shoppers to go with HTC /
samsung AT&amp;amp;T said it plans to offer HD
voice this year HD voice enhances call
clarity and reduces background noise
verizon doesn't have it yet t-mobile
said its iPhone 5 will support HD Voice
keep your eye on a couple apps today for
starters the town video a messaging app
upgraded to let users start and stop a
recording several times toute lets users
send a 15-second video
and you can think of it like a Twitter
for video tot is used by celebrities and
television shows to reach out to fans
the start and stop feature is similar to
the vine app but these videos don't loop
if you want to try out tap you can find
me there at Bridget Carey and you can
message me your video creations playboy
just release an app on iTunes that has
no nudity that's because apples content
standards don't approve of nudity
finally an app for people who subscribe
to playboy for the articles that's your
tech news update you can find more
