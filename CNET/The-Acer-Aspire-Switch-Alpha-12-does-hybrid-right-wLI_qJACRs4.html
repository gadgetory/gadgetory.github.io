competitors the Acer Aspire switch alpha
12 really can be used equally
comfortably as a laptop and a tablet
that's because it packs impressive specs
for less than $800 although unlike some
competitors it doesn't have an OLED
display still I think it'll be fine for
most needs and the display did survive
an accidental fall off a table at
Starbucks
despite the core i5 processor in my test
configuration the switch out for twelves
fanless liquid cooling system keeps it
silent and while it does get a little
warm perched against my legs it's not
bad it does stay cool streaming netflix
all night as a laptop it's quite well
designed with a kickstand that lets you
tilt it at almost any angle and a
bundled magnetically attached keyboard
cover with island-style keys the keys
have good travel and it's comfortable
for typing for long periods the touchpad
isn't too sensitive and doesn't get in
your way the laptops roughly
letter-sized in weighs just under three
pounds so traveling with it won't break
your back as a tablet it weighs about
two pounds but it doesn't support USB
charging so you may have to select the
AC adapter if you need more than five
and a half hours of battery life which
adds another 11 ounces to your burden it
can't compare with something like the
Microsoft Surface pro 4 for creative
work the active stylus is okay for
note-taking but the system only sports
256 levels of pressure sensitivity but
it's a great alternative if you're on a
budget
