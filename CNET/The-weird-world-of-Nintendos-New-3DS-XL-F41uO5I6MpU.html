Scott Stein hey and we want to talk a
little bit about the new Nintendo 3ds XL
we really do this kind of stuff but it
came to our attention after we just
received this new system it's been out
in other territories for a couple months
only came to the US or it's coming to
the US February 13th there are some very
weird things going on with this system
and I brought Scott here to help us talk
about just why it's so weird let's talk
about the biggest glaring thing right
away there are a couple of weird things
yeah the most glaring would be how do
you charge this how do you charge this
have you charged this ecosystem because
when you buy it out of the box
there's not one of these it didn't come
with a charger that's a charger it
doesn't have a charge they are very
useful you need one of those to charge
this system you get about what six hours
of play time five hours of submitter
it's not like you're gonna go a week
right out of the box a suddenly hours of
play time in there on your own so T soon
so we want to bring that up because
people should know and that is a pretty
massive omission it costs 110 dollars
dollars I don't understand why they
couldn't put this in the box there their
reasoning is that oh you probably
already own one of these I don't know
god if you have a Nintendo handheld
collection right you know you may be a
first-time owner and this is a $200
system or college system so no charge
you could throw in the charger very
strange the nice gesture just a little
word of warning if you're in the market
for one of these it doesn't go in the
charger you can get one on Amazon for
like four dollars up you get that's not
an official one you see an official one
for the Nintendo 410 yeah and then these
go back to like the DSi so the room ones
you can buy that go to USB which I find
grip for traveling so there are a lot of
them floating around out there but the
point is you're going to find one right
okay so that's issued one which is
shocking and upsetting on numerous elves
don't get me wrong we like this it's
it's a really solid system and the 3d
tracking is great I like the feel of the
buttons and you read that in the full
review and you can fine
now the details what we do like this
video is more of like what
head-scratching what do you mean okay so
this is the 3dsxl the original right
here and if you look on the side there's
a there's a nice little SD card slot
super easy to open up and save all your
games on that you can download games to
it great
there is not an SD card slot on the new
Nintendo 3ds XL there's only a micro SD
card and that micro SD card slot is only
accessible by on by unscrewing the back
of this thing okay now Scott tell us
what happened when you unscrew the back
of your new 3ds it's a fun little night
project the first time I tried to go get
myself a micro SD card for expanding
yeah a transfer everything over and B an
SD card adapter if you don't want to
spend hours with the wireless transfer
you set up with a computer then you
gotta unscrew this and and I opened in
it didn't really want to open all the
way it was sort of opening like a book
and I finally didn't tell me what to do
so I went and then the plastic tabs on
the front snap spin-offs on the front of
his case
I mean it's a tiny you don't really see
much of it there's more under on the
underside but a routine you need to do
this to swap out it's a very simple
micro SD card you could have a dad or
for that sure and you're going to have
to unscrew this screw it back on and
then you're not even getting to the
transfer process which is not as easy to
say like you know like the PS Vita even
allows multiple systems a few systems to
use that ID this you have to transfer
everything over right to the new system
so there is a trick and I'll try and
explain this really quick so what we're
complaining about is the fact that the
old format was an SD card the new format
is a micro SD card to get all of your
transferred stuff from one to the other
if this is something you want to do
there's a way to transfer all of your
regular sized SD card stuff to your
computer
from your computer install that onto a
micro SD card then you take the micro SD
card put it in a regular SD card adapter
hop it into the old 3ds and then
initiate the transfer process to your
new 3d XXL everyone got that and then it
will ask you to swap them towards the
end of the process it's so bad process
feels like minor brain surgery is to
pull that off it's kind of a hot mess in
that regard it's nice that it doesn't
use expensive cards like the Vita but
you know microSD are more expensive than
SD you're right if you get a lot of
storage
super easy to swap so that's basically
and finally there's one thing that we
were just talking about in terms of like
how this is just like a step a half step
up upgrade right what were you saying
yeah well it's like what is this really
it's nice that it's it's better made but
it looks so similar to the XL that it's
not like you're getting a smaller system
you're getting a little bit zippier
system sure you're getting extra buttons
so what's that is no buttons what's
going on so now I can only use these
buttons on games with the it's very
conclusive making games that are going
to use those buttons they claim a whole
new class of games might take advantage
its midway through this handheld cycle
it's not even it's doing well but it's
not like skyrocketing right and you also
have this getting this extra controller
nub
looks like came off a ThinkPad right
this is I think that's a hot nub it's a
thick pad nub instead of red it's gray
it's nice for camera controls but what's
going to use that the problem is not
even how well it works is what games are
going to say I'm gonna make a game just
for you new consoles it's strange but
that's why we love Nintendo they're
crazy they've been testing us 3d it
glasses-free 3d in the first place why
did they do that or the dual screens the
stylist lots of weird things in in Tendo
and there that's what they do a lot of
strange stuff read the full review we're
actually going back and sort of tweaking
it adding in a lot of the strangeness
that we found in the new 3ds XL scott
stein thank you so much for being there
helping us sort out all the oddness look
Nintendo we still love you stay weird
keep doing your thing and thanks for
