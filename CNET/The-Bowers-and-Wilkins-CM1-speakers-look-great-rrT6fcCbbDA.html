while and are looking to upgrade your
sound quality the best way to do that is
trade up to a good receiver and speakers
hi I'm Ty Pendlebury and to my mind one
of the most consistent speaker
manufacturers is British firm Bowers &amp;amp;
Wilkins who offer options from $300 all
the way up to 60,000 the Bowers &amp;amp;
Wilkins cm 1s to fit towards the more
affordable they're not cheap enter the
company's range at $1,100 appear these
figures are an upgrade on the original
CM ones and offer a number of
improvements including a new concentric
ring tweeter and a tweeter cover to
thwart those inquisitive fingers this
speaker features a five-inch Kevlar
driver and comes in this beautiful piano
black finish though Rose nut and white
are also available
these are ported in the rear and unlike
the original version are missing a wall
mount attachment while you can use these
with a receiver like our current
favorite the $500 Sony STR DN 1050 the
better your amplification the better aim
for between $800 and $1,000 if you can
if you're a founder bowels and welcomes
in sound quality which some detractors
might describe as dark or less excitable
in the mid-range then you will likely
enjoy the CM 1s 2s the tweeter does
liven things up as well as adding a
little more detail over speakers such as
the original B&amp;amp;W 685 but despite its
size it's still capable of decent bass
weight though with the wrong material
such as sibilant rock music the tweeters
can be overwhelming and adding a
subwoofer could help offset this by
filling in the missing low-end at this
price though there are plenty of other
options including monitor audio and PSB
though none are quite as pretty if you
want that same tweeter plus a larger
cabinet and a cheaper price the $700 B&amp;amp;W
685 s2 s should be pretty hard to beat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
