robot fans we're here at the Science
Museum in London to see the opening of
the robots exhibition we spoke to
curator Ben Russell the key robots I
wanted undetermined you know I thought
well actually what can i what can I get
hold of we had you know we had to go out
and rely on boring and new acquisitions
and that sort of thing we thought we'd
come straight on the humanoid robots we
realized early on that it's the
humanoids are most fascinating because
they're so much like us so I thought
let's go for those guys we have a lot of
robots that come in and loan to us from
around the world from Japan from America
from other museums in the UK so for
example with the Bose Museum a very
kindly let's their silver swarm which is
the most astonishing automata but with
1773 when you start doing exhibition you
always have a sort of you√≠ve sort of go
who's got what things and how likely are
they to give them to us I knew about the
swamp is the most remarkable machine
with it Wow and I thought they'll never
lend that to us and the museum Toyota
said no if don't not don't get so we
thought we have a try and amazingly they
said yes and amazingly actually a
gratifyingly high number of the people
out there with robots said yes when we
ask them so it's a really it's a really
unique collection of objects actually um
but I'm really pleased with how it's
worked out we sort of softly dodged the
IOA question because a I can be a voice
or abstract and intangible thing and we
threw up said well yeah when you book
railway tickets or your flight to your
holidays that's that's basically AI and
its software and what's more interesting
from our point of view is is embodied
intelligence so intelligence is okay but
it's got to be in a vessel and actually
what is that form actually research
tends to be humanoid form but how does
that affect the shaping of the
intelligence within it now I think
that's that that's really where we are
in a way where we were sort of sort of
small relatively small niche in the
whole realm of robotics but but I think
that's where the real challenges are is
great but as soon as you get it into in
a body and make it walk down some stairs
it's not gonna work we said a robot is
our mobile definition is a robot that is
a machine that looks like
like what behaves in a LifeFlight way
and we didn't want to sort of stick up
to the usual sort of sci-fi tropes of
robots the enemy enslave us all and
destroy the world but but have robots
which are a bit more thought provoking
than that and of course the interaction
is one as much to think oh and if I mean
the interaction itself is amazing but if
that interesting could then talk spark a
bit of interest people go away and think
you know through what's the coming
they're going to escape from the lab how
does that work then I think we've done
our job see well hopefully here is a
lock and a shield kid
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
