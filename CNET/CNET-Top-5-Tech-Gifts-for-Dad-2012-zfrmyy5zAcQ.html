gifting you know dads they tend to buy
themselves toys all the time so they've
got everything but I've got a great
surefire a list coming up that as long
as your dad isn't that dumb ass in the
AT&amp;amp;T Wireless commercial you know the
one who can't figure out how the cables
invisible is gonna make him obsessively
delighted and he's gonna play with his
new gift the whole time you're at brunch
good times let's go number five is the
Amazon Kindle the one that came out in
2011 the basic Kindle bells and whistles
aren't the point with an e-book reader
and this one understands that it's
compact light has endless battery life
and that great read anywhere screen
that's what matters plus it accesses
amazon's massive and easy-to-use
bookstore there's no touchscreen 79
bucks hello dad will have to be on Wi-Fi
to download books and there are a few
ads but they're unobtrusive so unless
dad's illiterate you can't go wrong here
and even if he is you could always
upload PDF cartoons to it number 4 kind
of the same street different address the
asuste transformer prime a full-blown
tablet not just a reader and one that we
love for being thin light high def &amp;amp; 8
megapixel it's like giving them a
handful of gifts in one you can probably
skip that keyboard dock thing that turns
it into a kind of wimpy laptop doing
that will keep you right at the five
hundred dollar price point for one of
the best iPad challengers number three
staying mobile here the HP folio 13 it's
one of those ultrabook laptops that
means it's really light really thin not
quite like a macbook air which is almost
trendy has great battery life almost as
good as a tablet but it's a full bore
laptop with a great keyboard of course
and plenty of power and storage 899 list
that brings in a hundred dollars below
the cheapest macbook air and that would
still need windows installed at extra
cost if that's dad's OS number two is a
great TV if you got the scratch get of a
panasonic tc-p st50 even the jaded cnet
TV reviewers think it's got a great
picture and thanks to being plasma
you'll get that great picture
anywhere you sit in the room like if
he's right in front of it watching golf
and you're over there in the side chair
passed out board it is a 3d set but
nobody cares about that so it's okay
that it doesn't include 3d glasses you
can get this 50 inch TV for about 1,500
bucks nice price number one is the
motorola droid razr maxx yep a killer
smartphone there's a pretty good chance
your dad doesn't have a smartphone yet
does he this one would catapult him
right out of the 19th century it's got
an alluring combination of superfast 4G
data and crazy battery life hence the
max name along with all the other
features of today's android super phones
on the downside it's only available on
verizon and kind of a problem if dad has
small hands commiserate with mom on that
one like most top follows its 200 bucks
with a contract now if these don't do it
check out the whole cnet guide for
Father's Day at dads cnet com I'm Brian
