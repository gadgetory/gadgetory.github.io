think you might be the expert in how to
approach alien contact so when aliens do
reach out to us what's your advice for
the sitting president talked in touch
shoot first um I think it's a I always
liked hope that we have one day alien
contact because people always like asked
me do I believe in alien I don't believe
in them I hope that they are existing
the only mean it's just a big difference
in a way and you hope that we'll talk
and I hope it will talk and I hope they
will not mind to die for trading badly
and otherwise I have to fight
a lot has change in technology for
special thank you talk a little bit
about compare contrast approaching the
special effects with first film versus
today well in the first film you know
already when I was writing it I had like
scissors in my head because I knew what
you can do and what you cannot do so I
knew that everything had to be done
armed with models we had to do motion
control photography and this time around
you know that you don't even have
scissors in your head anymore you
actually don't want to have scissors in
your head because everything is possible
they like to get the landmarks with the
absurd of VR it's blurring some of the
lines between what is a video what is a
video game what is a film do you have
any personal plans for your first
implementation of VR I'm still thinking
about it I'm if I would do something I
would love to do something in the room
of of science fiction because whatever
it is you know it's easier to create you
know vrf I mean it all digital and
because all digital can be photo real
you know it it's that's probably the
field I would kind of do my first VR
experience or film</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
