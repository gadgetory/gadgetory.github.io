Alfred dang Firefox is the latest
browser to introduce a way for users to
block autoplay videos online those are
those annoying videos that start playing
once you land on a web page and yes CNN
is guilty of the practice two good news
is browsers are getting more assertive
on behalf of their users to make the web
a little less of a pain Google a MP or
amp pages which reduced the number of
ads on a page so they can load faster is
another example so Alfred what are you
what are your thoughts on this I mean
it's I feel like this is way overdue but
I'm glad that there's more browsers like
making this change obviously Safari had
done this before as well as Chrome and
you know Firefox is the latest to join
them and I understand why a website
wouldn't want this in the sense of you
know that's how we get or add revenue
but at the same time you know it comes
at the cost of the you know going on a
website and being completely frustrated
by it so I think it's a welcome change
and I would make the point that I'd like
probably 99% of the internet agrees with
me on that what I don't think anybody
ever goes on a web site is like yes this
video played on its own that's exactly
what I wanted yeah there's there's one
website that's not seen at that would
actually put its video player at the
very end of an article and so it would
start playing audio and I guess enroll
actually yeah I couldn't actually find
where the video is so there are
obviously like some of these tactics can
get really annoying for consumers and
sometimes I would just mute my laptop
because there are so many different auto
plays but it is an interesting balancing
act that goes on where there's so much
more free content online these days and
people don't really want to pay for it
but at the same time a lot of publishers
try to figure out different ways to get
people to pay I guess through annoyance
I suppose that's a terrible business
model yeah I don't know I don't know
what to tell you
next up starting Tuesday Google's Chrome
browser so that's starting today
Google's Chrome browser will start
showing you a quote not secure message
when you're on a website that still uses
HT
TP instead of HTTP so Alfred why don't
you talk us through what the difference
is between those two yeah so HTTP is
basically an encrypted version of HTTP
and that's basically the way that you
get you know onto a website or anything
like that that's the start of all URLs
and what that basically means is that if
you were using an HTTP website somebody
who's on the same Wi-Fi as you or like
snooping on your Wi-Fi network won't be
able to basically see your passwords or
like what website you're going on or
anything like that because it'd be all
encrypted and a lot of hackers like do
rely on people going to HTTP websites
because in that way they can like gather
all this information on people like very
easily and it's much harder on HTTPS
what Google is doing with chrome in this
sense is that it used to always just
show secure that if you went on an HTTPS
website but now what they're doing
instead is like calling out like bad
behavior as opposed to like oh this is a
secure website now what they're doing is
if you're go on a website without it
it'll say not secure at the beach at the
top and then it'll also do like a little
like pop-up box log that's basically hey
the website you're visiting is not
secure so don't enter your password or
any sensitive data or anything like that
if while you're on here right so it's a
little bit more assertive from Google to
try to encourage more sites to go to
HTTPS offhand and I know I'm kind of
quizzing you here do you have any idea
how many sites have switched over to
HTTPS I would say I believe the last
time I checked 75% of the Internet is on
HTTPS already um so a good chunk of the
internet is on HTTPS I think when I was
doing a story on this and I wanted to
purposely find an HTTP web site I had a
really hard time doing that so yeah I
mean it's one of those things that that
yeah we have another topic to go to we
don't have enough time so last our own
Derek Kerr wrote about Airbnb effort to
stop New York City from passing a new
bill against it
the Big Apple argues that Airbnb rentals
are taking rental units off the market
and driving up housing costs Airbnb say
is it helps everyday New Yorkers make
ends meet it's unclear really if Airbnb
--zz Boulder tactics are gonna work or
if they are working but I don't know
it's really weird
Airbnb strategy
you know characterize New York City
Councilmembers as like oh there in the
pocket of big hotel or anything like
that but if they were you that would be
pretty easy to find like these are like
financial donations that are probably
public and for them to go with all these
accusations which if it were true I
would say yeah that makes sense and but
the thing is this is pretty simple to
find and I haven't seen a shred of
evidence about it so no I don't know
anyway if you want to read more about
these stories check us out on CNN and
thanks everybody for listening
I love the essentials all right thanks
everybody for joining us for the
recording of the audio podcast welcome
to the newbies in the chat at this point
we're going to take your questions and
comments comments about the the show
topics at hand because I can't talk
today apparently so if anything having
to do with Airbnb HTTP autoplay video
we're experts in that I personally want
to low a little bit more since the the
last story in our in our show always
gets cut so short just for ya I'm sorry
so Airbnb is a little more well these
are all really applicable stories to the
general consumer public today but I want
to know a little bit more about Airbnb
because I had my first experience with
that few few weeks ago it was a good
experience and being here in New York
I'm not gonna use it in New York for a
lot of obvious reasons but if I was to
ever have guests come I'm kind of
curious how does this really affect
somebody getting a rental in Oak Brook
City I can I can start this one off so
basically New York City already passed a
law that had stipulated that you're not
allowed to have somebody in a short-term
rental in your place for less than 30
days unless you're living there yeah
unless you're staying there so I guess
that if somebody's crashing on your
couch and paying for your rent for five
days and you're there that's totally
kosher that's fine but otherwise the
intention was to restrict Airbnb
significantly from that law the problem
was is that the level of enforcement
wasn't really there and so Airbnb sorry
New York City Council passed a new law
unanimously that stipulated the Airbnb
needed to provide a bunch of information
for New York City to actually go after
folks that were doing rentals so that
that was expected to substantially harm
B&amp;amp;Bs business in New York City which
yeah believe I wrote this is their
biggest domestic market just for some
additional contacts here though it's not
like these city council members are
basically going out of their way to
screw over Airbnb in New York the logic
behind all this regulation for New York
City is essentially that there is like a
severe lack of housing and rising rent
in New York City and the idea is that a
part of that reason is because landlords
instead of like renting out like these
avail
homes that they have there like keeping
them open for Airbnb host what they're
hosting it yeah those things yeah yeah
and so instead of like you know actually
providing a home for at a low price for
somebody that could actually afford it
they would keep that and then jack up
the prices for the constant flow of
tourists that are actually coming in
thus jacking up the rent costs here and
also contributing to the like homeless
epidemic in the city right and that's
primarily a reason why a lot of other
major tourist destinations have also
gone after Airbnb because of their
concerns that people instead of going to
you know hotels are utilizing Airbnb I
mean I use Airbnb plenty of times when I
travel but the other list of locations
that have had problems with Airbnb
include San Francisco LA Amsterdam Paris
Berlin
I think Barcelona is on that list too so
it's it's so it's a lot of places that
there there is substantial demand for
tourists and somebody that has a housing
unit might be able to get significantly
more money for themselves yeah just
think about like if you're if you're a
landlord like you would much rather you
know rent it out like on a weekly basis
where you don't have to deal with like
oh I need to fix a sink or something
like that or like bad tenants that like
just decide to stay there for a long
time or anything like that like it's
much more favorable for a landlord like
they make more money from it they have
less responsibilities but at the same
time like it like drastically affects
like the housing market yeah yeah yeah I
mean I again I use it personally and I
actually prefer to a lot of hotels
because I don't like staying at a lot of
hotels unless they're like boutique II
yeah which I don't have the money for so
it's it's a useful service for people
but I I also I guess I understand both
sides of the argument from the consumer
situation and also really I really
enjoyed so along with the Airbnb
argument of you know oh these these New
York City Council members are in the
pocket of big hotel there are other
arguments has been you know they're
hurting the the little guy like you know
they're not like these major hotel
corporations they're just landlords in
New York City that like on million
dollar homes so that's the other that
like I don't think
really the little guy as much as you
know Airbnb likes to make them out to be
so an interesting point that you make
about that so this is from a New York
Times story a report from the school of
urban planning at Merck at McGill
University this was a study by the way
commissioned by hotel by the hotel
workers union so if you want to throw
out the rest of the information that I'm
gonna tell you from that then fine go
ahead but either way it found that
nearly half of New York City rental
revenue on Airbnb was earned by 10% of
the hosts in the city so there are
obviously a lot of little guys but most
of the money flows to that top 10% yeah
to me makes a lot of sense wait I
thought that was agreeing with my
argument how does that undercut it no I
wasn't understanding it at all I just
you know I I totally had that ready to
go I thought that was an interesting
study that's why Ben is my true friend
that never disagrees with me rich Nieva
is my best friend by the way so I'd like
to do a shout out to rich Nieva right
now and say I hope you're watching ok
let's talk a little bit more about HTTP
I saw in the article down below we
didn't quite reach it yet that there's
this interesting graph of percentage of
wet pages loaded by Firefox using HTTPS
on put up on the screen now and the
title of that says why haven't we been
using HTTPS all along Alfred why not
because it wasn't developed yeah HTTP is
been around for like 25 years or so it
takes a long time for these things to
develop yeah but and also the idea is
that like so switching to HTTPS is also
kind of a process it's become much
easier recently and I actually have to
change that from my personal website I
don't even think I should have a
personal website anymore to be honest
but yeah like it's this whole process
like if you have assets on your webpage
that like are not compatible of HTTPS
it's kind of like you have to redo your
whole website in some scenarios is it
fair to say that that is incentive for
people to not want to get on board with
the HTTPS train it's more just kind of a
pain in the ass to deal with yeah but
like I said it's becoming much easier to
do it recently like there's a website
called like let's encrypt that like
helps you do that and they
I have you know they issue like more
than like 600,000 like HTTP certificates
like everyday if you have your website
hosted on github which I do then they
also allow you to do that but I remember
when I tried doing it a few weeks ago
there were like all these assets on my
website that were not HTTPS compatible
and I forgot like most of what I like
how i coded my website so I like needed
to go back and like redo the whole thing
so your website by the way is it in
e-commerce site for selling alfred baba
Smet it's Super Smash Brothers throw
pillows no if I if I had a supply of
Super Smash Brothers throw pillows I
just keep them all why would I sell that
you're like sewing them yourself no no
your website was just that go fund me
that you made oh yeah yeah that's right
send Alfred to the moon no I don't want
that money you're gonna kneel on musk
anymore but yeah it's become much easier
to do it and that's why I like there's
been such a steady adoption but like
obviously Google is still trying to make
that a hundred percent of websites that
are visited because there are a lot of
vulnerabilities that can happen there
was a report about it back in March that
you know there was this popular website
that people were going on - you know
download like software and things like
that
keep going
and it wasn't H it was HTTP and not HTTP
and the I believe it was this it was
I forgot what God might have been the
Turkish government but they had taken
advantage of this and used a
man-in-the-middle attack so that when
people in that like country were trying
to access the website to download
software they got spying software on the
computer and said that the like Turkish
government used to spy on them yikes
and it is still not HTTP man so don't
download stuff from this website so yeah
and cheese that's that's a pretty stark
example yeah gonna happen if you go to
an HTTP website versus HD yeah the other
thing was so I learned a lot more about
this when I was at Def Con last year
where I they have a package sniffing
village there which sounds really weird
it's not dry
but like it's like you know packets at
your computer sends online back and
forth and the idea was I wanted to
purposely like see what they could see
if I went like on the public Wi-Fi
network but the thing was like every
website that I was going on was HTTPS so
it was like they couldn't really see
that much that's why I brought up on the
podcast it was like I was purposely
trying to find a website that like they
could see my stuff on but it's become
much harder for them so does does does
HTTPS make it okay to go on public Wi-Fi
is like if you're in a food court or it
makes it it makes it easier yeah it
definitely like there's still stuff
people could do from like public Wi-Fi
like if you're both on the same Wi-Fi
network but it makes it harder for them
to like see what you're seeing and like
what you're typing in and Sunday nice on
a related note a question from Ranjha
Corp have extensions like HTTPS
Everywhere become obsolete at this point
they're not becoming obsolete but like
this basically kind of does what HTTPS
Everywhere already does where like it
warns you like if something is like not
secure tell me what a HTTP T sorry HTTPS
Everywhere so this was an extension that
was put out by the elec I always get
this wrong when I when I think of it but
Electric Frontier Foundation yes I just
think AFF but like but yeah basically
what it did was it would when I got look
at this let's just take a three minute
break and let it Alfred read that breed
I literally wrote about this like two
months ago it's a Chrome extension I've
got it open to Chrome extension that it
makes your browser more secure I would
imagine or like you know the sites that
you're visiting even if they're HTTP
well yeah I don't think it changes a to
an HTTP web site though is the thing
like I think on my point it yeah all
right live TV right here I hate all of
you for Chrome it is for Firefox it's
also for opera mm-hmm
yeah and the core basics of it is it's
just meant to re-secure the website
right so it's like a new house
oh okay I get it now okay so some
websites have both like HTTP and H
TPS versions because like while they're
making the transition over but like
it'll automatically go back to the
unencrypted version because it's like
like I've been on like an HTTP website
where like images don't load or
something like that and they want the
image to load so if it doesn't it'll
automatically go back to it what HTTPS
Everywhere does is like it'll send it
back to the HTTPS version even in the
website like request for that so in a
way it's not obsolete but like because
it'll still send you back to like a
secure version of the page but I mean
like as more and more web sites become
have HTTPS it'll probably like go out of
the way soon mmm nice I did it good job
dude so being route really uneducated in
the topic I wanted to ask is this the
kind of thing where eventually as most
things in the modern techie world is
going to become obsolete well HTTPS be
superseded as they're already any kind
of development rumblings in that realm
HTTP s I don't know ah HTTP um less I
think for that to happen there'd have to
be a vulnerability like associated with
HTTPS currently we're but like it's
become like a pretty good standard for
now but you know it's hard to predict as
you know security is always evolving and
there's always like new vulnerabilities
out there but for now I'd say it's a
pretty good standard I don't know it
could be some stupid blockchain things
that'll pop up that was like this is the
most secure thing now so oh my god that
already exists I'm sure of it yeah so
blockchain website webpages megaohm
question I don't know yeah yeah so last
but not least let's talk about Firefox
and autoplay
I myself have not seen the update come
through on my browser and I've got
eleven computers here anyone out there
in chat world have you gotten the
Firefox update yet how is it performing
I know we all hate autoplay and I know
there's been plenty of other
alternatives around in history to try to
supersede it but having it built right
into the browser I'm just curious to see
how it performs so chime in if it's not
now hit us up on Twitter later let us
know how you're experiencing it about
you guys just to clarify it's on Firefox
nightly which is a test
version of Mozilla's web browser so yeah
it is gonna be tested oh it's not public
yet yeah I thought they were saying it
went public takes not it's not
completely public but to me it was very
important to just say look Firefox
joined the other guys and actually
providing this even if it's in a
somewhat limited version at this point
here's to see if like places will
continue pushing it out even though they
know that like most people hate it and
like browsers will be blocking it like
if they're still gonna go for it anyway
with Ottaway videos
autoplay video I don't know it's hard to
say like when I was first browsing the
web pop-ups were like a really big thing
and you know like I would go on some of
my friends web site like on my friend's
computer that didn't have pop-up
blockers it was like almost impossible
yeah doing anything online so to me this
is just another iteration of the web and
you know Ferb for again stuff is free
online and autoplay was a way for folks
to make money off line online with that
free content so there if autoplay
blocking becomes very regular then
they're probably just gonna find like
another way to do it so there's a whole
South also more so it's curious about
like how this will affect Facebook
because like they technically autoplay
when you scroll through mm-hmm but it's
not like there's audio or anything on
that so I don't I'm like here's how this
will like play out with like Facebook
Twitter Twitter which also is also
autoplay how do plays become like very
common like very regular and there are
some I don't know some websites are much
more aggressive about that's what I was
talking about when I said I hate
websites that do autoplay videos I don't
I don't know any other websites that do
that mostly Facebook a lot of them do I
go on a lot of like news websites that
you know like 10 News CNN does autoplay
CNBC does like I guess I'm gonna call
them out on it they do a really
obnoxious version of autoplay where if I
stop the like it playing and then go to
a different website or like I switch to
a different tab and then go back to that
tab it'll autoplay off all over again
there's just like incredibly annoying I
already told you I don't want to watch
this video there's one like website
where like it's up top
but if you like move to like the X or
like the pause to make it like not
autoplay it'll like scroll down into
like the small box kind of thing on the
side I mean yeah go there deposit like
oh I'm hearing oh we're playing
hide-and-seek with this nice
that's the worst website experience so
the good thing is is like a look yes
CNET does do autoplay but you can
actually turn off the autoplay function
for good when you go on seeing it so
like if you ever go on seeing it the
first time it will autoplay but there's
a little toggle there that you can
actually turn it off so yeah I I can
yeah go ahead and I feel fine
I feel fine calling out my own website
because we actually have a feature that
lets you turn it off for good when you
go on regularly so I'm happy about that
Cena is on HTTPS yes CNET cnet.com the
best hey sir enjoy said nightly and
developer versions are loaded with it
works fine the Cena auto play
successfully blocked enjoy watching it's
dig your own graves
you chose to watch this now Timothy do
has a question where does edge come into
this
that's a good question where does I
don't know what they do I yeah
unfortunately yeah I I don't have a lot
of knowledge on Microsoft edge either so
I write about at a browsers that people
use yeah get the Microsoft chord after
you savage yeah that's that's tough um
I'll ask Mary Jo Foley later she
definitely knows all right so we've got
autoplay getting disabled we've got ad
blockers all up the ying-yang eventually
we're gonna get ad blocker blockers and
they're gonna keep finding a cyclical
way I mean they're they already have
adblock no that's what I mean and then
eventually there's gonna be like
autoplay replay or something I'm just
wondering what's gonna be the next
logical step in obnoxious forced media
consumption or ad placement yes its
autoplay that's what I was saying
there's no video it's just like play
sound in the background like MySpace
they will find a way they will find a
way to make money like if they can
package it to advertisers and do it like
effectively and seamlessly like that's
I autoplay was actually getting utilized
by so many different folks it's like all
thanks Jeff Goldblum it's like all the
annoying people that you grew up with
decided to get together in a room and
after they figure out they can make
money doing this mm-hmm yeah they didn't
hire me for it unfortunately yeah yeah
why would they they're much smarter than
you so to finish it on a philosophical
question farming this out to the chat
and to periscope and Twitter and so on
and so forth what do you think is gonna
be the next logical obnoxious Auto
placement on uh advertising websites we
just want to hear from you yeah an
autoplay pop-up it's Auto buy where it's
like you go on a website and it's in
your shopping cart like already oh I
have an idea I have an idea what if it's
like Auto you so you go on a website the
entire website gets taken over by your
face and it's telling you the
advertisement so it's like you're
talking to yourself about the
advertising it's it's one of those like
AI like fake videos where they get all
your photos this video hey there I'm Ben
I'm you know I want you to Ma Sharma I
should buy it I should buy some of that
now if I buy it I'm you know telling me
to buy it when you when you go like
grocery shopping with your kids like do
they just put stuff in the cart and
they're not or not we're not getting
this like take like put that back they
complain loudly about wanting certain
things but like the two-year-olds aren't
like their arms aren't long enough to
grab things yeah that's basically what
the new software the the new Annoying
software is gonna be where it's like it
just put stuff in your cars like no we
want this yeah and then you have to go
and like take them all out I could see
that you've visited a skiing web site in
March you definitely want it's in your
card already oh my god that makes a lot
of sense actually compared to the sites
I have like the Amazon ad fill that's
like you once looked at this thing it
never even happened in your cart but you
thought about buying the 600 dollar
camera lens you thinking about it again
now we're gonna now we're gonna have you
follow I follow you around the web with
it forever yeah the bigger problem I
find is when I buy something on Amazon
and then they retarget me with that ad
for like three or four days later I'm
like guys I already bought it
hey you just bought a car you should get
another one you should the car you need
three vacuum cleaners you know that's
that's important here's a suggestion
from mark dybul ghosted logos over top a
content that's not a terrible I mean it
is a terrible idea but you know what I'm
trying to say they would start
watermarking stuff to try to block you
from seeing things it's not dissimilar
from when you go to like New York Times
or something like that and they've got
the big banner across it said white list
us or buy a subscription kind of thing
or you can't see this content yeah it's
also it's it's like that Futurama like
like running joke that they have or like
they have the ads running in your dreams
now that second yeah it's gonna happen
man oh my god
instantly happen also advertising in
licensing agreements I'm also like very
annoyed at I think about let that one
sink in for a second that's like two bad
things at once it's like the turducken
of horrible things don't like Intel like
you know they've had some really cool
drones lately with like oh we made like
a flag with like these 10,000 drones
that we have in the air and everyone is
like very impressed by and I'm like
that's gonna be used for advertising
also totally it's like you're not gonna
see stars at night anymore you're just
gonna see drones as ads instead like
drink Pepsi like with like 5000 runs in
the air I mean they do that with
airplanes already they've done it for
decades where they've got like the tail
banners when they fly them over it was
only in the daytime and that required a
pilot to fly it now we've drawn like
Thrones and LEDs we have a whole new
opportunity of awfulness yeah so if you
look at that
I don't know that camera lens again then
until just said Amazon will send a bunch
of Intel drones to like your front door
and just like show you the camera lens
in drone form hey guys hey guys it's
that camera lens in drone form we're
gonna play a video on a drone in front
of you oh your browser can't block me
I'm getting like very annoyed thinking
about all these horrible it's actually a
black mirror writing meeting yeah I just
want to say idea I just want to say
there are opportunities for skywriting
to be used for good one of my favorite
trolls of all time is
this one here and someone just got a
plane and then they flew it out over a
beach and it just says where is your
plane peasants that is absolutely
something nice something I would do this
call go ahead and call me out on it
there have a plane you peasant yeah no
that would be fun if I paid for a bunch
of Intel drones to spell in the sky
Intel drones are annoying that could
that could be a nice corollary we've got
more suggestions rolling in as we're on
our way out the door
Jerrod says Amazon discounted TV with
ads I think that's already happening
isn't it hmm I don't know but it
wouldn't surprise me if it were I mean
they do that with our tablets exactly
and Kindle too right I think so I
definitely know definitely Kindle
tablets and I think they at least for a
while they did it with phones too you
don't do it the echo though right no
good morning you pay ten dollars for
those echo dot so they're being here's
really doing really cautious with
advertising right now with the echo yeah
and that might not be the case for ever
daily ad man if that thing starts
yelling ads at me in the morning when I
wake up it's going right out the window
when I talk to advertisers and marketers
about the echo they see it as a really
fertile ground like they think that this
is they're like very hungry to jump into
that platform it's a really great
opportunity for them and great
opportunity to annoy the hell out of
people there is a phone company slash
data mining service in Mexico that does
that currently where they pay your phone
bill but for the price of that like you
hand over like you answer a survey for
them at the end of every month but it's
like yes so it's like it's basically
they gather data on you based on your
answers to the survey for like I don't
know how much like phone those in Mexico
or but I can doesn't sound that bad yeah
I was expecting something like way more
intrusive like they take your kid every
every time you call your mom like the
the call starts with like hello this is
a phone provided by like whatever no or
just like a straight up 30-second hat
for whoever was paying the phone
provider so you want to speak to a loved
one and why not send them flowers from
1-800
this is we're coming up with some really
horrible ideas we have to observe in
this episode we have to be like mission
impossible this episode because if they
get a hold of this oh it's gonna be
awful we'll be sure there are feathers
then much worse than yeah come on boys
we're just riffing stuff you know yeah
they spend all day thinking of ways to
annoy us so these are terrible
situations or the echo yelling ads at
you somebody suggested Carrie said what
about having drones follow you around
like just on the street that wasn't that
was in the circle with our trumpet
playing like well stop doing it when you
buy the thing like we'll leave you alone
I had to say that would work with me
mm-hmm and then of course the worst case
scenario from Huey yeag commercials at
the start of the 359 with me just
reading him off oh yeah I paid for you
to plug my website earlier guys you've
been getting the 359 without any
commercials for a very long time
well actually you know what never mind I
take that back if you're watching it on
YouTube you do get commercials we get
none of that money yeah that's also very
very true but we are out of time so

wants to take us out today I'll do it

gonna name a bunch of companies whatever
