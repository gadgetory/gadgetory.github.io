I'm Bridget Carey and this is your CNET
update we're into the final stretch of
the 2013 International Consumer
Electronics Show here in Las Vegas
and with all the robots sensors and
screens on display we're on a gadget hi
this year there's a surge in wearable
technology one of the more popular ones
is the Pebble watch it raised ten
million dollars online from 68,000
people funding it on Kickstarter so it's
safe to say that people are pretty
interested in this SmartWatch it syncs
to phones both Android and Apple and
will display incoming messages and
caller information you can also program
it to send custom alerts it can even
give you an alert when it's raining it
has an eating style LCD display so you
can see it in bright sunlight and you
can change up how you want the time to
display
aside from numbers and phrases you can
even have it show the time in binary
computer language it comes in several
colors and cost one hundred and fifty
dollars and the pebble will begin
shipping out to its first Kickstarter
supporters on January 23rd some other
watches here have included health
sensors the $200 basis band is part
pedometer heart rate monitor and sleep
tracker there are sensors on the bottom
that measure your blood flow and heart
rate in real time it'll also track your
skin temperature and perspiration levels
on your wrist the accelerometer logs
your steps taken and calculates how many
calories you're burning and as you would
expect there's an app that keeps track
of all this data to help you analyze
your overall health it has a soft rubber
strap that comes in black or white but
the company says more colors are on the
way
watchmaker Martian also showcased its
passport watch here at the show it syncs
with iPhones and Android phones to
display text messages and other alerts
and calling Dick Tracy fans you could
actually answer calls using the built-in
speakerphone and you can use it for
voice commands it uses Bluetooth to
connect to phones and once linked your
text emails and tweets will roll in on
display on the watch and it buzzes if
you miss an alert but this tech doesn't
come cheap it cost $300 and will ship by
early March with more wearable tech at
the show this year's CNET best of CES
Awards have a new category called
wearable and health
just for these types of devices and in
that category the basis ban and Martian
passport watch have been nominated along
with the Fitbit flex which is like a
Nike FuelBand there's also one quite
unique the happy fork which is a smart
fork to help you eat slower it gives a
small vibration when you eat too fast
and it sends that data to an app be sure
to read up on all the best of CES
nominees this year and the rest of our
