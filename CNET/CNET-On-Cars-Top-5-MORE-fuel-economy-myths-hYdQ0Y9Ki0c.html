economy there's enough BS out there to
make a palm reader jealous I listed my
top five fuel economy myths recently and
that opened the floodgates to many more
that Kirk you I'm Brian Cooley with a
top-five more fuel economy myths we got
to do a top ten one of these days number
five fill up your tank when it's cool
outside I put this low because if you're
under fifty I bet you've never even
heard this one it's right up there with
nuclear bomb drills now yes gasoline
does expand when it's warm to give you
about two percent fewer burnable
molecules dispensed at ninety degrees
then it's sixty canada and hawaii for
example have temperature compensating
gas pumps because they've got unusually
extreme climates but for most of us the
difference cancels out across the year
as we go from warm to cold seasons
besides gas stations don't store their
fuel out in the driveway it lives
underground where temperature swings are
far less number four turn off your
headlights i'm also ranking this low
since daytime running lights and all
kinds of new laws have made driving with
your lights off almost illegal now yes
headlights do put a little draw on the
alternator to recharge the juice that
they take from the battery but by most
tests lights account for a tiny fraction
of one MPG lost and with LED lighting
proliferating that's going to get tinier
all the time
number three turn off the
air-conditioning
this one's real interesting the idea
here is you kill the AC turn it off to
reduce drag on the engine and reclaim up
to three miles per gallon that's big can
you roll down the windows instead well
how it works depends a variety of tests
by Consumer Reports Car and Driver even
the Oak Ridge National Labs have found
varying results that change by the speed
you're driving and the model of car
bottom line here's a rule of thumb
windows down when you're around town
air-conditioning and windows up when
you're on the freeway number two shut
off your car at a red light yes it does
save fuel which is why car makers are
installing automatic start/stop systems
but if you do this meaningly on a car
that doesn't have that technology you're
going to wear
your starter right quick and that's
going to cost you more than all the gas
you'll save also many modern cars cents
when they're stopped in drive and the
service brake is depressed and they go
into a low fuel flow mode anyway number
one has to be diesels are more
economical now I'm not saying they
aren't strictly speaking yes a diesel
gets more out of a droplet of dinosaur
grease but you have to pencil in a
couple other factors the higher cost of
low sulfur diesel in the US it averages
several tens of cents more than gasoline
and the typical premium you pay to buy a
diesel powertrain car the long term
savings are likely there but don't
expect more lunch money in week one or
even year one by the way one more thing
you really want to save some gas get the
junk off your roof and out of your trunk
car makers spend millions to improve
their aerodynamics or even cut 40 pounds
off of cars weight then what do you do
you go and leave 80 pounds of crap in
the trunk for no reason and leave that
kayak rack on the roof all year there's
an improvement that's low hanging fruit
