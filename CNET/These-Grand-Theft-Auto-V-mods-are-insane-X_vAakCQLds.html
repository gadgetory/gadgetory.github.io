entire modding community that sort of
popped up so I just want to show you a
few mods that I've been using that are
kind of hilarious let's boot up GTA 5

appropriately titled mod manager will
will allow you to pick and choose which
mod you want to run in GTA alright so

little mod cold god mode going to health

invincible all right enough talk let's
have some fun here so first thing I'm
going to do is enable a mod that lets me
shoot cars out of my gun so I've loaded
that up it's called vehicle cannon you

gun which is crazy why would anyone do

seems to be a bunch of traffic here in
this intersection if there's only
something I could do to clear it up oh I
know kaboosh is this wrong I feel like I
shouldn't be laughing but there's
something just too much fun about all
this still chaos unfolding behind it oh

like any sort of chimp in distress I'm
going to activate my hand cock mode
because you know the cops are on to me

chimp in Grand Theft Auto 5 so not only

learned how to fly well I also learn how
to fly a jet oh and there you go now
