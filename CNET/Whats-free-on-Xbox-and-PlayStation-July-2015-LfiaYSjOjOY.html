deliver July's free games on PlayStation
Plus and xbox live gold alright let's
start things off with what xbox one and
360 owners can play for free this month
with a gold subscription now xboxes list
is headlined by assassins creed 4 black
flag that is my favorite Assassin's
Creed game in the entire series and it's
available for free only on xbox one all
month so make sure you get on that one
xbox one owners will also be able to
play so many me from July sixteenth to
August fifteenth it's a cloning puzzle
platformer game that has very positive
reviews on steam so it sounds like it
might be worth checking out for Xbox 360
owners plants vs zombies will be
available from July first to the 15 and
then Gears of War 3 will be free from
July sixteenth until the end of the
month alright that does it for Microsoft
let's shift gears and see what sony has
four july for all of july ps4 owners
will be able to get the brand new
multiplayer car combat meets football
weirdo smash up game called rocket
league now the internet seemed very
excited when this was announced earlier
in the week so this one I will give a
shot I don't know much about it but it
looks like a lot of fun up next on ps4
is sticks master of shadows that's the
second game in the of Orcs and men
universe sticks is mostly a stealth game
where you have to stay in the shadows to
survive kind of like me in the
summertime ps4 ps3 and Vita owners will
all get mouse crafts for the month of
July which is a sort of strategy game
where Tetris meets the lemmings is a
good way to describe it also hitting
also new platforms this month is
entwined which is a rhythmic runner game
where you control two souls at the same
time with either thumb stick on the ps3
players will have access to
rain a uniquely stylized adventure game
that features a boy who can only be seen
when standing in the pouring rain that's
so sad and finally exclusively for Vita
owners geometry wars three dimensions
evolved will hit the platform and all it
stripped out multi-directional shooting
glory alright that does it for July as
always a small caveat you do of course
need to be a member of playstation plus
an xbox live gold to access these free
games and those memberships they cost a
little bit of money but as you can see
here it's totally worth it I'll be back
in August for a new list of free games
we'll see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
