obviously the hottest category and
technology right now samsung just
announced the galaxy gear right before
we shot this we didn't have one at press
time but it sounds like it only works
with samsung phones anyway so i'm
testing some more Universal smartwatches
the current darling of the set is the
pebble right here comparing that with
the Martian passport and trying to find
out if either of those can displace my
Michael Kors so I've been testing out
the Martian passport smartwatch and I
have to say that of all of the smart
watches that I have seen or tried out
this is obviously the prettiest I get
tons of compliments whenever I wear this
I got it in girly white although it does
come in black but it's really attractive
it has a very sort of classic timepiece
style look up here and then a small
little LED notification screen and
notification light Paul Allison Tom
calling Tom the pros overall for me are
how easy it's notifications are
basically any app that can do
notifications you can get a little note
down here so you can get incoming texts
phone calls tweets Facebook messages
emails now it's big claim to fame also
is that it is a two-way communicator it
actually uses voice control when you
talk to it you're just talking to Siri
or to the Android voice controls remind
me to make a haircut appointment that's
pretty awesome and I think it's a huge
selling point generally speaking the
whole thing is just pretty simple right
like it just gives you notifications you
can talk to it if you want to you can
play music out of it I found it pretty
easy to connect via bluetooth so that
leads me into the cons of the Martian
passport watch one thing I noticed with
the Bluetooth connection is that its
toll the Bluetooth connection from my
car so if I was in the car and I had an
incoming call or I wanted to use voice
controls I was no longer going through
the in car bluetooth system I
only going through the watch one other
con about this watch is that it's just a
little bit finicky and some of the
controls in the app or confusing for
example i'm pretty sure i have it set to
notify me when i get a text but
sometimes it notifies me and sometimes
it doesn't and i don't know really why
it's decided not to or when it's going
to that's annoying also i find that
trying to check out the notifications
and see what's happening on the watch is
really distracting when you're driving
like if this thing all of a sudden
starts vibrating and things start
happening on the screen and your got
your hands on the wheel and then you're
sort of trying to look at this and read
it and then a notification is scrolling
across it like this it's vibrating and
things are ringing and I just I don't
know what to do here I want out
alright some impressions on the pebble
watch here now I have to say that when I
first tried it on I thought that it was
a little cartoony probably because it
had the Mario watch face up but then
when I wear it with my orange shirt I
realize it look kind of cool and then we
went around the office trying it on
different people and it looked cool on
all of them too I think the design is a
little bit of a slow burn but it really
grew on me and now I really liked it
especially because i found this kind of
stylish watch face one of the cool
things about this watch actually is that
it has multiple watch faces built in
that you can scroll through now overall
i have definitely found this watch
pretty easy to use it has a lot of
buttons as you can see the ones on the
side scroll through things and bring up
basic menus and its really simple
pairing is very easy and then the button
on the left here acts as basically a
home button to back out of menus and get
you back to your watch face one thing I
don't like is that the pebble
unfortunately has a proprietary charging
cable the Martian watch charges over
microUSB so you can use it with any
charger that you already have at home if
you forget the charger on this guy
you're in trouble so one interesting
thing about the pebble watch is that
apparently it's water-resistant now I
have found over and over that water
resistant does not mean waterproof
however I'm hoping that it will give me
a little peace of mind for basic tasks
such as washing my hands in the sink you
know you always get a little splash
itude got a little soap on there get
that off
you know we got to do like the surgeon
wash like all the way up to the elbows
okay it seems fine so far I mean don't
get me wrong I'm never gonna take a
shower go swimming with this thing but I
do appreciate that I can leave it on
during my surgeon scrub what I do like
about this big screen is that if a long
email comes in I can press the buttons
on the side and actually scroll through
it so I can read the whole thing that
has proven pretty handy a couple times
I've also noticed that the Bluetooth
range on this watch seems to be really
good in fact it was working for me at
one point 30 or 40 feet away from my
actual phone whereas our reviewers have
said that the Martian SmartWatch only
works more like 10 or 12 feet away now
the pebble because it has an SDK
available has some apps I haven't tried
too many of them because they are almost
all for pay but from browsing the
various apps in the App Store it does
seem like they're somewhat limited as
far as khan's go for this watch and the
other in fact i found the notifications
very inconsistent sometimes I couldn't
get text messages to come through at all
other times i would get only text and no
email one other possible con is that
this watch so far has been hard to get
it only costs a hundred and fifty
dollars which is a really good price
compared to something like the Martian
but because it's been a Kickstarter some
of the fulfillments been a little bit
slow hopefully they'll improve on that
front but you might have to wait a while
to get your pebble
I have to say going into this I thought
the Martian passport was going to be the
clear winner because I liked the design
so much but the pebble won me over with
its simplicity and the potential for all
that functionality not to mention this
nice big screen however I'm gonna have
to say that neither of these is actually
a buy for me because I'm still not sold
on smartwatches it's annoying I don't
need that much info coming in all the
time no thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
