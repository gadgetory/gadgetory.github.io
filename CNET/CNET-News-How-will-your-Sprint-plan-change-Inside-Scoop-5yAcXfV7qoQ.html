Sumi das and joining me is kent german
one of our Senior Managing Editors here
at cnet Kent thanks for being with us
sure no problem so big news announced
today softbank a japanese company is
acquiring sprint can you tell us a
little bit about the deal sure will
sprint a third largest carrier in the
united states and Softbank is a big
Japanese carrier also their third
largest not a bank no not a bank
actually a wireless care and they are
going to be acquiring sprint for 20
point 1 billion dollars so the deal has
not yet been approved so that's going to
happen what sometime next year right
yeah it could happen next year it could
happen sooner but basically you know it
needs to get approval by the US
government when I can go through and so
nothing's going to change for at least
say eight months or something like that
right now you know Sprint customers
probably won't see changes probably even
a long time off I mean this is not a
merger it's not two companies joining
together and having to mesh their phones
and their plans and their corporate
cultures this is just some one company
buying another so soft pink is probably
going to keep sprint intact as it is so
we don't expect customers to see changes
for a long time if they do it all what
does this mean for sprint though because
this is good news for spring correct it
is sprints in a trying time right now
you know is the first carrier to roll
out of 4G network but that was under
wimax which is a different technology
than what's really popular now which is
called LTE and spraining is to switch
over to LTE mobility I would network
takes a lot of money takes a lot of time
it takes a lot of equipment and sprint
really needs the cash and the equipment
and just the help to be able to do that
and they're getting a great deal of cash
and big infusions deal well any of the
softbank CEO he is complaining about us
carry networks you know a lot of us do
says the networks or too slow there's
not enough you data speeds are too slow
and he really wants to make it faster so
this could be a good thing for Sprint
customers because they may see a fast a
better LTE network sooner faster and
sooner than they thought but again
several several years out or a couple
years out yeah well you know Todd this
kind of stuff takes a lot of time to
build out so we wouldn't see it for
several months brain is griz sprints
network is growing very slowly rises up
to 400 cities by now Sprint's way way
behind but hopefully this will speed it
up by a few months and by the time next
year we see in a lot more cities
especially the bigger cities like New
York San Francisco la so basically the
word for Sprint customers is that there
is no reason to
hurry though service is certainly not
going to get any worse now we don't
expect any changes for Sprint customers
though probably things will probably
bring it as they are for a long time
okay ken thanks so much sure for inside
