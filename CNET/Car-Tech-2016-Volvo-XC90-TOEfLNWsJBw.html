where Volvo is giving us a first taste
of their new xc90 SUV the model name has
been around before but this is a
completely different car and this is a
major clean sheet refresh it's the first
major launch they've had since
acquisition by Chinese investors let's
take a look let's weighing on under the
hood because this is the most
interesting part here is a very small
engine for a big vehicle a 2 litre
inline-four but with a turbocharger and
a supercharger working at different
parts of the RPM range and because we
have a t8 the eights have plug-in hybrid
technologies you can see part of that
here a big battery down the spine an
electric motor that drives the rear
wheels only for extra oomph and also for
a very smart all-wheel drive system on
demand the numbers work out great over
400 horsepower close to 500 pound feet
of torque and the mpge the efficiency
should be around 59 or 60 Volvo says
once the EPA rates this vehicle inside
the first thing you notice is an all LCD
instrument panel from speedo to tack -
typically nav in the middle over on the
right in the center console there's your
tablet like main unit which lets you
swipe back and forth to go either to
vehicle settings over to infotainment or
settle on the middle and a home screen
very much mobile technology style user
interface and of course being a Volvo
they've got advanced driver assist for
safety including the ability to pick up
bicycles and pedestrians both in day and
night conditions now they've got a rear
collision tech so if you're gonna get
rear-ended the vehicle locks up its
brakes and cinches you beforehand and
they've redesigned the inside of the
cabin so if the vehicle runs off the
side of the road into a rut it's going
to collapse elegantly to protect
compression of your spine very volvo
stuff
couple that with what they call a pilot
assist which lets it handle stop and go
traffic in terms of braking acceleration
and maintaining lane with almost no
input from you
ok I've almost got the xc90 the t6 with
a conventional powertrain that's coming
to showrooms in July 2015 here in the US
and then this t8 that the plug-in hybrid
tech that's more like an October arrival
these are about forty eight to seventy
some odd thousand dollar vehicles
depending how you equip them which
powertrain you select</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
