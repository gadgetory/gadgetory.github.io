of the crop of the smartphone world get
ready for a prize five push-out between
Samsung Galaxy s7 and Apple's iPhone 6s
we're changing things up the prize fight
will be decided by this committee of one
ring-a-ling a ding dong don't worry it
doesn't mean Apple products will win
every time like some of you are thinking
so let's get it on round one is design
Samsung's Galaxy s7 brings our sleekest
and most luxurious design ever with an
all metal and glass body the downside
dropping the bone has caused the
backside to shatter so a case is a must
it's slightly taller wider and thicker
body brings a bigger 5.1 inch Super
AMOLED display with a stunning
577 pixel per inch density is gorgeous
now Apple's iPhone 6s brings a sturdier
all aluminium body with its curved edges
but can't compare with its 4.7 inch LCD
display with a significantly weaker 326
pixels per inch density it fits in hand
a little better because it's not as big
but it's finished feels like it could
slip out anytime all things considered
I'm giving Samsung round one next round
of speakers
the s7 is the most feature packed phone
on planet earth right now in the US it
brings a quad-core Snapdragon 820
processor but it's biggest throwback
feature is the microSD card slot that
supports up to 200 gigs it has a
fingerprint sensor with Samsung pay and
it still has wireless charging and bring
the best voice recognition and Google
now oh yeah it's water and dust
resistant and can last up to 30 minutes
underwater at 1.5 meters
there's no removable battery but we've
tested its juice and the s7 averaged 16
hours of battery life one of the best
we've seen on a smart phone now the
iPhone 6s brings an A 9 dual-core
processor its biggest feature is 3d
touch which could be a game-changer with
live photos and in app functions but not
enough people are using it there's no
microSD card slot no wireless charging
no water or dust protection series
getting better but voice recognition
still isn't as accurate Apple will never
do a removable battery but its battery
life comes in at a significantly lesser
10.5 hours on a personal note if you're
offering a phone with a 4k capable
camera you also have to offer more than
16 gigs as a starting storage the s7
starts at 32 and the iPhone 6s starts at
16 of course we know the s7 is brand
spanking you but right now it's not even
close Samsung takes another round round
three is camera
cameras matter and the iPhone has long
held the title of best smartphone camera
overall for years but you know what
that's about to change
Samsung's 12 megapixel camera brings
physically larger pixels that allow it
to capture more light with a wider F 1.2
aperture and the proof is in the pudding
you can see it in examples like this
picture of a daffodil or turning on HDR
mode on both cameras for a city scene
now they're both great but overall the
s7 showed better results except for
selfies using the built-in screen flash
or the iPhone is clearly better
now if selfies matter - you get the
iPhone 6s but Samsung takes another
route with the better performing camera
in round 3 the final round is performing
most of these phones are snapping
performers and in the 3d ice storm
unlimited graphics test the galaxy s7
beat out the iPhone 6s by a small margin
which speaks to the strength of the
iPhone now in the Geekbench 3 benchmark
test for processing the iPhone 6s
actually beat out the s7 in the single
core score but the s7 prevailed in the
multi-core score and then that battery
life 16 hours to 10 and a half is no
contest you might not believe it but in
this prize fight samsung takes all four
rounds and is we clear undisputed prize
fight winners now even after all this
back and forth it always comes down to
the ecosystem and the platform that you
prefer so it's apples move next but as
of now the Samsung Galaxy s7 is 2016
best all-around phone to beat i'm brian
tong thanks for watching and we'll catch
you all next time for another prizefight
