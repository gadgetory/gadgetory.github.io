talking to Seth Rosenblatt senior editor
for seen it Seth you've been spending a
lot of time with Windows 8 I have talked
to me about Windows 8 what are we
looking at here sure this is the new
start screen it replaces your Start menu
if you want to think of it as having
blown up your Start menu that's a great
way to think of it instead of having
these little icons that you have to go
into you instead have these live tiles
as you can see some of them are updating
with real-time information so you don't
have to go into it to see what's
happening in that particular app or
program and in this particular case
we're running this on a touch screen
right so we are running this on a touch
screen can touch these tiles and that
will they'll push you into the actual
application indeed and this is actually
a Windows 7 touchscreen running Windows
8 now actually let's dive into one of
these apps here on on the screen show me
something how i would get into it say
internet explorer okay so internet
explorer is here we're going to tab pops
us right in as you can see it's very
fast there's a there's a lot of changes
in V it's not called Metro version of ie
10 the location bar is on the bottom
here and this is also where you perform
your searches you have your tabs up on
top and you can see here they're quite
big the thumbnails are really easy to
see they're clean and from the bottom if
you tap in your location bar you get
your pin sites your frequently viewed
sites favorites here and a key and a
touch keyboard if you are on a
touchscreen and that's a good point to
make here that a lot of people have been
stopping by your desk asking you if you
have to run windows 8 on a touch screen
right and that's not the case it isn't
it works really really well with a
keyboard and a touch screen if you
happen to have a mouse as well it works
great with that too if you're on a
laptop for example that has a trackpad
they've actually included the
touchscreen gestures on to the trackpad
the way that OS X has them so you now
have like you have your live edges here
that bring up the charms bar here on
this side or previously viewed apps
there we go over here
you can see we're just cycling through
previously viewed pages and then here's
our previously viewed apps well this is
a little change for Microsoft in general
just to actually have by default in the
operating system customizations or an
ability to use this on a touch mean like
a tablet or a touch ba literally a
display like this yes so talk to me
about why my Microsoft might be doing
that what's with Microsoft into or in
for trying to put this on more
touchscreen devices sure Microsoft is
looking at a unified ecosystem in a way
that no other company has built yet
windows 8 will work on desktops laptops
and tablets Windows Phone 8 which we
know is coming in September is going to
be the mobile phone version the
smartphone version and they're all going
to talk to each other with windows 8
really robust sync features you're going
to be able to sync settings browser
history documents will sink through
SkyDrive and Microsoft is aggressively
pushing that with 7 free gigabytes of
space you can of course upgrade to more
it's really something that we have not
yet seen in this way is there anything
that Windows users are going to turn and
run from about the experience in Windows
8 I don't think there's anything that
that is really worth running and you
know screaming to Linux or even OSX but
there are certainly a learning curve
here it's a new way of dealing with
things even though you do have your
desktop mode so you do have a place to
run your traditional apps and run scared
back down you can run scared right back
to this you still get your charms bar
here and previously viewed apps here but
it's a learning curve it's something
completely new and that will intimidate
some people all that being said
Microsoft is making this really really
easy to get into they want you to
upgrade to this like nobody's business
they are charging only forty dollars for
an upgrade that's almost a hundred
dollars cheaper than it was to upgrade
to seven if you bought a computer after
June second of this year you can pay
only fifteen dollars to upgrade there's
good reasons for it you've got a faster
operating system you got a safer one my
tests on this
machine with booting it up to get to the
start screen including logging put it at
under 25 seconds on average and so when
our users going to get their hands on
Windows October 26th right now this is
only available to reviewers and
manufacture well until then readers can
check out your full review thanks for
joining me Seth for cnet com I'm Donald
