2015 we're here at the world cooled
booth taking a look at their brand new
smart top-load washer dryer set so by
smart whirlpool means a couple things
one is that these are part of the works
with nest program there's an EcoBoost
feature that can tell when you're home
run away based on what your Nesta text
if you leave all say you have a dryer
cycle running it will then go put the
dryer to a sort of a tumble mode so your
stuff doesn't get wrinkled can I
generally keep your clothes fresh while
you're away sort of the idea we're
blessed in customs cycles you can
download this sort of specialized the
washing process so let's say you could
have delicates you could have pillows
you could have blankets you could have
stuffed animals kind of depending on
what modes you want to download the show
up on your phone send them to the washer
dryer and they'll wash accordingly it's
kind of a neat feature there's some
other kind of interesting things is a
diagnostic thing that comes up say you
have a lint lock edge the dry will
detect it send you a little notification
on your phone and they give you a little
video to watch to tell you how to clean
things out for example there's a what to
dry section and a how to dry section
that kind of breaks down the inter-basin
to direct it to easier to understand
sections so there's no pricing yet on
these units they will be available
spring 2015 though we'll be keeping tabs
hopefully we'll have reviews of these
things by the time they launch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
