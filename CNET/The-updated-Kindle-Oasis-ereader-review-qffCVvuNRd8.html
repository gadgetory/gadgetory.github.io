turns 10 this year and to mark that 10th
anniversary Amazon is releasing its best
Kindle yet the all-new Kindle Oasis not
only is it the first fully waterproof
Kindle but it features a larger 7 inch
e-ink display the very slim design and
an aluminum back the new Kindle Oasis
may not be as expensive as the iPhone 10
but is it very expensive for an e-reader
it starts at two hundred and fifty
dollars the thing that jumps out at you
is that larger 7-inch 300 PPI display
that PPI stands for pixels per inch
compared to the original Kindle 6 inch
display and provides slightly more than
30% more screen real estate and that's a
big difference
the other big change is to the battery
the original Oasis had a small battery
built into the device and a larger
battery built into the included case
which adhere to the e-reader
magnetically but the new Kindle Oasis
the larger battery is integrated into
the device itself and Amazon has made
the case an optional accessory that
starts at $40 the new cases also adhere
magnetically but they aren't charging
cases the new Oasis tapers down to three
point four millimeters at its thinnest
point and weighs in it
194 grams or 10 grams lighter than the
Kindle paperwhite Amazon says that
displays cover glass is the strongest to
date and the new dual or one gigahertz
processor with 512 megabytes of RAM is
the zipi estate giving you slightly
faster page turns it's worth noting that
the integrated legacy now features 12
LEDs instead of the 10 valve on the
original wases which helps the lights
play across the screen a little more
uniformly the other big addition is
support for audible playback on the
device there's no headphone jack but
that is Bluetooth connectivity that
allows you to connect the Nueces to a
bluetooth headphone or speaker if you
have the license to the audible version
of a book you can toggle between the
audible and the e-book versions however
you can't have the books text appear
while you're listening to the audible
version that's a quick look at the new
Kindle Oasis I'm David Carr noise for
