Tesla but he needs a little more time to
get it ready the CEO of Tesla previously
teased on Twitter that he would reveal
an unexpected mystery product on Monday
but alas Monday came and musk wasn't
quite finished on Sunday night he
tweeted that he's pushing back the
announcement to Wednesday adding that it
needs a few more days of refinement what
is the mystery behind all this hype some
are guessing it could be an update to
autopilot the self-driving software in
Tesla's Model S and X cars not everyone
is a fan of the name autopilot Germany's
Transport Minister wrote a letter asking
the company to rename the feature with
the concern that it encourages drivers
to believe they do not need to pay
attention to the road because it's more
of a driver assistant than a driver
replacement last week Germany's federal
motor Authority sent a letter to Tesla
owners reminding them to pay attention
at all times when using autopilot but
that's not all musk is cooking up next
week on October 28th musk will be making
another announcement this time we're
leading to Tesla's energy storage
devices the powerwall and the powerpack
musk first introduced Tesla's battery
backup system last year in May with the
pitch that it could help homes and
businesses store energy from solar
panels and help save money on energy
bills musk said he would be sharing news
regarding solar city the company that
works in partnership with Tesla to help
get more solar panels on rooftops Tesla
may soon buy Solar City a vote on the
merger takes place a month from now on
November 17th in the meantime Tesla said
that if it does acquire Solar City it
will partner with Panasonic to make the
solar panels that's it for this tech
