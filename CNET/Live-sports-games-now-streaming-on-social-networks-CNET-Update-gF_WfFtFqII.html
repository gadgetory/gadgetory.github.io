cord cutters are getting more choices
I'm Bridget Carey this is your cnet
update
twitter is the best social network to
chat about a live event such as a sports
game but twitter doesn't just want to be
where you talk about the game it wants
to be where you watch the game twitter
is struck a deal with the NFL to stream
some thursday night football games
online and you can watch for free using
any device the games will still be on
major broadcast networks like NBC and
CBS but now there's also the option to
watch online on twitter twitter wants to
grow by becoming your online sports bar
but Twitter's not the first with this
idea yahoo announced that it will live
stream one major league baseball game a
day for free that's 180 games in total
but live games will be blocked out in
local markets so you probably won't be
able to watch your home team online
yahoo also has live stream football
hockey and golf before and if you're
looking for a new way to watch online
video in your living room roku now has a
new streaming stick that you plug into
the back of your TV the improved model
can be pre-ordered now for fifty dollars
and when compared to the older purple
stick this new design is slimmer it
packs in more speed as well it has eight
times more processing power to fly
through things just as fast as a roku
box of course you'll need good Wi-Fi
connectivity but one neat perk is the
ability to have the sound transferred to
your smartphone app so you can watch
while wearing headphones and keep the TV
volume off if you don't want to disturb
others in the house it also includes a
simple remote control and for those who
want to stream premium TV without a
cable subscription there's a new outlet
card option the Stars channel now is
selling access online for nine dollars a
month which is less than what showtime
and HBO charge for their standalone
online subscription services but one
difference is that this new stars app
does not have real-time live streaming
so you may have to wait to watch your
favorite show the app is available on
google play and apple's app store and
that's not all in the world of streaming
t-mobile has added the 16 new services
to its binge on and music freedom perks
which do not charge customers for data
when they stream video or music from
certain services now amazon music ESPN
radio and nickelodeon are among more
than 100
outlets that can be streamed without
counting against monthly data limits
that's all for this technique sound up
and for more streaming news goodness you
can just head to cnet.com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
