devices in every room sounds about as
futuristic as it gets a voice controlled
oven a TV that doubles its art or an
indoor garden that practically manages
itself it all sounds great but there are
some things you should consider when
diving into a smart home of your own and
here are four of the most important
without a doubt the biggest concern is
fragmentation it's certainly gotten
better over the years with the growing
popularity of smart speakers like Google
home and Alexa but if you're not careful
when choosing the smart devices to
install in your home you'll find
yourself with a home full of devices
only using half of their potential the
best way to go about it is to pick a
brain for your smart home be it Alexa
Google home smart things or home kit and
only pick bulbs cameras locks and other
accessories that work with that ease of
use is also another point of
consideration you're not building a
smart home to make your life more
difficult
and turning on any smart light or
appliance shouldn't be any more
difficult than its dumb counterpart the
more products that the devices you buy
compare or communicate with the more you
can do with your smart home cross
compatibility will give you the option
to build automations routines or
commands that make controlling your
smart home easier and faster and another
thing to keep in mind more is not always
better there is such a thing as too many
smart speakers in a single house smart
home gadgets are generally more
expensive than their dumb alternatives
and rightly so a bulb that changes
colors can be scheduled or controlled
from anywhere in the world and that will
last for years should cost more than a
standard LED bulb but outfitting an
entire house with smart bulbs will cost
significantly more and that's just for
lighting when it comes to refrigerators
toaster ovens coffee makers or just
about any other smart home products that
cost difference is only compounded and
don't be so quick to believe the
purported energy savings cost savings
will depend on what technology are
upgrading from but even the products
that do use less energy than their dumb
alternatives will likely take several
years to make up for the difference in
cost finally you should be concerned
with security leave it to shows like mr.
robot to feed us the smart
nightmare fuel of the future while you
can DIY a smart security system very
easily and for less money than a
standard security system would have
caused you just years ago like anything
with a wireless connection is also
susceptible to exploits and other
security flaws your DIY smart home
security system is only as strong as
your Wi-Fi password and the same general
security tip is valid here give
everything its own unique password for
