name is Stephen Beecham i am brian song
and I am hollywood welcome to buzz out
loud cnet's podcast of indeterminate
length it is episode 15 hundred and
eighty 30 and we are super excited
because we have some daredevil guests at
the top of the show today yeah if you
guys were paying attention to see yes
there's a lot of buzz around this
company called chaotic moon who were
showcasing their board of awesomeness so
we decided not only are they going to
talk about more of the awesome things
that working on recently a video kind of
leaked out they're showcasing this
connect enabled shopping cart and the
brains the genus is the crazy minds
behind this at chaotic moon we have our
buddies Worley and philly early there
before we start the show is this uh is
do you have a last name is this like a
prince thing going on are you that big
already like how your tone is like is
there something you want to tell you
really i don't know why brian l sexy we
start talking like that I didn't get
sexy to you but some people interpret my
voice that way oh no slow down okay so I
open source community and it's kind of a
handle it made out of my name like a
UNIX username which is William Harley
and then it was really like crazy mad
scientist guy and then it was like whoa
that's his first initial last name and
years ago and just gave up on using
anything else because it kind of doesn't
matter anymore anyway so word Lee's
business card appropriately enough uh
actually says worley evil genius um but
I think I mean I think it could probably
safely say like evil genius plus
daredevil Evel g9 on at least some of
the videos that we've seen coming out of
chaotic moon tell us a little bit for
those who don't know what in the good
God's name we're talking about what it
is you guys do at chaotic moon so
chaotic mood is a pervasive computing
company we focus mainly on mobile so we
did a bunch of big name maps we did the
daily for jobs and Murdock we did Sesame
Street the monster this into this book
and we have a new games division we
launched last year which is converting
Xbox titles to you know
ads and android ty Wilson stuff like
that but at the very end of last year
Phil we came on board as our labs
manager and phil and i started a new
division which is the labs the idea
behind that is to kind of go out and do
all the things people say can't be done
or when you're wondering like where your
future is the goal is to have this
business you kind of start delivering it
and start showing how fast you can
innovate and types of things you can
innovate you know on that kind of
shorter timeframes shorter budgets and
bigger results now fill it fills onto
wave Phil Phil we want to talk to you
Phil because you're a big part of this
puzzle to now fill one of the cs really
launched you guys at least into the
spotlight where people started trying to
figure out who you guys are what is
cattle mooing oh my gosh this board of
awesomeness is amazing the Kinect
obviously plays a big part in that first
project was that when you came on board
was that one of the first things you
were trying to push or was it the
integration with the connector how we
can use the api's to really you know
elevate the size of what this device can
do really we just wanted to see what we
could do how far we could push it
basically the Kinect is a is a sensor
package and we wanted to see you know
what environment we could work with what
the the software and the hardware
together could do and just to be honest
to have a little fun with as well a
little so I don't know I assume that I
hope everybody watching this has seen
the YouTube videos or some of the videos
that we did but it is it I mean
literally we're talking about just at
minimum the first thing we saw out of
chaotic moons was a Microsoft Kinect
controlled skateboard which has a top
speed of 32 miles an hour I wrote it for
like a grand total of eleven seconds
before executive producer bonnie saw me
and told me to get the hell off yeah we
both got about like what 10 15 feet on
that thing before they say shut it down
yeah get off where you're not insured
for that kind of thing but so um since
then now there is a story that came out
this week about the latest thing that
you're working on which is the the
stocking shopping cart as some people
have described it that's not yeah it's
not as soon as just as you there enter
actually was something in between there
that surprisingly some people list but
we made a second board which is the
board of imagination
which is controlled only by the power of
your mind um so that's something we'll
get you later your pleasure no it's a no
it's on our YouTube channel I thought I
saw it on YouTube do it blew my mind if
you will oh come on now it's pretty cool
here's the headset right here but back
to the shopping cart that you uh and she
discussed yep that's it okay you know
what let's skip ahead to that sleep the
shopping cart is cool but we have to
talk about mind control i mean really
like if you were let's not bury the lead
yeah you know it's just you know the
thing is is we everybody said what could
you do after that with the skateboard
and so we were joking about shortening
the time between the riders thoughts and
what they were thinking wanting to do
and all of these different control
interfaces and what we came up with is
we should use an emotive headset and
actually convert brain waves into
instructions over them and so the guise
of the motive guys and gals over there
set as a headset and phil and i sat down
with it played around and then i spent
like 48 hours like mapping my brain
waves and figuring things out and and i
thought i was special because i thought
will only my brain and trigger and what
we found out is phil known the team did
an amazing job on the software because
we're actually out at Venice Beach just
yesterday and we were filming a day
before and yesterday and random people
were able to just hop on it put the
headset on think kind of imagine where
they want to go and then have the board
take them there so so when you say that
imagine where they want to go is it a
matter of the brain waves stimulating
the device and saying go or you're
saying go right go left it's a matter
it's a matter of well for safety with
all these people we don't get them right
away again don't speed up but it's a
matter of is you literally pick out a
point in the distance and you kind of
imagine yourself travel at that point
and the brain waves you know are
basically converted into instructions
and then there's a fidget on the board
that converts that to electrical signal
for the electric motor that's awesome
that's all really like yes boys it real
quick really can can I get you guys to
come out here so I can just control the
show with my brain waves and just sit
take take camera to camera three totally
do that you guys should have us out
bring a couple sets and you should have
a sound we should find a way to have you
control some of the basic parts of show
that i standing i think we'll just need
a refit reconfigure our entire studio or
mind control obviously also i'm gonna
need an implant okay go for it so
worldly and Phil uh we want to talk
about obviously the whole grocery store
concept you guys did give us a little
you guys did little whisper that you
know tumhi SE us but we we kept our side
of the bargain and didn't say anything
it's true we didn't say anything the
time and you know what we kept our side
of the bargain didn't say anything
either hey you're right you said yeah I
mean in fact when the when the demo was
given them you know neither of us were
really either in them even in the room
so we're fever is surprised to see the
video as anybody um but you know it is
you know it is out there now and so we
want to talk to you guys about it first
um it's um it's very interesting we have
a lot of different projects in the labs
on kind of new technologies and new
interfaces and one of those projects is
this project that Phil and I have been
working on around the shopping cart and
the idea is to figure out everything
from helping people with disabilities to
you know making the things smarter to
making check out easier we just had a
whole list of things we wanted to do and
Whole Foods was kind enough to give us a
shopping cart now the one you see in the
video is not the shopping cart that we
designed around we actually designed
around the little more square
double-decker shopping cart so you know
there was a tracking problem in the
video part of that is because when Phil
and I arrived on site the whole foods in
redmond doesn't have those cards they
have the green car you see in the video
and they have a really super like very
large card and so you know things
weren't quite as perfect but it works
really well with the card is designed
for and basically the idea is just kind
of proved out some some things and test
a mountain we needed a store to
Testament you can't just do things in a
vacuum you can't just do them in the
labs and so we got in contact with Whole
Foods there another Austin company their
flagship stores here and obviously you
know we're big customers of theirs on a
personal level and we asked them and
they were nice enough to give us a
shopping cart
and give us permission to come in the
store you know multiple times and kind
of test it out you know they give us a
nice little eye on the pasta aisle and
and that worked out really well because
you know we got the store when we
discovered you know there's a lot of
extra ambient noise and there's
differently you know some aisles have
speakers right above them and some miles
don't and you know there's a lot of good
data we gathered from there we also got
to see people's reactions which was
amazing which is people i think are
ready for this kind of thing you know
some people have concerns about privacy
well we had already in our work
eliminated those you know whole foods
does not have a loyalty program they do
not have you know frequent shopper type
things and what we designed was a key
fob where you could program a you know
shopping lists and things like that
we'll do it on your phone and you
control the data and you can share the
data with the shopping cart but the
shopping cart doesn't share that data
with anyone so it's just it's just you
know it's you're in control of your data
and even at all times you know another
concern was um will they will they you
know will they hit each other whatever
and you know I think we've got that
worked out as well the important thing
to note is how many times have you been
in the grocery store aisle and somebody
comes down the middle of the idol or
parse the cart this way so Phil and I
just for personal satisfaction I
programmed it to where the card always
knows that you do this side of the aisle
or in this side Wow so it's on the right
sits on the right side more polite than
the humans so but let's talk about some
of those other features that you've kind
of alluded to that you have a list that
you can communicate with the with the
cart not all so it's not just about the
cart sort of following you it's not just
hands-free operation and politeness what
is that what can you what else can you
accomplish by sharing your shopping list
with the cart will feel you want to tell
us about the features sure basically a
lot of this is coming from some of the
work we've done with some other
companies with being aware gluten-free
awareness with allergies and things like
that so what we one of the first things
we looked at was making sure that the
card itself you know when it comes up
and identifies what the product is it
also has access to all that fine print
that everybody looks at and tries to
read and never and miss this stuff so if
you can if you indicate that you have a
preference for gluten-free which is part
of the the scenario that you see in the
video it
will notify you if the item actually has
gluten in it and if it does and you
don't want that it will actually suggest
different different options for you so
instead of one of the problems with
people with special dietary needs or
concerns is a lot of times they feel
like they've been kind of put back into
this small section of the of the store
this lets them go anywhere in the store
find exactly what they want and if they
don't find what if they can't see what
they want they can actually scan
something similar to it and have the the
card itself make suggestions and help
them find what they need that's you know
the gluten-free diet you know there's a
lot of things in the store that don't
have gluten in them but people seem to
tip when they start that diet they tend
to think they have to be in this one
section of the store and they don't
realize there's a whole store full of
items you know available to them so that
was kind of really nice to talk to some
people that had those dietary concerns
and work with them on that it kind of
opened their world up some you know what
you know what's funny guys you guys talk
about this as just as a matter of fact
and after you guys who's like dropped
some of the info of what is capable of
we literally our Studios like oh my gosh
and then you guys can you come to I
blown away we like we're watching our
chat room just be like what like and you
guys have been playing with it for
months you're totally over it so what
are the so I mean that was it though
really you know this yeah so if you
watch the there was a couple different
people have talked about it the
development is you know we run like
three weeks now something like that so
this isn't that so I'm saying is that's
what we're trying to do in labs is these
things that you see in the movies these
things you see on TV these great
fanciful ideas they're held back by you
know companies don't want to advance
their product that fast cuz they have to
have a product life cycle or or you know
people think that's ridiculously
expensive and none of that is true i
mean we live in this amazing age right
now where you can do anything that you
want with the technology and there's so
many options and things available and
what we're trying to do in the lab to
show how fast you can take something
from a concept you know kind of from an
idea to a concept from a concept to
execution so a lot of people say you
know it's like but you know research and
development they say big R little d or
in a little are big
and we think it's actually our D and E
and so we're kind of like medium sized
rd Big E because we're about actually
delivering these things into the real
world so what are you thinking in terms
of practical applications for board of
awesomeness not the board itself but for
you know obviously that kind of mind
control interface well I'm glad you
asked well before he gets the mitral
makes the connected face we always talk
about how we do perceptive pervasive and
predictive computing we do a why in a
while and as we kind of hinted to you
guys at CES this the board of
awesomeness is the why why would you
build that and the shopping cart is the
wow and the reason is is that technology
platform on the two are identical with
the exception of the motor systems so
it's the same samsung tablet running
Windows 8 it's same connect it's the
same software and algorithms we wrote
it's just kind of inverted I've got to
say I would actually like a shopping
cart that goes 32 miles per hour in a
store if there's some way you guys can
attack on that now uh you know one of
the mazing things also is it mentioned
in the demo of the shopping cart how it
can refer to a section in the grocery
store if you needed additional items is
this mapped how does the I guess is it
mapped out for you or they're just
pulling data like there's the list of
the items that are in Aisle five and the
connect and the the system knows that
and it suggests that or is there
actually a physical map that this that
the connect because it's a camera can
can detect and map out itself so since
we've been working with you know grocery
stores for total three weeks obviously
we're experts but in that in that short
time what we've learned is that all of
these stores are different there's
different systems and different things
and and so what we needed was it to test
the first the environmental variables
that sound the motion people walking
what do people think all of those things
Whole Foods was nice enough let's do
that and we're very thankful for that
opportunity but what we also do is we
went started researching brochures in
general and and its stores in general
and so there are some ink art navigation
systems that and mapping systems
companies that are out there so we've
been talking to them seeing what kind of
data feed say provides and Kylie do it
must have been working on our own which
is you know how would you
do this one of the things people don't
realize is how often things move around
in a store you know whether it's you
know whole foods or whether it's a
target you know things are moved on
different in caps of different aisles
and and so you have to have a system
that you know tracks it as we know RFID
which was going to be kind of the Holy
Grail this stuff never really took off
because of the cost and other factors so
there's a bunch of different things
people using ultra wideband and stores
people using you know different things
you've seen those pricing labels that
automatically update their from a
company in Switzerland they're really
they're really cool so the pricing can
all be you know digitize these are
things that these kind of stores are
just now getting into so you know how we
map the store is we have to build a map
for the store for our test you know
that's just the way it works again three
weeks break but we thought we've been
like what we've been looking I was just
curious worley I wasn't criticizing I
don't know you said you didn't use your
sexy voice don't do that yeah it's hard
to tell I so early I wonder a little bit
I bet you could do mesh mapping if all
the cards talk to each other and the
only kill map as they go it's funny
that's something is you can use as you
know to connect to do some mapping and
scanning different type functions right
and so that is one of the solutions that
Phil and his team came up with is it you
know potentially you could have the card
you could you know let it through the
store have it follows you store can I
have a build a map another thing that
doesn't do is that gives you a map of
the store that doesn't necessarily tell
you where all the items are and those
items are going to move so these
problems are you know this this this
kind of technology demonstration we've
done is kind of scratching the surface
of this but there are some amazing
benefits which is you could take all of
the skus put them into a database make
it available to the brains of the card
and you could do the things like the
dietary need and everything or you can
transfer that onto a smartphone without
even having to have an automated card so
really there's about 20 things in here
from a technology perspective that are
really interesting and there's probably
half of those that you can implement it
in a very short term future in some way
or form so now then for the record
you're not going to tell me what the
thing what you're going to do with the
brainwave control technology because
don't think I didn't notice that if that
clever dodge
assign us we have we have huge plans for
the brain wave technology we have some
it some pretty astounding things have
come up with it without playing around
with it obviously driving a skateboard I
actually drawn the skateboard with it as
a blast and everybody this written it is
like the funnest thing in the world
because you watch something to you has
never been on one and they put on the
emotive headset and then they're bright
they think about it and the first time
they do they always fall off because
they're laughing and get distracted
because really co my god it works hey
I'm Ali's laughing in that video right
there oh my god and there's the worst
are in the videos I'm there in the
connector arriving today so so we have a
lot of applications there's no looking
into applications that are you know
mainly right now for our Social
Innovation Program in the space of what
can we do with disabled people or people
with disabilities so we you know have
grown as a company tremendously fast
we've been unbelievably successful and
obviously we want to give back so you
know we've done a few things already we
sponsored a movie shot and appalled to
help with the make awareness of the
trafficking of young girls out of Nepal
into brothels in India we did a charity
water race where we had two chaotic moon
rickshaws or tuk-tuks all decked out
with some tech equipment and branding
and we race those two thousand twenty
miles I believe down down India that's
on our website at the lab section and
we're doing more things and now we're
now we're finally at a point we're like
okay when you start releasing some of
the technology things we have so we
can't tell you I would love to talk to
you guys about at first but we have
something we're doing to be with the
emotive headset that is going to be I
mean it's like a deadline okay well it's
good it's going to make the shopping
cart look like oh you know my 15 year
old building shopping you guys and you
love it I feel like you guys are the
solve for x factory right like
everybody's giving talks it's all for X
and you guys are like oh we're actually
we're solving yeah we're solving doers
we're doers oh I am I am hoping to come
and visit you guys in Austin during
South by Southwest so hopefully we'll
have some more video of the cool stuff
that you're doing I hope it's you on the
second version of the board i'm totally
doing it further than a
11 seconds or a few feet because we were
limited we're limited by your producers
at all they're not kidding right there I
know that's why I'm already all over
that I know I'm bringing my knee pads
we're doing this let the range make some
elbow pads too now here's the only
problem usually we're going to try to
we're going to try to have this fixed by
South by is with the headset you can't
wear an EEG on your head and a helmet oh
so your producers thought it was
dangerous what be really careful of
course well we actually may we have a
prototype helmet Phil is working on
where we're trying to take it one apart
we're trying to actually put it into the
helmet and so if we have that done or
close enough to done will let you try
that one when you're here awesome guys
well we just want to say just really
exciting to talk to you and see all the
amazing things you're working on in we
will definitely take you up on your
offer for you guys to come back whenever
you have new news and all the cool
projects that you guys are working on so
there's Phil wheat Worley thank you guys
for coming out chaotic moon boom and
just so you know one quick note we are
doing a project a month so we did two
boards you know we did one in January we
did one in February in the carton
februari so we'll have one every month
if you want to find out about them all
right damn alright guys we'll talk to
you soon the the site is chaotic moon
calm they are chaotic moon studios and
we'll be talking we'll be talking more
right yes and we are going to take a
quick break when we come back of course
we have all the tech news of the week
google's privacy factor policies go into
effect ipad 3 rumors you know we have to
and windows 8 plus the best phone coming
out of barcelona we'll be right back
hands down probably
you
welcome back to buzz out loud everyone
we have recovered from our interview
with the chaotic mood guys and love
those days we're gonna move on to the
two it's really hard not to root for
those guys you know yeah they're just
they're really they're easy to root for
all right let's move on though to the
news the big news as of actually today
is that Google's new privacy policies
have gone into effect the ones that keep
them are the ones that allow them to
collect and sort of monitor your web
search history to share your information
between all of their different
properties give you a better experience
more a better experience or fall range
experience which i actually think if
executed properly some of it could give
you a better experience although i'm not
gonna lie i went and erased my web
history today so this is an interesting
though Molly because earlier I remember
when we talked about you said you're
okay with this but you still went to
delete your web history your searches
yeah i mean i am ok with google sharing
the data that they already have about me
between the sites like though i use all
of them for a reason i want them to be
better integrated I think that's fine I
think web history is a remarkably
personal thing especially I mean go look
you know they've made it pretty easy
they have google com / history you can
go and look at your past history you can
kind of like edit and manipulate it or
you can just erase the whole thing and
I'm not gonna lie like I google fifty
percent of the thoughts that pop into my
head at any given moment you know I'm
there I think you got the phone and
you're just like what is it mmm and I
mean it's dirty things that brian says I
don't understand I did not get scolded
during the break by the way friends he
didn't never worried about that
hilarious alright but seriously he says
word sometimes that I don't I do yeah
sometimes you have to urban dictionary
that it's you know it's science stuff
it's I don't know whatever and and when
you look at it all in aggregate or it
might be health stuff like I have a
weird bump right here and I'm gonna
Google that I don't you know I do not
web history I think is is the part for
me that everybody needs to pay attention
to yeah so there are a few ways right
people been writing and talking about
what are some of the ways that you guys
can do if you want to try to avoid being
a part of this because there's going to
be two camps one that is totally all for
it maybe actually three
someone that's kind of in between let's
get rid of web history or if you really
want to try to avoid Google's you know
new privacy policy not be tracked in any
way shape or form well guess what number
one might be don't log into Google right
don't log into the services if you
really don't want to be a part of this
you always have the choice either login
or just not even use the service anymore
one of the things people are suggesting
is there are ways to acquire all the
data that Google has and export it so
that you can take it to another service
if that's something that you really
aggressively want to do um you can use
another search engine you can use
another search engine which i find
hilarious alright you can turn it up
there are that there are some you can
temporarily pause your google web
history if you file a sure I'd have made
a good point in the chat room just now
which is its kind of brilliant marketing
because once I went and looked at my web
history my search history even though I
deleted it I still was like wow this is
kind of useful because if I forgot the
results of whatever it was I searched it
might be kind of but you so you can
pause it at at certain time so if you
know you're going to be like if I know
I'm gonna be researching something Tong
said I could just make sure that that
doesn't even get influenced put on the
privacy but is it oh is it a time range
you can set you can optimize it you go
into google.com / history you can
basically hit like pause got it and then
you can turn it back on whenever you
want on it I mean it might be kind of
annoying but but it's the way you know
it's the way we have to deal with some
of these things yeah you know what I
find annoying actually is that um
incognito mode I think that Google could
go a long way toward making people feel
better if there incognito windows did
not log your web search and that would
see you would think that would make
sense that would make sense I was shot
only does it not save all the passwords
and all the activity but don't save your
web it see that's why by default i would
hope or think that incognito would do
that but it actually doesn't yeah what
the what all it does is keep you from
being tracked basically but it doesn't
yeah so can we make something real clear
that this is only for people who have
gmail accounts right because I went and
tried to turn off all my history and
there was nothing there because I don't
have gmail well do you have a youtube
account I do have YouTube account but it
didn't see that either yeah it's right
now its track it's collecting web
history from gmail accounts okay so yeah
if you don't have a gmail account which
yeah my oh my only my only Google
accounts
I have our work CBS interactive and the
studio I work at so there's no history
at all what email are you using hotmail
oh yeah Wow let's cool dude it's almost
crazy is another store we have way later
in the show but that's crazy exciting
yeah cool there's a skydrive there now
sooo yeah that is nice nice actually
yeah a bind there's a startup called a
bond which is actually really funny
because I just yesterday interviewed a
lawyer from a bind for a story that I
wrote about online privacy which you can
find at Molly rants hey um but they
they're a startup that does privacy
tools they let you they have a sort of a
as close as they can get to one stop opt
out for data brokers that do all that
crazy scary collection about you which
is what the columns about but they have
a tool called protected search right now
it only works on Firefox which is a
bummer because Firefox becomes less
usable every single day but they say
they're working on other versions for
other browsers so that when when you're
using that extension basically it
funnels you through kind of a middleman
so that Google can tie the data back so
the middleman kind of hides your search
what you're actually searching for
requested but it never it kind of stops
that that gap in the direct relationship
in between yeah and then hides intimate
in the middle okay like that I think you
know that the market will provide also I
mean I do think that there are some some
positive things that can come out of
this nevertheless in other parts of the
world there are countries with much
stricter privacy that laws than ours and
we could take note one of them is Japan
Authority Japanese authorities have
written to Google saying that it's
possible that this this new technique
their new policies could violate
Japanese data protection protection laws
yeah this kind of follows on the heels
of South Korea who was recently
investigating the possibility that the
search giant was also violating their
own laws there so it's the EU is also
you know still looking at the issue of
Google merging all these platforms
together and sew across the world it
seems like across the world people are
more worried about this oh yeah then in
the US the actual governments are more
worried about this google is here
creating jobs and standing on Capitol
Hill lobbying them constantly to make
sure that actual you know privacy
shins are not enacted which is also what
the column is about I really miss it
really just comes down to how much can
you trust Google you know and how much
do you want to yeah and and if the
services get better that's great but web
search I think in particular especially
when you find yourself searching for
things about health all of that if it
ever is made public or if it can be
scraped by data brokers like you don't
need that to be affecting whether you
can get insurance in the future you know
I mean I think web search history is
something to be very careful with all
right also you guys should be careful
about what you hope for what you expect
for what you might see on March the
seventh it's official apple sent out
their invite i know everyone is like i
know this already Apple sent out their
invites for the March 7th ipad event
that will be a Wednesday of next week
what I love about this most specifically
is when people start parsing the actual
you know image invitations or but it's
it gets a little crazy right so we're
showing you at least on the on the video
stream of the icon or you know the
picture of the calendar shows March 7th
people immediately said oh my gosh that
looks like twice the resolution of the
previous calendar and it wasn't at
Gawker they were like this is the retina
display hiding in plain sight then it's
like we're done where is the home button
you guys look there's no home button in
that picture that is actually pretty
notable it is semi notable but at the
same time in at the same time people
could argue it could be just turned
sideways yep which is I'm just saying I
mean we're playing around it could be
either way we don't really know there's
rumblings that maybe they were gonna get
rid of the home button like six months
ago but no one followed up on it now all
of a sudden this pictures like there is
no home button the parsing is just a
blast mainly because they and then the
an touch thing does it suggest some sort
of new technology I said on Twitter that
my money was on a touchscreen like I'm a
core macbook air at little other project
is a little early and they prop and
nobody on Twitter ever wants to have any
fun at all so people were like your
stool this is this is all i can tell you
based on what i can say and it sounds
really stupid for me to say this but my
a very direct contact says there will be
another product announced at the event
that is not an ipad
not a knife that is hardware software
that is not an iPad that it note that
from Apple that no one has seen before
that's all I can tell if I'm right I'll
you Twitter haters are gonna have a nice
big drink of crow but you know I'm art
we're not because it's so such an
ambiguous statement but you know he's
obviously told me more but i can't i'm
not gonna get my friend fired iphone 5
then we're not gonna like traitor
broadcast but it's just something to
think about that it will there will be
another product announced that we
haven't seen from Apple plus in the
actual ipad 3 rumors of course there are
reports that it will have a Retina
Display that it may have a redesigned
bezel and that there might be three
different side three different devices
three different models one of which
could be on technium today of course
there's reports that you know there will
be like a seven inch version that
whether or not it's going to have LTE
and then some rumors coming out of China
that it could be seventy to eighty
dollars more expensive which is possible
if it has a Retina Display I can
understand there were speculating that
maybe they would keep the ipad 2 in
circulation don't not stop making it and
then make the ipad 3 the really premium
model which is possible here's here's
what you guys can expect all right it's
a week before the keynote we are gonna
hear everything known to man of like any
rumor possible its camera is going to be
42 megapixels eat your heart out nokia
all right it's gonna be ridiculous but
you know what we're gonna ride with it
yeah you know there was another whether
they're talking about rumors of not only
with those three different models right
the ipad 2 would have eight gigs so it'd
be a lower entry model right lower
capacity lower price who knows who knows
i'm not i'm not going to pretend like we
know all we can tell you is that we will
be there our cnet staff will be there
and then we will be doing live buzz out
loud coverage because the because like
it or not the world shuts down you guys
I had to change my flight to austin like
I was supposed to be on a plane at ten
a.m. on wednesday and everybody was just
like oh hell to the no you're not going
I'm not going I'm going way later that
day way later no so we will be doing
live buzz out loud coverage of you know
from our live stream which is as you
know like a lot more fun than just
watching a web blog so we hope you'll
join us for that yeah for those asking
what time is our coverage start I
typically the keynote starts at ten
right so we'll probably be on around 9
30ish 9 45 or so just come and hang out
with us then it'll be an extra bonus
episode we look forward to seeing you
see don't you feel better now about
other ipad3 rumors you were all like
bored and over it but now you get extra
show good for you a cool story about a
throttled iphone user who took eighteen
t to court said this is not okay how
your throttling my data speeds and one
eight hundred and fifty dollars till
death by a thousand tiny cuts yeah he
made the claim that ATT purposely slowed
down his data speeds despite the fact
you've subscribed to an unlimited data
plan and everyone has been talking about
this he took into court the payout
represents ten months of data on the
carrier for the remaining portion of his
contract I've got a wonderful people are
gonna start trying to follow his lead I
think they probably will yeah and I
think that they should I mean it the way
that AT&amp;amp;T has been manipulating its data
the way that they the way that all these
carriers are essentially lying let's be
honest about unlimited data is it's
reprehensible it's arbitrary it's
ridiculous and it comes on the heels of
eighteen t saying you know floating the
idea in Barcelona like hey maybe we
should charge mobile app developers for
the data that their customers are going
to use like today would repay for their
customers data as the customers try to
get around the arbitrary and way too low
data caps that we're putting in place as
we refuse to invest in our own freaking
infrastructure it's funny because it
seems like AT&amp;amp;T is the company that
always says those type of ludicrous
things right yeah we need more spectrum
you know they're not they're not dealing
with it the right way already oh let's
start and charging the mobile app
developers are you kidding me yeah well
will discharge them on one end for that
let you know I mean it really it's a
joke and an innovative new business
model to continue to make money from the
fact that we are I mean that lets their
throttling service for everyone to some
extent if they put in a to like a two
gig or a four gig cap like that's
everybody is starting to realize that
that is not enough for the media needs
of the population they're just looking
for more revenue because people aren't
text messaging as much and using the
free messaging service like we need some
more money right we those 15 20
bucks we need to make it up somehow
somehow somehow someway uh it's
outrageous anyway uh he that was he was
originally seeking $10,000 1 850 and I
suspect it won't be the last yeah of
those those small claims courts filings
windows 8 consumer preview also came out
this week finally this is great as they
consider it is actually it's very um it
there's been so much speculation about
it they were talking about it so much to
CES nobody really knew what it was going
to look like or what it was going to do
and they debuted in Barcelona which was
kind of interesting at Mobile World
Congress yeah really we're showing off a
kind of a video but really the launch
screen the start screen so to speak is
very more the Metro interface all the
demos that they've been showing really
feature the touch aspect a lot more than
the mouse and click aspect which it is
compatible with which it does allow you
to work in a desktop environment but a
lot of the demos that they're really
touting is the fact that this is a touch
device this is a touch OS right it's
it's it's everything but it they feature
more on the touch side which is that is
very interesting because it doesn't it I
mean the desktop experience I guess
they're assuming like usually no sure
people get it on the desktop because
their windows users and they're going to
upgrade one thing that you should note
though is that windows 8 on Intel is is
very unlike windows 8 on arm so as your
tablet shopping you may find some
interesting problems which is for
example if you were hoping to run
Windows 7 apps and older on your new
Windows 8 tablet you have to have an
intel based tablet and a pc the
architecture is not the same for the ARM
processor so if you have an arm tablet
you're only going to be able to run
those windows 8 metro apps and it's
interesting because when they were
making the announcement they were really
trying to tout that this works exactly
the same on both platforms right you
know this it's using the same code it's
going to look great and flow great but
they're still going to be you know for
products that you use from the past you
won't be able to necessarily use them
the right way yeah the windows 8
consumer preview for those you who want
to play with it because I think it's
definitely worth you got a messenger you
have to check it out you can download it
it's it's available to download so you
guys can get your hands on it
see if you enjoy the windows 8
experience I just it just feels so much
more tablet-based and they really just
haven't shown kind of I guess you could
say the kind of the Windows 7 desktop
look but I do love the Metro interface
the retro interface is beautiful i think
that there's some i wrote a column
recently about this and i think that
there's some problems with the
implementation mainly because like the
Metro apps won't run on the desktop
there's that arm vs intel problem that's
it and then the you know i am hoping
microsoft has alluded to are there have
been rumors that they're going to have a
write once run anywhere interface for
metro because right now if you write a
metro app for a tablet it won't
necessarily run on a phone and it won't
necessarily run on xbox even though they
are all kind of look the same so I think
as they move the Metro concept from just
aesthetics to really an engineering
platform that it has a ton ton of
potential be a total ecosystem killer
which is you know right now mountain
lion right like we're expecting the
mountain lion is going to be the it's
the OS that will tie the whole ecosystem
together with with the mac windows 8 can
definitely be that yeah they just have
some engineering stuff they've got to
get done and one of the cool things that
I do like about Windows 8 when you talk
about the ecosystem and tying it
together is the fact that when you have
an account with Microsoft you can
literally log on to any windows 8-based
machine in your settings and preferences
and you know they're all be loaded there
and you'll still have access to SkyDrive
so it really is leveraging the cloud
aspect of their SkyDrive integrated with
their services being able to use it on
any windows a base machine yep so that
that's pretty slick I like that yeah I
think it's going to be cool we have a
really good by the way um debate like
obviously these operating systems are
far from final right now but there jason
parker and seth rosenblatt did sort of a
little point counterpoint already about
windows 8 vs OS 10 mountain lion and
they go through some of these features
which one has a more compelling
ecosystem how will the hardware impact
the usage which one's easier to adopt
cloud integration stuff like that it's a
good read yeah it really is the the
message is that yes it is very early to
make a decision but it's worth talking
about for sure where they stand right
now yeah definitely anyway well we'll
check it out I think we're going to have
some videos
soon about how to install the consumer
preview too so we'll give you a little
excellent alright so we uh we keep
things moving along here with her with
our quickest let's let's hit that quick
are you laughing well you get hit that
quick and I got in trouble for other
jokes right that's me you only get in
trouble if they don't make me look good
well this is not something to laugh
about Molly right let's get serious HP
cuts 270 employees from their web OS
division that's terrible okay now first
of all I've got we this is a corn in the
verge we were all surprised that there
were actually two hundred seventy
employees still part of the webos
Division I was surprised by that I was
surprised that I didn't lot I didn't
expect that the vision was still so
large but it does signal I don't know
how large they are overall if it really
was you know a fifty percent cut or not
but that doesn't bode well for any
future for a web for you know for webos
is just being supported by HP in any way
shape or form are they going to release
it to the public well I think this is
them saying we're gonna make we're going
to open source it and so we don't need
our own people working on it oh that
that does make some sense even though
it's brutal luckily there was a
corresponding story recently in like The
Chronicle I think about how tech firms
in San Francisco are absolutely
desperate for employees so hopefully all
these HP guys will have somewhere to go
webos is just a sad story to me it's I
don't know if they're ever gonna be able
to turn it around to to even like a push
like okay even remotely like hey let's
just get back to like acceptability yeah
it's hard it's hard to see you gotta
feel like it's done like this that the
plan to open source it is basically a
way to kill it without killing it yeah
pour some out yeah that hurts The Wall
Street Journal posted a whole long hit
piece on Google+ the mounting minuses at
Google+ they called it a ghost town and
they pointed out that according to
comscore at least people are spending
more time overall even though there
aren't as many users necessarily users
spend more time on myspace then they
spend
google+ hey sexy back is coming back
myspace has more user interaction than
google+ justin timberlake was right she
was right that's crazy according to
comscore network here Wow users spent an
average of three minutes on google+ in
the entire month of january and myspace
users search for eight minutes that is
just pathetic for both sides it sets in
a month in a month all right way not
total like the users who were using
myspace surfed for a total of eight
minutes which is actually that's kind of
a long time in terms of user / over the
month there was a story recently that
like we survived that by 30 days no no
the average time that each user spent on
myspace during the month of January were
eight minute for okay okay okay and once
it like a user's than a total of eight
minutes didn't we did a story that's
what the virus like what am I no way no
we did a story recently were like they
were saying that a million new users
came to my space right that's has a lot
to do with their new music player mm-hmm
Justin Timberlake pimped out I mean I
think these numbers are a little I don't
know I think the numbers are a little
odd comscore doesn't count mobile
numbers like it's not i'm not sure that
you i think you should take this all
with a grain of salt daniel tournament
definitely wrote a little bit of a
rebuttal about this nevertheless though
they talked to people at Zynga who said
google+ a nice platform but it's been
slow on the uptick with users possibly
because users do different kinds of
things on google+ it's hard to say i
mean i have definitely seen and it that
there's an insane fire hose of traffic
on google+ like the number of followers
that i have on google+ is hilariously
huge right but they're not engaged and
most of the engagement that I see on
google+ is people commenting like hi you
know what are you doing you look pretty
like it's not um I don't know it just
feels like it feels like you're you have
a page on the open Internet and then the
open Internet just like people well i
think the other statement that they
probably forgot to mention in singers
comments where that no one is playing
are copied games on google+ exactly
they're not you know people are using
the same way because that cityville game
we got not working I don't and I do
i really don't i think people who are
using google plus are using it on the go
i think they're activating it on their
android device not on the web and so
that doesn't show up in comscore results
I think like it's just not I think that
the way that they're measuring it is a
little bit it may be not is appropriate
and and people are not using google plus
the exact same way that they're using
facebook you know so if the expectation
is they'll do all the identical things
and they'll just play zynga games yeah
then then sure might but I'm not sure
it's an apples-to-apples comparison I
think people are still figuring out
their Google+ usage I'm not necessarily
defending it or saying that it's taking
off but I think that this story was a
little bit distorted I'm figuring out my
google plus usage by not really using it
at all this is like to be honest like
when you talk about the you know
duplicating your efforts on both network
I'm sorry I don't want to do that i'm
not i don't think i'm in the minority
either I think repeating the same things
on two networks is just too much trouble
for the most part like we interact with
Twitter differently than we do on
Facebook and most people do Twitter
Facebook right but we don't you know or
let's say maybe twitter and google+ but
google+ and facebook are still similar
ish enough where we're trying to figure
out what we really are going to use
google+ for that I'm it's kind of like
getting pushed to the side right now
yeah I think it is but I also think
there still is an evolution to follow
like what I'm i'm using google plus now
is a composite one to one replacement
for the facebook fan page because there
isn't as much engagement there how many
people have fan pages Molly I'm just
saying oh no I know I agree but I mean I
think yeah it may be that but I'm
talking about the evolution of Google+
and it may be that Google+ evolves to be
really useful for brands in a way that
you know like facebook yesterday they
have this big marketing event they
rolled out timeline for pages they're
saying we want you know brands are going
to be able to have these beautiful inter
inter in immersive experiences that
we're really going to give them a way to
advertise and like buy into the news
feed but it might find it might turn out
that Google+ is a better place for
brands to be a better place for a public
figure to be because you get way more
engagement I mean I still do get a ton
of comments on whatever I post on
Google+ and you're immediately like the
big secret to me about Google+ is that
is a door it's a main line it is a hard
line into Google search results
so if you've been worried about SEO
everything that you post on you can
watch it you post something on google
plus 20 seconds later you've got a
google nurse news alert about your name
or about your business and i think that
that will probably prove really useful
in the long run that Google+ is maybe a
better outlet for like I said companies
and public figures than facebook yeah i
mean i could see that on the flip said
it i would have imagined that you would
start seeing some sort of traction from
brands already by now either they
haven't done anything major persada
they've allowed those brands to come on
board but we haven't we still haven't
seen people really use it as the brand
destination and maybe that's down the
road yeah but also I think the fact that
it could be able to search it that
benefits google more than it benefits us
right the whole google+ and we're being
able to search it and being able to you
know use that data for I don't know how
that everybody's desperate for SEO so if
you want your post to get attention and
you want to make sure that it's
immediately indexed by Google you know I
mean I'm not saying they're doing
anything fishy by like hiding the
facebook stuff but i don't think i've
ever seen anything that i posted on my
facebook fanpage show up in google yeah
it out sure like if i post a link to a
column on google+ it is instantly index
yeah and and then thereby i would assume
way more searchable to me that is that's
the like that's a nice i should start
paying attention that's why i curate all
the podcast shows on my Google+ page
because I know it's just gonna be
searchable people people gonna find it
later in the future you know so in the
future the future the future we'll see
what the future holds I should probably
just like I should have just blogged
everything that I said actually has a
role we can record this it's not too
late no yeah we can record you you can
look at the recording and then just you
know transcribe it and say this is why
brian Tong is wrong blah blah blah blah
blah this is why I'm right Kara oh no I
don't think either of us are wrong cuz
you know why everybody is no version we
talk about the future and technology you
don't know until it happens yeah we
don't know like flip the Internet it has
infinite possibility exactly yeah thank
you you know what's also love it amazing
about the internet pinterest seen a lot
of traction with the ladies but Steven
you found this right yeah yeah you want
to talk about this my man yeah so Gawker
did a story yesterday about
Pinterest is format or Pinterest is not
for men men hate pinterest don't like to
use it well hot oh by the way I agree
but say they found this site called man
trysting it's very interesting it's it's
a Pinterest for men and you can pin all
your guy stuff they come on that's just
pinterest yeah but it's man teresting
man teresting that's all sorry it's just
bunch of guys stuff so is this just a
blog that people post to or is this you
don't create a profile this is the
website that or they're mocking pinches
yeah yeah I was thinking maybe it's a
spoof but there is a place you can log
in and sign up and get involved in it
I'm just gonna you know what oh my god
they have gentle mint.com to which is a
wholesale described accurately by Gawker
as a wholesale ripoff of Pinterest why
wouldn't you just why can't you use
Pinterest like wait for girls it's not
it's totally one of those same girls if
you think it's for girls but but I mean
everyone thinks is for girls I mean it's
it's the Holy it's for every it's like
how about this volkswagen bug is for
everyone no it's not because that little
flower holder kind of gave it a feel
like hey it might be more female gear to
the car but it is for everyone I'm still
not gonna get a volt I a book see my
problem is that now I'm on gentlement
and I am interested in it because I'm
such a dude this is why I want men to
just man up man up men and get on
Pinterest because you know what I am
interested in your stuff and if your
stuff is cool i will think that you were
hot so hot have you seen the two devices
that I've pinned on Pinterest I don't
know not to check in okay one was a
mouse it was kind of hot I like a little
Mickey Mouse record player right there
I'm gentlement this is there did come on
man up men Oh get on pinterest no no man
up men don't get on pinterest you know
man trysting seriously gonna do it you
don't get on mantris if you and I get on
the interest don't do that I'm
ministered stocking gentlemen too though
all right guys you know we also love our
gadgets there's been some amazing
gadgets this week oh we have a couple
that we want to show oh yes
I know everyone listening had to listen
to our little Inspector Gadget we're
just like all right check this out
everyone you can't escape it the Lytro
right it's in our it's in the house I
put up a link that people can see some
of my cool Lytro pictures yeah but you
know we've talked to the crew the CEO
renting who came here long before they
liked you even had a form factor before
they were getting neighbor major
publicity that's how we toot our horn
that bol is the place to go for really
cool first interviews like with chaotic
moon you know that's how we roll we're
just saying we don't wanna miss buzzer
lab because we are on the cutting edge
we're gonna stop talking about it so
we'll still be on the cutting edge
cutting edges talking about yourselves
not cutting edge anyways if you guys
aren't familiar with it electro the
light field camera takes pictures not at
the highest resolution but still just
the amazing creativity of living
pictures people are like flipping out
about this stuff you can click on a
point like you can click on my nice
little face back there there you go look
at that is that cool now if you scroll
over I in the back if you scroll if you
scroll to one picture to the picture
with the spikes okay there you go so
check this out this one of the cool
features that they showed off now with
the lytro is this new ability to what
they call creative mode but allows you
to take macro shots and so that you'll
really be able people that are like
artists that love textures of things I
did the macro shot of this is like a leg
of an action figure but you can click on
each of the individual spikes or parts
of the image it's bonkers for really
think yeah you know people are
criticizing this yeah it's not a
mainstream camera yeah this is the first
demo of the technology it's gonna get
better and better down the road but man
for foodies I took a picture of a
grapefruit right and you could click on
the different texture of the meat of the
grapefruit but it was amazing yeah it
was so crazy my food pictures are gonna
be forever changed soon as the Wi-Fi
comes yeah oh yeah yeah just a quick
thing if you guys didn't know about
light rolla the FCC tore this thing
apart and there's a Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
chip inside of this I talked to the
lytro people of course they smiled and
said the only thing we can confirm is
that there's a Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip
in here but they're not gonna promise
any features they can't deliver on yet
but it's good to know that this I'm not
going to say it's future proof but it
has a future for more features and
capabilities
it's a fun it's fine it's really it's
really exciting we've never seen
anything like this is what technology is
all about it is I mean I'd say that
anymore like the idea of a revolution in
digital imaging is so exciting because
not only can we have these cool little
cameras ourselves which is really not
the overall point like I can't wait
until they start making their way into
film cameras I mean think about what's
going to happen to your dvds and your
extras when you've got infinitely
manipulatable video on on the web or on
a physical device like so nice that's a
nice you're able to you know I don't see
it that very well I think if initely
manipulator infinitely manipulatable
that's cool also just some cool things
right this light field camera already by
default because the technology takes
pictures in 3d that's a feature they're
going to roll out and then they did this
other demo for me that we couldn't show
called perspective shift and basically
with the picture you take you hold down
the mouse button and let's say you move
the mouse in a circle it you get about a
five to ten degree angle on the items I
mean it's and you don't need 3d glasses
all right this is moving a picture and
seen it from different angles it was
bonkers it's pretty a quick thing in the
chat room picture file size and
individual picture to download to your
computer it's going to take about 16
megs per file it's it's own propriety
file when you export and upload it to
light show servers so then you can share
it on Twitter and Facebook those files
are anywhere from 500k to one meg so not
very small not very large and they're
gonna at this moment they said they're
unlimited they're going to host them a
limited amount right now and I asked
them is that going to change the future
they said we'll see how the behavior is
but for the most part every photo you
load right now you won't be capped or
anything like that so because then
that's one thing to note is that when
you upload the photos they do have to
live on nitro servers because Lytro
serves them up then in there essentially
proprietary player yes it was a fly
flash player html5 player and then you
can uh yeah that's just no proprietary
at all but then you can export them to
things like Facebook so that you can
actually share a manipulatable file so
if you posted on Facebook people can
still in the flash player just be like
dude and that's that's the craziest
thing like all my friends who weren't
even familiar with this they're like how
did you do that picture right that's the
that's the oh my OMG OMG yeah it's
really excited these so anybody who
pre-ordered these are supposedly
learning to ship I have not gotten my
nose like a medical check right now I go
check on that coming but they should be
arriving I think soon you know within
the next few days yeah I ordered them
they said in the u.s. Friday the people
start receiving their first units and
it'll trickle out i think
internationally it's gonna be a little
different but initially its they're
pumping these guys out so this is our
scene at one i purchase my own just to
let you know i'm not just kind of blue
when i got the blue one too you did yeah
because 499 is a little to burn a dance
yes 399 I can handle before 90 and I was
like all right but this is not the only
gadget this week actually Mobile World
Congress has it has already delivered
some interesting devices the HTC One X
and the nokia pureview 41-megapixel
phone but then now the phone that has
everybody going gaga today the PadFone
the asuste padfone this is bonkers hit
me anyway the sous are the people behind
the transformer prime which as you know
was like the tablet that could easily
come become a laptop this assu spat
phone kind of takes the idea of the
motorola atrix 4g which could dock into
a little laptop station one step further
because this can dock into an actual
little tablet and then power a 10-inch
tablet and also a laptop dock for this
is this is the ultimate transformer
right yeah this this this is amazing
it's the do everything phone what's
crazy also is when you dock the can't
the phone into the tablet it uses the
camera on the phone as the camera for
the tablet I thought that was just kind
of like so like oh that's cool it's so
clever and then you can use the the
tablet or the laptop to make calls using
the integrated speakerphone or the
bluetooth headset you don't want to hold
up the tablet to your face because that
looks pretty funny but yeah it's pretty
it's this is pretty slick and its but
its innovative I think it's a really
clever way to address the fact that
everybody's kind of using their phone in
some cases as their only device these
days yeah now yeah here's a cool video
of its you can see I know yeah it's like
really hard to understand exactly the
picture
and unfortunately they didn't show it
doc inside this thing so right now just
to it then okay it just looks like a
laptop right now that's the tablet there
that's docked on top of the keyboard and
in the back of the tablet you can shove
the phone into it so it's pretty cool
I'm sure that the accessories job it is
cheap by the way but you want to
carefully set that in there and think is
actually a more accurate we can get with
that bar it's pretty interesting ah
pending shipment okay see now she's
gonna dock it in there for listeners
we're showing the demo where a hinge
kind of opens up that fits the phone and
then you pop it in and then you go the
tablet and the doctor that I talk pretty
cool stuff love it all right Steven this
is your time to shine my man let's do
that moving on hey okay cool so this is
my video pic of the week or the month as
we can call it this one comes to us from
the University of Pennsylvania general
robotics automation sensing and
perception lab otherwise known as grasp
well good name they put out all these
great videos of quadcopter robots doing
specific tasks that they programmed them
to do I can't say the specific task
that's hard to try saying infinitely
mama mama what was over in vanity label
label specific tasks yeah so um so this
is I did that with Invisalign that is
impressive it might have helped you
actually probably yeah anyway okay so
this is a more proof of how we are going
to be killed in the future by robots
from the sky death from above this these
guys made a video basically what they
did is they program these quadcopter
robots to perform they program 10 of
them to perform in tandem a song
double-oh-seven so check this out it's
really interesting watch this we can
listen to them whoa I have not seen it
looks like bees right they like these
I've seen this hate it I like the guy so
they're so scary I mean they're Google
very right oh no what is that thing on
the left side
there's to keep their like the most
adorable little jazz band in the world
oh so these these guys look like about
the size of what maybe half a soda can
right quad copters yeah yeah they're
really small further proof that they're
going to be programmed to kill us all
Wow future all right let's say you get
sick and have a thick and perform
double-oh-seven together as a team then
imagine what I was thinking you guys for
people listening you guys gonna have to
check this out but literally the
individual quadcopters are either
hitting a key on a keyboard running like
a you know a metal thing against like
notes like a long extended Harper saying
or like on a symbol or audible guy it's
crazy it's crazy here's the end the big
finishes oh my god sound does a guitar
that's amazing i'm better glacier howdy
in the chatroom says they're appearing
at coffee shops in portland through
April I was in moral in this as Duncan I
love pork that's amazing you guys gotta
go watch that of Portland all right we
do me on the show notes so please check
it out i'll put that video on the show
definitely do all right we gotta keep
moving we got voicemails go lower
our first caller points out that Google
doesn't even care about being fair hey
bol crew um I was just thinking about
microsoft and Google's little fight with
with the video coding and I think Google
is still going to be asking for the 22
dollars because Microsoft is taking five
dollars of every android phone that sold
so I think what they're really wanting
is to get their five bucks back and
they'll probably drop the 22 $22
prescription so I just thought I'd throw
that in there keep up the good work
fight yeah we were talking about the
coupon we were talking out sure any show
how that cuz not and also i just love
that concept that it's that they're just
like they're like the better off dead
kid I want my five dollars five dollars
$22 we're gonna break even or what let's
just do this let's just knock this out
just make it happen and forget about all
the other companies involved crying out
loud it's a good point all right and
then we got we have to give this next
music service in to do because it has so
so many fans and so many people want to
leave a note in that this is our answer
to the music service that we really want
hey Brian and Molly this is Nathan for
Portland what you guys were talking
about a subscription service for music
that gives you pretty much everything
you want like a Spotify but streaming
downloading purchasing I know it's not
integrated into everything but Molly the
Windows Phone you would have bought a
zoom past which you know Microsoft of
changing it windows 8 but they have
their zoom past you can download stream
you can easily purchase music you can
easily hit their smart j playlist the
software it gives you once you like
enough music than so it knows what
you're gonna pay start gives you like
listeners or like minded or whatever you
know what i mean like
bum like you know I mean things like
that it's like what she's lying I kept
eating anyway love the show but
everybody always talks about Spotify
June past nine ninety-nine a month all
you can listen to you all you can
download he goes on for a little longer
to tell us again how awesome it is but
everyone always says that about zune
pass and I have to say you know what
Microsoft should really do make an appt
Megan oh absolutely don't just limit it
to the platform let soon pass be the
ambassador for the coolness of the
Windows platform by making an appt allah
kindle and amazon and when because if i
could subscribe to zune pass and then
have an app on my iphone like that would
be great microsoft would get my money
and then maybe I would be like this
microsoft thing is really cool like how
I really like my Kindle so I'm always in
a buy a kindle fire well the trick is
with zoom past though you can also buy
music so they would have to limit the
app to just be like a streaming app
which would then limit the fact that
their service is more than that and
because if you want to purchase songs
right you can't do it on iOS they limit
you from that that's apples they don't
let you purchase songs through on
another app so you can either go back to
Windows Phone or you know maybe an
android phone Molly but not an iphone
also lily HC points out in the chat room
that it's not all you download that
Microsoft to discontinue the downloading
part discontinued and Tim Beck says
Microsoft's killing the zune when
windows 8 comes huh so I guess we'll see
and I'm taking cool pictures with my
light rail streaming app though at least
like if I just want the subscription
part there could at least be a streaming
up yeah totally alright let's do some
email real quick we have a pretty we
have tmobile lovers and haters Jim
savage writes in and says last week you
guys are talking about the fourth
quarter t-mobile customer defections and
as it caused you blamed it on them
having no iPhone really bol really it's
not like the first iphone just came out
are you saying that t-mobile customers
only learned of the iphone when Verizon
and Sprint picked it up I know you're
becoming more and more alpha iphone
centric but the world does not revolve
around Apple k to that first part of the
email i would just no point out that
iphone 4s sales would seem to suggest
that we're right yes it's like not about
it but it's like maybe 18 d didn't have
a good service in their area
they were locked into contracts or
whatever like more availability leads to
more demand yeah it's a combination of
those things but you can't deny that the
iphone was part of that stuff yeah so I
think an absolutely what he also write
like how he was gonna leave like Dale
says yeah that he's a happy customers
never had any problems with t-mobile and
he was happy that 18-2 didn't buy them
but when his contract ends in march
he'll be leaving it shows there's no
because there's no future and staying
with tmobile because they seem intent on
selling the company and that's an
unknown that i don't like thinking about
nobody he wants to buy the galaxy note
on sprint I'm really enjoying this right
now i know i'll just make the next email
cuz you i'm taking you're gonna
appreciate the picture i took of you
guys give you like look i have a light
