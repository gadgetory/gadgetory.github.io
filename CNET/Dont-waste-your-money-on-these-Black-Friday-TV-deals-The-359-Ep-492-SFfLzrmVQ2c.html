welcome to good morning everybody to the
3:59 podcast CNET's daily news podcast
on November 20th it's episode 492 you
got Ben Fox Rubin today and special
guest friend of the show Tana Katz Meyer
hey I am here before the man that knows
all things about all TV's so today's
podcast we're gonna talk all about TVs
during the holiday season we've got cats
Meyer here to run through an epic amount
of information the adjustment in just
four minutes yeah we'll try to cram in
as much as we can send in whatever
questions and comments you want to share
with David and I'll just kind of sit
here and relax while he answers the
questions after the podcast right either
way without further ado let's get to the
podcast and we'll see you in three
minutes and 59 seconds start hitting us
up with any questions and comments you
got about buying TVs it's coming Black
Friday and we'll see you back in the
chat in three minutes and 59 seconds
from three - welcome to the 359 I'm Ben
Fox Ruben I'm David Katz Maya the
holiday shopping season is upon us which
means consumers will have a lot of deals
to sift through so cats how many of
these deals specifically for TVs are
basically crap about a hundred and forty
two and I say that kind of
scientifically because we actually went
through and looked at 151 deals and 142
of them are probably not worth it know
you and and I'll tell you what happens
that all these retailers throw up TVs of
you know ridiculously epic cheap prices
so yeah if you want an eighty dollar 32
inch TV not the worst place to spend
your money a 32 inch TVs are generally
junky but what people looking for is you
know good living site living room sized
TVs at a good price so I have a few that
I can recommend top of the list of the
Vizio e-series that thing starts 443
inches at 310 dollars so that's not
there are cheaper 43 inch TVs out there
and you can jump over somebody you know
at Best Buy to get one but that's a
really good TV goes at full-array local
dimming we are
that the best home theater worthy of the
cheapest home theater worthy TV of the
year that's a great TV and it goes all
the way up to 70 inches again for 750
bucks yeah so those are really good
prices for a TV that performs very well
and then there's a TV that my favorite
TV of the year the TCL six series which
I just bought this morning thanks to you
individually cope coincidental yeah so
that TV is great
that's my editors choice superb picture
quality better than the E Series
definitely worth the step up in price
Ben you didn't get ripped off it's a
wonderful TV 55 inches for what is it
six would you pay six thirty six thirty
on Amazon yeah yeah yeah I mean and it's
got the Roku built in which rack rate so
anyway those are my two real value picks
and you know you see cheaper TVs out
there from LG and Samsung they're not
gonna perform any better LG and Samsung
make some great TVs but they cost more
money than these so again if you want a
really good cheap TV those are the ones
I recommend I've been hearing these
words come out of your mouth a lot these
days full array local dimming yeah for
the folks at home why don't you explain
to us what that means and why it's
important so basically a LCD screen has
a bunch of LEDs behind it and those can
turn on and off independently on a TV
with full array of dimming on most LCD
TVs especially the cheap ones they all
turn on and off at the same time of
course the benefit is with this
localized dimming and brightening you
get much better pop much better contrast
to something like HDR which all these
TVs have but only ones with full array
local dimming do really well and of
course OLED TVs do really well so that's
really what it does it improves contrast
and that's the the most important
ingredient picture quality let's talk
about OLED so LG makes him really good
OLED they basically were like look we
know you guys want to buy this TV so
we're gonna cut the price by like twenty
dollars yeah during the holidays are
there other allege that I we should be
paying attention to or this is really
the one to beat at this point yes so
again OLED TVs right now the cheapest
one is sixteen hundred bucks for the 55
inch size that's what I expected but I'm
obviously not on the market yeah exactly
that's and and the price drop is a lot
less than I thought it would be so what
LG did this year is they didn't do those
steep discounts that everybody's hoping
for so yeah if you want to spend you
know it's still the lowest prices ever
been
well actually the lowest price been this
year last year was actually cheaper so
you know they're not really coming down
in price the LCDs are the ones that you
know again give you that really really
good picture quality not as good as OLED
but they'll give you the best bang for
the buck this time of year so the was it
the LG that's as low as $1600 this year
or is it somebody else no that's that's
LG and LG is always gonna have the
cheapest OLED TVs just because they're
the ones that make all the panel's so
you know that's a really good television
it's our editor's choice for the
high-end markets 2500 for the 65 inch
but again those prices are not gonna be
world-shattering you're not getting a
great sale price on those I was hoping
for like 2 grand for the 65 which would
be a really really good price but that
hasn't happened yet maybe it will you
know who knows maybe LG won't sell any
and they'll want to come it down bring
it down but right now again the best
value is in the LCDs so with the little
time we have remaining let's let's run
through maybe one other important
feature set one of them a piece of
technology hopefully that people should
pay attention to if they want a future
proof their device like what should they
look at so we talked about fuller a
local dimming they're really high
quality but with Smart TV I really like
Roku TV operating system they do a
really good job of making all these apps
really easy to use and you know again
it's very frequently updated and it's
it's one of these systems that you know
that's what Roku does they make TVs easy
to use they make streaming easy to use
on these TVs so if you have a choice
between two TVs that look very similar
when I was a Roku one it doesn't I'd say
go with the Roku nice all right if you
want to read more about these stories
check them out on CNET I'm Ben Fox Ruben
David Katz Mayer thanks for watching
that was so much more specific than I
thought it should I actually go and just
know all right everybody thanks for
joining us for the recording of the
audio podcast if you've got great
questions about what TVs are available
right now different feature sets David
Katz Meyer is your man I got a question
for you David so there are a myriad of
options out there with giant gorgeous
screens
hmm help someone like me who as much as
the giant screen is wonderful might not
fit in my apartment and as TVs are
becoming larger in their standard forms
how do I go about shopping for something
that's a little more compact so it
depends on how compact you mean like I
said the 43 inch Vizio e-series that's
kind of that's pretty small these days
and that's 310 bucks at that size that's
my pick I know you want to go smaller
Brian yeah for four for shits and
giggles why not so actually I said
that's the topic 32 inch TVs are
basically like who cares they're they're
a dime a dozen
they're pretty quality's not gonna be
much different from one brand to the
next so again you can get really cheap
ones my pick right now is a Roku TV like
I talked about 130 bucks for a 32 inch
size mic it down a little less expensive
than that but that makes that one that
one's TCL okay so and again you're not
going to get good picture quality at
that size the best picture quality
improvement or gonna get is when you go
to a 43 inch size so I would stop
strictly on price lower than 43 inches
so and that's because with the smaller
devices they're just not able to cram as
much tech into them and/or it's not
really even it's not as big of a market
yeah I mean it's it's mainly because
they the competition is so rough down
there that they stop making good small
TVs a while ago and even Vizio which is
you know they're bringing these foolery
local dimming prices to you know to a
lower price point they're they stopped
at 43 inches which is actually pretty
good last year I think their lowest size
was 50 inches so again that's
everybody's concentrating all the
manufacturer concentrating on the
quote-unquote larger TVs which are
fifty-five inches in up uh hunter is
asking about a 21-inch you can even go
that small again I would shop on price
you know it did Roku does I think the
TCL s 305 series goes down to twenty one
you see the 21 or 24 and that's an
awesome TV again when you're in these
tiny like living room and bedroom
situations it's really nice to have the
built-in smart TV because one you have
to juggle a second remote you're not
like in a full you know home theater
situation where you got all those other
equipment anyway it's generally just the
TV and having everything built in for
that one TV especially in a secondary
room is really convenient alright let's
take some questions from the audience
Timothy do asks how many years would you
recommend getting a new HDTV I'm
guessing he means like how many years in
between jumping to get your upgrades as
long as you can I still have a 10 year
old TV at home it's great you know it's
a plasma with great picture quality I
haven't felt the pressing need we're
sorry we're still hanging on to him as
much as we can but yeah III wouldn't
it's not like a phone okay I'll put it
that way you don't I never feel the need
to upgrade some people do you know but
they just have money to burn TVs are
expensive I would buy a good one and you
know expected to last for a while if
he's talking about reliability it's all
over the map
you know these TVs again you can expect
them to be five or ten years before they
die basically and you know that's that's
that's it's a wide range but you know
they're again they're gonna last longer
than in terms of going obsolete they're
not gonna go up salute they're there
they're gonna stick around and produce a
really good picture for a long time
right and unlike a phone you're not
moving it around all the time you're not
you know it's not a touchscreen you're
not touching it all over the place so
that obviously significantly increases
its lifespan that it's arguably it's
sitting in the same place most of the
time right until your switch controller
like flies against it destroys it but so
you use your little you know wrist
holders please yeah very important and I
saw that happen once in college so yeah
we modes yeah I've only seen that on
YouTube I am impressed that you saw that
like live in person I would have paid to
see that this is what
ones are really light but back was that
a glass Brian was that like a plasma
screen oh no it was it was a cruddy old
CRT but we still made it happen oh yeah
all right next questions coming in from
V chord V code are oo7 will Vizio PQ 65
f1 be back in stock what would you
recommend as an alternative if it's not
great question that's my number one
question perhaps you for pointed out so
I really recommend the P series quantum
it's a great TV for $1400 65-inch so we
were talking about those oh let
alternatives before for the high end
that's my number one pick right now of
course it's out of stock everywhere at
that price it normally was for 2100 so
that's a crazy awesome price and that's
well before Black Friday yes though they
started early and you know the people
that we're paying attention decided they
were like we're not gonna get weight
we're just gonna buy this thing yep so
to answer your question no idea I've
actually asked Vizio yesterday and again
today whether I even added them just now
on Twitter so maybe they'll get back to
me and let me know when these things are
expected back but they know you know
it's a really good seller and they know
it's a great price so who knows an
alternative the normal Vizio P series is
very good but I think the best step down
alternative to that is actually about
TCL six series it has superb picture
quality it's not going to be as good as
the quantum you know I gave the the six
series and eight in picture quality the
quantum got a nine always get a 10 to
give you some reference but that six
series again for nine hundred bucks
right now for the 65 inch at Best Buy
superb television unless you're you know
a real video quality hound you know
you're not gonna be disappointed by the
picture and you know the quantum is
amazing but you know if you can't find
it you really want a new TV either wait
a little bit for to come back in stock
or or jump on that TCO right and I would
probably say the way that the market
works these days it probably will come
back in stock later in a season probably
not at that price exactly they probably
realized these are selling like hotcakes
what was it a 1440 that's $700 it's like
what thirty five percent off right so
they're they probably realized they
could they don't have to offer it at
that same price again so unfortunately
if you miss the boat this time you
probably miss the boat and I don't know
maybe next year or
you really love to the TV buy it
slightly higher when it does come back
in stock yeah that's a good point
let's talk accessories getting away from
picture quality for just a second
Josh has a last gen chromecast would it
be worth upgrading to the new model
assuming you mean the puck circle size
absolutely not I'll do the same thing
the new chromecast was the most fake
upgrade ever like it all it is is like
its mat now a new color
yeah it's less colors than is less came
in like coral and all these weird colors
before now it's just black and white
they phoned it in on that update don't
even bother
good answer if we're gonna talk about
accessories and functionality David
wants to know what your feelings are on
smart TVs at this point most TVs are
going pretty smart am i right I mean the
features are just kind of coming
standard but if you're not already there
like myself when do you think is a good
time to make that jump for the
additional functionality so again I'll
go back to my original answer window
upgraded TV the best way to upgrade a
Smart TV is to buy a Roku a little
streamer that starts at 20 bucks for
Black Friday and goes up to you know 50
for their 4k HDR one my favorite
streamer you can put on any TV it'll
basically infuse your old cruddy TV with
amazing new streaming you can get a fire
TV to Amazon's fire TV has done a really
good job with voice if you're in Alexa
head but that's the best way to make
your old TV you know less sake first
streaming so why don't you also we were
talking about the side of the podcast
why don't you walk us through some of
the a variety of the Smart TVs and who
does a better job than others well again
like I said Roku is the best in terms of
overall Smart TV functionality Vizio is
the worst so in that middle area you'll
find bold fire TV Amazon makes those
televisions picture quality's nowhere
near something like the TCL six series
but they throw a fire TV on there it's
okay
I think Samsung actually does the best
job of all the guys that develop their
own operating system and the newer
Samsung's are very very good the the
issue there is updating so you know
they're not necessarily motivated in the
same way that
or even an Amazon to continually roll
out these features updates what they
want to do is sell you a new TV and if
your TV starts sucking and and and you
know the the Smart TV works bad that's
what I really like the Samsung but the
Smart TVs bad let's just buy another so
you know they're good LG is good they
have that we've talked about a Wii
Remote that's pretty cool on they boat
they all do a really good job right now
with the current generation so you're
buying a brand new one there's very
little reason unless you need like a
special app or something like that
the exception is Vizio who Smart TV is
as I've been saying for years terrible
but you know when you are ranking these
things you can always go you know what I
really like that vizio tv let me buy a
50 dollar Roku and put it on there and
be in you know a really good place hmm
makes sense
next question comes in from American
princess when will 80s c 3.0 come out
ooh
so ATSC 3.0 is the latest generation of
the over-the-air broadcast spectrums
over they broadcast standard they're
talking about 2020 now so supposed to do
like better digital quality well a lot
of his data tracking surprising right
they're gonna sighs yeah well there's I
mean of course there's video quality
stuff you can do a K and whatever um but
they're also saying maybe some better
reception but it's it's really about
two-way data and they're also they also
want to you know compress their
bandwidth to sell off more spectrum to
wireless guys that actually make money
like cell phone providers ones lousy
sound good it is technically better um
you know you can get some improvements
we don't know yet I mean it could be I
mean and I'm expecting it to at least be
as good as ATSC 2.0 which is your
current over-the-air television again
you'll get improved video quality with a
KL get potentially HDR all these things
so that is potentially good we just
don't know but that's been one of the
big things is is that is the data
tracking the ability to you know
basically phone home and tell everybody
what you're watching which is it gets
them up to date with the streamers maybe
I was in 2020 there might be some really
crazy
we're gonna follow your eye movements
yeah yeah there's there's gonna be the
ATSC broadcast guys are inevitably gonna
be slower than any of the internet you
know base guys that's just how it is but
yeah maybe 2020 we'll see let's talk
about burn-in Jay and David are both
asking about burnin for OLED no what are
your thoughts on that so you maybe
they've been watching some videos on
YouTube there's a lot of that I mean
we've been saying this for years if you
were burning in an OLED TV you're trying
really hard and a lot of people let me
let me back that up I think a lot of
people leave their televisions on MSNBC
or Fox News or CNN for days and days on
end and they have that little logo
burned into the lower left-hand corner
if you're gonna watch TV like that don't
get an oled unless it's a C net logo
burn it in the lower corner right it's
not even possible and then get a do some
net tattoo yeah we do now okay this
right thing to do is just to burn in oh
let's but it but if hopefully you're
turning off your TV at night and and and
doing the normal stuff and for example
letterbox bars aren't gonna burn it in
they're much more resistant to burnin
than plasma was anecdotally I've never
seen a case personally and you know I've
never I haven't gone into stores and
look for them because that's where you
seen a lot and a lot of people say
gaming if you game maybe 18 hours a day
and never turn off your TV and have the
little HUD in up in the upper left for
the same game that might do it there's a
really good test being run right now by
another website and they've done a
really good job of kind of tracking it
they haven't seen massive stuff but
there have been some evidence of it when
you you know again leave these static
images on a screen right I say if you're
watching normal TV get a know that we
have a much longer description of all
this stuff on Sina if you want to dive a
little bit deeper but the end of the day
it's not a big concern for a lot of
people alright next questions coming in
from Myra
so is OLED better nowadays we're looking
for a TV we play lots of games online
and watch a lot of streaming apps which
TV would be good specifically what's
good for a team bedroom or like a
preteen bedroom maybe like a maybe I'm
guessing they're looking for a smaller
cheaper option okay so that covered from
OLED to a teen
bedroom first of all don't put your
$2,500 TV in your kids bedroom please
unless you're well okay maybe you want
to but if you can't afford that again I
go back to the TCL Roku TV s for the
smaller bedroom screen sizes again like
21 inches they start at they go up to 43
those are non 4k 480p sorry 1080p TVs
720 on the smaller sizes they're
perfectly good they got great streaming
you know and they're really really cheap
and then you can go if you want good
picture quality stuff up to the Vizio
e-series again starts at 310 bucks for
the 43 inch size great television but
again these Roku's are pretty fine for
you know your kids your kids bedroom you
and for gaming as well Aaron Johnson
asks I have a question regarding cheap
smart TVs I noticed some TVs like the
Samsung's
only have two HDMI ports would you have
to add an HDMI extender to add ports or
other devices do those things even exist
I've never seen anything like that and
let me just say imagine if Apple made a
TV I have one of those where you add
more HDMI port yeah yeah a lot of I'm
like one of the only people in the world
that still has a blu-ray player yeah I
have a blu-ray player a Playstation 4 my
Roku and I have an older TV that only
has two ports so it's actually not that
hard I just bought one of them that adds
an additional two ports and it
automatically shifts them over it just
it knows which one you're using most of
the time so you don't even have to find
the remote to toggle over to the next
one yeah and those are those are
perfectly fine if you again if you want
to don't replace your TV if you run it
up or it's go to Amazon and Google you
know HDMI switch or whatever that will
get you a bunch of results and they're
all cheap and a lot of them do 4k HD are
they're pretty popular with a new TV I
wouldn't worry about it too much again
especially if you're doing a lot of
streaming for the built-in streaming is
good you know then you don't need to buy
a streamer for example to attach to it
the game console and the cable box are
two common things that you do buy a HDMI
you know you're going to need ports for
that too is usually plenty but you know
I wouldn't just disqualify a TV based on
that you got to go with what you
actually
and figured out that being said I guess
with two ports that's usually the
smaller TVs but you have a lot of the
questions that we're getting even the
cheap ones you know like again Samsung
and LG with these back Friday TVs
they'll chop ports off you know just to
see how much money it's saving yeah you
know and and and a lot of that is maybe
to induce you to boards slightly more
expensive Samsung or LG or Vizio
whatever it is to get that extra port so
there's a lot of a lot of stuff out
there but again you can usually solve
those problems if you're willing to put
up with a little bit of hassle by
attaching one of these switches on there
mmm all right Katz hypothetical your TV
just blew up and you have to buy one on
this coming Black Friday Vizio P series
Vizio e-series or TCL six what wins your
money
TCL six but I would actually save up and
buy an OLED because I feel like I yeah
you're a TV guy I'm a TV guy I would put
it on a zero percent card and you know
pay for it a couple years from now
whatever things you know get the points
and stuff it would be it would be it
would be rough you know I'd be a tough
conversation to have with my wife but
yeah that's how much better the picture
quality is right like it's that
noticeable I I love it I you know again
these LCDs are very good but I would
probably kick myself in a couple months
if I didn't get an OLED when I had the
chance and so that's what I would get
you know I get the the current editors
choice the b.a.p for 2,500 bucks for the
65 inch but you know again between those
three I do like TCL best the Vizio P
series though is I'll put this in right
now it's on my list just because it
comes in a 75 inch size that those ones
know so TCL maxes out at 65 you want to
get crazy huge that's it all for sixteen
hundred bucks right now at Best Buy
and that's a great price for a massive
TV that has amazing picture quality at
75 inches so the Vizio P is is really
good at that size all right digging for
another question here let's take one
from Storm King I'm looking for a new TV
I have a sanyo a 32 inch with an actual
picture tube is it time for me to jump
to the 2017 model yeah you know again
maybe maybe I'm content
myself because I say don't buying TV
unless you have picture to you too yeah
I think it's a CRT yeah he's talked
about us here I didn't know those were
stole or if nothing else storm king love
the name if you buy that TV you will get
you know 2x the size which is the best
piece of advice that I can give for
anybody shopping for a TV buy as big of
a TV as you can if you're buying thing a
particular size this is for you Brian to
maybe get something a little bigger it
really you know you'll eventually go
okay wow I'm glad I did that instead of
man I wish my TV was a little bit bigger
so that's you know with these LCD TVs
they're they're a lot bigger than the
CRTs used to be back in the day and it
makes a huge difference just for that
alone and again they're so dirt cheap
one hundred thirty bucks for a 32 inch
that'd be a pretty good place to start
for that TCL you know in someone who's
just upgrading from CRT so I bed sorry
yeah that was somebody else calling you
for advice yeah yeah we're just the
phones are ripping through I ran off
with my vibrating this whole time but
yeah if my TV got any bigger I'd have to
double as a dinner table when do you
think when do you see Smart TVs fully
integrating Google home hub as part of
the chromecast functionality mmm I love
a question maybe next year um I I think
Google is motivated to keep some of that
functionality on the smaller screen and
I think it does make a lot of sense on
the smaller screen the recipe stuff all
that you know the kitchen stuff but I'd
love to see for example the live photos
make the jump to chromecast and you know
Android TVs which are also that sounds
so easy like you would think that would
make so much sense to just do yeah yeah
and maybe they already have
don't quote me on that but you know
that's really cool and you know there's
a lot of home hub stuff for the Smart TV
like the thing about a home hub is that
it's got a built in you know Google home
speaker right so there aren't any right
now TVs with the built-in Alexa speaker
or you know Google no eager yet they
well we both did a briefing with Amazon
specifically about the fire TV cube
which for one thing motivates Google to
try to stay
in the entertainment game at the same
time with Amazon because they're both
really fighting over various elements of
smart home and that's also that's
basically like getting Amazon lady which
is what we call her on the show yes yes
getting getting that as close as you can
to your television that's that's the
primary point of the fire TV cube and I
think it's also on sale for Black Friday
a pretty good price
yeah it's 60 bucks right there basically
they just try to like throw out their
devices Mashable there they're getting
pretty close to doing that but yeah if
you have any interest in getting a fire
TV cube that's a really good price for
it and I like that product a lot that's
a cool product but yeah they haven't yet
taken that obvious step of building the
lady into a TV yet which I feel like
maybe it'll happen next year we wouldn't
be surprised to see somebody maybe it's
Google who decides to take that leap and
say you know what screw it we're gonna
make the Google home TV and it's gonna
be 55 inches and blah blah blah to your
point though as far as adding smarts to
your existing television with like a
stick yep you can do a very similar
thing with just an echo dot or in Google
home Mini which those are also gonna be
on sale for like $25 during the holiday
so also not a reason to run out and get
a new television if all you really need
to do is add a dot or a mini to your
living room that's what we have at home
we have the TV in the living room and a
dot you know basically close to there
and actually works better if you have a
dot closer to your mouth instead the TV
speaker because that's one of the things
that they had to re-engineer for the
fire TV cube it's designed to sit next
to the TV and there's a lot of other
sound coming in there especially when
you're saying the wake word you know to
get it to mute everything and get ready
for your command I mean that's that's
one of the the issues with having the
speaker built into the TV because that's
got to be able to you know filter out
all that that's a good point actually I
wonder if that's one of the limitations
that they're you bumping up against
right now yeah yeah they'll figure it
out those guys at Amazon they're smart
cookies yeah all right in Google we're
winding down towards the end let's take
a couple more what's your preferred
audio choice as an audiophile atmos or
DTX
for me it's DTS and DTX all the way
that's coming in from
all right Tim I wouldn't want to
disabuse you of that and honestly I
don't have you know the latest and
greatest height based object based 7
plus speaker surround system at my house
so I couldn't give you a real good
answer a lot of it does vary on content
you know some some discs and and
services and streaming movies blah blah
blah have one or the other and I know in
Hollywood you know a lot of these guys
are mastering with Atmos Netflix for
example is doing a crap ton of stuff
with Atmos so yeah it usually depends on
you know the content itself so I
couldn't tell you one way or the other
and if you like DTS X good Anja next
question is coming in from Moose Mustafa
is Samsung cool ed worth it well there's
a lot of cool Ed's mr. mostafa Wow what
do you think about culet versus OLED
though I think you and I have had this
conversation is for LED so Q light is
Samsung's marketing term for their LCD
TVs it does actually refer to a
technology called quantum dots they've
been using it I think to make people
think that their OLED TVs because when
you look at similar they're little
things there's just a little thing
easier you know and yeah but you know
what we've been writing that for last
couple years if it's versus OLED
trounces it it's it's a completely
different technology OLED is emissive
it's great from off angle it's got
perfect black levels yada-yada-yada
Q LED has some advantages it can get
very very bright for example and there's
I mean I gave a really good review to
the q8 earlier this year I'm looking at
the q9 it's been a long time coming if
anybody's keeping track it won't get
there eventually that's there those are
their flagship high-end culet TVs
they're really really good they have
full array local dimming but the q6 and
q7 don't so they have less effective
local dimming and and their picture
quality is generally not as great and I
didn't review them this year but I'm
pretty confident as saying that they're
not gonna be as good as for example this
TCO 6 series one more coming in last
minute here what's the next version of
OLED I'm guessing some Japanese company
possibly testing it right now is there
wait a minute looks like that hasn't
even gone downstream yet we're already
talking about the next one
well there are I could talk about that
too there's how long my been in this
field been what's that how long have you
been in the field of tech okay you're
right sure you're talking about solely
right we don't even have 5g yet people
already talking about six that's right
that's right what about our 8g yeah I
need my email poured in my brain thanks
Samsung 8k is here um but I mean if
you're asked about what's gonna succeed
it in a couple of years that's micro LED
Samsung actually started selling it's
crazy expensive commercial only a
hundred and forty four inch micro LED
thing which is basically like a
scoreboard you know at a game that's the
technology it's a whole bunch of little
lights that are hella bright and they've
gotten really small and that's cool in
2020 or 2024 right along side ATSC three
if you're talking about
oh let itself who's gonna get it next
that's a great question because right
now it's basically in the United States
it's LG and Sony they're there and
Sony's licensing LG's panels LG's the
only guys that can still manufacture it
at large screen size is Samson right
Samsung makes a lot of all LEDs they
even make OLED for Apple but that's on
the smartphone side yes
not for TVs yeah the Samsung no LEDs are
wonderful in phones and you know David
everybody's using them now but they're
the Samsung does not make a large screen
all it and I don't think they're going
to they basically said we're gonna skip
that technology and go straight to micro
LED and so that's their marketing name
maybe they'll decide to make OLED who
knows but they actually did a while ago
curved anyway that other manufacturers
maybe Vizio maybe but there seem to be
pretty well wedded to their local
dimming of full array TVs in there at
the lower end of the market anyway Sony
again already makes OLED LG does and
there's not that many other people
Hisense I think even sells one now
that's a Chinese name
not many people heard of I should
probably study up on it and he's you
know best buy some time yeah yeah
they're very inexpensive they're in the
TCL range and t-cell itself may or may
not but you know those are all
all that is basically where it's gonna
be I think for the foreseeable future
you don't see Samsung jumping on there
and maybe one of these other brands the
Vizio TCL Hisense will get one but you
know it's kind of a crapshoot at this
point and LG is gonna continue to make
them and they'll continue to be able to
give themselves the best pricing on
those sets and so I think their their
game now is to try and get as much
profit as they can out of OLED until it
gets you know with with micro LED from
what you know about pricing the Samsung
only selling it that super-high level
like sitting on our level
yeah it's not a real product right now
it's it's it's has it so expensive yeah
it's it's a brand new display too they
literally came out with it at CES last
year there was they told me was one
product in the world they kept shipping
around and showing it at their events
and and you know maybe they'll announce
a smaller size 144 inches doesn't fit
into many maybe there's a table at
Bryan's apartment that you know you can
sit everybody make it into the door
possibly well that's why it's modular
literally they have to make it oh yes
that was the law yes yeah that's that's
the TV that's like a Lego and you can
take it apart and put it back together
and you can make it even bigger he'll
not as well do a couple of them um but
that I think that's six figures so you
know who cares
um they are talking about bringing that
down to a 75 inch size the problem is
when you're shrinking scoreboard LEDs
think about it you got to make them
really really small and it's really hard
to get the heat working right and all
this stuff so there's actually movie
screen technologies that you direct view
LED like that already and Samsung makes
one Sony makes one called Cletus the
slackjaw yokel is that a joke no and
that's that was one of the coolest
things that's the yes a couple years ago
yeah 38 white foot-wide Cletus screen
I'm bringing a Simpsons reference into
the show you know that always makes my
day
anytime I was gonna make a Cletus line
but the only one that I remember it
comes from Bart if the song goes some
folks will never stop to something then
them some some folks are likely it is
the slack-jawed yo cool I'll wash myself
for the honesty that's that's why I said
it was barred I said it was future part
but it is prototype for Cletus
actually future Bart one of my favorite
part yes classic okay girls mortified by
that but real quick let's talk about a
brand we don't talk about very much
house Philips doing mmm Oh Philips
interesting Black Friday sales they're
big in Europe Philips is still
Netherlands based company although I
think there are American operations
we're taking over a while ago by a
Taiwanese company they still sell TVs in
the United States I haven't reviewed one
in a long time but yeah again they're
they're basically a European centric
brand right now alright and one more
what about picture and picture is that
making a comeback
hmm it's one of those things that people
seem to like back in the day that
doesn't exist anymore I know some cable
boxes you can do that you can you can
put two channels on at the same time the
little box although I've only ever used
it as a feature accidentally yes like
when you hit the button and it was just
it was just a noise on YouTube you know
and it like pops up that little sketch
you know I'm like just go away I don't
need that I'm not I'm not entirely sure
what the point of that feature was in
the first place it's like if you're
gonna watch the news watch the news well
I'm gonna watch a sports game watch a
sports it's because one channel is not
necessarily entertaining enough and if
you you definitely bored if you're only
watching one thing so this entertain
it's I think it's to keep track of two
football games for example it's really
cool those who are like Buffalo Bills
fans we need to have another picture of
somebody actually winning to make a feel
better okay
the other thing to consider i guess is
that p IP may have been killed by the
smartphone yeah because everybody does
two screens now whether they're on their
laptop and watching TV or other on their
phone doing something stupid or watching
like looking at twitter right and also
watching the game I'll throw that it
might have a resurgence with these
streaming services like PlayStation View
for example allows you to literally
watch four shows at once I think they
might even be a nonsense so because
they're streaming you know so they can
just give you whatever you want on the
screen and they have umpteen channels so
you can throw four on there at once or
two or whatever that's some neo Matrix I
know kung fu bullcrap well just
pointless it's it's if you have a lot of
money riding on four different football
games it's a really easy way to keep
track of your wins and losses real time
great so for the five people that that
matters - thank you very much
PlayStation video ok fine more than five
people yeah I mean like you know it's at
the bar I don't know I haven't done that
but yeah it's it's it's gone away
picture and pictures basically go on
from TVs you know replaced again
probably by phones and and maybe these
streaming things we just watched a mini
romance unfold in the chat from Stephan
events and from Steven Dougherty of
all-natural lemon and lime flavors which
might be the best screen name to ever
appear on this show Wow
some foam we can never eat a skunk and
then again some folks like you I Cletus
the slackjaw yokel you thought of like
the less savory one right right alright
we are way over time but hey it's worth
it cuz it's our last show of the week

surrounding the Thanksgiving holiday so
