some VR in the near future acer is
working on two different solutions at
once one meant for the home is a Windows
mixed reality headset cost three hundred
dollars a move available in the holidays
its lightweight and it's meant to work
with Windows apps so you can do work and
be in VR or mixed reality at the same
time we tried one on it's pretty
lightweight but unfortunately we can't
show you the whole experience yet
Acer's mixed reality Windows VR headset
is really more VR the mixed reality but
it uses a technology from hololens it
has cameras on the outside which means
that it can track you and allow yourself
to move around without any sensors to be
hooked up nearby less wires and it's
lighter weight on the other end of the
spectrum Acer is also working with star
VR to develop panoramic VR headsets
these are not going to be available to
buy they have a 210 degree viewing angle
which is larger than about the hundred a
degree or so that are in most VR
headsets it surrounds your eyes and goes
almost to the edges and it looks kind of
strange to put on and unfortunately it
doesn't work with most glasses it didn't
work with mine
Acer's mixed reality VR headset is going
to be joined by many others over the
holidays but star VR is going to be
meant for arcades showing that Acer and
a lot of VR companies are working in two
directions at the same time to try to
reach eyes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
