caiman has been my favorite Porsche
smaller and lighter and more agile than
the 911 it's also a little bit closer to
my budget so as you can imagine i got a
little weak in the knees when Portia
unveiled a special edition gt4 earlier
this year but now Porsche is going
straight from my heart with this a
limited edition club sport edition of
the Cayman gt4 it's a lightweight
race-ready edition of the gt4 with 385
horsepower at 60 more than the Cayman S
it puts that power down through a
dual-clutch gearbox not a six-speed
manual like in the GT for maybe a little
less engaging but certainly faster
around the track the car is 100 pounds
lighter than the gt4 Cayman and that's
despite a full welded in roll cage as
you might have noticed there's no
interior in there at all as a central
fire extinguisher system you can also
get an air jack useful for tire changes
of the track which is the only place
you're going to be driving this car it
is not road legal price on the car
you're looking at one hundred and sixty
five thousand dollars to start that's
about twice the cost of it came in GT
for about three times the cost in the
base Cayman out of my price range for
sure certainly is nice to dream
