look under the hood of Google's Chrome
OS how to travel through time in your
own time lapse videos top twitter trends
for 2010 and a set-top smackdown in this
week's prize fight it's all coming up
right now
hi everyone I'm Hollywood and welcome to
the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech and offer some unique tech
wisdom in the form of the bottom line
let's get started with the good last
week google gave us a glimpse of what's
to come in their new Chrome OS and as an
added bonus those in the audience got a
special google laptop the cr-48 so they
could try out the OS at home or more
likely back at the office here's Seth
Rosenblatt with his first look at the
new OS if you love chrome the browser or
about to fall in love with chrome the
operating system hi i'm seth rosenblatt
frisina download calm and in this first
look video i'll be showing you around
Google's beta release of the Chrome OS
there's not a whole lot new here chrome
OS feels and looks almost exactly like
chrome the browser the cr-48 google's
demo notebook prototype of what
consumers can expect in the summer of
2011 and the computer we've got here is
powerful enough that the operating
system wakes from sleep instantly
currently Chrome OS is running the
stable version 8 of the Chrome browser
and that's expected to change as the
browser updates extensions bookmark
settings anything that you've synced in
Chrome will be instantly available in
Chrome OS the settings window has been
expanded to accommodate the requirements
of a full operating system although
there doesn't seem to be a way to change
the clock to 24 hours Chrome Web Apps
play a big role in the Chrome OS the
apps become essential quick links from
your new tab window to your email your
productivity suite notepad instant
messaging video and voice calling and
other programs that most people are used
to being separate from the browser the
Chrome Web Store link it gets you access
to even more another nifty feature of
the operating system is the logon
procedure when you first open the laptop
it asks for your google user name and
password and then takes a photo of you
with a dedicated webcam Chrome OS
supports multiple accounts and has a
guest account option that opens the
entire OS in incognito mode Chrome's
tracklist browsing option the cr-48 lap
the only computer that currently ships
with chrome OS comes with keys that are
indelibly tied to an operating system
that's also a browser the function keys
have been replaced with dedicated
navigation buttons back forward refresh
full screen and next window controls yes
you can not only open a new browser tab
but a new window as well the caps lock
key has been replaced by a dedicated
search key that opens a new tab and puts
the cursor in the location bar you can
change this back to caps lock if you're
really into it there are a ton of hot
keys that have been mapped to this
laptop and they make a huge difference
hit ctrl alt and ? to see an overlay map
that reveals them all including ones for
taking screenshots revealing the task
manager and printing right now Chrome OS
is only available on the cr-48 laptop of
course you can download and install
Chrome OS is open-source parent chromium
OS on most laptops or desktops for cnet
with a first look at chrome OS i'm seth
rosenblatt now lots of people were
stunned by the news that google intends
to get rid of the caps lock key but
never fear holding down the shift key
with your pinky will let all those
psychos out there keep shouting in all
caps thank goodness of course you may
prefer the feel of a classic keyboard to
some of the more modern designs you find
on laptops or maybe it's just that old
timey clickety clack sound that you fell
in love with in either case Justin you
has one just for you
hi I'm just a new associate editor for
cnet.com with a first look at the das
keyboard model s professional keyboard
but before we get into the review here's
a brief history lesson on mechanical
keyboards the first IBM model m keyboard
was manufactured in the 1980s and
quickly became cult products with typing
purists that preferreds buckling spring
keys as opposed to the thin laptop keys
we type on today now as a result some
keyboard manufacturers like das keyboard
are making updated versions of the model
M that bring back the same mechanical
key switches and the click-clack sound
hence the term mechanical keyboard the
dots keyboard model s is finished in a
glossy black base and the frame is made
of a heavy plastic to withstand in
lifetime of typing and typing on the
dots keyboard is completely new if
you've never used a mechanical keyboard
before the secret is in the mechanized
switches underneath that give the right
amount of resistance and spring board
action that almost makes it feel like
the board is helping you type it's kind
of hard to describe but the clicky sound
also helps some people type faster than
normal and we actually notice a slight
improvement in typing speed and accuracy
after using it for just two weeks on the
other hand the noise may drive your
co-workers and roommates crazy so das
keyboard also has a silent model that's
exactly the same but sounds more like a
clack rather than a click again the $135
price tag may deter casual users that
see it next to fifty dollar models but
power typists and real nerds will find
comfort and nostalgia in its performance
you can read more in our full review on
cnet com but that's going to do it for
me I'm Justin you this is the dot
keyboard model s professional mechanical
keyboard and that feels pretty good to
me how awesome would it be if it had a
little belt it dinged whenever you got
to the end of the line what not cool at
all heck with you I still want that next
up we have a handy how-to for all you
budding experimental filmmakers out
there as antoine explains time-lapse
photography is a fairly simple process
but it can be quite time-consuming
luckily he also has some suggestions for
things you can do to amuse yourself
while you wait
now most of us have seen those cool
time-lapse videos that compress almost
imperceptibly slow events in the short
videos seemingly speeding up time before
your very eyes but how are they made and
more importantly could you make one on
your own I'm antuan goodwin with cnet
com and i'm here to show you how you'll
need a few things before you get started
a camera that can shoot still photos at
timed intervals we're using the gopro HD
hero photo editing software with a batch
edit function we're using efrain view on
the pc which can be found over on
download.com and some sort of video
software to stitch your photos together
in this video we're going to using
quicktime pro its cross-platform
software step one you're going to want
to familiarize yourself with your
camera's interval photography mode now
for some of you this will be as simple
as selecting a mode on your camera for
others it may mean taking advantage of
custom hardware software or firmware the
exact process for this step will vary
depending on the make and model of your
camera for this video we're going to be
using the gopro HD hero now load up an
empty SD card select the time between
the shots here we have the choice
between 25 10 and 30 second intervals
mount your camera depress the shutter
and go find something to do while the
camera snaps away now you could point
your camera at anything you'd like but
I'm a car tech editor so I am line out
of the windshield of the car on a trip
from LA to San Francisco step 2 once
you've got all your photos captured
you'll need to treat them however after
hours of shooting we have almost 5000 5
megapixel shots now that's way too big
of a picture for even the nicest HDTV on
the market and way too many photos to be
individually resizing you'll need to
find a way to betch process these photos
now you could use software like Adobe
Photoshop but we'll be using the free
oron view software on the pc from the
file menu select batch conversion rename
then navigate to the folder that
contains your images and add them all to
the batch now you'll need to do two
things under the best conversion setting
heading
like the advanced button in the dialog
box that appears check resize and set a
value for the long side of each image
then click canvas size and apply a value
to be cropped now what you're aiming for
is an HD friendly dimension of either
1280 by 720 pixels or 1920 x 1080 pixels
now the exact number that you're going
to use to get there will vary depending
on the image size captured by your
camera so you're going to need to do a
little math here we're going with a 1280
width and a 240 pixel crop for our 720p
video now select the folder for your
resized images click start batch and go
find something else to do while your
photos process step 3 once you've got
all your images resized up fire
quicktime pro and from the file menu
select open image sequence now navigate
to the folder that contains all of your
resized images select the first one
you'll have to select a frame rate here
we chose 24 frames per second click OK
and then go make yourself a cup of
coffee while QuickTime stitches the
image together into a video step 4 when
quicktime pro is done you'll have a
working preview of your time-lapse video
but you'll still have to export a final
file for use in other programs go to
file then export to bring up the export
menu now under option select size and
make sure your dimensions are set to
your liking now in addition to the HD
sizes there are also presets for mobile
devices like the iPhone so choose the
one that works best for you now give
your file a name and hit save you'll
probably want to go grab a movie or
something at this point because it's the
longest part of the process and can take
anywhere from several minutes to a few
hours depending on your computer's
processing horsepower once everything is
done you'll have a completed time-lapse
video that you can share with your
friends on video sites like YouTube or
Vimeo time-lapse photography is a great
way to document natural events like the
blooming of a flower or as we've done
here capture an entire road trip in just
a few minutes now these same steps can
also be applied to stop-motion
photography for those of you who want to
get in touch with your inner ray
harryhausen so there you have it
time-lapse photography in just a few
easy steps
I'm antuan goodwin with cnet com
okay I can't wait to try one of these
and I hope you do too just promise me
you won't make another video of animals
decomposing or food rotting because
please we get it it's gross December is
often a time for reflection as we look
back at the year that was ponder the
important moments of the past 12 months
and then write numbered lists of things
and put them on websites as Natali
Morris found out it's no different over
at Twitter where they've compiled a list
of the top twitter trends of the year
take a look the Gulf oil spill fifa
world cup and the movie Inception were
the top three trending topics on twitter
this year followed by the haitian
earthquake and the infamous vuvuzela on
monday twitter released its top trends
of 2010 they do this every year and
according to biz stone co founder of
twitter the results are always
surprising one of the things that
strikes me about these overall trends
when you look at things like you know
the the world cup for is a great example
i mean obviously that's going to trend
it highlights the fact that twitter can
it just makes the world seem that much
smaller the question is how much do
these twitter trends reflect what the
rest of America or the rest of the world
for that matter is thinking according to
a recent study only eight percent of
Americans who are online used Twitter
yet the number of people on twitter has
skyrocketed in the last two years if we
look at December of 2008 we had about
three million registered accounts on
Twitter on the whole service and
December of 2010 we now have over 175
million registered accounts and many of
those were done in
this past year with sixty-five percent
of accounts being created outside of the
united states twitter trends reflect a
global conversation josh lowensohn
editor of cnet explains people of
tragedy and they love celebrities and
they love lots of both so we're seeing
things like the oil spill and Justin
Bieber in massive quantities earlier
this year there were rumors that Twitter
had to buy more equipment to handle all
of the tweets about Justin Bieber turns
out that was not necessarily true I
think we had an ongoing measurement
called the beaver index which we were
measuring like you know the mentions of
beaver internally but we didn't actually
have any separate servers and if you
like that for CBS News I'm Natali Morris
cnet com in San Francisco of course we
here at cnet are preparing plenty of our
own year-end countdowns and
retrospectives will go easy on the
beaver but we will have a special cnet
tech review year in review coming up for
you next week but that's a whole week
away and we haven't even finished this
show yet so hold your horses we're going
to take a quick break right now but
we'll be right back with more tech
review right after this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on in the good dr. dre hasn't
put out a new album in years but somehow
he seems to have plenty of time to debut
a new set of headphones or earbuds every
couple of months just in time for
Christmas the pro edition of the monster
beats are the boldest set so far hey I'm
Julie Rivera and today we're going to
take a look at the monster beats pro by
dr.dre so far the most expensive pair of
headphones from the dr dre line the
first thing you'll notice it's a sheer
size of these things they're big and
they're heavy about an hour so of
continuous use the pros eventually cost
some discomfort and pinching despite the
leather like padding on the crown and
the earcups the large padded headband
which is not so subtly emblazoned with
the beats signature moniker attaches to
adjustable brushed aluminum sides ending
with full sized ear cups that rotates
upwards for storage the build quality is
solid and extremely durable I've knocked
it around a bit drop it a few times and
tossed it to the side once or twice and
barely a scuffle nor scratch has shown
up the beats pro featured input and
output audio ports on each earcup
allowing for some daisy chaining action
looks a little dorky but it beats
sharing that single earbud with your
friend on the train you guys know what
I'm talking about each earcup has a flip
of design rotate towards the back of the
head and you've got an ear available
remaining focused on your DJ set while
monitoring the outside environment each
ear pad is also removable in case you
want to swap them out for denser or
lighter ones in the future the single
red audio cable cord is thick and
rubberized with a very tightly coiled
section at the bottom to which quarter
inch gold-plated adapter is tethered to
the detachable cable locks into place on
the bottom of each earcup and can be
swapped to either side of the ear cups
as well one last thing we were surprised
to find that only a travel pouch was
included in the packaging as opposed to
a hardshell carrying case like the pros
predecessors with the 450 dollar price
tag we expect to have these babies
protected i'm julie rivera and this was
a first look at the monster he's pro by
dr dre
you hear that monster get that girl a
hard case for those headphones she's not
messing around and while you're working
on that let's check out the bed earlier
we saw the top five trends on Twitter
this year but who needs to wait for
december for a top 5 list Brian Cooley
has a new one every week take that biz
stone this week Brian's counting down
the top five places with the worst
reputations for protecting your social
security number unfortunately most of
them are worthless unless you're willing
to hand it over
top five worst entities to share your
social security number with unless of
course you just have too much money in
which case this video just got renamed
top five really cool ways to lighten up
your finances I'm Brian Cooley this list
was compiled by the folks at mcafee
security after they analyzed reports of
social security number breaches from
January 09 to october 2010 using data
from three major clearinghouses number
five any of those medical businesses
like those diabetes or invalid care
supply houses you see I'm advertising on
daytime TV we'll send it all to you and
bill Medicare turns out there leaky ER
than an off-brand adult diaper but note
this ranking is not the same as for
hospitals oh we're still going to get to
them number for the government yeah it
doesn't matter local state or federal
the folks who really ought to know
better are among the worst at protecting
your social security number a big part
of this is the huge number of systems
and agencies that collect and share all
that data how would they know what
they're doing with it they're not that
good at IT number three would be a
hospital yep and in their sick come out
a little less so but now broke and very
possibly with your ID ripped off by some
credit scammer small wonder that adverse
health events are a leading cause of
bankruptcy number two's ironic banks but
just try not giving them your social
security number no problem you can just
skip having things like bank accounts
credit cards mortgages direct deposit
just live off the grid in fact there's a
nice refrigerator box down in the alley
here by cnet you can set up housekeeping
there before we get to our number one
lousy 'used entity at preserving your
social security number know that you'll
find little help in the law when you
refuse to give it to that weird little
dude behind the counter at the local
video rental place federal law throws
you to the Wolves saying your social
security number shall be recorded for
just about any kind of license from
medical to marriage and that it can be
recorded by creditors as well in fact
these days its relationship to social
security does all
the footnote okay the number one place
or entity with whom you should not share
your social security number if you want
it to be kept secure is by far a college
or university apparently such
institutions are new to concepts like
restricted database access good network
security even shredders and yet I wonder
how many of them also offer courses in
data security well that's it for this
top five sleep well for more like it
check out top five cnet com I'm Brian
Cooley see you next time
so I guess if you really want to be safe
you should keep all your money in a
mattress forget about going to college
and never get sick sounds fair to me
maybe there's some good news waiting for
us in the bottom line if you've decided
you're ready to dive into streaming
video on your TV your two best choices
are the roku XDS and the Apple TV given
that they're both priced at $99 you
can't really rely on price to help you
decide but you can depend on brian Tong
to judge a fair price fight and this
week the two set-top boxes go
head-to-head
what's up price by fans i'm brian Tong
and we've got a battle for streaming box
supremacy it's a prize fide throw down
showdown between the roku XDS and the
Apple TV our judges for this fight our
senior editor John bad to the bone
Falcone senior editor David Garneau and
yours truly all night long we'll take
all three judges blind scores and
average them out to the nearest tenth
each round the final prize fights or
will be an average of all rounds using
the same decimal system let's get this
party started round 1 is design both of
these boxes are small and black and you
really won't notice them next year TV
set the roku XDS is simple and clean but
it's fabric tag belongs on a t-shirt
more than it does on a set-top box Apple
stays true to tradition and can even
make a streaming box sexy it's the
smallest component you'll have it's
about fifty percent smaller than the XDS
and it's remote is just as sleek Apple
TV starts a fight with a perfect five
and Roku gets a four next round is
interface and navigation the roku XDS
has a simple interface that's very
utilitarian it won't wow you visually
but it gets the job done it's also easy
to customize by adding channels for your
favorite content and the remote doesn't
get in the way the Apple TV interface is
clean and elegant just like you'd expect
animations are smooth and its interface
feels polished you won't get any real
customization here but it's remote is
simple and easy to use the big a gets
another perfect five and the roku gets a
3.7 dr. averaging two rounds Apple leads
by over a full point but it's still too
early to get excited round three is
speakers with the media box you want
options and the roku XDS connects to any
TV with HDMI up to 1080p component video
and composites there's also USB port for
potentially streaming content off a
connected thumb stick or hard drive in
the future plus you're getting dual band
802 11 N and an ethernet port for
connectivity now the apple TV is pretty
limited here it brings HDMI at only 720p
and that's it it won't connect to any
non HD television sets networking
options include Wi-Fi and ethernet but
it's pretty slim pickings roasting
strikes back with a perfect five of its
own and Apple gets a 3 next round is
content with media streaming boxes
content is king Netflix is the flagship
service on both boxes but you know us
we're hungry for more now the Roku
shines with over 100 channels of content
like amazon video on demand blue plus
pandora for music discovery and
streaming music from the cloud with mp3
tunes plus there's on-demand sports for
Major League Baseball and the National
Hockey League and none of these services
are currently available on Apple TV now
beyond Netflix apples box has access to
content from itunes but key shows like
house fringe or modern family aren't
even available at the moment it can
stream itunes from pcs on your local
network and you can watch youtube you
can use airplay to view content from iOS
devices on the big screen but not all
media content can be viewed like videos
plane in Safari or movies you recorded
on your iPhone it's a killer innovation
but it's still not fully baked The Rose
who gets another 5 with its myriad
content solutions and the Apple TV gets
a 3 after averaging four rounds Roku has
taken the lead by four tenths of a point
this one is so close and the final round
that decides it all is value for $99 the
roku XDS brings the best video and audio
streaming services on the web with every
connectivity option you can think of the
apple TV is also 99 bucks and if you
live in an apple dominated ecosystem
you'll feel right at home with iTunes
integration but you'll be missing out on
a whole lot of content in the final
round Roku gets another perfect 5 and
Apple gets a 4 so let's average out all
five rounds and in a battle where the
big a dominated from the start the roku
XDS came back with three perfect rounds
taking this faceoff 4.5 24 and is your
prize fight winner both of these
streaming boxes will continue to mature
with new features and content but the
decision really comes down to your
desire to stay in the Apple world or
experience all the services that Roku
has to offer i'm brian Tong thanks for
watching we'll catch you guys next time
for another prize fight what
the bottom line this week Roku like a
hurricane all right unless you're
totally committed to an apple centric
lifestyle you really can't go wrong with
the Roku for all your streaming needs
and I'm sure our corporate parents at
CBS will forgive Brian's promotion of
ABC's Modern Family especially since we
know their writers are fans of our site
oh I apologize for breaking world's
worst per month did you bought stupid
excuse me but the experts at cnet.com
rated it the best remote they gave it
three and a half mice Wow I have an idea
let's invite the gang from cnet over and
your old buddies from cheerleading and
we have a nerd party I give that five
mice I mean stars all right that's it
for this episode but come back next week
when we'll have a very special year-end
edition of the show our cnet tech review
year in review and until then there are
tons of great videos available every day
at cnet TV com I'll see you next time
and thank you for watching
