alfred hang and with us today is
all-star video game reviewer jeff bacala
thanks so much for having me guys quick
hurry
four minutes go I was gonna I was gonna
keep doing the intro a little known fact
about Jeff his middle name is also Fox
no okay alright it's Seymour we don't
often talk about video games on the show
but we wanted to take a chance to
discuss Red Dead Redemption too which is
gaining a lot of attention so Jeff my
first question is why why are people so
interested in this game as it turns out
it is arguably the most this is will
sound like a cliche but it is arguably
the most ambitious game ever made come
on it is like I may have heard that
before but you have you a chance to have
heard it before but it turns out it's
actually kind of true it is somehow able
to create one of the most believable
fictionalized worlds I've ever
interacted with and there is something
about this game that it does better than
any other game out there where it is
chock filled with characters events
environmental effects and things that
convince you 100% through and through
that you are in this Western world and
it makes West world look like city
slickers so what did you like about the
game and also what didn't you like about
the game there's really not a whole lot
I didn't like I think for a lot of
people they might not be expecting a
game that really takes its time the way
Red Dead does some of it is a drag
cowboy life in 1899 turns out not the
most you know exciting thing in the
world moment to moment what I did you
know love about this game is is how
quickly it was able to grab me every
there is nothing there's nothing cut and
pasted in this game every experience is
unique every mission every task every
activity every objective is is almost
this bespoke kind of like you know
beautifully crafted a meticulous thing
that is an absolute marvel to experience
it is unlike anything else I've ever
played Wow
well thanks very much for that very
quick explanation of Red Dead Redemption
- sure next up if you won the latest
easy sneakers these days you may need a
butt to help you out Alfred you've wrote
about the world of sneaker head BOTS
tell us a little bit about it yeah so I
spoke with the creator of one of the
more popular sneaker BOTS out there the
bottled cyber AI oh it cost about two
hundred pounds to get and then they only
sell 100 copies of that pot every month
and then people will try to rebuy if
they miss out on the sale though try to
buy that bot for about $2,700 Oh like
sale market on the bots yeah yeah they
get robots to buy sneakers and there's
also BOTS to buy those BOTS now because
there's only a hundred copies of them so
people make BOTS to buy those spots and
you might be wondering why so many
people pay thousands of dollars for
these BOTS even and the big reason is
you know these sneakers are basically
collectibles like even though these
Yeezy sneakers on Saturday are gonna
sell for $200 there's a very good chance
that on the resale market or it'll sell
for like eight hundred six hundred
dollars or so and that's just like these
sneakers there are sneak like the Marty
McFly sneakers that came out a few years
ago those were on an ebay auction for
like forty-one thousand dollars because
they're extremely rare and there's a lot
of rich people out there that like wanna
collect these so is it the people that
get these BOTS are they more collectors
or are they resellers there's a good
chance that they're most likely
resellers because like they're basically
by investing in a tool to help them make
more money
hmm like it I don't think they'd spend
that much money to just you know collect
these sneakers on their own but it would
be a healthy investment I would say if
you're in the reselling business
all right last Twitter reported a drop
of nine million monthly users in its
latest quarter but its stock is way up
thanks to the company hitting a sizable
profit I wanted to pitch this question
to you guys is Twitter somehow
benefiting from all of Facebook's misery
what do you guys think about that yeah I
don't think it's hurting them I mean but
the fact that they lost 9 million users
seems like a lot well they've been
killing off incidentally a lot of bots
getting around a lot of fake accounts
getting out of there so maybe that helps
I think for social media they're getting
in a different game now of I think in
the past it used to always be okay
what's your daily monthly average user
or anything like that
and you know it was a race to see who
could get the most users but now I think
they're more focusing on engagement and
like actual users and that's why they're
okay with killing off all these like
bought accounts in the past they were
just there and it kind of helped them
inflate their numbers a bit to investors
but now I think it's much more important
for them to say hey look we have a clean
and healthy platform do you think Jack
Dorsey is actually a set of identical
twins why would because he's actually
miraculously running square and Twitter
at the same time it doesn't really feel
like he's running Twitter though I don't
know sir just like a mascot yeah I
either way I wanted to mention Derick
hers deep dive story about deforestation
in the Amazon that just published today
if you want to read about these stories
check us out on CNET I'm Ben Fox Ruben
I'm Alfred Inge and I'm Jeff Bakalar
thanks for listening
all right thanks everybody for joining
us for the recording of the audio
podcast and it's nice to have Jeff on
Jeff have you ever even been on 359 yet
apparently he's been on eight times on a
bunch I love that he knows the exact
amount like it's he like puts a notch on
his desk every time it's true I have a
carved into the bottom yeah then also
does but it's just like anywhere from
four to six nine well we love having you
on yeah very much my plate I mean to do
a four-minute podcast that's you guys
know how good yeah but we sit around for
20 minutes and talk to people so yeah it
was it was a very very funny mini story
that happened as we were walking in
today to do the podcast was that Bryan
was trying to talk me out of talking
about Red Dead Redemption too because he
was like have you have you played the
game do you even know what you're
talking about I'm like no I haven't I
haven't played the game and then luckily
you walked in yeah and and prove me
right so this was actually well you were
working on the review apparently people
bear-like it would have been really
weird if you have never played the game
I was like hey guys today we're gonna
talk about something that I've never
played ask me anything
talk about sneaker bites - which is
another thing I know nothing story's
wild I I'm a big sneaker guy but I don't
have any of those bonds oh no yeah
unless you're like reselling I would
make the argument that there's no reason
for you to have these so I have a friend
whose little brother that's what he does
for a living
really I don't know if he hey I I wonder
if he has a bot like this or that bot
but like you he sends me photos in his
room and it's like eighty hundred stack
yaksas of like you know all those were
so my friends do it manually as well but
like it's much harder when you're doing
a manual because you're competing of all
these BOTS and I've tried the manual way
once just because there was a pair that
I really wanted and it is incredibly
frustrating and impossible because like
adidas and all these brands need to like
do some well that's a thing right
yeah they limit how many you buy because
you mentioned no story
40 BOTS yes so that's true with this bot
they don't actually go after Nike and
Adidas own website so they'll go after
like footlocker or like foot action that
sells these but they don't do adidas or
Nike because they have a lot of
protections against it so one of the
things that Nike does is they'll do a
raffle through an app and it's much
harder to send an app to send a bot
towards an app address than it is a
website and it is does similar cut they
have like a lot of like are you a robot
kind of thing yes when you try it's
still impossible I can always try to buy
a new adidas stuff and I can get it so
they'll do they will do a raffle way now
where you use an app and then you enter
to buy it buy the sneakers and they pick
like a thousand people that might get it
so it's much harder that way a lot of
brands have been doing that - like
supreme which is another like hyped like
streetwear brand has been doing that
where they send you a raffle through you
basically have to win a raffle to wait
on line and it does the same thing as
well look I would say that that's at
least helpful in so far as like you
mentioned in your story that one company
bought more than a thousand tickets to a
u2 concert yeah that's different a
minute movie that's like concert tickets
that's right but at the same time that
was like Wild West type of situation
where you're able to buy using bi it's
like so quickly that like regular people
don't even stand a chance so anyway
let's get to questions sure all right
some Red Dead is there oh there's plenty
of red dead okay so I already one says
Jeff is it a must play for Red Dead one
to enjoy Red Dead - I don't it's not a
must play but I think you know there is
a lot of exposition that it makes sense
with with having the context of Red Dead
one in the back your head well what you
said is Red Dead one is Error
red net - I should say is a prequel
right yeah residues a prequel so there
are characters in Red Dead 2 that show
up in Red Dead 1 if you're following it
chronologically it's good for backstory
stuff I don't think in any way like you
need to play Red Dead 1 to appreciate
Red Dead - it's perfectly fine on its
own and I think there's a lot of
Easter Egg II kind of like special you
know tips of the hat for people who are
familiar with the story but I mean to
play Red Dead one right now in front of
Red Dead 2 is like a huge undertaking
you basically have to play a 60 hour
game right now to get ready for the
hundred and eighty our game well you
have like how many years is it between
Red Dead one and two uh so I start my
in-game story or visit like actual well
let's go at both okay so in game's story
I think they're like 11 years apart this
the red did two takes was in 1899 and
actual development time
Red Dead 1 came out in 2010 it was that
long it doesn't feel like it was yeah I
read the New York mag profile of
Rockstar without a key that's another
sort of story that's going on during
this entire thing which is a hundred
hours per week yeah it's a really
difficult thing to kind of like you know
have that go on too and then just give
this in different opinion about the game
you know I mean when you were playing it
that it like seemed like yeah this I can
definitely see like the developers porn
pouring that crazy amount of hundred
percent but I think you know and this
isn't making excuses for anyone but I
think you anytime you experience
something that is creatively astonishing
whether it be a movie or you know a
piece of art or whatever it is a game I
think it's like oh my god how many
people spend how many hours on this game
or movie or whatever it is so yeah it's
it's the fact that nothing is repetitive
in this game is I think what really
makes it stand that part
pretty crazy oh I know what I need to do
I just got to collect the chickens yeah
I'm just gonna collect chickens you know
you play that's what I started to
realize with fallout 4 was that after a
while the missions just repeated
themselves and there's a different
environment I was people would they
don't push you forward and so it sounds
like they did a better job at this game
of actually moving for the narrative and
I'm just like aimlessly searching around
that was basically what like always like
makes me stop playing open water
like after a while it's like okay I'm
doing the exact same thing you know this
is a game that you're gonna want to keep
playing probably all the way through
because there is something insane like a
thousand unique activities to accomplish
nice and I've maybe done 100 of them I
mean it is wild how much stuff is in
this game add up to a point where you
where you once you you know the game
opens up very slowly and but once you
sort of like are let loose and and you
see the scope of what you're being
offered it's uh it's it's almost like
overwhelming to a point were just like
oh no this oh I can't do this in a week
so yeah how many people do you think are
gonna take off of work just to play the
game so I've heard wild stories I've
heard of stories of like small offices
that they buy everyone a copy of the
gaming you know Friday off seriously
yeah I've heard two independent stories
about that in the games industry oh this
accounting firm which by the way I need
to get a job at that account that's a
great accounting firm it's not like you
know people close the store and just
like play the game but I've heard a lot
of stories of like PR people or whatever
it is like hey you've earned it take
Friday off play Red Dead for 15 hours so
no national holiday is what you're
saying no no just the election the banks
are still open thankfully let's take
some more questions shall we let's talk
about the size and scope a little bit
more specifically how big is the file
size for the game and then if you want
to follow that up how big is the world
now you used a pretty good analogy for
me yesterday and comparing it to like
breath of the wild which is my most
current frame of reference as far as
open world goes but try to tell them
give them a good like paint paint a
visual picture of like how far and wide
that game can take you I don't
necessarily have like a one-to-one scale
comparison like geographically of what
the the game size feels like but just
put it like this I very rarely will ride
around in that game and just be like oh
I've seen that before you know like
there's so much you're constantly going
in a direction you likely have not
on in and you know not a lot of retread
yeah I mean you know everything is so
varied and unique even though it is sort
of like this Old West thing there are
like the snowy mountains in the north
northern you know sort of reaches of the
map there's a huge body of water that's
sort of centered in the in the whole
thing and you just aren't really gonna
ever feel like this thing I feel
claustrophobic in this thing it's it's
you know for a long time a lot of games
would brag about like it's the size of
Rhode Island and you're like oh that's
cool but yeah I mean this is massive a
lot of games now are massive this feels
just as massive as anything else and as
far as file size to download a for you
cuz it is available digitally it will be
right yeah yes I get a whole new ps4
just to I mean like a lot of people who
I talked to reviewed the game had a
clear out space I think the initial
download is on ps4 is 95 gigs and I
think that still makes you clear out as
like a buffer something like 110 and
that's the ps4 pro I don't know I don't
know if the regular ps4 version is
somehow smaller it might be because it
doesn't have as high-res textures in it
but it's a lot it's a lot if you buy a
physical copy comes on to blu-rays it's
which is like unheard of wow we haven't
seen multi-disc gaming in a minute now
like that uh we saw a lot of last gen or
at least more frequently last gen but
right never seen it right now
I mean two blu-rays that is Q blu-rays
can hold like 120 gigs I think or
something well there you go
I mean like you were talking about
roughly 110 gigs the extra 10 as like a
buffer for installation but the core
file is something like 92 or 95 gigs it
took me like four hours to download I
like that the the chat there is people
trying to guess the size of the game
throwing out words like Utah Bronx New
Mexico Arizona Montana keep it going
guys I want to see where this goes it's
probably this it's probably the size of
like I I don't want to like think of it
town that it would be the size of but
you like can't even do it it's just it's
big it's a big game big wide world okay
we got a couple minutes left we got a
couple of graphics heads in the chat too
so you said some really stellar things
about the visuals in the game can you
give us a little more yeah it's what's
wild about Red Dead is that I think
Rockstar has the ability to recreate
like human vantage points and create the
illusion of like photo realism in a way
that not many games are able to do I
think I think like God of War had shades
of that a little bit but God of War is
obviously so based in fantasy that it's
tough to kind of ground yourself in it
in Red Dead there's a lot of little
things especially if you do like
first-person stuff yeah that you're you
get tricked really easily into being
like oh I'm not looking at a movie I'm
looking at a video game weather effects
are wild the skybox is like super
convincing you know there's just stuff
in that game that makes you have to kind
of do a double-take the other little
details you're you were playing this on
a ps4 pro okay so I have a ps4 it's like
fantastic right the experience
graphically is not gonna be
substantially degraded no I don't have
no no it's gonna look great I think if
you have ps4 Pro or you have ambitions
of one day getting one or at the very
least if you have a 4k TV do yourself a
favor and get that you know or if you're
if you can look if you have a 4k TV
maybe a Playstation 4 Pro become a
little easier to you so if you're on the
fence man do it but I just spent all my
money on a 4k TV say wha but I just
spend all my money on a 4k TV l can I
get a ps4 Pro well you know you just
have to not treat yourself again for a
while yeah Christmas will have to come
early just eat some PB and J's
yeah just live off cup noodles you'll be
fine you do that anyway I do that anyway
okay with the last couple minutes coming
down back into the open world sense
priority one wants to know is it more
open world infarct ithe Far Cry 3 mother
came of all
time well I didn't hear that last part
they asked is it more open world than my
favorite game of all time Far Cry 3 yeah
of course
yeah no Far Cry it's like there's
nothing in that open world
I mean ferger's yeah like yeah I mean
the latest Far Cry game those are
open-world games but I mean like mad
small isn't it it's all I wouldn't call
it small but I think compared to what
Red Dead 2 offers it's sort of like a
night and day situation like the I don't
know on the scope and the in the
massiveness of Red Dead I will say this
like people it sounds like a damn cliche
people will not be prepared for how
overwhelming and sort of like daunting
this game can feel this it's it feels
insurmountable in the beginning where
you're just like about a lot of things
in this game and the open-world Miss is
lends itself so well to being encouraged
to explore and discover and do your own
thing I think better than any game I've
ever played
like I I applaud games that figure out a
way to encourage you to explore but it
comes so organically in Red Dead 2 that
it's like alright there the night
they're the ones to beat now hmm yeah I
mean you say that but it's no Shenmue so
there can only be one true king
all right before we go Jeff did you get
to try it on any other platforms I know
you did your primary place there on the
ps4 Pro the Nintendo Wii doesn't run
real well on switch I was surprised no I
mustn't controls were awful just shoot
awkward perks and bonuses to ps4 versus
ex bonus PC so it's not on PC I
I hope it's on PC one day because I mean
you know I replayed Red Dead when the
sort of HD texture thing came out a
couple years ago and I was like I was
like man this game looks real good on
Xbox one X at the time and
that's sort of like a thing if you if
you aren't gonna play Red Dead 2 and
you're just like I want to play the
first one first played on xbox one X it
looks really good it holds up remarkably
but I wish I knew that I wish I could
get them side by side I haven't been
able to do it I would love to see excuse
me if there are differences between the
one X and the ps4 Pro right now I can't
imagine oh what I've compared plenty of
enhanced games side by side and it's
really tough to discern a difference
between the two I would be quite
surprised if there was a real meaningful
difference in fidelity between the 1x
and ps4 Pro and what I can gather the
way Rockstar likes to show this game off
they were showing it off on Xbox on um
on PlayStation 4 Pro in their private
sessions so if they're showing it on ps4
Pro in-house they are quite confident in
how that game looks on ps4 Pro so don't
go don't drive yourself crazy about
which console to get it on all right we
are at the usual stopping point do we
want to cram anything else in about the
sneaker BOTS or any of the other stories
before you wrap it up today you want to
I'm just gonna answer questions but if
nobody has any I figured everyone cares
more about Red Dead Redemption yeah
they're all over the game today the
sneaker bad thing just tweaks me out
though it's a cool story it's very cool
it's very little reading guys but it's
just even more daunting that even the
simplest thing is like buying your
essential clothing is now regulated and
alright mate it's not
none of these are essential clothing
those are like really expensive and like
wear sneakers you're you're gonna be
able to get your New Balance is fine
like nori which I did no BOTS going
after that all right I'm putting a call
out to the audience
somebody build a bot that will find me
rare Magic the Gathering cards that's
what I need they probably something out
there man you are nerdier than I thought
all right we gotta start digging you
guys help me look ok good get Brian
those do land cards thank you yeah
got'em my deck is a mess okay which time
to wrap it up say goodbye thanks to Jeff
