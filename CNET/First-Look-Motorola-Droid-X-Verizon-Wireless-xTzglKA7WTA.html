at cnet.com and I'm here with your first
look at the Motorola Droid X for Verizon
this is the carrier's newest ROI device
and I'm gonna walk you through the
design really quick on front you've got
a 4.3 inch WVGA capacitive touchscreen
looks really gorgeous
it's running a revised version of
motoblur so it's not quite like the
clique or anything like that it's a very
subdued which I liked a lot better below
the screen you've got four hard buttons
you've got the menu button the HOME key
back and search on the side here we've
got the micro USB port as well as an
HDMI port so you will be able to hook it
up to an HDTV and watch video as well as
your photos speaking of photos it has an
8 megapixel camera and can record 720p
video so it's HD video
there is no front-facing camera but
Motorola has said that they will come
out with other devices with front-facing
cameras later on here on the left side
there's a volume rocker and also a
dedicated camera key and finally on top
we've got a power button and a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack now as far as
software I like I said it's running
motoblur it's gonna launch with Android
2.1 but Android 2.2 Froyo will be coming
to the Droid X as well as the Droid
later this summer and this will also
bring the flash 10 capabilities for the
phone other things on here all the
wireless options 3G Bluetooth GPS as
well as Wi-Fi and you can use the Droid
X as a mobile hotspot for up to five
devices but that will run you in
additional $20 a month on top of the $30
data plan just FYI milky media is gonna
be huge on this so they are launching
with a dedicated blockbuster app a lot
like the HD 2 so you can rent and buy
movies from the phone it also had a V
CAST video as well as in a film oboe and
all other Verizon services the Droid X
will be available starting July 15th
from 199 99 with a two-year contract and
after $100 mail-in rebate and it'll also
be available at other retail outlets I'm
Bonnie Tom this has been your first look
at the Motorola Droid X for Verizon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
