to the modern age unified weapons master
is a high-tech sport based around
ancient combat we spoke to CEO David
piston unified weapons master or UWM
started out as a crazy idea about five
years ago and since then it's evolved
from being completely insane to highly
ambitious and now totally achievable the
genesis of the idea came from my
business partner training throughout
Asia and seen incredible weapons based
martial artists that no one had ever
heard of and the reason for that is
there's no format or forum where those
guys can compete so he thought wouldn't
it be great if there was a way to
showcase the skills of these guys and
use technology to bring that to the fore
and that's what we've done the
construction of the armor is quite a
complex process and it's been
interesting because we've had to solve a
number of technical challenges in
building the armor you know armor has
been around for thousands of years but
no one has previously had to incorporate
sensors in the armor that measure the
force and location of strikes to the
armor and all of the other electronics
that we include in it so in terms of how
the materials are constructed this is
like a sandwich of different materials
there's a high impact layer which
prevents penetration that's typically a
carbon fiber type layer and then there
are polycarbonate layers and what are
called elastomeric foams which are high
impact absorbing phones so they reduce
the shock and impact of combat with
weapons and sandwiched in between those
we have these sensors that measure all
of the forces that are being applied to
the armor in real time the sensors do
report back to a scoring system so we
have built a system with medical data
underpinning in it that data includes
fracture profile data and blunt trauma
data and we know objectively how much
force the body can withstand before it
breaks or before critical damages
incurred and so what those sensors are
doing is measuring all of the forces
that are being applied to the armor but
the scoring system interprets that as if
the competitor was not wearing armor
knows how much damage would have
occurred to that competitor there is a
feedback process built into the armor we
have a lighting system that we're
building into the suits which will
visually display the damage that's been
incurred to different parts of the body
in real time
there's also audio feedback to the
competitor that tells them how much
damage has been sustained and then
finally we have a referee who will be
part of the competitions and that
referee has feedback going to him and
when someone has lost a virtual life or
become incapacitated that ref will step
in and give them effectively a standing
8-count
and if they have lives left because it's
a bit like a video again we give them
multiple lives otherwise it can be over
quite quickly then they will be allowed
to fight on and that actually prolongs
the entertainment experience for the
audience historically there's 96
different weapons based martial arts
that are practiced all around the world
and those arts have evolved over
hundreds and even thousands of years but
there's really nowhere that you can see
those arts practiced and the people that
do practice it have nowhere where they
can compete to test how far they've gone
so what we've done is create the
opportunity for a competition where
people from all around the world
you know Japanese samurai masters
Chinese Shaolin staff masters Indian
kalari PI art masters incredible weapons
based experts to come together in a
single global competition and compete to
find out who is the world's best weapons
master that's why it's unified weapons
master
