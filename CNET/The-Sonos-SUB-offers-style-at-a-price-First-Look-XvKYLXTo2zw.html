a review of the Sonos sub if a friend
asks me what kind of multi room music
system should I buy more than likely I
will answer so nas it's easy to set up
and use and sound quality is
consistently good but one of the things
that lacks particularly in the play 3
and play 5 speakers is meaty bass Sonos
has gone about fixing that by releasing
its first subwoofer simply named sub
this is a large O'Shay p sub with the
piano gloss finish the sub features to 6
inch drive units and can go down to 25
Hertz which is almost a limit of CD
technology the subs biggest selling
feature is that it's Wireless simply
press the button and your software will
configure everything you just need to
tell it if it sounds too loud or soft
and just a slider up or down and you're
done the sub works with also nos
products with a built-in amp and based
on our tests it's most useful if you're
partnering it with the play 3 or play 5
speakers if you own one of these systems
I would say adding the sub makes a
definite improvement on sound quality
the bass response becomes more natural
and the system is able to then
concentrate on producing a clearer
mid-range the effect is actually quite
pronounced and the sub itself is able to
go as loud as is comfortable in a normal
room without distorting if you only
connect amp though I'd say save your
money and choose a powered sub by
another manufacturer instead the biggest
negative here is the price at six
hundred and ninety nine dollars it's the
most expensive cirno's component by far
and for the money you'd pay for this and
a couple of play speakers you can really
buy yourself a nice stereo system this
