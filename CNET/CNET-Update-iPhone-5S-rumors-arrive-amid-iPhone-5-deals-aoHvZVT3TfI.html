Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update when Apple releases the next
version of the iphone it'll likely be in
September or october since the last two
iphones were announced around that time
but if you don't care to hold out best
buy has a promotion going on where if
you bring in an old iPhone 4 or 4s you
can trade it in for a free 16 gig iphone
5 but to get that offer you have to be
eligible for an upgrade with your
carrier and get a new two-year contract
yada yada the best buy trade-in
promotion ends jun 29th but starting on
friday jun 28th the iphone 5 will be
sold without a contract on virgin mobile
so without that contract subsidy the 16
gig iphone 5 will cost 550 dollars and
data plans start at thirty-five dollars
a month we don't yet know much about the
next iPhone other than that there's a
good probability it'll physically look a
lot like the current model there are new
alleged photos on macrumors of the back
of the next iPhone which has just a
slightly larger LED flash there are also
reports that apple will launch a lower
priced iPhone or offer the iphone in
multiple colors but samsung beat apple
to the punch on that one it just
announced the galaxy s4 will come in
several colors blue purple red brown and
pink it's just not clear winner where
these colors will be available and the
water resistant version the s4 active
also has color options grey orange and
blue in other news facebook launched the
ability to add photos to comments so
when words aren't enough you could just
upload an image you won't be able to do
this from a smartphone app but you can
do it from your smartphone if you go to
the mobile website @ m.facebook.com and
if you've been eyeing the Nvidia shield
portable gaming system it just lower the
price of three hundred dollars that's
fifty bucks less than the original price
tag this android based system plays
google apps and it streams pc games from
computers with nvidia chips looking
ahead you can expect sony to unveil a
new SmartWatch on Tuesday Sony is
posting teasing tweets with an image of
a SmartWatch and the hashtag
it's time one message says wearable tech
is in our DNA remember the walkman
another says one in three smartphone
users want smart wrist where Sony first
released a SmartWatch in 2007 and the
current model has several functions that
work over Bluetooth like call handling
and music controls but it requires an
Android smartphone connection to
function it even needs to be connected
to an android phone just to keep the
time so it's not really a standalone
gadget we shall wait and see what
upgrades are in store that's your tech
news update you can find more details on
these stories at cnet com / update and
follow along on Twitter from our studios
