of a nokia lumia 1520 and shrink it down
to a 5 inch phone that is the nokia
lumia icon a new exclusive for verizon
i'm jessica doll court for CNN i'm going
to tell you all about this phone let's
start with the design the lumia icon
comes in two colors the white one I've
got here and also black this white one
has silver aluminum ridge around the
edge and the black one has that rim as
well it's just colored in black instead
of silver what's interesting about this
phone is the shape and also the colors
you don't get the screaming yellows reds
blues or anything else because verizon
goes for much more somber shades you do
have the straight edges here which means
that the phone can stand up on its own
on the bottom top and left spine at that
is different there is also the slight
curve to the back so it's still
comfortable in the palm this is a
unibody design with a polycarbonate
backing so you can't remove the back
cover to get at any external storage
because there is none you also can't get
at the battery that said though there
are 32 gigabytes of built-in storage and
you've got seven gigabytes of free
online storage via Sky Drive you've got
a very characteristic bright beautiful
screen on this nokia lumia icon it's 5
inches it has the same three column
width as you're going to see on the
6-inch phones like the Lumia 1520 and
1320 the icons are a little bit smaller
here in the smallest size but they are
still tap about the full 1080p HD
resolution makes everything very crisp
and it's also very bright the screen
does have a setting option for extra
sensitivity so you can operate it with
your nail or with gloves on and it can
go even brighter for outdoor readability
as for the camera you do have a 20
megapixel sensor here with dual LED
flash most photos do resolve to five
megapixels but you have the option for
lossless zooming so that's going to get
you closer to about 16 megapixels in a
16 by 9 ratio on the front you've got a
2 megapixel sensor here you're only
going to get one point 2 megapixels for
stills but you do get the benefit of the
2 megapixels when it comes to video
conferencing now this is a very speedy
phone in addition to LTE your
you two have a two point two gigahertz
Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 quad-core chip
in here so it's going to give you quite
the boost you've got all the windows
phone standards here including the
microsoft office suite being music
identification voice search and a whole
bunch of extra nokia apps especially for
the camera there's also multitasking NFC
and built-in wireless charging the Nokia
Lumia icon goes on sale februari 20th
with verizon for two hundred dollars on
contract overall it isn't my favorite
looking nokia device it's a little bit
heavy a little bit thick and a little
bit bland for my tastes personally but
you do get that really nice camera the
very fast processor the beautiful 5-inch
screen so there are a lot of specs in
here to like I'm Jessica doll court for
CNN you can check out my full review of
the Nokia Lumia icon from verizon at
