little problems but it's created some
new ones these are the top five most
annoying problems caused by tech at
number five the phantom buzz you feel
that twinge in your leg and you check
your pants pocket your phone doesn't
display any information on the
lockscreen you dig deeper and you check
into any notifications nothing you put
it back in your pocket and this is you
don't believe it at number four tablet
face that's getting smacked while
reading in bed you're reading a story on
your phone you reader or tablet and all
of a sudden physics fails either your
hands failed or somehow your gadget
cheese for my begins hurtling towards
your head face meat glass and yes the
same problem does exist with books at
number three the movie phone check it
Tech also has this weird ability to
change people let's say you're trying to
watch a magical wizard boy take on an
evil magic man in the movies you're
trying to get engrossed into the story
and then out of the corner of your eye a
six inch screen glowing staring at that
illuminated moviegoer never makes
anything better at number two fear of
missing house or foam Oh back before the
days of the internet if somebody
canceled plans with you you probably
wouldn't know what they did otherwise
now it is your friends can either post a
photo or status to Facebook Twitter
Instagram or even checking on soarin you
can see the lives people are living even
though we all know online versions of
people are usually distortions and it
can still cause the dreaded foam oh and
at number one the texture zombie walk
all you want to do is get from point A
to point B then you spot someone in
front of you arms close to the body head
slightly down and then there's that
distinct zombie-like shuffle clearly
this person is messing about on their
phone you can't shove them out of the
way you're doomed to be behind this
person until you see daylight wait hang
on my phone is buzzing
