pretty nice router but it's not about
you today it's about you now some of you
actually many of you have complained to
me that after having invested in a nice
Wi-Fi router you didn't get the
performance at home that you expected
now the key word here is expectation and
today I'm going to set that right when
it comes to buying networking equipment
there are three speed that you need to
be aware of the advertising speed the
ceiling speed and the actual real world
speed now first the advertising speed
take a look at this one here this is a
AC 2600 router suggesting that it is a
802 point you have an AC router which is
Chu and it has some 2600 megabit per
second performance that is completely
wrong now here's why this one here is a
true dual band router meaning it can
work in two separate band at the same
time and also a top-notch router so on
the hood frequency band it has
the ceiling speed up seventeen hundred
and thirty three megabit per second and
on the 2.4 gigahertz band up to eight
hundred megabits per second now come by
those two you have a some 2533 megabit
per second or roughly twenty six hundred
megabits per second but a Wi-Fi client
like this iPhone sick an connect to the
router on only one band at a time so the
connection can only cap at either
seventeen hundred and thirty three mega
people second or eight hundred megabit
per second at a time
now that is from the railroads
perspective from the client it's a bit
different story now the phone here
support the 802 pointed a Wi-Fi standard
but just the lowest tier of it and cap
at only 433 megabit per second so when
the two connects it is the ceiling speed
of the phone the rule is in a connection
the ceiling speed is that of the slower
device because a condition is as fast as
its weakest link in other words if you
have all clients at home
getting a topknot Wi-Fi and router will
not help much with the speed if at all
now that brings us to the actual speed
there's many factors that affect the
actual Willman speed of Wi-Fi for
example the distant the further away the
client from the router the slower it
gets there also obstacle in between them
like wall of furnitures and there are
interference from other devices that use
the same signal on the same frequency
band and finally hardware and software
from different vendors might not work
optimally with one another so generally
in my experience of many years testing
Wi-Fi router and access point in the
best case scenario the real one speed is
about a third of the ceiling speed
oftentimes must slow so when you read
the Box like this one here do not ever
believe in the numbers after up to they
are never right but the thing is faster
Wi-Fi speed always mean faster
real-world speed this is not as fast as
they cracked up to be
now for more on this matter check out my
full riya sen calm but the takeaway is
do not send invitation which on what the
vendors telling as about as helpful as
reading the beauty magazine for the
articles instead get your connection
based on what I tell you and I tell you
what no matter what I sell in that
magazine
you look fine the way you are I know I
do
and that's because I'm dumb no and this
has been a quick explanation on what is
real really</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
