here at CES 2014 in Las Vegas this is
the cat b100 it is a rugged cell phone
one thing I really love about these
phones is that they're a lot of fun to
look at they really are a tough
this one is certified ip67 which means
for water and for dust it can drop 1.8
meters that's about six feet that's what
it's certified for and you can dunk it
underwater for up to thirty minutes for
about one meter that's also three feet
characterized by this very thick case
sort of rubberized protection around the
back some screws to keep the back panel
in place which will keep out water and
dust their flaps to cover the headset
jack and also the charging port now this
phone has very large buttons it's
intended for people who are outdoors a
lot maybe some outdoor workers
the idea is you should be able to use
this with wet hands and with love to use
as for the other specs it has a 2.2 inch
QVGA display there is a 3 megapixel
camera on the back that's the flash
there and that is your speaker there's
something kind of fun here in between
the volume controls you have a
flashlight so if you press and hold that
long enough you will sear your eyes out
or somebody else really useful for
finding your way into crevices if you
drop something while you're outdoors if
you just need a closer look this phone
is very low on a lot of additional specs
however there is noise cancellation
texting and an FM radio the phone costs
150 euros and there is no US pricing yet
but you should look for it available in
the US somewhere in q1 it's not with the
carrier that at least
