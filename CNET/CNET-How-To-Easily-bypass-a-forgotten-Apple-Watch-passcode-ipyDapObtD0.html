Apple watch and now you can't remember
the passcode to unlock it was it one one
one or maybe ten ten none of these seem
to work after six attempts to are then X
- wait a minute before trying again but
it doesn't matter
you simply can't remember it luckily
there is an easy way to reset it click
the Apple watch app on your iphones home
screen select general scroll down to the
bottom of the page tap reset and choose
to erase all content and settings this
will return the watch to its original
out of box state unfortunately that
means everything on it will also be
deleted the good news is your iPhone
automatically creates a backup of your
watch when it's unpaired using this
method so when you're ready to repair it
with your phone all you have to do is
select the backup option during the
setup process if you don't have your
iPhone with you
you can still reset the watch but you
will need your charger close by hold and
press the side power button on the watch
then perform a force touch which is a
hard press on the power off switch
select erase all content and settings
and connect the charger to your watch
the watch will then reboot and you can
repair it with your iPhone to prevent
the same situation from happening in the
future I recommend turning on the unlock
with iPhone feature on both your watch
and your iPhone you can choose to turn
this on during the initial setup or in
the Apple watch app on your iPhone by
selecting passcode and toggling the
unlock with iPhone switch from off to on
these are both good options for people
who have forgotten their passcode but of
course thieves could also perform these
same methods so be sure to take extra
care of your Apple watch for more tips
like this be sure to check out how to
cnet.com you can also reach out to me on
Twitter with any questions or comments
