today I'm looking at the LG 32 CS 460 TV
if you're looking for a 32 inch
television you may think they all pretty
much perform about the same but based on
my roundup of 32 inch TVs there are some
winners and some losers in this occasion
the loser is the LG 32 CS 460 the LG
design is distinctly average with a very
thick bezel and an outdated silver strip
it does have a swivel stand though which
winds at some points and the remote
control is quite good if you're using
this as a TV without a sound system
though that big bulky bezel does have
one good point it enables larger
speakers and as a result gives excellent
sound for its size as a budget TV there
are no real features to speak of and
like the others at this size and price
it's only a 720 resolution though it
will accept a full HD signal the TV does
have a good menu system and some
advanced controls the problem with this
TV is that when I got it out of the box
the colors were glaringly awful and even
with the controls it was difficult to
get a good picture out of colors were
noticeably off and black levels for the
worst of the TVs we tested the LG wasn't
even able to conjure up shadow detail in
Harry Potter resulting in a big dark
blob while it's only around $300 the
rival Samsung eh 4000 is a much better
performer and looks better on your
mantelpiece - and that's where I'd be
spending my money this has been ty
Pendlebury for seen it be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
