the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition has
all the technology DNA of the galaxy
note 3 it gives you a crystal clear
cannon to display an ultimate
productivity in a beautiful package now
you can enjoy an immersive content
consuming experience with it screen
stereo speakers and portability the note
10.1 is incredible it's only seven point
nine millimeters thick and the Wi-Fi
version weighs only 500 35 grams
considerable reductions from last year
and this is a device that you can take
anywhere and with an 80 to 20 milliamp
hour battery you hit the road with
confidence tell us about the the screen
the 10.1 viewing experience obviously
it's a critical part of of that device
yeah this is something even more special
what you're looking at is a wqxga
display with 2560 by 1600 resolution
altra high def yeah exactly and with the
10.1 inch screen the my magazine feature
gives an even richer magazine like
experience also for the first time we're
introducing Samsung hub for tablets in
this stylish magazine format and there's
multitasking work on that platform it
works especially well you have all this
display real estate to work with both in
terms of size and resolution the new
multi window feature works just as we
described with the note 3 and with this
awesome display it works even better
let's talk hardware specs give us the
spec lowdown okay I got them yeah so
it's 10.1 inch screen it's running on a
two point three gigahertz quad-core
processor for the LTE version and 1.9
octa-core for the 3g version and like
the note 3 it also has the first in
category three gigabytes of RAM and it
makes it a multi taskers dream it's got
an 8 megapixel camera on the rear
a 2-megapixel on the front and it runs
on androids most recent version of jelly
bean 4.3 okay so that's the the hardware
spec account it's a very important part
of the picture but also extras what
comes with it both the Galaxy Note 3 and
the 10.1 2014 edition will come with a
host of free and exclusive partner
content that really pushes the devices
productivity entertainment and creative
properties our contents gift pack for
the note 3 and the note 10.1 have more
than a dozen free premium partner apps
on board with a range of offers okay
final fools final thoughts well what I
really want to say is that the Galaxy
Note 10.1 2014 edition it's going to
change the way you think about large
screen tablets it's light it's fast and
the display is gorgeous so you're
definitely going to want to try this out
