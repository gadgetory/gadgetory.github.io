Kenmore 795 dot 780 22 this is actually
an existing LG bottom freezer model that
Kenmore has slapped it's a name on to
sell its ears that's what Kenmore does
it resells existing models of other
manufacturers instead of making its own
appliances and that's actually a good
thing in this case because LG as we
found makes a pretty mean bottom freezer
now sure it's kind of a boring basic
build with the white body and the lack
of a drawer on the bottom I wish it had
that because a hinge swing door free of
pain to get things in and out of but
open this thing up and you'll find a
feature-rich interior with a lot of
user-friendly design elements you'll see
the crisper bins get humidity controls
you've got a third pantry drawer down
here you've got spill proof shelving LED
lighting you've got these plastic
sliders in the indoor shelving that
helps you segment things off this shelf
appear folds up and out of the way to
make way for tall items you're really
getting a lot for a fridge that sits at
the bottom of the bottom freezer price
range also keep in mind that this is
basically the exact same interior as the
top-of-the-line LG bottom freezer we
reviewed that a couple of weeks back and
loved it and you're getting all the same
features at a much lower cost now
officially that price is $1,500 the MSRP
for this thing but Ken were always
slashes its prices for the cedar show
floor so expect to take closer to 11
hundred and like I said that's about as
cheap as bottom freezers come at that
price this fridge is a deal although I
might pay a little more for model that
has a drawer on the bottom thanks for
watching check out the rest of our
refrigerator reviews at cnet com
foreseen appliances I'm right Chris
