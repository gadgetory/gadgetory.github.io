micro so what is this well it is G speed
Stevie OH are terrible - great storage
systems from GTA now not only does it
look like a Mac Pro it also costs and
performs like a Mac Pro that's right now
am i testing this one here you're
actually very fast offering a sustained
real-world speed of close to 500
megabyte per second and available in
2014 by 16 Tabor and 12 T to buy it
costs some thirty six hundred twenty
seven hundred and twenty two hundred
dollars respectively so let's say what
you have for the money well this one
here hosts four into the hard drive they
are very easy to access just pop up open
the top right here and you can pull them
out one by another in fact it's too easy
to do that because there's no way to
prevent somebody from doing that just
for fun now this hard drive here are
most together into one volume using rate
the speedier support raid 0 raid 1 raid
5 and rate 10 now at the back is support
raid 5 and is ready to be used right
away it also includes a Thunderbolt
cable for you now if you want to change
the rate setup you have to use a
software called the G speed our studio
utility the software actually very easy
and nice to use you can quickly chain
from one way to another and do many
other things now on the back that G spot
have two Thunderbolt 2 ports it's a port
unableto but also works with honorable
and the two ports means that you can
also connect another turnable device to
the host through it now the G speedier
share the power status with the host
device and it can wake up from the sleep
mode almost instantaneously that's a big
improvement over other rate system that
I've revealed and so one other thing
there this one here makes a very loud
beep sound whenever it wakes up or turns
on let me show it there you go
you actually live in app to start up me
and I am NOT very easy to be startled
well there's a button on the back here
that supposedly turned off that sound
but it doesn't work now if you prepare
for that and the other minor thing which
is money this one will make a great
accessory for your mac pro for more it
check out my full width
you see Netcom basically if you do
something super fast and super spaces or
just don't know what to do with your
money
this one will make a great investment
which make it even better if you get to
play with it for free that's because I'm
Domino and this has been the first look
as the G speed studio are from GTECH</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
