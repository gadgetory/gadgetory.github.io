scanning apps and plenty of amazon
freebies the fire phone is definitely
unique among its peers Amazon's
innovations and attention to detail put
it on the right track but performance
snags scared with a high price tag make
it a hard sell in an already crowded
space I'm jessica's all court for Cena
showing you the good and bad of Amazon's
the fire phone like Amazon's tablets is
based on Android code but it has an
interface that's entirely its own I
really like the carousel of oversized
widgets and the related content or
recommendations below and yes you can
pin items to the carousel to keep them
there or clear them out a swipe or chart
of your wrist gets you context and
navigation menus on either side of the
screen I am personally a fan of the fire
phones rich visuals especially in the
lock screen amazon has sprinkled some
other 3d like experiences throughout the
phone as well including on the map and
in some of the games and apps on the
topic of apps the fire phone doesn't
work with any Google Play services so
you can't download anything from the
Google Play Store which doesn't exist it
means that there's no you tube or
hangouts the proprietary app store is
stocked with a lot of popular titles but
amazon has a little bit of work to do if
it wants to fill in the holes if you
need any help along the way whatsoever
Mayday connects you to a customer
service rep for free sharing your phone
screen through video chat it's pretty
neat actually on the visual front the
fire phone's design reaches for
understated elegance in other words it
looks like every other all-black phone
for me it's 4.7 inch screen hits a sweet
spot for wielding it with one hand and
sticking it in a pocket glass on the
back pumps up the premium value but also
makes it more breakable luckily a soft
rubberized band around the sides helps
with grip the 720p HD resolution is on
the lower end especially as we're seeing
our first quad HD screens still because
of the fire phone sub 5-inch screen it's
312 PPI is still visually immersive the
13 megapixel camera on the back takes
pretty nice photos they may not be the
pinnacle of crisp detailed smartphone
imagery but they are absolutely
shareable through social media 10 8
EP HD video capture is also good and a 2
megapixel camera on the front does the
job camera settings and controls are
sparser than I'd like but you will find
HDR panorama and a mode called
lenticular that helps you create your
own 3d photo effects conveniently the
button on the phone side is a physical
camera shutter if you press down on the
same shutter button up pops firefly
which scans the world around you it
matches barcodes and products to
amazon's online catalog but can also
identify phone numbers and email
addresses plus songs TV shows and movies
Firefly is one way to get you spending
on Amazon but other services are wrapped
in as well like Amazon Instant Video and
Amazon music if you don't renew prime
after your first free year you'll lose
all those perks but you will get to keep
the free online photo storage either way
despite the quad-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon 800 processor performance was
a little laggy particularly on load
times for the 3d effects battery life
also drain faster than i wanted and
little quirks with missing notifications
got in the way amazon will surely smooth
over all those snags but in the meantime
you have to figure out exactly how much
amazon services are worth it to you the
fire phone costs two hundred dollars on
contract through AT&amp;amp;T which is the same
price as other top-tier Android phones
ultimately Amazon's first smartphone is
interesting and even pretty good but if
you're not a frequent Amazon user it's
best to move on I'm Jessica doll court
