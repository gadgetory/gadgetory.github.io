HBO I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
cnet update if you don't subscribe to
Amazon Prime well you may change your
mind because Amazon just sweeten the
deal almost every hit HBO TV show
including The Sopranos the wire and true
blood will be available to stream on
Prime instant video if you're not
familiar with prime instant video it's
basically Amazon's version of netflix
and the cost is about the same a little
over eight dollars a month HBO gave
Amazon the exclusive rights to stream
its older programs and seasons of the
newer shows like girls the newsroom and
veep well they'll also come to Amazon
but you'll have to wait three years
after the season airs on TV HBO is
hoping that you'll binge watch on Amazon
get caught up on the plot but then
you'll be so hooked to the show that
you'll feel compelled to pay for HBO
when the new season rolls around on TV
but sorry if you like Game of Thrones or
true detective because you still have to
pay for HBO to see those it's not part
of the deal the HBO programming arrives
on Amazon next month on May twenty first
and if Amazon keeps it up with these
exclusive deals Netflix will be in
trouble but that's not the only big
streaming news Roku owners can finally
watch youtube videos on their streaming
boxes this is kind of a big deal because
Roku devices were able to access pretty
much every single internet streaming
feed that existed but there was no
YouTube channel available until now well
technically the new roku 3 had it in
December but now everyone with a Roku
can use it and if you're watching a
YouTube video on your smartphone or
tablet a button on the app can throw it
to the Roku so everyone can watch it on
the big screen TV you know this amazon
HBO news is also good news for roku you
can't stream amazon on apple TV or
google's chromecast basically Roku has
become master of the streaming universe
but not all change in technology has
been for the best this week take for
example Twitter's new profile it will
eventually roll out to everyone but some
brave souls have manually switched to
the new look
the link to switch is on Twitter's blog
but before you dive in brace yourself
your main twitter feed looks all normal
until you click on your profile and oh
my that is not pretty you may need to
re-upload a header picture so it won't
look so blurry and stretched across the
screen seems like Twitter wants to be
the professional blog page that you
don't mind sharing on a resume with its
clean white background and big Facebook
feel in the new design you can also pin
a tweet to the top of the page so it
doesn't get lost in your timeline that's
your tech news update you can head to
cnet com for more details on these
stories from our studios in New York I'm
