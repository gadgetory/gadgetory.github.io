at the Isuzu then books ux301 now of
course that Zen book line from Isuzu is
one of the first sort of ultra book
style laptops really very MacBook Air
like these very thin sort of aluminum
laptops people love the design the
latest version of it is actually a
little bit different in two ways one now
these n book has a glass back and you
can see it's Gorilla Glass so you're not
get scratches on it of course if you
didn't have a glass lid for your laptop
you wouldn't get scratches on it anyway
probably but you see it's got this cool
kind of circular pattern to it and it's
guerrilla glass on the front and the
back so hopefully fairly rugged I
haven't broken it yet the other big
thing is this is one of those better
than HD displays that means it's higher
than the standard 1920 by 1080 that you
get an even high-end laptops this guy is
2560 by 1440 some of the better than HD
laptops go all the way up to 3200 by
1800 it can't really tell the difference
it's all sort of in the same category as
let's say the Toshiba cure book or the
Lenovo yoga 2 pro or the retina MacBook
Pro and it's a cool feature to have on a
13-inch screen which is not a super huge
screen you can't really tell the
difference unless you really zoom in on
texture you're gonna edit really large
images in which case the extra pixel
resolution really does come in handy
it's a cool feature now all of these are
better than HD laptops or premium
products they cost a lot this guy
whoever is the most expensive of the
current batch that we looked at this
particular configuration is 1899 and for
that you do get a very high-end low
voltage core i7 processor you get a big
256 gig SSD the egg is RAM and of course
you get that super high-resolution
display now some other guys give you
that high resolution display for a
little bit less a comparable retina
MacBook Pros we've got a hundred bucks
last same thing with Toshiba cure book
if you just want the resolution the
Lenovo yoga 2 pro is actually about
$1000 the other specs are not as good
but you do get that super high res
display if you're gonna pay more for
this guy you do get slightly better
performance the cpu and this was a
little bit faster than most of the other
versions like this but battery life not
quite as good
just about six hours which is not really
all-day battery life and if I was going
to spend 1890 $200 on a laptop that's
kind of what I want I'm Dan acronym that
is the assumes n book ux301</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
