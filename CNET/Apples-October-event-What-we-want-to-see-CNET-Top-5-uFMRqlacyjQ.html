see at Apple's October event Apple has
not officially announced it's holding an
October event at the time of this
recording however it seems likely David
Roberts at our sister site
ZDNet did some research and found that
over the past 10 years papal has held a
second fall event 60% of the time he
also says that the second fall event has
never had a new iPhone but it always had
a Mac announcement there's also been
plenty of iPads so let's talk about what
we want to see from Apple this October
at number 5 is air power
I'm not asking Apple to introduce the
wireless charger it announced in
September of 2017 I'm not asking that
Apple even introduce a replacement
wireless charger at the minimum it would
be great if Apple would explain what on
earth is going on with air power if it
cannot be made the way Apple wanted it
to work just say so but that's
essentially me asking Apple to say oops
we goofed and that's probably not gonna
happen coming at number four our new air
Potts the current model is almost 2 full
years old this is technology we need new
stuff all the time even though it's been
almost 2 years the air pod still look
like you've shoved cigarettes into your
ears
perhaps a refined design would be nice
also the old air pods used bluetooth for
maybe a new model could include
Bluetooth 5 which has improved range a
number of iPhones and the home pod used
Bluetooth 5 so why not have the air pods
join them and number three is TV stuff
you know how we've been hearing about
Apple's TV show dreams there's a new
legal thriller starring Chris Evans
there's some kind of deal with Oprah
another report has steven spielberg
coming back for amazing stories as an
executive producer that's great let's
watch all of those things but where will
Apple keep its shows like Planet of the
apps and carpool karaoke on the Apple
music app will these new shows live in
the TV app maybe there's some kind of
third options Netflix Hulu and Amazon
all chugging along with their services
Disney is gearing up for 2019
where do Apple shows belong it'd be nice
to know
number two new iPad pros in March Apple
took away a big distinction from the
iPad pro pencil compatibility the pencil
now works with the cheapest iPad so
maybe it's time to make the iPad pro
different again the latest iPhones
ditched touch ID entirely maybe it's
time for face ID to hit Apple's tablets
surely the assembly could fit in the
bezel then there's that smart connector
you might have forgotten about it
because they're not a ton of accessories
for it you can connect a keyboard to it
whoop-dee-doo and the number one thing
we want to see it Apple's event is new
Macs
I know computers right so boring no
computers are interesting and useful so
many Mac's are aging and aging meanwhile
tons of other laptops and desktops are
heading into the future
Microsoft is releasing surfaces
everywhere and we're still looking at
the same old Mac's
the MacBook Air is virtually unchanged
in appearance since its introduction how
about the MacBook super-thin nice design
still one USB C port hey I'm now talking
to Apple directly pay attention check
out your own site at Apple calm to the
right of the Apple logo is a word it
says Mac how about remembering you make
Macs and maybe they should be updated is
there anything you want to see from
Apple maybe a new Newton of Pippin to
the return of the iPod stock let us know
am i a zapped iron I'll see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
