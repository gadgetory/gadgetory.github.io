bluetooth headphones out for the 2016
holiday season and this is probably my
favorite of the bunch the summit
wireless a sports model that retails for
$35 I can't tell you that sounds great
but does sound decent enough for the
money and just as importantly fits
comfortably and securely and comes with
a few different silicone tips and wings
that help lock the buds in place I'm
also a fan of the headphones a signature
design feature on the inline remote
which houses the battery microphone and
all the electronics there's a magnetic
clasp it allows you to clip the
headphone to your shirt you can also
wrap the cord around the remote and keep
everything in place with the clasp
battery life is rated at 10 hours at
moderate volume levels and the headphone
is sweat resistant though it's far from
waterproof with only IPX to
certification as you might expect from
an inexpensive wireless headphone you're
not looking at premium build quality
here and I can't tell you how well this
will hold up over several months of use
but for 35 bucks you are getting a
lightweight comfortable wireless
headphone that sounds decent enough and
can be used for running or just walking
around and that's not a bad deal I'm
