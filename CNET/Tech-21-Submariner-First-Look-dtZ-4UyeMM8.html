editor here at seen it today I'm going
to show you the tech 21 Submariner case
now you're probably looking at this
thing one and what the heck it is and I
don't blame you cuz it's big it's yellow
it's bulky but it actually is an
underwater case for your iphone I used
it actually at a pool day in Las Vegas
was floating in the pool all day was
able to use my phone does have this nice
lanyard you can hang it around your neck
you can also remove the lanyard by this
clip I did drop the phone on the pool
deck a couple times it's nice clean hard
concrete no problems no scratches to it
so it insert the phone you undo this
latch twist that 180 degrees open it up
so they can take your iPhone one thing
you'll need to use this case is you will
need the impact band which is also made
by tech 21 it actually is a lot like the
Apple supplied bumpers that they gave
out with the iphone 4 when they had the
intention problem so it looks like that
it's just a little thicker it's a little
stronger I personally like this an awful
lot does make the buttons a little hard
to press when it's on but you will like
I said you will need this to use the
case otherwise the film won't fit in
properly if you don't have this this is
$39 so itself you can use the Apple
supplied bumper it doesn't work quite as
well because it doesn't make the phone
quite thick enough but will just insert
it like this actually before I do that
though there is a case there is a
compartment in the back that you can use
to store maybe money you can store your
credit card so I'll just put in my
clipper card there a couple bucks make
sure this is snapped on just pop it in
like that and close the case tilt this
and flip down the switch now there's a
silicon membrane on the front so that
does allow you to use the touch screen
it has kind of a spongy rubbery feel
it's a little weird at first but got
used to it you can use the home button
that but you do not have access to the
other control so I'm like the lifeproof
case you can't change the volume you
can't do the ringer switch you can't
turn the phone off if you like you can
use UK if you wanna play music you can't
hear the music no problem and if you
want to you can't make a call though
because well you can hear the other
person if the volume is turned all the
way up the other person cannot hear you
this is really for browsing the web
using apps using Twitter or Facebook or
listening to music and you can even
watch videos too
so once this is on completely we'll go
ahead and drop it in I know it did feel
a little nervous about this at first but
no problem so now the phone it actually
does float it floats upside down it
floats vertically which is a little
strange but if you happen to drop it in
the pool it's not going to sink to the
bottom it will float around which is
nice was one thing of course you can't
do is and this is true with a life truth
case you can't use the touchscreen under
water so it's just the touch screen
won't work because it you know
capacitive touchscreens they let they
measure the electricity between your
finger and the touchscreen so it's not
going to work underwater but once you
get it out the water rolls off the
membrane pretty easily and you can keep
using it again one function about the
membrane I don't like is that it's kind
of sticky so it kept attracting hair
kept attracting dust or de dirt and it
just had a general unclean sort of look
to it and it was hard to clean too so
it's one thing I wasn't crazy about the
membrane one thing you can do is you can
take pictures underwater as long as the
top of the screen is above water so is
able to get a couple of interesting
photos like that one thing you want to
watch for though is when you're wearing
the phone around your neck and your and
the phone is in its proper place so
pointed like this with the top of the
phone up near the top of the case it
doesn't mean is going to be upside down
if you're using it like this which is a
little concert which is little you know
it's not very convenient it's a little
confusing you can switch the phone so
you can put it upside down but in that
case the camera lens rubs up against
this angle on the back and so you can't
take photos the photos get distorted in
fact that look somebody's in a funhouse
the head will be up and there will be a
really long kind of blurry neck and then
they'll be their body so that's another
function I didn't quite like but as far
as a case that's pretty indestructible
you can dunk it underwater it is going
to be perfecting from dust from rain
from snow from pretty much anything
drops to the ground this is the way to
go I don't know a price yet because it's
not officially on sale but once it is I
imagine a price of at least fifty
dollars I know that's a lot for a case
but if they need something that's going
to last I than the tech 21 Submariner
case definitely fits the bill i'm kent
german senior rank jeder for seeing it
here with the tech 21 Submariner case
