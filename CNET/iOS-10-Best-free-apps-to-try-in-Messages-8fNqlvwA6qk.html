emojis and filters in the messages app
in iOS 10 but there's a lot more to wrap
your head around so what's the deal with
the apps first make sure you know where
to find them go to the App Store icon
next to your message bubble swipe left
for a quick view of your current apps or
click on the four dots for an overview
now press the plus sign to go to the
store which is the same one you've been
using for other apps in fact any apps
you download in messages will also be
downloaded to your phone but why would
you even need apps and messages let's
start with your basic adding gifts to
your conversation just got easier gift
keyboard has a huge library to choose
from right from the search bar and if
you can't find what you're looking for
you can create one right there on the
message
weird stickers are more your jam try the
free Mario go pack click to send the
individual stickers or press and hold to
drag a sticker onto a photo you've
already sent for a super mario makeover
and it's not just limited to photos and
text spice up your voice memos with
chatter berg just record your message
Luke I am your father and then choose
from one of the sound filters or just
send a sound effect you can waste the
day away sending sound effects and gifts
but you can also do practical things in
messages if it's a date night you're
planning OpenTable and Fandango have you
covered pick a restaurant category
narrow down a time at the top to see a
list of options select the ones you want
and send it to your date to make the
final call you can reserve right from
this window same thing goes for movies
click on the title choose a time and
location purchase your tickets and share
everything with one tap and if you're
splitting the bill don't bother opening
the app because you can send a payment
right from the chat window with square
cash or venmo
to delete apps press and hold as you
would in your app homescreen and get rid
of the ones you're not using it may
sound more complicated than before but
chances are once you have it down you'll
be spending way more time in the
messages up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
