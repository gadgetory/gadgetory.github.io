blu-ray player it's no longer necessary
to spend hundreds of dollars while the
latest for Cape players are still around
400 bucks you can get a standard BD
player for $100 or less it will do
almost everything you need and it will
still look good on a 4k television these
days most blu-ray players perform about
the same in terms of picture quality and
the biggest differences are actually in
speed is difficult to tell a cheaper
name-brand from more expensive one by
how well it plays a movie but load times
are where the improvements show the
closer you get to $100 the more likely a
player will have a snappier processor
for example this means the difference
between waiting a minute for Netflix to
load as opposed to 10 seconds blu-ray
discs will also load quicker with a
better player if you're into streaming a
good blu-ray player can replace a Roku
box or your televisions Smart TV
interface but try and make sure that the
player has the services you use most in
some cases you might be better off with
a Roku almost no players have HBO when
shopping for a blu-ray machine look for
convenience features as well for example
some remote controls also include
shortcuts for services such as Netflix
which can save you time also try to find
a player that has the same inputs as you
have on your TV or sound system some
players only have an HDMI port and this
won't work with most sound bars the bad
news for people with all the TVs if your
screen only has analog inputs such as
the red green and blue component cables
a modern blu-ray player won't work these
days they're digital only if you're
worried about 4k blu-ray making HD
players redundant don't worry 4k and HD
will coexist for a long time for example
if you buy a 4k disc now it comes with
the 1080p version in the box and many
movies will never come out and for
spending a hundred bucks on a good 1080p
player now is a smarter move the waiting
years for 4k to come down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
