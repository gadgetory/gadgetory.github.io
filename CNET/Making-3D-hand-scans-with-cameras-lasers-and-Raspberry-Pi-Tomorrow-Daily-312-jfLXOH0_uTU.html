welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe
I'm Jeff kanata together you're watching
our headlines episode so let's hit
capturing 3d images of the human body
can be a little bit tricky because we
tend to move around but the cure a show
hand scanner aims to fix that PHR
schmuck Minh is a student at the Delft
University of Technology and he noticed
that 3d scans of hands were tough to do
because as I mentioned people tend to
move during the procedure so he created
the curio the final prototype consists
of 32 cameras laser projection and is
powered by a Raspberry Pi when a person
puts their hand into the machine the
lasers create a lot of different
reference points for a modeling software
to use and the cameras all snap a photo
at the exact same time Smok Minh thinks
the cure a show can be used for a wide
range of products from 3d printed casts
all the way to sports equipment yeah
this is super cool but if they're
looking for a celebrity spokesperson
I hope they consider horatio sanz for
curie she owes hands huh because he's
available I'm sure next hey switching
from a medical story to a one about
pottery
check out how music can influence the
making of pots one day olivier van herb
noticed loud music changing the form of
a 3d printed object and was inspired to
create something similar
instead of accidentally changing the
form he worked with sound designer Rick
even broke joven and mounted a speaker
directly under a 3d printer designed by
ven herb to make clay pots while the
printing process happens the speaker
emits low-pitched sound pulses causing
the pot to vibrate and change its
pattern the final products are beautiful
intricate pots with some personality to
them so interesting that sound can be
used as a physical manipulator but I'm
curious what it would be like if you
used actual songs yeah something really
bass heavy yeah a good EDM track yeah me
a wub wub pot I want to see
Run DMC's pot wait a minute one pot
whoops alright guys that's it for our
