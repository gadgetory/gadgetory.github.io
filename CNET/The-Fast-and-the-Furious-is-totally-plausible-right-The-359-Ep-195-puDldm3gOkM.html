359 podcasts episode 185 on Thursday
March 16th and this morning we are
joined by Ben Fox Rubin and Roger Cheng
and we're talking about cars yeah we
kind of I don't know talking with a fast
and furious yeah that is at scores
that's basically I it's the Thursday
show so I'm not prepared you've already
checked out for the way you can pletely
check out I took the day off yesterday
you're gonna go to the meet you how
would be a really interesting scene for
you at the beach in this weather it's
like 20 degrees outside forever forever
all right so we'll be talking about the
fast and furious and see that's
exclusive interview with ludacris yeah
suck with luck in the Magus and yes the
scene that magazine came out new stance
yesterday and are there's the online the
interview is available on our site I
will be talking about that just a
plausibility of some of the insane
antics that show up in the delays fate
of the Furious trailer antics antics
that's a good work yeah I will also be
talking about Google tango we got a
chance to check it out at a local Lowe's
and as well the lastly Google family
link a lot of Google today which will
allow parents to give their children
children under 13 access to an android
account in google services which they
haven't actually been able to do legally
the fair I mean people break the rules
all the time with that but now you get a
chance to do it and spy on your kids
bonus bonus if you're a parent you're a
kid that's probably not cool now yeah so
let's let's get started as always if you
have any questions leave them in the
comments section Brian will get to them
and we will answer them in three minutes
59 seconds from 32
welcome to the 359 when we talk about
the top tech news of the day and all the
other crap you want to throw it I'm
Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox Rubin are you a
fan of The Fast and Furious franchise
Cena had a chance to talk with ludacris
who plays Tash in the blockbuster
franchise when you get a chance pick up
a copy of the magazine hit the
newsstands yesterday check out the
interview it's also online it's nice
segue though to talk about the latest
fate of the Furious trailer the latest
movie the eighth movie is franchise
which has self-driving cars and the rock
punching torpedoes into tanks right so
the self-driving cars thing I feel was
just inevitable right that we're gonna
see somebody take over all the
self-driving cars on the road and use it
for mayhem uh if that wasn't exactly
already done in a Batman movie you know
I guess I guess you might as well do it
in a tenement period it's a great and in
keeping with the fast-food franchise
over-the-top scene which surely thrown
swipes at our tablet and seemingly every
car in New York City comes under her
command it's it's kind of funny insane
scene but it's uh it definitely speaks
to kind of the fear that people have
with self-driving cars the Hassi right
even in the interview that ludacris
gives seen any sort of talks about how
he doesn't see a time where humans
completely get you know sort of wiped
off that the driver rightly trusts the
instincts of human drivers more than a
robot which is which is interesting
because you would think that like a
robot would have faster response time
right especially with the way of
processors of the way computers have
gone faster and faster that I imagine
that in terms of split second reaction
time eventually computer is gonna
override or surpass humans right right
that being said it's always enjoyable to
see Hollywood chumming the water and
trying to scare the hell out of people
when it comes to new types of
technologies started with all for the
sake of making a buck right yeah all
right next up CNN had a chance to test
out tango Google's new indoor mapping
technology at a local Lowe's it can lay
out virtual path for you to basically
point out what where you want to but
where you want to find the thing you
learn I so you don't the bug an employee
for directions you can never find one I
mean like that's the thing that I find
really frustrating is is that like if
you go to home depot or lowes
you can never find a person and if you
joined a person you can't find the right
person they're like oh I work in
lighting I mean I think that's why the
technology is fantastic or it's useful
yeah it's wholly useful only sad part is
it is only available on one phone grand
novo fab to pro which chances are you
probably never even heard of yeah I've
heard of it only because it's a tango
enabled phone right so you do need a
tangle enabled phone and the good news
about that is that more tango phones are
coming out all the time so that's slowly
going to start rolling out but yeah this
technology is rolling out to hopefully
to a phone near you unfortunately not
iPhones yeah that's okay we'll see what
happens in September also more google
news google created a new tool called
family link for android phones it lets
parents set up their kids google
accounts which technically wasn't
allowed for kids under 13 and it lets
parents monitor what apps their kids are
using tracks kids physical locations
maintain app installations established
screen time rules yeah this is a lot of
regulation there but at the same time
it's useful for kids now you can use
google stuff totally it's it's
interesting because a lot of kids
already have google account or android
accounts you know they were I guess set
up technically illegally in regulation
those terms and services do you think
kids are I mean kids with existing
accounts do you think they'd they'd
actually would willingly subject
themselves that's a great question this
new like big brother-type regime at the
very least for new users parents at
least have something to push their kids
into yeah so maybe they don't actually
know these these other less restrictive
mechanics as sort of a first as an entry
into android this is excellent but if
you already have android using google
that that might be a problem for a
pretty convincing your kid well we're
both parents well and what age do you
feel you're comfortable giving access to
android or to google for your kids like
two or three Wow yeah well yeah it's
really touchy these days i was gonna say
like 12 or something what you know I'm
an old man what can I say all right for
more of these stories chicken sound of
CNN I'm Roger chain I'm Ben Fox Rubin
thanks for listening
first and foremost shout out to Yahoo
we're sorry the Alex and Cooley couldn't
join us on this episode but we
absolutely need to have them on the show
if we're gonna talk about cars again
that's jarett oh yeah yeah we'd love to
have them on the show aye sir there
aren't necessarily hard it's hard
especially likely I mean even when
they're in SF they're not really in SF
they're traveling around yeah Showtime
Chang wrangle those guys down or like
Tim Stevens or any of them they're
always doing photo shoots you know
remote photo shoots remote drives
minutes and I have much cooler jobs than
us but obviously I know them Brian
Cooley never misses an episode so sir
stop by sometime right by the way we
wanted to mention this on the show we
didn't get to it else only four minutes
I would like to send a shout out to
Michael Haverly for being the one
awesome person in the universe to send
me a penny through venmo for my birthday
I made that request a couple days ago
just to see if it would work and here it
is um Michael thank you very much sir
michael have really your hero you are a
hero and i will realize that one place
you know ethically speaking you should
then know him a penny right back yeah
but it's my birthday presents bro I
don't want to insult the man well it's
the only come anyway doing the only
petty actually different pay you're
keeping the penny that he said to you oh
I'm sharing a new penny Oh different
penny all right really want to keep the
penny moving on we got a question from
yothu uh why is the project tango
limited to the only the lenovo phone
well I mean the Lenovo data or it's not
no it's it's full of it's a full mature
product what happened with Lenovo and
Google kind of work together on this
project for a prolonged specifically
well no no not for low is just Lenovo
and Google had a relationship to work on
project tango initially was called
project tango so lenovo basically got
first dibs at this and they were willing
to kind of build a phone to to take
advantage of the technology it's not
just a matter of software they actually
had to have multiple cameras i think
it's like four or five different cameras
sense depth to sense different kinds of
factors and so it actually take
different hardware and so it's a little
bit more difficult for a phone maker to
go in and you know tweak their phone to
include different cameras and sensors
for the technology it's not just
software so that's that's why you don't
see it a lot hopefully tango comes to
more phones but it is kind of a an issue
if you only have one or even two cameras
well at this point you wonder if that
will become an enticement for other
phone makers to start including that
technology as an attribution or if the
retailer's start to develop you know
like a pocket thing you pick up on your
way in with your cart yeah or build into
the cart or something like that so you
don't have to necessarily install it
it's just pre built on today I'm
shopping I would say the more
cost-effective way I mean what retailers
are hoping I think it's this technology
goes into people's phone so they just
pull it out of their own pockets instead
of handing over and investing in these
playing like smart devices yeah smart
shopping tablets or whatever trust they
build it right into the cart that would
be something like that idea but I think
Rogers right that enemy that's a
liability on the store right and also
write like how many people I'm just
gonna make off the cart yeah people make
off with the cards anyway yeah yeah so
that I mean it's not like it's gonna do
you any good outside you know were
though right but there is some hope that
like you know Apple I mean the iphone 7
has dual cameras set up which with depth
sensors so the hope i think is with a
sort of future technology as the
technology kind of gets better Apple can
incorporate some of the stuff into their
cameras as well into their dual camera
setup right and as more of the stuff
comes out you're going to see more
augmented reality capabilities this one
was specifically with lows where you
would be able to like go around in the
store one of the other things that I've
seen is I think Wayfarer does that or
other you know like online furniture
companies where you can see how a couch
is going to be set up exactly in your
house yeah so you press the button and
then it kind of opens the box and shows
you in like in the depth exactly yeah
then we say some of the widest
technology in at CES is here with a like
an AR game where it kind of reads the
room and yeah your answer yeah objects
into like game I mean feature things
yeah at major Congress last
demo for I believe this out a non tosh.o
which was the automaker but like you got
basically with the phone you can see the
full car you could walk towards the car
we get closer you can actually get into
the car move your phone around you can
see what the interior looks like what
the exterior looks like you customize
what it looks like so there's definitely
applications out there for and I think
retailers see a big opportunity for it
but it's just the challenges getting
that technology out to devices props to
Pamela for smart carts she called it she
also wants to know if you guys think
that the if the s8 will be a tango
enabled phone I would bet know very
little little too late for that one but
maybe next round yeah fine what is it
the asus zenfone is expected to come out
later this year also with tango so
here's the problem these are called
phone makers that no one cares about the
u.s. well that's probably why they're
putting bets down on tango right because
they want if they want a way to
differentiate themselves yeah for sure
um prom is just especially for US
consumers like we're not we're not buy
lenovo or a sous phones right we're
we're buying iphones or samsung phones
yeah so and and it's you're really
looking at a very small segment of the
population that's so interested in tango
that they're gonna go out of their way
to get one of these phone makes I mean
look I mean the compromise could be like
you get retailers or you get hotels to
you know buy some of these phones
specifically and make sort of specific
apps for mmm you know for their
particular service let's talk about Fast
and the Furious let's do this you guys
are more familiar with it than I am I'm
sort of i think this is our fastest yeah
I've had this like kind of love hate
relationship with it like I really like
that first movie which is compass
grounded film based on an actual news
story about the illegal racing scene
well it was also a remake of a movie
from no it wasn't a remake it didn't
borrow the netball dinnae got it but the
premise was off of an article August a
recent scene then I started then estar
to kind of drag out kind of didn't like
it but I was played out then it kind of
got better again with the fifth movie
and has grown increasingly awesome with
like each movie is it like it kind of
amped up the ridiculous levels of
done special effects to point where
nothing makes sense anymore it's it's
kind of cartoony but it's become almost
like Avengers like and it's it's
awesomeness right yeah they are kind of
superhero away where they can't possibly
they were I mean they were what's a John
Rahn it's when the franchise began they
were basically there was a cop and
street racers and now they're basically
international spies with MacGyver level
skill sets right and they usually like
it hack into anything they drive drive
they drive cars like off of like giant
high-rises a job signs like the last
trailer he jumps a submarine while the
rock punches the torpedoes Oh kind of
Awesome and reading graves yahoo that is
not a fan of movies without any of the
ties to actual physics so do not like
Star Wars physics in Star Wars what's
your what's your favorite Roger Pamela
likes fast five the best I agree I'm a
big fast five I look that was the one
that really was a turning point also
they became super awesome criminal
mastermind robbers and when did that
happen I like what yeah at what point
did they get all these skill set today
like they brought back characters from
older movies and they started tie it all
together the idea of the whole family
the family theme kind of I think it
started it got created in that movie
really all right yeah what uh I haven't
even gotten a chance to look at the
magazine yet what did lieu de loop us
into in his discussions I mostly it was
a she did he act a fool act a fool there
was no reference to that at all i was a
little disappointed that's my favorite
part of passage is that song oh no you
talked a little bit about self-driving
cars how obviously he's not a fan of
them yeah while he appreciates the
technology again he still thinks that
there should be a human behind the wheel
that this is more healing place that is
more fun though you can replace for him
you can replace that kind of split
second decision making yeah that that
only human have versus computer so which
is more logic based right I think he's
forced to say that because he's a fast
and furious star right it's like that
movie would be so boring if it was
self-driving cars being except there
except there are self-driving cars in
the next friday which is those are the
those are the bad guy cars I don't know
when the next fast fast nine right
that I sign they're sleeping in the back
some to work last nine the credit roll
Google uh actually one of the more
interesting things he fell he still just
his main cars in 1993 acura what yeah
like he's had two hundred seventy three
thousand miles on it and actually I'm
sure he's put a lot of acura actually
effort into it well no like because like
he's had the car for so long and they no
longer make parts for it like Acura
stepped in to help them like refurbish
the car entirely no kidding because like
it was the only one with one on the road
so kind of kind of cool that is kinda
retro tech cars yeah what if they bring
it back because of that just like the
Nokia that's true it does not beyond the
realm of absolutely holy cow that'd be
kind of cool to see though yeah i mean
like look at volkswagen did with the bug
that can it came back from the ether and
granted it took a completely different
spin on it but it was like the return of
the bug and it's got kind of a retro if
it was hugely successful and now we saw
the detroit auto show this year they're
bringing back the bus really well
there's otherwise now the big the big
volkswagen so yeah yeah you know the old
hippie wagon yeah um it's it's a
slightly different version of that and
it's super autonomous but it's what is
super autonomous mean I mean all I'd
like to think the booth was across from
us I didn't get to experience it but
just kind of glancing at it basically
look like a hippie robot on wheels so I
can only drive drives by itself it
seemed to yeah but again this was in the
concept phase I can't tell you much more
about it i'm not an authority on cars
obviously but it looked kind of cool and
it's like again like this whole retro
tech thing is starting to branch out
mm-hmm I wonder where else it goes yeah
would Lou to replace his car with a
brand new Acura version I don't know he
seems pretty partial to that 93 accurate
I don't want to know which model
actually I come 93 acura I'm guessing
it's an integra that's what I'm hoping
for it's an acura integra because i
remember back in my school days like
that was like the hot car that you
customized I couldn't I couldn't afford
to do it but it was out of the honda
accord those two cars were like well a
sitting those three like I had a mind as
my friends at civics we all have like
minds don't know their mufflers I mean
they've been full on kids in the back
the yeah
was I wasn't cool enough to do that yeah
here's a question from mahfouz he says
why haven't we seen totally AI
integration in the new autonomous cars
have you not seen terminator yeah well I
mean I think we're common is stepping
stone to that right now I think car
makers want to eventually get AI full
into it but they're things are missing
right like processing power isn't strong
enough network connection isn't there
yep you need to have everything
connected really for AI to work properly
and on the regulation front we just
don't have rules on that yet I think car
makers aren't really wound and they're
lying some yet push back yeah as well
there and I think it's smart that
they're going extra slow on this
ironically because that's us you're
putting a robot killing machine on the
street right to sounds the sights of
fear-mongering angry I mean to sound
like that but bring it back to Ludacris
just the idea that like that can be
hackable mm-hmm it's a big fear and I
think that's stopping both automakers
and consumers from really embracing that
idea and I think if anything's been
proven over the past year that like
literally anything can be hacked and yes
it's any system can be and my interest
is is if you create what is it atomic
storage then maybe you don't actually
need the cloud for these things to
actually function properly they don't
need an internet connection they could
actually have full autonomous vision
doesn't have them all connected right
yeah well that way they would actually
be able to like see each other I was
just trying to think like how could you
have an autonomous car that doesn't
actually need an internet connection
would make it much much harder to hack
it you would have to like break into the
car and like you know put a thumb drive
in there so so to close out the show
today let's let's predict the the next
fast and furious we said they're gonna
have autonomous car self-driving cars to
an extent but what if they had like a
spy GaN this shot an atomic storage chip
onto a non-atomic car and or non
autonomous car and made it smart whoa
whoa oh my god I was gonna say something
stupid like smart drones but that's way
better right they should also and going
to transform and then it becomes a
transformers classic yeah oh my god yes
make all of my money right it's we're
basically this close to that actually
out so God please do you know what we
can write the script for the next movie
that's where it would probably make the
same amount well you guys got Ludacris
is number still from the other games
you're friends with a now what up Chris
just you know transformers come on dude
make it happen leave the same studio no
no I don't know either oh not there not
so before we close it out for the day we
want to make another plug for our yes
200th episode coming up on marched 29th
30th I forget what's the 22 Mon Dec 22
mar 30th yeah March 30 acres are big 227
that's a monday did I say that wrong I
don't know i Doan the calendar in front
of me I'm so kind of and we we got a
little messed up too because I think
it's a Monday the 27th okay monday the
20 something so what we're looking for
here is we want to celebrate one of our
most dedicated commenters if you go back
through 195 episodes worth you will find
at least a baker's dozen from this kid
named Christian many comments regularly
and I quote I want to punch Roger Cheng
in the face and it's become our mantra
we actually warm up every episode by
chanting that oh yeah okay that's fine I
do intercourse we do I like I want to
punch myself it is I know that's how you
get yourself so what we're looking for
is to celebrate somehow keeping the show
going uh if you look down in the show
notes in the description you're gonna
find a link to a jpeg of a high-res
photo of Roger we want you to take that
picture download it and then show us how
you would punch Roger Cheng in the face
is a joke no you actually did this we
did that yeah so I'm baffled where we
want your creativity so if you want to
print it off put it on a punching bag if
you want to take it and put it into
little animation screen or something
like that go nuts we just we love gifs
yeah anything you can come up with send
it my email is in there and if we like
it we're going to include it and show in
the twentieth episode give you credit
maybe we'll find a way to get you a
t-shirt or a prize or something we don't
know yet but we the whole point of this
show is the interactivity well put fifty
percent is a four minute podcast you can
take on the go
the rest of it is 20 minutes of us
screwing around rambling and getting to
get getting started you guys yeah every
single morning except fridays but yeah
please send us along your punches your
punch Roger in the face we want to see
your best effort and feel free to tag
feel free to join in on this by the way
or anytime between now and the end of
next week which would be march to 24th
right yeah so Friday the 24th is a
deadline send us video links downloads
however you want to serve it up and yeah
we look forward to seeing your your
contributions to the Grand franchise
that is the 359 best I can't believe
we're actually doing this idea
especially our well well about inclusion
he grows and on that note on that note
