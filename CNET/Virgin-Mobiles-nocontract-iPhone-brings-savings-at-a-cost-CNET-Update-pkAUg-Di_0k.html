avoid password stamps and quit your
mayor obsession already I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update it's
confirmed the iphone is coming to virgin
mobile at the end of June but you'll
have to drop a hefty 650 bucks to get
the 4s and that's because there's no
two-year contract plans start at thirty
dollars a month and if you do the math
that's technically cheaper in the long
run than spending two hundred dollars
and being tied into a more expensive
monthly bill for two years but you'll
get less talk minutes a virgin uses the
sprint network and if Android is more
your style Samsung's flagship phone the
galaxy s3 will soon be available in all
carriers expect this to be a hot seller
it's coming to Sprint and t-mobile on
jun 21st verizon 18 sprint already began
taking pre-orders this week it'll come
in white and blue and this summer ATT
will be selling a red version there have
been several password security breaches
this week after linking confirmed that
hackers compromised user passwords a
harmony sends out an alert that many of
its user passwords were also hacked
anyone who has been compromised will
have their passwords reset and will be
prompted to create a new one but that's
not all even the music service last.fm
has also recommended that its users
should change passwords after
discovering some passwords have been
linked and with all this news of
passwords being exposed some seriously
shady websites have popped up stay away
from websites that ask you to enter your
password to see if you've been hacked
I'm seeing these pop up on social
networks even if you think it's trust
where they do not give some random
website your password to check anything
just change it yourself to be safe and
the biggest danger with password
security breaches is that hackers will
try your password on several sites like
trying to key in many locks to see how
many they can open so make your
passwords different for any site that
stores personal information if it's a
word in the dictionary it's really easy
to crack if you want something memorable
and complicated abbreviate a song lyric
or phrase and spice it up with some
numbers and upper and lowercase
characters
today's appt to watch is foursquare it
just got an overhaul in design and
functionality the focus is shifting away
from the race for points badges and
getting crowned mayor the coffee shop
it's more about discovering new places
and reading recommendations from other
users at the center is the explore
button which pinpoints what places near
you have a bargain or special and which
are popular at the moment on foursquare
users can also like and comment on other
check-in that's your tech news update
