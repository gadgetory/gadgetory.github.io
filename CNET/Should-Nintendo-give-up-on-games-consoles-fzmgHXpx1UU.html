analysis uh I you know you're right some
of the console ham right some of them
come and seen going nintendo is perhaps
the most famous gaming company in the
world but it's no secret that the
company has fallen on slightly harder
times in the last few years and around
that there have been rumors that it's
going to get more into mobile gaming and
maybe less away from consoles but is
that a good idea for Nintendo rob
crossley is here he is a gaming expert
from GameSpot which is CNET's sister
site Rob you think that Nintendo should
stick with consoles why I think Nintendo
should stick with consoles because there
is only one constant in video games and
that is that fans of a franchise or
friends of an IP will pay a premium
price for high quality entertainment
Nintendo are perhaps the best company in
the world providing premium
entertainment so console is the best
place for them to do that I would
absolutely agree the Nintendo provides
brilliant high quality grade
entertainment I think that they're
probably the in all the video games of
the company with the best track record
maybe when it comes just two video games
I would agree yet right but Nintendo has
a pretty bad track record when it comes
to consoles you know it's made some very
iconic ones like the sort of NES and I
mentioned the Game Boy but then you've
got other ones that like the the sort of
the n64 in the Gamecube in the world
yeah and the wii u and the three DS
consoles that are sort of beloved by
people who owned them but commercially
didn't really do very much for nintendo
so don't you think it would make more
sense for them to basically take what
they're good at which is making great
games and sort of ditch the things that
they couldn't do in the past you know
things that haven't been working I think
that's an excellent one-sided analysis
oh you know you're right some of the
console am right some of them come and
seen going some of the console's haven't
done too particularly well but the
reason why their games do so well is
that the designers know the hardware
inside and out the
thing about Nintendo is they make
hardware and software in the same house
in the same place and because of that
they can create games which are awesome
basically that because they have the
insight if you suddenly say to them hey
make a game for iPhone then they're
designers who have been working on
controllers for two decades are going to
go all right over this is brand new to
me so they won't have that expertise
they wouldn't have that skill they were
never experienced so I think if they
move to other platforms you know I think
the quality will be diminished somewhat
right yeah that wasn't you know if you
if you sort of it's not impossible to
imagine a world where Nintendo is
bringing some of the great gaming minds
to bear on another platform I mean the
you're right because they know the
hardware inside out but but I don't
think it would be in that doesn't feel
like such a huge opposite obstacle to
you and like Nintendo has a reputation
for being actually a very
forward-thinking company I wonder if
Nintendo couldn't be the you know it's
got it you got Nintendo Sony and
Microsoft and it feels like at some
point someone's gonna have to be the
bigger man and say hello what are we
doing what what is the point you know
it's like it's like it's like in Game of
Thrones it's like Daenerys Targaryen
it's like sometimes Sony's on top and
sometimes Microsoft's on top of
Nintendo's on top you want someone to
break the word yet no Tendo has to break
the wheel you know I don't consider it
losing to give up on consoles I consider
it old if you look at if you look at the
PlayStation and the xbox two consoles
which I absolutely do yeah over the past
ten years they have done the same thing
they've gone through the same route
right and if you look at the PlayStation
4 controller it's pretty much the same
as a PlayStation 1 controller has been
much evolution and the same SAP is true
for the Xbox as well make those consoles
don't evolve too much they just become
bigger and bigger media entertainment
hubs basically bright yeah where's if
you look at nintendo's consoles they go
off in different directions i mean you
had the wii which was i mean people were
laughing when they first saw the way
because it was just his waggling stick
it was insane yeah and then they moved
they went from that to the
you which is like a tablet console
hybrid thing yeah Nintendo's hardware
team like to innovate from hardware
right and they like to inform how their
software works from hardware they like
being creative and I guess like if
you're in the business of just making
money then fine you know just try-try
shipping on other platforms but I think
inherently they have a corporate culture
of wanting to do something wanting to do
more than selling stuff I think they
want to create something which makes
them proud and I think that's true and a
lot of Technology and entertainment
companies all right that is persuasive
because you have you've turned me around
the idea that like an int endo at noon
invit intend o console could be the best
of all possible world but you also
mention the xbox and playstation and
let's talk about this realistically
because the wee while a fantastic
success initially ultimately found it
that it didn't have the right hardware
to impress third-party developers and
over its lifespan we saw the xbox 360
and the playstation 3 sorta you know
like creep up on it and then with this
new generation we've we've just seen
Nintendo drop right back and Microsoft
and Sony plow ahead so even even if you
know there's there's some great you know
it brilliant new hardware experience
that Nintendo has waiting in the wings
can it realistically come back from the
position it's at now I'm not sure Sony
and Microsoft are not to be trifled with
these are both these are huge companies
that don't just make games consoles they
have so much money and if it's not only
know if it's not working for Sony they
just draft in some of the extra cash
from one of the bits of the business is
working and the same with Microsoft and
tell you that doesn't have the luxury it
needs to be more competitive needs to be
more nimble ultimately I agree with you
but for the sake of argument okay yeah
if you're exactly what you want a new
technically correct on Nintendo's
position however if you look at their
history the snares they went from the
snares to the n64 the n64 sold less yeah
we're from the n64 to the gamecube the
gamecube sold let's
so they want to downward trajectory in
fact they went from the Nez to the
snares and thus Ned's sold less than the
Nez right right but then they released a
wig and it outsold all of them mmm they
are an innovative company that provide
new ideas in an industry that's
stagnating creatively they always come
up with a new idea sometimes it's the
Virtual Boy and it doesn't sell well at
all yeah but sometimes it's the way and
it becomes the fastest selling console
in history now yes if ninte mean if
Nintendo published on xbox or
playstation they might technically make
a bit more money they have a wider
audience but at the same time the
industry would be would be less creative
they'll be less happening in the
industry they'll be less innovation and
I personally believe there would be less
hardware innovation in the industry I
think in any industry you need a one
company at least ago we're going to go
that route actually and you know it's
what Apple did with with their
smartphones and they're very solid you
know where the Nokia phones they're
great but we're going to go this
direction and the whole world changed
you need a company that's willing to say
we're going to go this direction I'm
going to go we're going to take a new
part sony doesn't do that sony's about
state keeping the course microsoft is
about keeping the course as well so as
much as I agree with you I hope you're
wrong because we do need we do need
innovation all right well that's what
Rob and I think but what do you think at
home let us know in the comments and
stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
