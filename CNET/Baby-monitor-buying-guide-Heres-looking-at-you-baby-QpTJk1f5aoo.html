which baby monitor is the right baby
monitor to buy now you can go really
old-school with some walkie talkie type
devices that are basic but dependable or
you can go really high-tech and
expensive with wearable baby monitors
that are cool but unproven and then
right in the middle of those are video
baby monitors like these here these
devices have the dependability of the
old but a lot of the really cool
features of the new before you decide
which product to drop your money on here
are three questions you need to ask
first do you want to use it just at home
or when you're away two if you just want
to use the device while your child is
napping in the nursery and you're
getting some work done in the living
room then a device like VTech safe and
sound monitor here is a really great
option the camera comes with a separate
base station monitor so you can just set
it up right next to you and glance over
whenever you want to check on your kiddo
now on the other hand if you want to use
your monitor primarily to watch the
child while you're out of the home and
you've left them with a sitter
then consider something like the eye
baby monitor m6s with eye baby anytime
you're out and about you can pull up the
app on your smartphone and check the
live stream feed do you want to use the
monitor on its own or integrate it with
other tech if you want to use your video
monitor independently then most devices
will do the trick
but if you want to integrate it with
other technology like door window
sensors or motion detectors then you'll
want to consider a device like
Panasonic's video baby monitor that has
a hub with it that integrates with other
devices what smart features are
must-haves for you while most quality
video monitors are going to have all of
the basic features like night vision pan
tilt control to weight audio you want to
also check for those extra goodies that
you want for your child Samsung for
instance has recorded lullabies and I
baby has stories that are recorded that
your child can listen to as they go to
sleep getting a push notification on
your phone one sound or motion sets off
an alert on your camera is also a really
nice feature to have once you answer
these three basic questions just match
them up and you'll be able to find the
baby monitor
that meets your needs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
