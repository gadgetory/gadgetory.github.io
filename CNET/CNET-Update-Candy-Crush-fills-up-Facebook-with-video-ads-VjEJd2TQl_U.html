to take over Facebook I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your CNET update another
wave of candy crush game posts may soon
pop up on your Facebook feed a sequel to
the popular puzzle game was released
earlier this month it's called candy
crush soda saga the company behind the
game King has been flooding facebook
with commercials and people are watching
in the first day the video is reviewed
by 100 million people across seven
countries according to King and Facebook
about 70% of people viewed the ad on a
mobile device and to put that in
perspective go back to years ago when
Facebook went public back then only 5%
of mobile ads were on Facebook this year
Facebook is expected to make up about
22% of the global mobile ad market
Google takes up about 50% and in case
you're unaware of this new version now
the candy puzzle includes purple soda
and gummy bears but here's a less than
addicting app for you the Google Maps
app for Android has been updated with a
new feature that may come in handy for
your holiday road trips the app now
shows the current weather at your
destination and if you search for a
place such as a hotel or a restaurant it
will show you some details about the
place maybe even a review t-mobile is
trying to sweeten things up with its
music freedom program customers can
stream music from their phones without
the data being counted against their
plan and now t-mobile has added more
streaming services including Google Play
Music Xbox music and SoundCloud t-mobile
says an average of 200 terabytes of
music is streamed each day on their
network that's about 66 million songs
now if you want to get your
entertainment the old-fashioned way of
picking up a movie at the Red Box video
machine be prepared to pay a little more
on Tuesday December 2nd the price of a
DVD from red box goes from a dollar 20
to 150 a night and blu-rays are two
dollars the kiosks will also increase
the price of games in January to three
dollars a night when it comes to where
technology most folks are familiar with
activity trekking wristbands and
smartwatches
and that kooky Google glass but if
you're the type that wishes you could
wear a camera on your shirt for
continuous monitoring of your day well
there's the narrative clip it captures a
photo every 30 seconds and it just got
an upgrade with a desktop app now along
with the Android and iOS app you can
also use your desktop computer to browse
the endless unflattering and pointless
photos taken from the perspective of
your shirt collar
that's your tech news update form or you
can always head to cnet.com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
