courses and they might help college
students save money and graduate faster
the longer you stay the more you spend
so this is a big huge problem with
student debt approaching trillion
dollars so online is a part of that
solution for the first time students can
enroll in a MOOC that's purely taught
online and receive academic credit
thanks to San Jose State plus a
partnership between San Jose State
University and tech startup Udacity
instead of us standing back and just
lecturing or 50 60 minutes the Udacity
approaches to have an inquiry-based have
the students constantly interacting with
the material students watch short videos
based on this scatterplot then take
quizzes just take a guess this doesn't
affect your grade you learn by making
your brain go crazy you don't do
anybody's listening the pilot program
offers three entry level math classes
costing a hundred and fifty dollars each
much less than the roughly two thousand
dollars it costs to take the class on
campus classes are limited to veterans
high school students and a few others
going forward the hope is to open
enrollment to anyone what we hope is
that this will really help advance
students in their ability to understand
the mathematics master it and even
become confident and excited in the past
Udacity has had trouble with students
dropping out of MOOCs so for this
program there's a key addition mentors
you will get the same level of attention
you'd get normally in college the same
number of hours and those will push you
to be honest and they'll help you to be
there for you when you get stuck a
personal touch in a virtual classroom
many hope that combination helps
students and state universities alike in
