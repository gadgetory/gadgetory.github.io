taking a look at the Frigidaire Gallery
fgt our 1845 qf it's a top freezer
refrigerator with 18.3 cubic feet of
space and it costs $1,000 the smudge
proof stainless finished the curved
handles they look pretty good here
especially for a thousand dollar fridge
on the interior the LEDs are nice and
bright you have separate temperature
dials for the freezer and the fridge and
the temperature readings solid here at
the default setting you want the freezer
to hit zero degrees you want the fridge
to hit 37 those two middle shelves the
bottom shelf and the middle shelf hit 37
point oh and 37.3 as an average over the
three-day test that's great on the
coldest setting we were hoping it would
hit somewhere around 33 degrees and it
did it actually kept everything except
that really cold top shelf above 32
degrees where your foods going to start
to freeze and below 40 where it's going
to spoil more easily according to the
FDA a cool result which means you have a
high usable range in this fridge the
different settings are going to give you
temperatures that are useful for your
food when we put the 18.3 cubic feet of
space to the test it surprised us it did
pretty well it fit all of the normal
groceries we wanted to stuff in there
and a few of our large items like party
platters and cake trays so yeah I like
this thing but there are some kickers
here when you try to move the shelves
for one you're going to find there
somewhere between stuck in place and a
permanent cemented fixture it's really
really difficult and the bigger issue is
that it gets beat by the eight hundred
dollar GE top freezer model in just
about every way that GE performs
slightly better and fits slightly more
and costs 200 bucks less so if you want
a few solid top freezer options this one
deserves to be on your list it is good
enough to be worth your consideration I
just have trouble recommending it
because there is a better fridge out
there that costs
for more be sure to check out my full
review on cnet com for Cena with the
Frigidaire Gallery top freezer I'm
