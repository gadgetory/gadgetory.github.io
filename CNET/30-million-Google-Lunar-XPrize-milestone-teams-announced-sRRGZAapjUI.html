Operations Director for the google lunar
xprize the google lunar xprize is a 30
million dollar prize to land a robotic
spacecraft on the moon and move across
its surface the total prize purse is 30
million dollars and that's the largest
incentive prize ever the milestone
prizes were introduced to give teams a
boost in their preparations towards
liftoff the google lunar xprize started
with over 30 teams now we're down to 18
of which five have been selected for the
milestone prize accomplishment realm the
five selected teams are Astrobotic and
moon Express from America indus from
india part-time scientists from germany
and hospital from japan to reach this
stage the teams had to do two things
define firstly what their critical
technical risks are and secondly how
they plan to overcome them teams have to
demonstrate their technologies and prove
to the judging panel that they've
reached their milestones those five
teams can share in the six million
dollars available if they demonstrate
that they've overcome the specific
challenges that they were selected for
those challenges are spread across three
technical areas landing mobility and
imaging the lunar environment is
incredibly harsh is extremes of
temperature radiation the environment is
a vacuum there's highly abrasive lunar
dust that gets into all of your
equipment the ways these small privately
funded teams will overcome these
challenges will be incredible the
milestone prizes run through to the end
of sep tember 2014 the 13 teams that
weren't selected for the milestone
prizes are still eligible for the grand
prize the second place prize and the
bonus prizes the google lunar xprize is
pioneering the future of space
exploration we're going back to the moon

teams make history</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
