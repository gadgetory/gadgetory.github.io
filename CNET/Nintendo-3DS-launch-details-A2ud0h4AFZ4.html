cnet.com we're here in New York at the
3d s press event Reggie fils-aime a the
president of Nintendo was here giving
some much anticipated details about the
3ds you'll get to experience today not
just a new technology a new device but
the opening of a vast new world in 3d
entertainment something that you haven't
experienced before
not in theaters not on trade shows and
the most obvious change of course is no
glasses nothing comes between you and
your gaming passion we've always seen
ourselves as part of a much larger
entertainment industry and so while the
Nintendo 3ds video games will be eye
popping all by themselves the system
also offers more than enough even for
people who've never played a video game
before and that's because second it can
also deliver 3d video playback
capability and third Nintendo 3ds also
provides immediate 3d photography and 3d
display of those pictures so what are
you getting for that two hundred and
fifty dollar price tag well embedded in
the 3ds is a game tracker a Mii Maker
which allows you to make Me's on the
system as well as face Raiders which is
a game that puts your face into the game
there's a 3d camera and viewer as well
as a 3d video player now everyone wants
to know what kind of games can we expect
on the 3ds
well first party titles that were
announced today include Pilotwings
resort in ten dogs and cats legend of
zelda ocarina of time which is highly
regarded as one of the best games of all
time that's getting a 3d makeover in
terms of third party games we've got
super Street Fighter 4 3d Dead or Alive
dimensions Resident Evil 3d as well as
Madden football so very
citing stuff there's a lot more to check
out at Sina tv.com including game demos
videos and more reactions from the
president here in New York I'm Jeff
Bakalar for cnet.com thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
