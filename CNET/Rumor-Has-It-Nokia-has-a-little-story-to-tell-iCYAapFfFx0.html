has it the show that rounds up the
week's biggest tech rumors and you can
vote on what you think about the rumors
too in the interactive player if you're
watching on cnet this week the Nexus 5
is on its way Facebook is looking for
some ad dollars and Nokia could try to
tell some stories let's get started
first with all the apple news lately
I've hardly had a chance to talk about
another big deal in the smartphone world
the Nexus 5 and with a reveal coming
soon the rumors and leaks are coming
fast and furiously the latest comes in
the form of a log file obtained by the
site my siiii the log appears to confirm
previous suspicions that the new pure
Google phone will have wireless charging
but it also includes a reference to
miracast which is Android mirroring
technology that allows you to wirelessly
throw your android screen to a TV this
is different from the chromecast which
is limited in what it can do the log
also confirms other previously reported
specs like a 5-inch full-hd display a
two point three gigahertz Snapdragon 800
CPU 2 gigs of ram and an 8 megapixel
rear camera and a 1 point 2 megapixel
front camera will hopefully hear more
about the nexus 5 soon which some people
are whispering will be announced
sometime later this month next up the
wall street journal is reporting that
facebook will start providing new data
to the four largest US television
networks CBS FOX ABC and NBC in an
attempt to attract more advertising
dollars to its service just last month
Nielsen revealed that there's a direct
causation between Twitter usage and TV
ratings so obviously Facebook thinks the
same thing about its own site according
to the report the data Facebook will
share will revolve around actions that
users take on the site including likes
comments and shares related to a
particular television episode data will
be gathered from all posts including
private ones but facebook said that data
will be collected anonymously and shown
an aggregate to
protect users privacy um let's hope so
this isn't the first time that Facebook
has been dealing with user information
and it never seems to end well for the
social network and look if I'm taking
the time to like a sister wives episode
then I'm not embarrassed for facebook to
use that information I'm embarrassed for
myself use it Facebook use that info to
your little hearts content and finally
our favorite Twitter leaker evleaks
recently tweeted a screen grab of a
Windows app called storyteller which
looks like a storytelling photo app the
tweet mentions serious and bandit the
alleged code names for Nokia's upcoming
tablet and 6 inch smartphone implying
that the app may be included on both of
those devices based on the name and that
image the app seems to be a way to
organize your photos based on different
themes and events thus creating a story
nokia is really banking on photos it
seems with its Lumia phones really
packing in those megapixels a photo
based story app seems like it's right up
the company's alley I for one tell
stories with pictures all the time like
here's a story about my cat noodle
sleeping and here's a story about my
other cat chowder also sleeping here's a
story about the ramen that I ate okay my
stories would be really boring I guess
anyway nokia world opens up october
twenty seconds so hopefully we'll find
out more about this then what do you
guys think is there room for this when
we already have instagram and facebook
with this app make you want to switch to
Windows Phone don't forget to vote and
leave a comment that's our show
everybody please share your rumors that
rumor has it at cnet com or call us up 1
800 750 cnet and tweet us and tune in
next week for more tech rumors
