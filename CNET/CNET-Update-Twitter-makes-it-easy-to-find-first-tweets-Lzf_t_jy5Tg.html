you've wasted on Twitter I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update
samsung smart watches will cost you a
pretty penny samsung announced the
prices of its new wearable devices the
gear to Smart Watch is $300 the gear 2
neo which is the model without a camera
it costs two hundred dollars and that's
also the price of the cooler looking
gear fit band with a curved screen now
all three of these devices hit stores
april eleventh which is the same day as
the arrival of the galaxy s5 smartphone
I wouldn't rush to be the first with a
gear SmartWatch I mean the gear devices
may be alright but a bunch of
android-powered smartwatches with
Android wear are coming out this year
and the Moto 360 is launching sometime
in the summer you just have to see what
else is out there before dropping three
hundred dollars on a gear in the
meantime android owners you'll have a
new voice command trick to show off to
your friends using the google search app
on android say ok Google take a photo or
you could say take a video if you don't
care to use the magic words ok Google
then you can tap the microphone to say
take a photo and when you do it'll
launch the camera app a prototype
controller for valves upcoming steam
machine game console is going through an
evolution it's keeping its unique touch
pads but adding buttons including
directional up down left and right
buttons this steam machine isn't your
typical video game system it's for
playing pc games on your TV and pc games
are usually programmed for mice and
keyboards and when seen it review or
eric franklin got to play with the
controller this week he said the touch
pads were so sensitive that it was hard
to get used to it during the short time
he tested it and on the topic of game
systems PlayStation owners will have
exclusive access to original TV shows
according to The Wall Street Journal
Sony is working on a TV show called
powers it's based off a comic book and
it will be available on the PlayStation
Network twitter has been around for
eight years and to have some birthday
fun Twitter launched a site where it's
easy to look up your very first tweet
and reshare it you go to first dash
tweets calm and you can look up anyone's
first tweet and yes that is mine it's
pretty funny searching through the first
tweets of many folks as they gripe about
how they finally we'll try this twitter
thing or that maybe they're just trying
to figure out the whole thing you know
what it's still pretty confusing today
for newcomers and that's the challenge
Twitter will have to solve in order to
grow that your technique is update but
you can find more details at cnet com /
update from our studios in New York I'm
