pickup trucks really crash and the top
five car technologies you really care
about it's time to check the tech EC
cars differently she loved them on the
road and under the hood but also check
the tech and are known for telling it
like it is ugly is included at no extra
cost the good the bad the bottom line
this is C net on cars
welcome to C net on cars to show all
about high-tech cars and modern driving
I'm Brian Cooley well thanks to mpg and
clean air targets in California and
about a dozen other states we're getting
some very odd vehicles with plugs in
them these days none more unexpected
than the Mercedes s-class plug-in hybrid
is it a sign of the times a sign of the
future or just the price of doing
business let's drive it and check the
tech
now this is mercedes-benz first plug-in
hybrid but it's not their first hybrid
it's not even their first s-class hybrid
they used to have this unloved beast
called the s400
that was a mild hybrid without the
plug-in part and it did mild things for
the mpg like for better in the city a
bad and 0 better on the highway so
nobody cared it died in 2013 this is a
much more serious animal with a much
bigger battery and the ability to be
plugged in as well as generate on the
fly now back here of course is where the
big battery lives the additional
traction battery for the powertrain this
is clearly taking up some space back
here although it's by no means killing
the trunk this is an eight point seven
kilowatt hour capacity battery to put
that in context compare it to a Nissan
Leaf which is electric only that has a
24 kilowatt hour battery a Tesla Model S
has either a 70 or 85 kilowatt hour
battery so this is a more modest helper
since this car isn't only an Eevee you
charge it right there in what I believe
is the only charging port I've run into
yet that is integrated back here on the
bumper some folks have expressed concern
that that's a very frequently hit part
of a car and how often will that be
disabled by bumps and dings in parking
lots don't know it's a two-hour charge
from flat on a 240 volt circuit which
you'd certainly want to have at your
home
now inside the s550 hybrid is a lot of
familiar territory very plush very
comfortable and this wonderland of duel
giant LCD wide screens
I'm not going to recover all this cabin
technology for that head over to see net
and just search s550 and you'll find our
detailed review of the debut of this in
gas engine form we take all this apart
here's what I want you to notice though
two new controls on the console this one
here has a little battery icon above the
car as you cycle through that you get
four different modes right there on the
instrument panel hybrid is going to be
your most common mode it's your well
understood blend of gas and electric
power --mode is electric power only
silent running and the accelerator pedal
will actually push back if your goosing
it too hard to optimize battery drain
issei v' defends the battery state by
using the electric motor the least and
recharging it the most and charge goes
the furthest it prioritizes charging the
battery above all and doesn't use
electric motor at all honestly there's a
lot of inside baseball here
I bet you'll just leave it in hybrid
mode and this button right here has an e
plus mode it's a separate layer separate
from those four it gets a little complex
here that one among other things is
going to set up camera and radar to look
ahead and if you're closing on a vehicle
in traffic where you have to trounce the
brakes and waste inertia it's going to
prompt you to do so more gently an
earlier conserving momentum now unlike
what you expect to an s-class there's
not some big brawny engine in here it's
fairly small it's a 3 liter gas engine
v6 still ofthey you've got your bright
orange electrical current cables down
here and that means you're attached to
of course the electric motor which is
embedded in the transmission on this
vehicle inside the works of the 7-speed
automatic so it's highly integral for
both adding as well as doing
regeneration of powers going back to the
battery some of the numbers compared to
your base v8s 550 329 horse on this guy
plus another 114 from the e motor give
you an odd 436 total the gas engine car
is 449 so that's 13 better torque here
is 479 pounds feet 516 on the gas via
so we're losing 37 both have the same
7-speed automatic architecture although
the gas engine car can be had all-wheel
drive this hybrid goes to 60 and 5.2
seconds the gas engine car is a little
quicker at 4.8 and of course that big
battery charging apparatus an electric
motor add weight the mpg is notably
improved we're twenty four thirty in the
hybrid just seventeen twenty six without
it and of course where there is no
comparison is electric range this car
can go 20 miles on electric power only
in the right conditions and up to 80
miles per hour on pure electric this is
a key part of the strategy that helps
this car work on the credits that
Mercedes needs in zero emissions market
places like California and other very
stringent states if I know underway you
know that an s-class is a big buttery
thing this one's bigger and buttery here
it has this incredibly modulated ride of
course owing to that 450 pounds of
battery in the back unfortunately the
throttle response is real lumpy
sometimes you've got a bunch of power
sometimes you have a good amount but
it's not the same kind deceleration is
coming in and out because you've got all
these different drive modes of electric
gas gas and electric and different kinds
of regen it's just not linear and if you
trounce the pedal and really get onto a
freeway on-ramp or something absolutely
no problem it's that around town stuff
where it's a little bit you know in and
out of different modes it's jarring
which doesn't make sense in a car like
this so I'm left wondering who's really
gonna get excited about this car who out
there is saying ah finally that's the
s-class I wanted it saves some gas it's
it's measurable
but it's no Prius so what are we left
with I think an s-class that the world
wasn't asking for but California and
other state regulators were
okay pricing on this s550 hybrid is
about 95 3 delivered what is interesting
is that that base price is the exact
same as the gas engine v8 twin-turbo
there is no hybrid penalty on this car
that's pretty notable other things to
bear in mind is these kind of luxury
cars in particular the s-class have
dramatic 5 year depreciation I think
that will be compounded by the fact that
you've got a hybrid here which is
probably going to be much better in five
years and this will be the antiquated
technology that's not going to do you
any favors either also know that this is
only available rear-wheel drive if you
want all-wheel drive you got to get a
gas engine only find our full review on
that Mercedes s550 II with the plug-in
the bumper over at Cars cnet.com well
you don't have to live in Texas to know
that a pickup truck for many people is
also the family car so you want it to
absolutely be safe but verifying that
has become surprisingly controversial in
recent months will update the smarter
driver when CNET on cars returns
Ford's new f-150 truck passes the IIHS
small overlap crash test with flying
colors except for the ones that dump the
big cab super crew version received the
coveted Top Safety Pick
the shorter super cab version earned
only a marginal rating in the same crash
the front small overlap crash test of
the extended cab f-150 the tope and
pedals moved nearly a foot back towards
the dummy's legs steering column with
eight inches towards his chest coming
dangerously close the difference turned
out to be a set of special steel
reinforcing tubes welded in front of and
behind each front wheel in the bigger
super crew model the smaller super cab
doesn't have them a key takeaway here is
that the IIHS can't and doesn't test
every version of every car in truck that
it crashes usually it doesn't matter but
here it clearly does and as a result the
Institute has just made it policy that
it will test multiple body styles of big
pickups that will soon include silverado
tundra and RAM which just announced it
has added reinforcing bars to all its
cab styles 3/2 it pays to double check
which model a pickup truck you're
considering buying and knowing if that's
the exact cab version that was tested or
was it a different one that may not
collapse quite the same way
welcome back to see net on cars coming
to you from our home at the Mount Tam
Motor Club just north of the Golden Gate
Bridge well you may have heard me
mention in some recent performance car
videos we've done that the vehicle had a
dry sump lubrication system the biggest
oxymoron and all have Auto dumb
we've actually got a number of cars
coming up that have won as well so it
seems like it's time for a car tech 101
on dry sump now most cars including very
likely yours have what's called a wet
sump something the old German Dutch word
for a muddy wet bog or Marsh which is
actually a pretty good analogy for what
happens down here at the bottom of your
engine is what's known as the oil pan or
the crankcase also known as the sump
the heart of the lubrication system is
the oil pump the two revolving gears
create a suction as the teeth move apart
this suction draws oil from the storage
reservoir or oil pan when this is a wet
saw that means basically all your oil
lives down here except when it's being
pumped out circulate it around the
engine through little passages where it
gets all the things that need
lubrication lubricated and then it drips
back down here to do the cycle over
again the problems with that design are
actually many first of all look at this
pan down here on this v8 to my right
they're both big and tall that means the
engine has to sit higher in the car to
not scrape the ground or bump in the
suspension that means a higher center of
gravity a higher hood knows what have
you the auto makers don't like that
secondly the oil keeps coming back to
this same hot place so it's hard to cool
the oil third because this can only be a
given size to fit in the engine bay you
can only have so much oil any terms
would like to have more oil fresher oil
and crew
oh boy and forth you get oil starvation
and design like this the oil is just
kind of down there by luck and by
gravity in hard cornering sometimes it
moves to one side and the pickup where
the oil is sucked up goes dry once in a
while when that happens the bearings go
dry not good a high performance in a dry
sump seeks to cure all that if the first
high-performance sports car with dry
sump lubrication for a lower center of
gravity a dry sump engine still has a
pan at the bottom of the engine but it's
much smaller it catches oil and it's
immediately then pumped out to a
reservoir somewhere else on the car
where typically another pump then moves
it back to the engine it's all very
controlled and done under positive
pressure you end up getting a lower
engine and lower center of gravity
because you don't have a great big pan
to protect down at the bottom you have
no oil starvation and hard cornering
because everything is done under
positive pressure and you end up likely
with cooler oil because it gets a
vacation from being in the engine all
the time and you can have a lot more of
it because the oil reservoir can be as
big as you have room to fit the downside
of a dry sump design is basically cost
and complexity you've got a pump or two
that are external to the engine you've
got some very critical plumbing you've
got that reservoir to hold all that oil
has to go somewhere else in the car
so they're only justified in high
performance situations today but if you
look at a high performance car look at
our reviews of them you're going to
increasingly see the dry sump design
making its way into vehicles that are
not just tracked cars that are high
performance Road cars
in a moment
measuring mileage demystifying all those
conflicting numbers and the car tech you
really want when CNET on cars continues
this is an Aston Martin Vanquish it's a
grand tourer
and has a big engine it's what happens
when you decide you want to treat
yourself after a lifetime of hard work
you see this cars party pieces it's six
litre v12 it kicks out 568 brake
horsepower and 456 pound foot it'll
crack 200 miles an hour if you've got
the space and you'll get from nought to
62 in 3.8 seconds that makes it the
quickest accelerating production car
still has everything
which means there's potential for a lot
of silliness indeed buy more from the ex
car team of CNET UK at cnet.com slash
welcome back to see net on cars I'm
Brian Cooley here's the part of the show
where I take one of your emails in this
case I'm going to take a whole slew of
your emails but before we get to those I
want to give a nod to Keith from the
Philippines who sent us some photos of
his wheel upgrade from last episodes
email section remember he has a Honda
City with 15 s on it he wanted to go to
19 I suggested more like 17 s or 18s he
finally ended up doing his wheel
conversion to a nice set of 18 so it'd
look really good
nice work Keith now we've got a trio of
emails to get to about units and
measurements that we use on the show as
we communicate the specs of cars the
first one comes in from Boston who says
when you present technical information
about a car I usually convert the units
to metric myself last time I tried a
different online calculator to go from
mpg to liters per 100 kilometers and I
found out that this calculator gave me
20 percent lower results than one I used
previously he asked can you please give
me the right formula to convert mpg to
liters per hundred weight pounds to
kilograms and also acceleration time the
zero to 60 thing that we talked about
here in the US well let's take those one
at a time first of all when you're
comparing mpg on cars especially around
the world you've got to get to apples
and apples mpg and liters to 100 are
actually not it's apples to oranges you
want to take litres per hundred
kilometres and compare that to gallons
per hundred miles that stat is actually
rated on US cars but almost nobody knows
about it over here it's in the fine
print on the window sticker and other
places we talk about mpg in the US but
in fact when you're comparing two cars
it's actually not a good way to do it
for some weird rounding errors that are
beyond my grade level in math once you
do look at gallons or liters for miles
or kilometers you end up with a very
easy piece of mathematical conversion to
do converting pounds to kilograms is
easy one pound is 0.45 kilograms
kilograms are much heavier and 0 to 60
in the US or 0 to 100 km/h in Europe
which is 62 miles per hour is messy you
can't just do a numerical conversion
because each car is got its own unique
torque curve and the way that it gets to
those additional two miles per hour is
not just a straight extrapolation it may
spike up or spike down for that last
little bit it's not a big deal but you
can't just do it numerically I'm afraid
they are somewhat different measurements
okay next one comes in from Omar he's
riding him from Malaysia he says
regarding fuel consumption I've been
wondering if the gallons you state are
US gallons or imperial gallons he says
he finds it over on our sister site X
car the fuel efficiency seems to be much
higher than he hears on SEANET on cars
okay so the gallon thing is very
different Imperial gallons as are quoted
on cars sold in the UK market are 17
percent bigger 17 percent more fuel than
a US gallon so you're going to see a
complete difference in the amount you
get per gallon of fuel it's not even
close and the last one comes in from
Patrick Pease in North Carolina but
travels a lot he says I'm on business in
the UK this week and I've noticed that
here cars tend to get about 20 mpg more
than their US counterparts he says I
went on Ford's website and saw that a
focus just like I have at home with the
powershift transmission gets 54 mpg in
the UK and his in the US is rated at
just 37 highway why the big discrepancy
he asks a few things are going on first
of all see the note we just talked about
on imperial gallons you're seeing an
imperial gallon rating because those
gallons are bigger yeah they get a lot
more mileage out of their bigger gallon
secondly the way cars are tested in
Europe and the United Kingdom the actual
circuit they drive to measure fuel
economy is very different than in the US
as I understand it it tends to be a
shorter drive at lower speeds than we do
here in the US finally though there are
very different power plants in Europe
the focus there may not have the engine
you have over here even if the
transmission is the same European
consumers will accept a lot of manual
gearboxes they'll accept a lot of
smaller engines that American consumers
just aren't interested in so it tends to
be more different than the sheet metal
would suggest and we try to explore
every new technology in cars here at C
net on cars that's kind of our mission
but let's face it there's always a core
of these things that most consumers care
about the most and that makes for an
interesting top 5
JD Power asked consumers about fifty
nine car tech features ranging from
those involved in energy efficiency to
in cabin entertainment we've ranked the
top five responses based on how many
people selected the technology for their
short list number five self-healing
paint 25% there's really no such thing
as self-healing paint there is Nissan's
scratch shield but that only smoothes
out very minor scrapes in the clear coat
only not the paint but we so hate the
expensive time-consuming results of a
dent or scratch that we keep on dreaming
number four a rear camera with the
display in the mirror 30% not just a
rear cam but one that has a little tiny
display at least it's up where you
should be looking when backing instead
of looking down number three collision
mitigating braking 30% this is one of
the most gettable of the early
self-driving technologies the one that
will jump on the brakes when you forget
to and if you think this might be driven
by the guilt people feel about staring
down at their phones in traffic number
two is night vision technology 33%
here's an odd one since so few people
have ever tried it apparently not enough
to know that in my experience it often
sucks but we love anything with the
phrase night vision in it before I get
you to the number one technology we want
in cars here are the ones we want the
least like health and wellness
technology gesture control and haptic
feedback screens bless your hearts
you're right on the money there
interestingly missing from the top ranks
of what we do want our hybrid technology
and the latest smartphone integration
like apple carplay and android auto
maybe they just need some time the
number one technology you say you want
in a car is blind spot tech 40% the
automotive blind spot back over there is
one we know we need help with and
they're only getting worse because cars
keep bulking up more and more like
fortresses on wheels
who says you got to join the army to
drive a tank
thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed
this episode seems like you did because
the emails come in a torrent and I'm
glad you do that it's on cars at
cnet.com I read everyone reply to as
many as I can and a lot of them become
segments in the show I'll see you next
time we check the tech
