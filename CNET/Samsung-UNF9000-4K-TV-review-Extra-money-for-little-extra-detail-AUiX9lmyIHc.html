and next to me is Samsung's F 9000 this
is the company's first 4k TV that
doesn't cost forty thousand dollars this
thing is still extremely expensive it's
a 65 inch size the F 9000 is also
available in a 55 inch size we got to
all that 4k goodness in a little bit but
first let me start by telling you this
TV is pretty much identical to the F
8000 that we really liked earlier this
year except for that extra resolution of
4k it's got the same really cool design
kind of a little strip around the edge
of the picture that makes the entire TV
seem almost all picture it's also got
that really cool almost disappearing
stand along the bottom the flipside is
you'll need to have a stand or a table
top that's wide enough to encompass the
entire stand or else the TV's gonna fall
over of course you could always wall
mount this expensive television and not
be too shabby
this feature set on this TV is great up
to Samsung's normal standards you get
it's excellent smart TV suite the
ability control a cable box umpteen apps
and of course the ability to adjust the
picture six ways from Sunday one of the
things that make this TV different from
the f8000 however is it's a jack pack
the TV has a separate connector box
where all the HDMI inputs are connected
there's also a USB ports and pretty much
every other port on this separate box
the idea is once a new format standard
comes around for connecting into this TV
otherwise known as HDMI 2.0 Samsung says
you can discard the current connector
box grab a new connector box for an
undisclosed sum and plug it into the
back of here and get pretty much
future-proof upgradability that future
connector box will also allow the TV to
have the smart evolution upgrade which
will enable new processor and new
software so all told a pretty slick way
to keep this TV up with the times in the
future another standout feature shared
with the F 8000 Samsung's touchpad
remote unlike that TV this also comes
with a separate standard remote with a
bunch of buttons on it so you get your
choice in this case and like other
high-end Samsung TVs this one is 3d
compatible it comes with four pairs of
3d glasses and now for 4k what a lot of
people been wondering and what we've
been running ourselves until we got our
hands on this TV to test it it's how
much of a difference 4k really makes
well I'll tell you it's 65 inches it
doesn't really make that much of a
difference we compared this TV
side-by-side with a 1080p 65 inch
television
and unless you look extremely close it's
really hard to tell the difference in
fact with 1080p sources the 1080p TV
actually looked a tiny bit sharper than
this one in some cases so if you're
looking at today's 1080p sources
displayed on this TV expecting a really
big increase in detail you're not going
to find it in terms of 4k sources the
couple things that I was able to test
include some video from red which looked
very good as well as a 4k game off of a
PC that's really the main thing you're
gonna be using this TV for right now is
the 4k video game aspect and it really
does look really good as long as you
have a high enough PC to take full
advantage of it of course beyond its
mere resolution the F 9000 is an
excellent performer it has the same deep
black levels as the F 8000 so it does
have really nice contrast for an LED LCD
although still not as good as a lot of
the plasma TVs we've tested it also has
extremely accurate color and I
appreciated the screen uniformity so
again an excellent performer even beyond
its 4k resolution on the other hand the
Samsung is extremely expensive and it's
still early days among 4k TVs in a
couple of months we expect some new 4k
TVs to be announced and they'll probably
have better specs and at least have that
HDMI 2.0 that this one lacks out of the
box so unless you're really early
adopter and don't mind spending five
thousand dollars on a high-end first
generation 4k TV we recommend you wait
that's a quick look at Samsung's F 9000
4k television I'm David Katz my from
