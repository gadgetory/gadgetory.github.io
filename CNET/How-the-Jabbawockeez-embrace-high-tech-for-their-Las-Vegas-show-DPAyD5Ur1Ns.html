Jabbawockeez what they've been able to
pull off their biggest ideas the hip hop
dance wares from performing in Las Vegas
since 2011 their current show at the MGM
grand dreams uses high-tech props since
they don't have enough space but it
means being able to pull off even more
creative ideas than they would have real
props you could use all these type of
effects now with the choreography to
make it look more stunning and appealing
when all your props are digital though
you run the risk of glitches ruining
your show that's our mark Burke the
show's producer comes in so this is a
this is where everything starts here the
computers and then it gets networked all
the way back up to to the show control
area this is used for we can close I can
close shutters with this so like this
wall over here I'm able to control I can
control turn that that guy off over here
now all of our audio comes out of the
moat ooze here the hybrids there's
visual cues that we're waiting for to
take so you know if it's if it's putting
the hand on the throw or if it's you
know a flick of the nose that's the
trigger and then then we could go when
it's all working the way it's supposed
to work it's it's a press of a button
and you just watch a lot of people they
don't realize how much work is really
involved behind the scenes into this
show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
