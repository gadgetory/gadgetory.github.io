examples we're seeing now Evernote let
you create notes on the fly by talking
to your watch and it will dictate it

glance that but for the most part you're
seeing the same things as you would on a
phone it's just that now you don't have
to take the phone out of your pocket and
you can also go running with it and
listen to music without wearing a phone
