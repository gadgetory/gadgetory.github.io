here to talk about apple with josh
lowensohn apple today reported its
latest quarterly earnings not good tell
us what happened so they actually had a
really phenomenal core they posted more
than 50 billion dollars worth of revenue
the wall stree was expecting more
especially in terms of profit so they
came up short there so what were the
highlights what were the what were the
disappointments highlights are really
iphone sales they sold more iphones that
they never sold many quarter same thing
with ipads where they really fell short
worth max and there was also a decline
in ipods but the big story is really
about their future revenue they
predicted the next quarter they're
really going to come in below what Wall
Street was expecting and so what was Tim
Cook like on the call with analysts it
was kind of interesting usually they
kind of opened and they read off a
script and this time he was really
almost apologetic and and very trying to
trying to validate the results he said
what makes us important is how customers
react with our products not just the
numbers and that is really kind of
pointing to some of these numbers that
fell a little softer so did he give us
any specifics I mean while she wants to
know what's coming right so of course
you know people try to ask him about a
TV which he said you know I can't talk
about that we keep poll which he has
said for a long time exactly you know
the same thing what was interesting is
that he said someone asked him about
maps a product that they really got
railed on and he said that yeah hey we
have made improvements in maps we're
making some more you might have already
seen them we're going to put some more
stuff out this year and look forward to
that so you know kind of like a little
highlight right but it's apple on the
defensive now exactly okay thanks so
much sure first seen it on Paul slow and
talking with Josh Lowensohn about Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
