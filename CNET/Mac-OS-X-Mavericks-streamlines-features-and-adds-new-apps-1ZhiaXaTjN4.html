it and today we're going to look at mac
OS 10 Mavericks with new features new
apps and other improvements those plenty
to show up to start off the new finder
tabs work much in the same way the tabs
new in Safari a plus sign button on the
right lets you open a new tab and you
can drag them drop tabs just like in a
web browser you could have one tab for
air drop in another for documents then
drag and drop files to airdrop to send
to a co-worker Finder windows can be
expanded to full screen mode as well
make it easier to organize and find
documents there's also a new tagging
system in Mavericks now you can add
multiple tags to documents you can
search on one or more tags to get the
exact files you want when saving a file
you can pick a color pic from some
standard tags like work or home or
assign your own tech now to get all the
documents of that share a tag you can
select it in the left navigation of the
finder or search for it by a spotlight
next the calendar app got a facelift and
a bit more functionality the scheme
orphic leather-bound look is gone
replaced by clean lines and interface
elements to draw your attention to
what's important a streamlined event
inspector will autocomplete location
addresses give you driving time to your
destination and present you with a map
click it to see the destination in the
Maps app and yes if you hadn't heard
Apple maps is now on your Mac even
though it's been somewhat maligned it
has improved quite a lot over time and I
think it's a useful addition to
Mavericks Apple maps is integrated with
your calendar like I showed a second ago
but you can also get quick directions
from context and you can quickly view an
address in the mail app when exploring
the app on your Mac is a great
experience letting you switch views like
you do in iOS and using 3d flyover on
the trackpad is both smooth and looks
great another cool feature in mass is
the ability to send directions to
another device simply search for the
place you want to go on your Mac then go
to the share button to send the
directions to your iOS device it's
important to note you'll need to be
signed in to your iCloud account via the
Mac preferences in order for this cool
feature to work
now let's check out Safari a personal
favorite new feature of mine is the new
sidebar where you can click bookmarks on
the left and quickly sift through
websites on the right you also have easy
access to your reading list top sites
gets a new flatter look and Mavericks
and it's easier to customize just drag
and drop tiles where you want them or
you can pull out a bookmark and place it
on top sites for easy access that's all
we have time for today but there's a lot
more to Mavericks than what we've shown
here you can get more info about the new
iCloud keychain better multiple display
support for full screen apps
notifications with updates from your
favorite sites and more in my written
review for seen it Mavericks is
available right now at the mac app store
and is free to all users thanks for
watching everyone i'm jason parker percy
net and this has been a first look at
mac OS 10 Mavericks see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
