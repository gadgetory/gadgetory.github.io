with another pair of joints from that
galaxy far far away coming in town for
the holidays
the company is rolling out an app
controlled r2d2 you remember him the
three legged robot that dates back to
the beginning of the Star Wars saga r2
is joined by BB nine eight if BB 9a
isn't familiar - that's because this
droid hasn't made a big-screen debut yet
we expect that later this year
like other spirit eyes r2d2 and bb9
are control to a Bluetooth enabled
smartphone app the app faithfully
recreates the look and feel of the Star
Wars universe employing the fonts and
music that are universally associated
with the franchisors sphere I paid
attention to details with both of these
droids the colors on r2d2 is plastic
canister are remarkably close to those
you see in the movies the Droid has all
the blinking LEDs and glowing disks
we're familiar with r2d2 s dome rotates
and when he transitions from bipod to
tripod mode the third foot pops out with
the nicest one my favorite part r2d2
beeps and chirps the satisfyingly event
he almost expects c-3po to interpret for
you the bb9 a toy is reminiscent of the
bb-8 droid sphere introduced ahead of
2015 - the force awakens both have small
magnetic heads that allow them to stick
to their spherical bodies however this
last iteration adds inductive power
allowing BB 90s LEDs to light up
wirelessly unlike our first ball droid
BB 9 a is a glossy black reflecting his
use by the first order an evil military
hunter in the latest Star Wars movies in
typical Sphero fashion they packed these
droids with extras both r2d2 and baby 9
a can take you on augmented reality
tours of some of the starships featured
in the Star Wars saga via the app the
droids will also watch a Star Wars movie
with you and react along with the plot
there's no doubt r2d2 and BB 90 are
worthy successes too bb-8 and for
hardcore Star Wars nerds that pretty
much must-haves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
