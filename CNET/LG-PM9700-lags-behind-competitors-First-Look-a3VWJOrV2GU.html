review of the LG p.m. 9700 plasma TV
it's undeniable that LG's range of LCDs
is the best-looking set of TVs available
this year but unfortunately this plasma
isn't all that special to look at it
does have a weird-looking finger stand
but the bezel looks very similar to
Samsung's plasmas that are available
this year as well though the LG p.m.
9700 is the company's flagship plasma
it's not as expensive as its rivals best
models at about 1700 for the 50 inch
model the TV has a number of features
including the magic motion remote active
3d playback for HDMI ports and built-in
widi or wireless display for streaming
your laptop to your TV color is
reasonably good and images have some
depth even if there is a smidge of
detail softness to things hurt this TV
though especially against the similarly
priced superstar the Panasonic st50 the
first is black levels you can get LCD
TVs at the same price which have better
performance than this plasma the second
is the dreaded soap opera effect the TV
comes with a smoothing feature called
trumotion that won't turn off even in
THX mode you can switch it to gaming
mode but then you lose some of the fine
picture controls the other modes give
you and therefore less color accuracy
it's been a while since LG has produced
a must-buy television and unfortunately
the PM 9700 just isn't it maybe the
company's OLED the 55 inch am 9600 which
is due in late 2012 we'll fix this
problem this has been ty pendlebury from
