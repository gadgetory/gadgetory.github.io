but I always find myself wondering how
do these things get put together so I
took two of my friends Jess and
Stephanie to escape from LA to solve
that puzzle hello ladies are we ready to
go okay so grab your stuff and follow me
today we are doing the alchemist escape
room which apparently will involve us
saving humanity and going back in time
or as I like to call it Tuesday this is
a gorgeous escape room already I need to
talk to the madman who put all this
together I'm John Hennessy I am the
creator of escape room LA I grew up
playing cd-rom-based video games you
know miss this guy just became my new
best friend I love a game where you find
yourself in a strange environment and
you don't really have clear direction
about what to do or where to start okay
are you ready to open the scroll you've
never played an escape room for just
come with an open mind and be ready to
talk out loud and think out loud oh it's
like it's just you're not using your
phone you're not using technology when
people finally see the solution it's
just like this oh my god and that's
that's the best feeling to see an
interior secret door leading into an
alchemists lab the tale is all this time
okay oh wow we walk into a hallway with
candles and it's dark and literally
that's all I want in my apartment we do
work with a theatrical CNH designer you
know so we kind of work together to
figure out how these things are actually
going to get built and how they're going
to work and how they're going to last
for a game after game after game day
after day after day
only better or air like the colors water
fire air air earth we find heart
captain planets going to show up there's
a lock here with water cinnamon bark
they smell let me out they all my smells
Oh wake up cinnamon cinnamon okay
it smells like quick read I have to
admit using your sense of smell not
something I've ever experienced before
in an escape room but my nose is up to
the task
eucalyptus leave it you feeling that I'm
smelling shy I think you might be right
ok ok so yellow w you I'm having a
really hard time telling the difference
between all the liquids I thought I knew
it lavender smelled like but right now I
have no idea that's knowing it to keep
our noses don't work in the key for an
escape room that is not horror-themed
there sure seems to be a lot of jump
scares here and letting our motor
vendors oh great what is right it's
gotta go in there now we can move on to
the last puzzle in the room fire we're
gonna I'm gonna put some fire here in
post right no we can't do that no oh
it's just says hit the fire monster
that's just good life advice so when we
knew we were gonna have a laser in this
room we knew we had to make it awesome
so you don't I'm not sure if we're gonna
make it to point the laser into the
gargoyle it's really shaky
like fire we did it we beat the
alchemist but after talking to John and
Steph it was pretty obvious that
creating the experience of an escape
room is a lot more difficult and
challenging than coming in and just
solving the puzzle like we did there
like real-life point-and-click adventure
games I mean it's like being in a video
game but at the end of the day us one
escape room</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
