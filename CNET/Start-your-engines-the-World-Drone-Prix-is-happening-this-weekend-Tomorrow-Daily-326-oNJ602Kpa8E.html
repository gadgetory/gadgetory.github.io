welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I'm
ashley's together and i'm jeff cannata
and it is time to hit those headlines
start your engines ladies and gentlemen
because the world drone Prix is
happening this weekend over 100 teams
will be competing in the world drone
prix this weekend in dubai for a prize
package worth over a million dollars and
they will be doing it in style the world
organization of racing drones or word
governs the championship event if this
promo video is anything to go by guys it
looks like futuristic racetracks
exciting races and high-speed drone
crashes are on the menu for this weekend
if you happen to be in dubai on march
11th and 12th you should definitely grab
a ticket to the races and if you don't
have a ticket it will also be streamed
live on the internet so you should catch
it anyway because it looks like real
life rainbow road but with flying drones
I'm gonna be watching that I are they
streaming it like from the drones
perspective because that would be rad
too maybe because the thing is is they
have it from the trailers and things
that I've seen it looks like they have
some first person there first person
right flights yeah so they might plug
into whatever that output is able to
kind of show a point of view I'm hoping
they let me choose my camera because I
want to see it from all kinds of that be
so rad I want world drone pre-con where
I get to just like it's like a digital
ticket where I can just pick whatever
your racer I want to follow for the
whole weekend so good luck to all the
racers you can hit up a world drone pre
calm if you want to check everything out
hey speaking of planes DARPA has a new
plane that they're working on if they
can pull it off it's going to be pretty
impressive VTOL is short for vertical
takeoff and landing and the x-plane aims
to make that happen with 24 ducted fans
each with its own cell those cells are
mounted on the wings and canard of the
craft which can pivot from the
horizontal to vertical as needed
offering maximum efficiency during all
phases of flight DARPA says it hopes to
use this design to open up aviation
possibilities quote freed from prior
constraints unquote that sounds pretty
rad
now this is still in its concept phase
but they hope to begin manned and
unmanned flights by 2018 so it's not
that far off yeah you might see some
unmanned vertical takeoff planes in the
sky which would be pretty cool they will
be destroying the drone pre and 2018 ok
so we out of these two stories I I feel
like personally we have to talk about
the drone pre come on I mean I think
we're both pretty excited about that
excited the VTOL plane looks pretty cool
but definitely let's let's let's cue
that up for Thursday talk about the
drone pre and if you guys want to talk
about it you can actually use the
hashtag hey TD yeah all you gotta do
shot at us using that hashtag on Twitter
get your voice heard if we like your
comment will include it in our show on
Thursday when we deep dive into that
story and I'm just saying you definitely
want to be included on Thursday show you
do we might tell you it probably tell
you Wednesday but maybe tomorrow yeah
some fun stuff coming on Thursday we're
pretty excited pretty pretty excited
anyway let's see our phone time for the
day our phone talk for the day today is
Desmond who shot this lovely picture on
his iPhone 6 Desmond ride tasting at
folks this is Gramps he loves curling up
on the couch with a bowl of kibble his
favorite blanket and watching your tech
reviews he has no pockets so hasn't been
able to save up any money but when he
figures out how to overcome this short
coming he's thinking of buying a drone
and attaching a laser pointer he was
caught in today's deep contemplation by
one of his human servants using an
iPhone 6 he looks like he's uh either
wait yeah I was gonna say either very
comfortable are really upset these upset
he doesn't know pockets you need to get
that cat as some clothes maybe an
overcoat that seems like a great idea I
like the drone with a laser pointer for
infinite cat fun that seems like a
Kickstarter waiting to happen Desmond if
