fabric what's coming to the newest
disney theme park and oculus buys a
company that's gonna make them even
better I can't even imagine that
tomorrow daily
dirtying citizens in the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily best geek talk
show the known universe I'm Ashley
skills killin ominous um wow it's it
feels like it's been a hundred years
since comic-con like I was just thinking
about this morning you ever have that
like time sort of slows down when you go
to an event up like in your face all the
time and then you come home and it's
like everything goes really slowly I'm
still tired from comic-con yeah like my
leg muscles still are the best my little
nerdy leg muscles aren't so good sad
that we skip leg dad guys we skipped
like okay all right well uh let's let's
not waste any more time what's at that
one I don't know if you've been keeping
up with what's going on the VR world but
it's been a lot of headsets and a new
controller from oculus well guess what
they just announced a brand new
partnership that Facebook an oculus they
did they announce that they've act
acquired a company namely pebbles now
what pebbles is the pebbles interactive
I think uh pebbles creates motion
gesture software so it's looking like
we're starting to see oculus move into
the controller less world of via um it
uses custom optics sensors and algorithm
algorithms are pebbles paves the way for
better touch functionality in oculus and
other oculus partnered headsets like the
gear VR yeah yeah yeah it's it's no they
get the recognition on that that's crazy
yeah pebble has been a leader in this
for a while they're they're kind of a
small company but I mean it's it's it's
really crazy that it's it there on out
there like this has come about so
quickly obviously it's not gonna be a
part of like the first wave right yeah
because the consumer headset comes out
in 2016 yeah so yeah it could be it you
know it could be uses it as a side
method it can be used as the main method
I'm sure we're not going to see this for
a while but Sir see some examples but
yeah this I mean this is the ultimate
goal of VR is immersion full immersion
and faint like finger like being able to
reach out and like grab things again
like seeing your hands was always a big
kind of thing that always struck me is
weird that wasn't available but now if
oculus touch right if the controllers
yeah I got seems maybe like this could
be what they add to it well I guess
touch their motto as their goal has
always been to make it not feel like
you're holding a controller but you that
you're kind of immersed and this is just
full immersion I've always said that
that was a big hurdle to like yeah
having your hands and being able to
touch things and move move it it in real
space that's just gonna put you even
further into it all right I think that
really is one of the biggest hurdles so
there you go pebbles pebbles we might
see some really cool stuff from pebbles
not the watch guys not pebble pebbles
with an S yeah also more than one okay I
saw that really briefly this morning the
headline it was like oculus purchases
pebbles and I was like wait wait wait so
I had to click on it I'm like ah icic
its pebbles so that's not the watch Mike
what if you want a SmartWatch for it's
weird all right you're a big Disney fan
I'm a big Disney fan we're all big
Disney fans here there's a new theme
park coming to the world the world at
large is coming to Shanghai it's going
to be called the Disney Shanghai resort
huh clever very clever uh so see a
Disney CEO Bob Iger was talking about
this and there was this really awesome
concept video that accompanied showing
off like what the park is gonna look
like to be very high-tech there's gonna
be all sorts of state-of-the-art stuff
like you would expect from Disney
including this really awesome looking
Tron kind of roller coaster which just
looks super rad there it's called the
tron light cycle power run this is going
to open next year so it's it's coming
soon this is not something that's ten
years away where they have to break
ground they've already been working on
this and here a couple the other
franchises you're going to be seeing at
the Disney Shanghai resort you're going
to be seeing Star Wars they're gonna
have a launch Bay where they're saying
they're gonna have set pieces props
memorabilia from episode 7 that's Eve
that's coming out this year they're
gonna have all sorts of and a cinematic
experience which i'm guessing might be
something a little bit like what we saw
at the Marvel experience right where
it's like kind of yeah which would be
pretty cool and then there's also going
to be a Marvel experience where they're
gonna have like briefings and they're
gonna have superheroes walking around
and then they're gonna have sort of at
Disney California Adventure they have
the artists alley where the animation
you can do an animation class and learn
how to draw a Disney character they're
going to do that for superheroes
to say here's like have comic book
artists come in and teach you how to
draw like superheroes and stuff and then
they're going to have a fully
pirate-themed land called treasure Cove
which is gonna be all Pirates of the
Caribbean themed so it's going to be
fully like a full land dedicated pirates
of the caribbean and and for those of
you wondering like we'll gosh like i
live in the US when are we going to
start getting marvel star wars like all
this cool stuff in our parks d23 expo is
next month which is disney's big
conference and and there we're kind of
expected to sort of learn a little bit
more about what the future is for
disneyland and disney world in
california florida which a lot of people
are speculating and like if you go do I
is it sad that I go to like rumor sites
for disneyland for like construction and
stuff is gonna like mice chat my sage
and stuff or it's like they tell you
about all the little rumors and things
that are gonna be coming to the parks
like rumor is toontown is going to be
shut down in California yeah you're
gonna add like either Star Wars or Star
Wars are Marvel back there all of
Tomorrowland is gonna be getting like
revamped where you're gonna have like
you know maybe the stark Expo type thing
or it's gonna be all Marvel like we've
heard a lot of rumors about what's
coming so maybe we'll hear a little bit
more about the actual official expansion
plans next month so that's pretty
exciting poor Roger rabbits cartoon spin
Oh her ass in peace that's sad but it's
cool western what what is the reasoning
behind them making a Tron roller coaster
I like like i love i love me some tron
but disney doesn't love them some tron
does he not anymore now a third tron and
they like abandoned their little Trump
party thing like I think it's more like
it I think that is specifically in their
version of Tomorrowland and so I think
it sort of fits in with the aesthetic of
that area of the park and then on top of
that like it's just gonna look really
cool blacklight I get it that's cool but
that che hai park sounds amaze yeah it's
really rad I like it my next fire next
year it's gonna open next year so it's
gonna compete with my money with Harry
Potter wizarding world here in LA which
harry potter pi win cuz going she was
shanghaied disney shanghai resort seems
really expensive so i don't know if i
can afford that but that brings us to
our hashtag
just hashtag TD Mickey we did something
similar with the Nintendo theme park I
want to know what high-tech ride or
experience you can pick an experience
like the make up something would you
want installed at your nearest Disney
theme park so it doesn't have to be in
the state doesn't have it could be
anywhere there's Disney theme park you
live in Japan you can pick that your new
Euro Disney like any of that stuff what
do you want installed what's the thing
what's the one thing you're like just
dying for hmm I can already I hear the
gears turn actual lightsabers just real
lightsabers just have actual lightsabers
they're just that's it like and you can
you fight with them or well I mean you
can fill in the blanks all you want
there but like once I have my lightsaber
I know what I know what my life's gonna
be like that's a good point I mean
everybody's gonna kill themselves but
I'm just gonna like you're gonna be a
Jedi right out of it i'm gonna be like
it or like you die yeah you don't want
to use this but ya know it'd be cool
like actual lightsabers or like even
fake actual lightsabers where it just
does a beam of light and it's not like a
plastic thing not plastic yeah what if I
do you remember the void those like big
virtual reality experiences we've put on
the headset and then they had like you
know remember that like thing that
they're gonna open that we talked about
I want something like that where you
basically get a VR headset and like it's
like laser tag and then you do it like
themed to something so you could do Star
Wars of you good one like storm troopers
vs. rebellion like Empire versus
rebellion yeah we know Tigger's yeah
totally I mean that's it that's a war
that's that's a word that's been going
on forever yeah it was so cool we could
do this like amazing virtual reality
thing where you could do like run around
and do like virtual reality laser
tagging which had to be like they would
be like a version of Battlefront yeah
that would be pretty that'd be pretty
sweet I think every every Park needs to
start doing recon yeah I agree um okay
so lastly we got to talk about this like
feelings and if everything so weird but
actually kind of impressive in its own
way this comes from this a clothing
brand called abstract and it comes from
three people web designer Bjorn Carmen
textile designer Christine bazan and
fashion designer Julie hell's Erickson
and what they have done is they have
created this website where you go to the
website say your on your macbook or your
your laptop you type in a story that you
have feelings about
okay so let's say it's like oh when I
was a kid my grammys to bake these
cookies and I love them and we would you
know tell stories together whatever so
here's the actual thing so it tracks
your facial expressions as you're typing
in this story and remembering it either
fondly or sadly or you know whatever
your feelings are about it it also
tracks your keystrokes so whether you
pause whether you type really fast and
get excited about something or whether
you take your time and type slow and all
of those things go into this sort of
data visualization that turns into a
fabric pattern that you can then apply
to all of the different clothes for sale
on their site so you type in your story
do all the stuff and then this is what
comes out it kind of looks like glitch
art like it reminds me a little bit of
glitch art and what it is is it's a it's
a full data visualization and these are
the different things that sort of
contribute to what this looks like so
emotions picked up by the facial
recognition correspondent colors so
let's say you tell a sad story are gonna
see more like blues purples but maybe
there's some happiness in it well then
it might blend in some Reds things like
that and then you have content that will
make the actual pattern Bill Cosby's it
does look like a Cosby sweater and then
also your keystrokes like depending on
how fast or slow you type what you did
it chooses the scale of the pattern
whether it's really really tiny a really
really big and then you can apply it
like i said to any of the clothes on the
website and then they will print out
this this custom fabric for you and ship
you a jacket a sweater a skirt a dress
you know whatever you choose that's on
the site which is crazy like this scene
is like a whole lot of work for some
clothes right yeah but it is interesting
it's very interesting that Bill Cosby
sweater that crazy glitchy Cosby sweater
but but they were saying like there
would be a lot more they're still in
testing phases and they're saying like
as they go they're getting better and
better at it so they might actually be
able to make like some pretty cool stuff
and you can manipulate the story so like
let's say as you're typing you can see
the patterns start to emerge in you say
like oh I really like this one bit you
can actually repeat a line in the story
over and over again and get that so why
don't you just create your own pattern
well you could but the thing is is like
this is sort of like creating a pattern
of
but with a story behind it I guess or
like your emotions behind it right so
it's like you'd wear the sweater and
like remember the story you told about
your gram I'm not trying to be jaded I'm
just trying to be like it makes it may
be a good it like as fight financially
it may be at rickys to like choice well
extra financially it might be a tricky
choice because these are not going to
come cheap because they're handmade
because they have to like take that data
visualization the claws make the cloth
like put together your clothes like the
whole thing it and this is all handmade
stuff they're saying like a one sweater
is it'll cost you like 300 bucks so
that's those days I thought it would be
that's gonna be a son Jay Z level not
jay z but definitely it's up there it's
not going to target um it's not picking
out some of your target but it is a
really good conversation piece and I
feel I know some people who are really
into art that would be into this as like
a conversation starter type thing where
it's like oh well this fabric is a story
that I told one time about you know this
break this terrible breakup I had a sad
it is well that sounds very conceited in
the way that you said that well that's
those those are my our friends I'm sorry
our friends you're kind of full of
yourself so I noticed my sweater but
it's about me I wrote a story about me
and this is my face yeah this is my
sweater yeah or you could give it as a
gift you could say like is great story
about our friendship and here's here it
is in fabric this is how i feel about
friendship and then you look at your
like i don't know if this is good or
like so you feel like a jumbled mess
about friendship i don't know but i
thought it was really interesting yes
cool abstract with an underscore after
it yeah i find it really interesting i
think it's cool that people are like
thinking of these things like it's
pretty neat but thats it for our stories
let's take a quick break we'll come
right back its into it time after we
come back we get to talk about things we
like and then we also have kind of your
user feedback because i totally forgot
about it yesterday but i got some tweets
from you so i didn't forget you and then
our photogra for the day so don't click
away it's tomorrow daily
whoa let go
welcome back to the show we've returned
that was if you're wondering are quick
right before the break video is called
the Magnus effect so you put a little
bit of backspin on a ball and drop it
from a very high place and actually
curves out as it falls which is pretty
amazing um at least that's how it was
explained to me it could be thought it
was hoop God so I was looking up on my
phone to see if fair I listen it's if
it's magic and it involves a basketball
it's probably who got all praising yeah
um so it's Thursday so that means we
have to talk about the things that cuz
all about us right now it's all about us
right time for into it it's like at a
nice Joe Pesci impression all you need
now is an Elmo to spit on that they
don't get that I know but now they're
gonna look it up and they're gonna find
out uh kale please tell me what you're
into this week it's this is so lame I'm
into something I was into I think it was
on my into it a while back yeah but I
never finished it so I'm into shadows of
Mordor right I finished it because I
hate it I picked it up and it was like
and I was like I hate this game I hate
it and then at some point of it oh my
god I love this game and then I hated it
again and now I'm playing it again and i
love it it's like the best game ever 2
love-hate relationship that's it's got
that stupid feature where if you die
like if you get killed by uh-uh then
they get stronger he get killed by the
same or call multiple times to get
stronger and stronger and more defense
and like his friends get stronger and so
at one point like I was fighting guys
they went from level 8 12 0 16 just
because I kept losing against them and
they'd like leveled up and they were a
higher rank and they became more chiefs
and I was just like well this sucks so
it was not quick but it was ultimately
my fault I got the hang of it after
playing Batman and now i'm also trying
to make him my into it so that producer
Logan will eventually play oh very good
I like that I like that there's some
sort of like subtle there's it's not
even subtle you're just like pretty slow
gonna need plays games yeah I mean you
know because he has to cut the like
trailers and stuff into this so it was
an exciting way to get him to like
pushing them like it inception I'm glad
that you're not you didn't totally rage
quit you only
like rage quit for a little while and
then like you said use Batman as like
your training to come back and like
totally smoked this game and do oblivion
it's a really amazing game it's a really
really good game and I'm actually gonna
do after the show so excellent we're
going to it any nominations were this
morning I'm really big into television I
love watching TV i watch this literally
what I do in my spare time like that and
play video games like that's it so I was
really excited because this is actually
a really good year for nomination some
really good stuff Outstanding Comedy
Series I had some really great things
like transparent which amazon prime like
I mean netflix and amazon prime walks
way to a bunch of nominations Silicon
Valley was in their parks and rec last
season unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt a
Netflix show I mean like really really
good veep HBO so like HBO walked by
thing with the most nominations looks
like a valley to win that would be
awesome but I'm gonna say it's not gonna
happen um but yeah drama series really
good better call Saul I really love
better call Saul Game of Thrones home
landmass a little old house cards man
it's a little old Mad Men last season
and then and then orange is the new
black which a lot of people weren't sure
about because there were new rules this
year saying that if you were like you
could choose what to submit in there
wasn't a rule hard fast rule I'm like if
you have a half hour show it must be
submitted as a comedy so orange is the
new black they were like well what do we
submit us because that show can be very
funny and they were like but we're kind
of more of a drama but they had been
submitting previously as a comedy so
they were really all excited to be
nominated in drama because they weren't
sure because that's a much tougher
category to get nominated in a few
there's there's a lot of really good
comedy on TV but like usually there's a
handful that are like very obviously the
best and then but drama right now
scripted drama is just so good
interesting so I thought I like I'm like
a TV nerd this is like my thing I was
super excited to see a lot of people get
nominated that deserved it this year
Tatiana measly from from orphan black
got nominated finally after years and
years of people on the internet like
screaming at the Emmy Academy being like
what's right with ya like dodgy animes
Lee is amazing because she plays all
those clones yeah and then like and then
I think Jon Hamm got nominated twice
like once for lead actor in Mad Men and
then
once is a Guest Actor an unbreakable
Kimmy Schmidt because he plays the the
past or whatever like so great so so
great so it was a really good year for
nominations I'm actually really looking
forward to the Emmys like last year it
kind of fell a little bit boring so I
feel like this year is a little bit more
of a refresh a little more competitive a
little more diverse in terms of like
what types of shows and where they came
from so every year we just keep getting
more more cord-cutting like shows
showing up in the emmy so it's it must
be making a lot of the network's really
nervous yeah there's a lot of good
there's a lot of good stuff was
daredevil nominated for anything no a
lot of guys get out yeah just go I don't
it might have been nominated in lesser
categories that like it wasn't like any
of the main ones it wasn't but you know
there's always season two it's a fresh
show so it's got plenty of time so much
time that's what I meant you right now
Emmy nominations now I get to start my
betting pools start an Emmy Poole yeah
buddy I'm all in on daredevil daredevil
just all in good all right guys let's
time to talk about user feedback I may
have made a terrible mistake yesterday
during the show by completely blanking
and forgetting to mention the hashtag of
the day that's no big deal we didn't
talk about it but that's okay because I
asked some people on my Twitter going to
give us some answers so yesterday's
hashtag was technically TD breathe and
we were gonna ask like what food you'd
want to inhale if you could turn it into
a Miss cuz we talked about the alcohol
architecture I think you just assumed
I'd say pizza so you didn't even ask the
question yeah maybe it's not just
telepathically knew and I felt like it
had already happened because I can see
it so clearly in my mind's eye the whole
conversation so glad that conversation
like we must have and what did you say
like cupcakes I'm sure yeah I was like
donuts donuts cupcake something
something was choked a lot of sugar in
it um so what would your said would it
be pizza yeah yeah be pizza mine would
be donuts or cupcakes see ya there'd be
pizza care all right um but I asked a
couple of you guys you guys had some
good answers uh this jose wrote in and
said imagine a hot nasty 97 degree day
with no chance of a breeze then you
inhale some cold strawberry ice cream
missed I like that that's marks really
good like that like cold mist that seems
really cool um no puns
Walter then wrote and said no I enjoy
eating my food he likes to masticate
chew his chew stuff yeah um and then we
got a couple of other ones just really
briefly uh chocolate we saw bacon a
Nutella atmosphere mmm that's a good one
yeah somebody Brandon said I'd want to
breathe in kale not kale it's got to be
better than eating it to get my
nutrients it's good breathe in
vegetables like that would be cool no
breathe man and then the Tulsa Nader
said so much k so in all caps she's just
a strip cheese yeah this is a good
question that was a question so and good
answers thank you and sorry I apologize
I wish I would have remembered but like
I said I just I really felt like we have
that conversation and then I guess we
didn't so hey the shag today as TD
forget yeah TD whoops was my bad um
alright guys let's talk about our very
last pc user feedback it's our photog
refer the day are you thinking about
shadows order right now oh that's kind
of great I'm thinking about cuz i have
all the warchiefs anyway ok well like
how far into the game did you actually
drop out i was i think i'm at the end of
the second act I don't know if that's
how games don't work in 30 ish yeah I
feel like I've got to be near the end I
skip the sty skip the story I'll be
completely honest I am ashamed of you I
just don't I don't care you just want
their like combat well I'd it's just the
whole Lord of the Rings like like i love
i love learn no I love lower the rigs
but when they're messing around with
stuff that isn't the main story of like
we're following the ring bearer it's
like do we must do rescue the princess
from the orcs like we yeah that's how
these games yeah so yeah that's it's
just not not super interested in the gay
it's a great game here in Game place so
anyway fair enough so what kind of
pretty picture we got 40 we got a good
way Cavill wrote in and said hi took
