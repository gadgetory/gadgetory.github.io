at the Huawei p20 and the p20 Pro I
haven't even opened them up I'm saving
them for years so let's take these bad
boys out and see what's inside
so these are two totally different
phones from Huawei one of them is
definitely more of the flagship device
but I got sent both of these together
huh see Huawei a little a reviewers
guide here we'll put that off to the
side and here is the p20 and here is the
p20 pro so it looks like probably not
really gonna need the box cutter always
made this easy let us save the best for
last
the p20 pro and let's check out the p20
first so this is always follow up to the
p10 you can see right on the box the
claim that the camera was co-designed
with leica that's a partnership that's
been going on for a while alright so
what do we have here we've gotten the
phone hard to tell from this angle what
color they sent me it is blue this is
really pretty it's got a very reflective
mirrored surface on the back I already
see my fingerprint and some smudges on
here but I also see that there's a dual
camera setup so there's a 12 megapixel
camera on the back that's the RGB color
camera and then we also have a 20
megapixel monochrome camera so this is
not a telephoto lens this is monochrome
to add richness and detail and of course
to take those black-and-white shots we
also have the Leica name on the back
here flash there's color temperature on
the front looks basic black right now of
course there's a fingerprint reader on
the front this is a little different
from previous Huawei phones that have
had the fingerprint reader on the back
on the front we have a 24 megapixel
camera it looks like a little round
speaker here at the top and another
thing that this phone has but that is in
fact it's pretty interesting is there is
a notch
that is digitally cut out but if you
like it you can turn it off in the
settings it's amazing
basically you just get blackout bars on
the side so while this comes up let's
see what else we have in the box here we
have a SIM card tool it's pretty
standard not as for of course opening up
the SIM card tray so that you can pop in
your SIM anything else in here
no so the p20 phones are not selling in
the u.s. at all so we have a very
gigantic europlug it does come with
while we supercharged that's their fast
charging for the battery here alright so
charging brick aside then we have a USBC
charger charging cord charging cable I
always like the ones that detach that's
mostly what you see these days but then
you can plug it into something else to
charge it up and then what else do we
have here some earbuds kind these are
pretty standard they connect through USB
see because there is no headphone jack
but you can see the notch now and you do
get a dongle so if you do want to listen
to your wired headphones you can open up
this envelope or rip it open as I'm
doing very glamorously or I could use
these scissors that's smart and you have
the dongle that will connect into the
phone so that you can use your own wire
and headphones I'm not a big fan of
dongle life I don't understand why
phones can't just have headphone jacks
too and Samsung is definitely shown that
this is possible this seems to me like
it's pretty easy to lose but that is the
way of this phone okay so that is the
Huawei P 20 let's put all of these aside
and see if there are any extra goodies
in the p20 Pro which is of course for
Huawei the phone that they really want
to sell you and you'll see why in a
second that's there right on the box
triple camera this is actually the first
phone to have three cameras on the back
for photography it is
pretty much the same as the Huawei p20
but as we're going to see it adds a
third lens and the first thing I notice
is that this is a different color this
is what they're calling Twilight I
always say that it looks a little bit
like a Starbucks unicorn Frappuccino I
don't know if it's really easy to tell
but insert and lighting like especially
if you've got a lot of natural light the
color shifts and it's kind of like bluey
purpley and it's just it's really pretty
it's really mesmerizing so we see
immediately those three lenses on the
back a lot of differences here between
the p20 in the p20 Pro first of all
instead of a 12 megapixel camera we've
got a 40 megapixel lens still the 20
mega pixel monochrome lens and then we
have an 8 megapixel telephoto lens and
that's got optical image stabilization
on it other differences are the screens
so you've got a different screen size
5.8 inches here and 6.1 inches on the
larger p20 pro but what you can't really
tell by looking right now is these are
booting up is that the screen technology
is completely different to the p20 uses
an LCD screen and the p20 pro uses OLED
so so these are very different phones
you still have the fingerprint reader on
the front here beneath the screen very
slim bezels not the slimmest we've ever
seen but I don't mind I think the design
is actually really nice it's really
sleek power button on the side otherwise
the design looks pretty much the same
there are differences internally but
right now the box okay so so far looking
like we kind of have the exact same
configuration got the holder we've got
the empty envelope of nothingness with
the sim card tool I do like a sim card
tool and I don't know what to tell you
it's exactly the same the exact same
charger the exact same cables and dongle
and I was kind of hoping for a little
bit more for this signature Twilight
color and also just for the fact that
you know this p20 Pro a first phone with
three camera lenses on the
I would hope that Huawei would have done
something special it's also you know
it's it's pricier so you're looking at
about six hundred pounds for the p20 and
you're looking at two hundred pounds
more than that for the p20 pro right
this is actually like a pretty expensive
device and when you pull it out of the
box really not a lot of fanfare but
that's okay because we definitely are
curious about how this phone will
perform it's got a big battery in it
it's got a lot of RAM it's got a pretty
fast processor those cameras we're
talking about the same 24 megapixel
camera on the front some super slow
motion video on here portrait lighting a
lot of things that you see in the iPhone
10 and definitely in the power to take
on the galaxy s 9 which I have over here
too but in terms of color of gotta say
they come in really close how well will
the Huawei P 20 and P 20 Pro perform
stick around we'll have a full review
coming up and we are gonna hit these
cameras really hard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
