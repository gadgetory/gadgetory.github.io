parts Apple is currently in the middle
of a legal fight with Qualcomm over the
cost of patents and licensing fees The
Wall Street Journal reports that Apple
is looking into making future iPhones
and iPads that do not need Qualcomm
chips cutting the company out completely
of course there's a chance Apple and
Qualcomm could work things out and this
report could just be a tactic Apple is
using to put more pressure on Qualcomm
during their pricing battle you see it's
a bit messy so allow me to break it down
with a simple summary Qualcomm is the
biggest provider of mobile chips and it
has patents for a lot of the technology
used in today's mobile devices Qualcomm
also makes really fast modems that's
what helps you connect to the internet
the iPhones that connect to Verizon and
Sprint networks use Qualcomm modems but
I found that connect to AT&amp;amp;T and
t-mobile Networks use Intel modems so
this whole story is that Apple may be
trying to see if Intel can work with all
wireless networks and be the main modem
supplier for all of its iPhones Intel is
not necessarily better but cutting
Qualcomm out could save Apple money
Apple may also bring in another modem
maker as a backup like China's media
tech back in January Apple filed a suit
against Qualcomm for about 1 billion
dollars saying that the wireless chip
maker wasn't fair and how it licensed
its technology Apple says it's paying
too much and paints Qualcomm as a bully
so as a response
Qualcomm sued Apple for patent
infringement and it is seeking a ban on
iPhone sales Qualcomm said the iPhone or
any modern smartphone would not have
been possible without its cellular
technologies I am Bridget Carey and you
had to see net to read more details on
the legal battle that could change the
future of the iPhone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
