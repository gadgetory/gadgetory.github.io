BMW v Mercedes E and a bunch of other
tough competitors the look is absolutely
cutting edge the cabin tech not quite so
much so the driver assistance you decide
let's drive the 2013 Infiniti M 56 and
check the tech
now the first thing I'll tell you about
the m56 and its current generation about
2/3 model years now is that nothing else
looks like this these shapes and curves
are unique in its category no one's ever
gonna say oh you got a new 5 Series now
this thing looks totally apart inside
though the cabin Tech is a little more
long in the tooth let's take a look oK
you've seen much of what's in this car
before the familiar infinity controller
you turn you push you jog eight inch
color LCD that map style is evolved some
but it's still basically what they've
been doing for a handful of years one
thing I forgot to be honest in this car
that's a touchscreen I never think to
touch it it's too far away so I use the
controller a lot but remember this thing
is a Touch and that's often the best way
to get on these commands no matter which
of these menu buttons I go to here one
thing you're not going to see no apps
this is one of the last cars in the
premium sector that doesn't have true
apps support the way so many others are
doing these days
it's a dated head unit for that reason
alone by middle of this year by the time
you see this video perhaps the new
Infiniti Q will be out the q50 and that
promises a completely new head unit you
may need to think about buying one of
these until second half of 2013 if you
really value the best tech here I want
to mention the voice command in this car
not because it's all that advanced but
it does work well here's what I mean
navigation address california san
francisco 1 now what i want you to
notice there is how you have to parse it
still which is kind of old-school in
other words one button push for city
another for street that's old but the
speed of recognition here is very
admirable now all these 56 cars the v8
cars come with a Bose audio system we've
got an upgrade through the Sport Package
for some reason that puts Bose 5.1
various types of processing for noise
and soundstage and speakers on the
shoulders of the seats 16 of them around
the car as far as sources good
USB plus iPod a2dp bluetooth streaming
satellite radio optical disc you're good
to go now let's look at some of the
driver controls in here this is the only
shifter you're ever gonna see in this
car one choice only 7-speed automatic
left side for a shifting gate with this
or if you've got the Sport Package which
we do you get a pair of very long
magnesium column mounted paddles that's
exactly where they should go and they
should be nice and long like that so
pretty much wherever you are there's a
paddle under your fingers and they don't
swing around and change their role in
their position this button right here is
what they call DC a distance control
assist that's basically to keep you from
running into someone ahead of you the
car is always reading and applying the
brakes and giving you a warning to keep
you from bumping into someone especially
in slower traffic here is your cruise
control on/off and this button above it
tells you it's adaptive cruise control
I've also got blind spot detection as
well as blind spot screw up intervention
in other words the car will steer you
away if you're about to drift into a car
on the left or the right and do the same
thing with Lane drift that has active
lane departure technology okay end of
the hood welcome to the halls of
tradition this is a v8 and a big 15.6
litre hence the name of the car that's
kind of antiquated these days I mean a
big displacement v8 unless you're in a
car well north the six figures is
starting to feel kind of like old
thinking no turbos no blower nothing
just a dual overhead cam 5.6 v8 that
gives you 420 horsepower here 417
foot-pounds of torque
mucho on both counts this guy weighs
nearly 4,000 40 pounds but still gets up
to 60 in 4.8 seconds simply because of
that big ol motor mpg is fine it's 1624
given the weight of the car and how fast
it can move itself I'm ok with that
oh by the way in Japan they don't even
sell the v8 version of this car they
offer the hybrid as the high performance
version they're thinking a few years
ahead of us
now the first thing you notice driving
this car is prodigious power but getting
to it I think in a really responsive way
requires you you shift it yourself I
didn't get a lot of satisfaction out of
even the sport mode on that mode control
dial down here it still left the
transmission to loopy and floaty and
hunting I had to go to the manual gate
and then get here on the paddles
then I more or less got things the way I
wanted but there's still some weird lag
in there getting to the power it feels
like turbo language of course it isn't
so I got to believe it's processor lag
the suspension in the car is not active
it's you know Springs and rods and bars
as a result it doesn't do enough to
change personality between a comfortable
mode and a sport mode regardless again
of where that knob is one thing I take
away from all these infinities
especially the big dollar models is I
feel like I'm driving a computer with
wheels they have a very sterile
high-tech feel I think that's part of
what infinities going for they really
want that high-tech message and there's
an awful lot of processed feeling and
feedback coming through this car's
various interfaces but that may not be
for everybody especially in this price
class and with a major powertrain like
this you may be looking for a more
street fighting car
okay let's price this guy a 2013 M 56
rear-wheel drive is about 62 grand
admittedly well-equipped but not fully
seen that style on top of that you've
got to add about $3,000 for the tech
package which is all that driver
assistance stuff and adaptive cruise
another 5,600 for the Sport package
sport break sport suspension four-wheel
steering and that's also how you get
bose 5.1 and i hate when they link
dissimilar stuff in a package like that
this car is an easy 71 thousand dollar
ticket to go seen that style you can
push it to 75 and that's a little bit of
a tough piece to buy it off for the
Infiniti brand
