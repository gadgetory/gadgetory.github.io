Bridget Carey and this is your CNET
update the new vine app seems to have a
porn problem vine a Twitter app that
allows people to share 6-second looping
video clips launched last week with a
lot of buzz but it only took a couple of
days before users started loading up
clips that are not safe for work
searches for hashtags like porn and sex
bring up graphic results you'll even
stumble on porn now just by browsing the
most recent vines vines Terms of Service
do not forbid sexually explicit content
so the question everyone's asking now is
how long will this app be available to
download in Apple's App Store Apple has
a strict policy over banning apps with
adult content and nudity so will Apple
ban the app or make an exception for a
Twitter owned application perhaps it's
giving Twitter a chance to clean up its
act if you haven't heard of vine yet
this new Twitter video app is getting
buzz only because Twitter's behind it
it's not actually something most people
will get value out of using Instagram
grew popular because it enhanced the
photos you were already taking and
became a community of people to tell
stories of their life and snapshots
browsing vines 6-second looping clips
will just make you disoriented with bad
editing and shaky recordings of trivial
things like people making coffee at its
best vine is a good way to express your
creative side with artsy stop-motion
animations but that takes time and
currently 99% of vine posts are junk if
you don't have an iPhone you shouldn't
feel left out for now but if you think
otherwise post a comment on the update
blog or write me an update at cnet.com
in other news there's talk of another
Retina Display iPad model being readied
for release that would have 128 gigs of
memory the report comes from 9 to 5 Mac
iPhone users can now download the iOS
6.1 update the software has a few minor
features and bug fixes and if you've
been considering an upgrade to Windows 8

cheaper price upgrades to the pro
version cost $40 per computer unless you
just bought a computer after June 2nd in
which the upgrade cost 15 dollars but
after Thursday January 31st the price
for the upgrade sky
gets to 200 bucks for the pro version
Microsoft will be releasing its next
version of Office on Tuesday it's called
office 2013 so look to see Nets full
review on that one it launches and the
big blackberry 10 revealed comes
