we went just outside our backyard just
off the coast to a place with some of
the biggest waves and most extreme
surfing in all of North America OS 10
now Mavericks is a release with deep
technology focused on extending battery
life and providing responsiveness it has
great new apps and enhancements for
every Mac user and some features that we
think are going to really appeal to our
power users and I want to talk about
just three of them right now starting
with finder tabs sounds like you guys
know how this is gonna work so you of
course can work in the finder with
multiple windows it's a very powerful
tool but now you can draw all those
windows together in tabs here's finder
environment I got a lot going on a lot
of Windows a lot of different locations
I'm going to go up here to the window
menu and let's merge all my windows just
like that it hopped into a set of tabs
now of course these tabs at different
locations different view settings for
each of those locations creating a tab
is just to choose it you'd expect just
click plus i can select another location
like airdrop maybe another for this work
file share I've going right here and now
that I have multiple tabs it's a really
great way to actually work in copy
documents if I want to copy this field
report I can just hover over the airdrop
tab drop it just like that really nice
and of course I can now take finder full
screen next let's take a look at tagging
this is really cool so as I go to save a
document you notice I can give it a name
like let's say project plan and in
addition to its location in this case
I'm going to save it in iCloud I can
also give it a tag from any of the tags
I've made up so i'm going to call this
document important looks pretty
important to me and we'll go here into
the finder and you've seen the Finder
sidebar I have an important tag and I
see all these documents they're from
different locations different
applications all drawn together in
sidebar we have other tags have given
things for things that are draft and in
review now of course with tags I can
assign multiple tags to the same
document it's part of the power of tags
so I go here and I'm going to say this
one is also in review and you notice as
I sign that tag
it now appears in that location as well
I can also assign tags by just dragging
things in to the tag area in the finder
so different assets from my website just
drag them in and they're tagged like
that and tags are great for searching
next let's take a look at multiple
displays I'm going to open up some of
the kind of windows that I often working
with will open up iphoto here maybe a
keynote presentation and I actually have
a second display connected to this
macbook pro let's show that up there on
the display now of course with multiple
displays I can just move windows cross
displays like you'd expect but now i can
get up at my menu bar in the second
display if i go down to the bottom i can
summon the dock just like that if i want
to open an app on the second display i
can just open it on the dock here and
here's itunes take this app full screen
just like that and as I swipe spaces
just right back there just on that
display let's take a keynote full screen
as well I'm gonna go back to my first
display here let's even take I photo
full screen so now I have different full
screen apps on my different displays
it's actually a really fantastic way to
work going here in two favorite travels
and I can now drag assets across my full
screen apps like that super cool and
Mission Control has just been super
charged for multiple displays so I'm
going to go now into Mission Control and
we see my different full screen spaces
and desktops across applications I can
drag a window from one display to
another but I can also go and drag a
full screen app right across displays
bring preview open and now I've have
that full screen on this display as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
