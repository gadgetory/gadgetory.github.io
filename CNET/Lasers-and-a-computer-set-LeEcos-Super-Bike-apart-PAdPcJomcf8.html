event in San Francisco where this video
streaming company from China had just
launched some televisions some
telephones and this what it calls its
super bite we've got a carbon fiber
frame we've got a thirty gear Shimano
drive system we've got hydraulic disc
brakes these are all the latest in
bicycle componentry this isn't actually
an electric bike although it does have a
generator in the front hub that powers
all the electrical systems from lights
on this light we've got a brake light
we've got a headlight we've got side
blinkers which I can turn on and off at
the push of a button and we also have
what they call laser guides this paints
a laser stripe on the pavement next to
you that tells drivers another bicyclist
that this is your space we also have an
electric parking brake I can activate it
the push of a button that locks the rear
wheel so somebody can just ride away
with my call but they could pick it up
and run away we have a computer mounted
into the stem now this is an Android
computer kind of like a phone but it's
built in
and there's also heartrate monitors in
the handlebars so this will feed your
health information to the cycling
computer the second computer also looks
at miles you've gone prime rate things
like that and finally we have an action
camera built into the handlebars here so
you can quickly video any of your rides
and catch those drivers and motorcycles
that are getting to the bike lane in
front of you you can turn that on and
off with a button on the frame to this
super bike is currently being sold in
China this model won't be available in
the US the company is actually working
on a model more tailored to the North
American market so we'll see what that
looks like when it comes out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
