what if you didn't need to buy the
latest console to play games like
Assassin's Creed Odyssey that's what
Google is testing with project stream a
technical beta that brings the latest
Assassin's Creed game to your Chrome
browser no console no installation but
how well does the game actually perform
streaming over the Internet compared to
old-fashioned methods like downloading
and installing it we played a little of
bolt for the purposes of looking at them
side by side and determining what if
anything was sacrificed in the name of
bandwidth
Google promised that Assassin's Creed
Odyssey could stream @ 1080p at 60
frames per second unlike streaming video
games required little to no latency
meaning they don't have the luxury of
buffering so unless you have flawless
internet service you're going to notice
the performance dips one of the most
noticeable is frame rate when project
stream is firing on all cylinders
its glorious you almost can't tell the
difference from version streaming on a
Chrome browser to one installed on a
console and this is what we experienced
during cutscenes and smaller gameplay
sequences however most of the open-world
exploration combat dips to an acceptable
30 frames per second
when internet stability was at its worst
there was some noticeable pixelation as
a resolution dropped from 1080p to 720p
but those instances were not nearly as
frequent what about latency well that
never seemed to be an issue whether we
were riding horseback fighting handfuls
of enemies or soaring through the skies
the game's controls were responsive and
never caused any issues during the time
we spent playing the project stream
controls did feel little less sensitive
than the console version when using the
joysticks to make small moves such as
walking but it felt like personal
preference as opposed to filling like a
limitation we never expected assassin's
creed Odyssey to perform better on
project stream that on consoles but it
does have some advantages for one it's
super easy to jump into the game
assuming you have fast enough internet
to pass the connection test much like
when you put your Xbox or Playstation
asleep the game resumes right where you
left off when you return this is
especially helpful if your game has ever
interrupted due to lost connection load
times also seem slightly faster on
projects stream this is apparent when
switching between Alexios and his eagle
companion all in all project stream
delivers on the ability to play a
blockbuster game like Assassin's Creed
with near lossless quality it seems like
it would be a great option for people
that like to game on the go without
lugging a bunch of hardware around but
doesn't quite live up to the quality of
gaming with traditional hardware yet
with some time and infrastructure
perhaps some of the kinks could be
worked out and we'll see support for
things like multiplayer and 4k
resolution but until then we'll keep on
playing Odyssey until the beta ends in
