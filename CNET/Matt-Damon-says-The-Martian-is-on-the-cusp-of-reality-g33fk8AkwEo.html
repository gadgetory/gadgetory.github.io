still alive obviously I have no way to
contact NASA what my crewmates but even
if I could it would take four years for
another manned mission to reach me and
I'm gonna have designed the last 31 days
so in the face of overwhelming odds I'm
left with only one option I'm gonna have
to science the out of this so for
you personally there ever been a
situation where you've had to science
the out of something and now you
have God hey God if I have to science
the out of something we're in deep
deep so I did did you specifically
do anything to prepare for the role or
did Ridley ask you to do anything
specific to prepare for the role the
first time I met ridley he said he
always wanted to make Robinson Caruso
you know and we were looking at this as
like okay it's writes the Robinson
Crusoe story but what makes it different
is actually the fact that this guy's got
cameras all over the place and he's
talking to them and he's leaving a log
for other scientists so that they can
learn from his experience and that in
and of itself makes it different because
his behavior in a way is observed you
know or he has the feeling that it's
observed so so it's not that kind of
existential loneliness that you get in
something like castaway or Robinson
Crusoe it is but it's got this extra
layer of you know of self-awareness to
it okay let's do the math I gotta figure
out how to grow four years worth of food
here on a planet where nothing grows
but if I can't figure out a way to make
contact with NASA none of this matters
anyway I just thought this story was
incredible and since so so fun and
entertaining but like but really
engaging so I you know that that was
kind of what what drew me to it so
recently you've been involved in quite a
few science and space-based films how
has that impacted your perception of
what astronauts do and what they'll have
to do especially with the Martian to go
to Mars yeah well this movie is really
meant to take place in the very very
near future so we're right on the cusp
of being able to do a lot of the things
that that we do in the movie and that is
really it's just humbling to think of
like what these people do because it's
incredibly dangerous and and and so it
takes a lot of courage it takes a lot of
intelligence and and but it's really
also incredibly necessary for us to
eventually get some of the species off
of our planet you know in order to do so
we have to find some other place where
we can go and and trying to determine
that and figure that out and start to
make another place hospitable is like
really really tough dangerous work so
the world
to my family I never stopped fighting
to make it home
