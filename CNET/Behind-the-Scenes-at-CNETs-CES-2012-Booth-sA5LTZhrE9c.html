at CES 2012 now we're just a couple days
before the show starts
everyone's unpacking their boxes and
setting up their stages we wanted to
give you guys a first look at what
people will see here from the South Hall
escalator and right away boom there you
have it that is our 25-foot ever Brian
screen with all the announcements of
what's happening at our CNET booth and
then next to it you have this amazing 8
foot in diameter shiny our CNET red ball
logo we kind of like to call it the
skittle because it looks like you could
eat it but that guy we want to take that
bad boy home with us after the show
you'll also see right next to it our
stage from behind you'll see a ticker on
top that has all the latest information
on what's happening over there but
enough about the outside let's go inside
the booth so you can show you what we
have cooking inside there hey guys so
we're here at the CES food we have all
these boxes and crates that we're pretty
much unpacked for the most part but well
you guys came to see is voila our entire
CES 2012 stage it looks beautiful right
now we have our first looks q this is
where a lot of our editors get the
badges from the devices that you want to
see they'll be shooting them here in
front of everyone live then we're gonna
kind of come out here into our lounge
area this is where all of you guys kind
of hang out with everyone you'll see
here our friends of sprint have provided
these charging stations because you know
at CES you need power for your toys then
we've got this amazing wall here we have
three screens set up here and then I
guess you could call this our wall of
fame I don't know so much about that
over here we have our little lounger
where tablets we set up and the lovely
the exclusive you know you want one of
these how can I get them well come by
our booth maybe you will alright let's
keep on walking over here you'll see
again this is our main stage area kind
of a different look we'll have our
entire setup with our plasma behind
there this is where we'll have a lot of
our live content going on but again it
looks amazing it's really reaching up
high in tall so we have a just an
excellent presence here at CES now in
past years you guys been able to see our
editors hard at work from the outside
this year you know they're kind of
this cloth curtain type wall but we want
to still show you what's happening the
inside kind of some of like guts and the
stuff that you really won't see it all
if you're here at CES so let's just kind
of walk you this way I'm going to take
you over to our editing bayen stations
this is where really all the action
happens all the first looks all the
pieces like the one that you see here
they're all being done you guys are hard
at work right
really working alright this is the shows
in two more days so you know they'll be
hustling and crunching away in a little
bit now there's also a lot of
audio/video equipment that goes on
behind the scenes that controls all the
screens and all the visuals you guys see
here at our CES 2012 booth so what we
have over here laptops with laptops
these are backups some of the content
that we're displaying we have our flash
animations for our schedules over here
this is some of the video content that
you'll see that appears on our plasmas
and then this big rig over here this is
the setup that controls that large
25-foot ever Brian's screen it pops and
this is all the machinery that makes it
work and then of course you see a lot of
cables you see a lot of buttons but over
here we love to have the screens within
the screens that manages every single
piece of content that you see pumped out
from here and onto the stage so that's
the back of our huge 25-foot ever Brian
screen well let's take you right here
into the control room your setting here
where all the content is really directed
and created and controlled now we have
this little people that reveals the
entire stage we still have people
working on the stage right now let me
let me give these guys a little bit of
morale boost hey guys nice job with the
tape see they like that all right now
when we come out here also you'll see
where all the cameras are viewing this
will help our director put up the vision
that he wants to see on the screen that
you guys will see at home and then we're
