Bridget Carey this is your cnet update
reddit one of the most visited sites on
the internet is undergoing changes this
10 year old site is one giant discussion
board to share links and talk about
anything but that anything goes
philosophy contributed to the creation
of a very dark side of Reddit a cesspool
of hate and violence in the beginning it
was designed as a place to say anything
you want but that tone is changing as
the company is growing last year reddit
received a 50 million dollar investment
now it's making small steps to address
that dark side the co-founder and new
CEO Steve Huffman laid out new rules in
a post saying that it's going to ban
spam harassment publishing people's
private information and anything that
incites harm or violence against an
individual or group of people but you'll
still be able to find hateful speech the
way reddit works is that there are
subcategories for an endless list of
topics and reddit is continuing to allow
topics for groups that promote bigotry
among other filth instead of banning it
read it's just going to put a curtain
over it and hide it in the corner
flagging it as indecent and requiring
you to opt-in to seeing it read it says
it also isn't going to make it
searchable and it's not going to sell
ads on it so why not just clean up
everything crude perhaps read it doesn't
want a complete revolt from its massive
user base of a hundred and sixty four
million monthly visitors even if they
don't sell ads on the pages that are
vile I'm sure they're still counting
those users and activity in their
overall numbers to attract advertisers
and show growth you see this is red it's
big identity problem does a care more
about growing as a business or doesn't
want to be a home for trolls former CEO
Ellen Pao wrote in an editorial quote
the trolls are winning but perhaps those
trolls are finding a new place to stay
the site vote Co is marketing itself as
the place to go if you don't like red is
restrictions vote promises completely
unfettered free speech and it's ranked
by users just like red it is with no
legal subject out of bounds there's a
different sort of drama brewing over at
uber the ride-hailing app ever since it
rolled into our lives uber husband
fighting a constant
battle against government regulators
over its operations which threaten the
status quo of taxi Commission groups
ubers latest battle with New York City
has changed the app if you use the app
in New York there's a new option called
de Blasio named after New York Mayor
Bill de Blasio and when you click on it
it shows no cars available and a wait
time of 25 minutes asking users to tell
the mayor against the city putting
limits on the service you see the City
Council is scheduled to vote soon our
proposal to cap ubers growth to fight
traffic congestion but Hoover says it
shouldn't be capped and there's demand
for these jobs it's a battle free market
versus government that's it for this
tech news update there's always more to
dive into its cnet com from our studios
in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
