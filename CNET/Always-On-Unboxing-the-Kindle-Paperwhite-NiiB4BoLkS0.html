paperwhite now this is the one that
comes with that light technology I'm
very curious to see and it replaces the
e-ink touchscreen Kindle which we have
right here alright let's get inside the
box pretty minimal packaging and
actually that's a little dangerous as
you can see our box arrived pretty
banged up hopefully it's okay okay so
here's our paper white note to self do
not call it paperweight you're gonna
want to trust me so inside the box we
just have the charging cable no wall
wart you can never complain enough about
no Walmart the bezel is black not the
kind of charcoal gray that we've all
gotten used to with those latest gen
Kindles okay oh it's pretty nice it's
super sleek and you can see there are no
physical buttons on this guy at all this
is all touch screen it feels super
smooth the mat back is really grippy
some of the other Kindles are a little
bit slippery hopefully it's a little bit
charged for us to thinking wow so
there's that light you can see that come
on immediately this is meant to be kind
of a cross between a tablet and an e-ink
kindle you can compare here our e ink
Kindle isn't in the greatest of shape
but this looks a little much more like a
book that is bright alright while we
load up our books here let's get to the
specs it has a six inch e-ink display
using Amazon's patented light technology
which they claim evenly illuminates the
screen for perfect reading under any
condition there are two gigabytes of
internal storage which translates to
1,100 books the previous Kindle Touch
had four gigs of storage so this is a
little bit less it weighs seven point
eight ounces and there are no buttons
it's fully touch screen and amazon says
a single charge will last eight weeks
even with the light on we'll see
unfortunately there's no headphone jack
or audio output for audiophiles the
paperwhite costs $119 with ads for the
Wi-Fi only version
and there's also a 3g version that will
run you one hundred and seventy dollars
if you want to opt out of the ads it'll
cost you an extra twenty bucks I got to
say at first blush the kindle paperwhite
is like cognitive disconnect because it
looks like a kindle which is kind of
like a book but then it acts like a
tablet or a computer with all the touch
screening and the like shiny light and
stuff i mean it's nice it's a very nice
device and i'm sure that the light would
actually prove to be pretty handy it
might take a little getting used to but
all in all I suspect it's going to be a
winner it is also in fact a cnet editors
choice so it's definitely a winner with
