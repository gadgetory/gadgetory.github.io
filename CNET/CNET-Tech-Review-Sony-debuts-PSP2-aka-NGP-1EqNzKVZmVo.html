your eyes on Sony's long anticipated
next generation portable whatever it's
called a new radio app for the mixtape
set will count down the top technologies
destined for the garbage heap and go
behind the scenes of the most popular
Apple centric show in the history of
CNET it's all coming up right now
hi everyone I'm Molly wood and welcome
to the CNET tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer our unique tech
wisdom in the form of the bottom line
let's get started with the good this
week in Tokyo Sony announced the long
rumored and finally confirmed
PlayStation Portable or PSP 2 although
for some reason they're calling it the
Sony next generation portable or NGP I
don't know anyway our friends from
GameSpot we're on hand for the big event
and here's what they were able to find
out hey everybody this is Ricardo Torres
from GameSpot comm here with the first
look at the NGP which most people
understand is the PlayStation Portable 2
or the successor to the PlayStation
Portable we have it next to a PSP go
which is the latest version of the
hardware that's been on the market for a
while
for those to be that are wondering the
NGP is considerably beefier than the
original PSP you're looking at a 5 inch
LED touchscreen in fact the device has
also a touchpad on the back in addition
to two analog sticks as you can see
there on the back it is a return to the
have the brick form factor of the
original PSP which you also see is the
buttons that everyone knows and loves
from the original PSP but now you have
two analog sticks in addition the device
is going to not use the UMD media format
they are using a new cartridge based
media format for games in addition the
device much like we've seen on the
original PSP is going to support digital
downloads the device has
Internet connectivity in addition it now
has in addition to Wi-Fi it now has 3G
which will allow a variety of new
features that are being implemented on
the device that are very social
lazy man this one
no word yet on pricing or when we can
expect to see the MGP in the u.s. beyond
in time for the holidays and on a side
note Google searches for Prince's
backing band the new power generation
have been going through the roofs and
Sony's announcement now to date myself
even more remember listening to the
radio and trying to record your favorite
songs but then you'd always miss the
beginning or the DJ would talk over the
end and mess it all up well this new app
called tune in radio will let you relive
that frustration as you record tunes
from radio stations all over the world
welcome to tap that app I'm Jason Parker
and this is the show where we cover the
hottest apps in the mobile space this
week we're showing off a streaming radio
app for the iOS that just might be the
best in its category
it's called tuning radio and it works on
both your iPhone and iPad with an easy
to navigate interface that makes it a
snap to find stations you like powered
by the radio time website tuning radio
offers more than 40,000 stations to
choose from around the globe and you can
even use your iPhones GPS to find your
favorite local stations with all this
audio content it's fortunate that the
interface offers a number of ways to
drill down to exactly what you want to
listen to right from the launch page you
can browse local stations choose
categories like sports or talk radio and
you can browse by language just to name
a few
like other radio streaming apps browsing
the music category gives you an enormous
list of genres to choose from each with
a long list of options around the world
with your local choices at the top once
you find a few stations you like you can
easily bookmark them from the station
page so they show up in your bookmarks
list for later listening the station
page also gives you album art for the
current song the ability to play the
Last FM radio station for the band and
numerous options to view more
information about the current station
while listening to a station if you like
a particular song you can pause and
rewind live radio like a DVR then record
the song from the beginning tune and
Radio keeps all your recordings in a
special section so you can listen to
recorded favorites later one of the best
things about tuning radio is that it
works in tandem with radio time comm
this means that once you sign up for a
free account you can save favorite
station streams on your home computer
then access them from your iOS device
you can even schedule radio time to
record a morning show for example that
you'll later have access to on your
iPhone tune in radio costs $1.99 at the
iTunes App Store but with 40,000
streaming radio stations the ability to
record music and handy tools that work
with the radio time website it's pretty
easy to recommend you tap this app
that's it for this week's show
if you have any suggestions send them to
tap that app at cnet.com I'm Jason
Parker I will see you next week
I'm gonna have to get that and then I'll
be able to hear all those calls to the
dedication lines that I've been missing
they still do that right Rick Dees the
weekly top 40 okay this next section is
for all you computer gearheads out there
first up rich Brown shows us a new
luxury gaming rig that will set you back
almost 5000 bones and then don't bestows
his editors choice award on a mammoth
Nazz enclosure take a look
hi I'm rich brown senior editor for
cnet.com today were gonna take a look at
the brand new Falcon Northwest Mach 5
this giant tower system is a high-end
gaming desktop it cost about 4,800 bucks
and it's one of the fastest gaming
systems we've seen it comes with Intel's
brand new core i7 2670 expect for this
price it also comes with a brand-new
case from Falcon Northwest Mach 5 line
so we'll go over some of the details of
that too so as you can see this is a
very tall system it comes in or about
two feet tall and it weighs almost 75
pounds rip up the front door here and
you can see it's got pretty much a basic
layout there's a blu-ray drive here
couple USB ports down here well as up
top you get a few more USB and audio
connections there's no media card reader
in this build but you do have the option
and you can figure that on Falcons
website so go right inside the system
you'll see this is definitely not your
standard PC build by rotating the
motherboard 90 degrees inside of the
case you get an up venting air flow
situation that means it's a lot cooler
inside for the hot graphics cards as
well as the overclocked liquid-cooled
CPU you see here that Orient's the ports
on the top of the case and you can run
the cables through a slot here plug them
in and there's a cap you put on and it
kind of makes a really tiny cable
situation as well as giving you a
thermal benefit now Falcon Northwest is
not the first vendor that we've seen
with the system like this main gears
shift had this pretty much same outline
in a very similar case regardless this
is out there we think it's a cool design
and it probably makes a lot of sense for
higher-end gaming pcs so going to the
components we mentioned this system has
an Intel Core i7 2600
Intel's brand new Sandy Bridge
processors and is overclockable
4.6 gigs in this system but we've heard
that managers can get up to five
gigahertz or higher considering this is
one of the first core i7s and supporting
motherboards to hit the market we sort
of understand that Falcon wasn't able to
go quite as high as possible with this
system that said we hope that future
systems in this price range from Falcon
or any other vendor really push hard on
the overclocking in order to justify the
cost the reason is the core i7 is so
affordable you get $2,500 systems that
have the same application performance
you're gonna pay this much for a PC
you're gonna want to see that extra
performance edson justify the cost
that's not to say that Falcon didn't
push hard to make this system worth the
price you get to high end GeForce GTX
580 graphics cards here as well as to
solid-state boot drives as well as a
separate one terabyte storage hard drive
here Falcon has put 16 gigs of memory
that's some of the highest we've seen in
a desktop down here you've got a
thousand watt power supply and that
actually should let you add a third
graphics card to this PC if you want to
add one after purchase now we mentioned
that main gear has a similar design to
this Falcons primary innovation is this
separator between the CPU and the
graphics card compartment according to
Falcon the separator gives you better
thermal management by isolating the
graphics cards now our only real issue
with the design of the system comes with
the tool free hard drive base each of
these slots pops out you get a cage here
where you can install a hard drive now
the design is supposed to be tool free
but the problem is Falcon didn't mount
the power of data cables behind each Bay
that means not only they have to run the
cables yourself but if you want to pop
in the drive it's gonna involve sort of
a messy cable operation and you may even
have to take the far end of the case off
in order to really get things connected
finally as I mentioned earlier because
of the rotated motherboard all the ports
are on top of the case you get USB 3
firewire eSATA two kinds of digital
audio DVI plus HDMI along with standard
7.1 audio outs so overall the Mach 5 is
one of the fastest pcs we've seen in our
lab and the new case makes that also one
of the most innovative we'd encourage
you to shop around if you're looking for
a new PC in this price range featuring
Intel's new CPU mostly though this
system lives up to our performance and
value expectations for PC close to 5000
bucks
so I'm Rex Brown this is the Falcon
Northwest Mach 5
if you're looking for the best networks
or server for your home or small office
you're watching the right video hello my
name is dongho and this is the
distinction 1511 + na server from
Synology the first nasa of 2011 that
earns our editors choice award visit a
firebase server
meaning it can host up to 5 SATA hard
drives the server support virtually any
3.5 inch SATA hard drive on the market
in fact is one of the few that can
handle the new 3 terabyte drive with all
this way it can offer up to 15 terabytes
of storage space now the front facing
hard drive bay are very easily
accessible you can just unlock the latch
and pull the Troy out too quickly
service the hard drive you can even do
this without turning the server off as
long as you want to replace only one
hard drive at a time the server support
many red configurations such as raid 5
raid 0 and so on the best rate that you
want to use however is a Synology hybrid
rate which is similar to raid 5 but also
allows for dynamically increasing the
rates capacity without having to build
it from scratch
now if 15 terabytes not enough for you
the server come with plenty of
peripheral ports on the back here you'll
fight to is at our port and for USB 2.0
ports to add even more storage space the
USB ports can also be used to host other
devices such as printers on the back you
can see it so big ventilation fans that
are quiet for how big they are and not
one but su Gigabit Ethernet ports these
two ports can work together either for
fancy purpose or to increase the
throughput speed the best things about
the dis station 15 years when plus and
those that cannot be seen from the
appearance the server runs a very robust
firmware that can be managed over the
web interface the interface is very
organized in advance much like that of
an operating system this makes managing
the servers vast amount of features an
editor for advanced users the server has
many unique features such as the ability
to host up to 20
IP cameras with its comprehensive
surveillance station which is better
than most civil and DVRs on the market
on top of that its performance is the
best we've seen the server is available
now for around nine hundred dollars with
our storage for more information on
whether or not is worth the investment
check out the full review at CENTCOM
once again my name is dongho and this
has been the first look at the
distinction 1511 plus Nass server from
technology so even though rich knocked
the Mach 5 for its hard drive cage
design you can probably avoid having to
deal with it if you just get the sine
ology DiskStation 15 terabytes that is
just plain hot and while you figure out
how you're gonna fill up all that space
besides ripping your entire DVD
collection of course let's take a quick
break but we'll be right back with more
tech review right after this
welcome back to the CNET tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at CNET TV now
without any further ado let's see what's
happening in the bed by show of hands
how many of you got a stack of blu-ray
movies or even a blu-ray player for
Christmas this year
well according to Brian Cooley you might
as well just throw them in the trash
let's check out his top 5 list of doomed
technologies to find out why
techies sit around picking winning
technologies like drinkers pick horses
just their thing
I'm Brian Cooley with my top five picks
of doomed technologies don't feel good
about these if you do you're gambling
with the grocery money don't bet on them
number five
blu-ray oh I hear you blu-ray is already
a good sized hit but as it tries to
equal the impact of its parent DVD it's
getting taken out at the knees by online
streaming to the television even faster
than many of us would have guessed a
year ago I think blu-ray falls somewhere
north of laserdisc bought around
paragraph 9 of the history of home video
number 4 eBook readers
yeah Amazon won't stop telling us the
Kindle is their number one best-selling
most wished for most gifted product what
they don't tell us is how many have they
sold estimates are between one and a
half and three million since November of
2007 and that's by the way the most
popular eReader out there well Apple
sells that many iPads in a couple of
months and it hasn't been on the market
nearly that long a tablet is not a
perfect reader but we're also not a
nation of bookworms either for most of
us the tablets gonna be good enough
especially since our real love is video
and the web readers their niche for life
number three 3d TV yeah it's the newest
thing on the list but I'm still nervous
about it early word from retailers is
that it's proving to be a tough sell
blame it on those glasses and the fact
that they are proprietary to your brand
of TV also the mess of standards and
most of the stuff we watch not being
made better by 3d I'll give this one the
stink of a carnival trick in 2011 I need
to see glasses get standardized displays
standardization as well either frame
sequencing or polarization and tons of
content that is meaningfully presented
in 3d
maybe I'll be convinced number 2
wireless hdmi this one's bubbled up here
and there with various manufacturers and
mostly in proprietary form it's never
taken root I'm just not sure consumers
care yes cabling your home system the
first
is a pain but then you're done for years
and yes that wire crawling up the wall
to your TV is ugly but so is your living
room and you're gonna need a power cord
anyway we're not a nation of interior
design buffs so a technology to
eliminate a snarly mess of cables isn't
gonna find much love now before I take
you to my number one doomed technology
here are five that have emerged as sure
bets over the course of 2010 and well
into the years ahead these guys you can
take to the bank okay my number one
technology that just feels like it's
dead
is Wi-Fi in cars Wow seem like such a
great idea a year or so ago but now we
have so many 3G smartphones 3G tablets
3G notebooks and 3G my 5s and USB
dongles that the idea of a 3G powered
Wi-Fi translator hotspot bolted into the
car to connect devices that already have
3G just doesn't get out of a garage
thanks for watching folks will check in
late 2011 and see how I fared on these
predictions i'm brian cool
Wow come on let's not be too hasty I
mean if you haven't been able to part
with that box of VHS tapes in your attic
yet your blu-ray movies should probably
come in handy for a while I'm sure all
right moving along it's time to check
out this week's bottom line
now that the Verizon iPhone announcement
and Steve Jobs medical leave are behind
us there hasn't been a lot of other news
in the Apple world lately so what better
time to go behind the scenes of the
Apple byte to find out how Brian Tong in
the game put the show together each week
so you want to know what we do here you
know how we make the sausages seen at TV
well tell you what the first ingredient
is dedication I'm the first one here at
work every day I can't remember the last
time someone was here before me and all
I do is I wake up I check out the news
check out all the latest information
because it's really up to me to provide
you guys with the stories that you care
about and you guys do bars do the job so
we have this meeting it's a mandatory
meeting that Brian says we can
brainstorm our ideas he doesn't have any
good ideas they're all lame and the
t-pain one was totally my idea he stole
it but if you ask him he'll deny it
paper toss how's my idea I food you
think he could have come up with that
idea
oh yeah love link I was all mine I shot
that thing well wait a minute no the
last scene that was Brian I just really
like to create a safe place where every
idea is a good idea no there is no I in
team you've heard that but if you switch
the letters around it spells meet and
meets the number one ingredient in
sausage our son Brian is very special to
me because when he was a baby I dropped
him on his head yeah special very
special I'm a professional I've been
doing this kind of work for years the
lights the backdrop everything has to be
perfect I'm so excited to be part of the
scene that team it's it's been like a
dream like come true that's I've been
watching you see that since I was kid
and like I'm such a big fan of the Apple
bite I can't even put it into words
sometime you know once you clean up that
last fun and often my brown ones next
I'm working with professionals here and
I wouldn't expect anything less
I have the utmost confidence in my team
pretty good in a lot of ways
Brian Tong is great to work with because
of his addiction to the teleprompter as
long as you put the words in there he
will be able to regurgitate them alright
let's go guys that's a wrap
yeah it doesn't really make sense
Brian's been doing this for a long time
and he just hasn't really gotten better
welcome to the Apple buy for all the
good and bad inside
about both guess what's coming the next
few months I guess it starts with I
don't think you understand I see Brian
when I walk in in the morning
every shoe I have to stare at him while
I edit every time I turn a corner he's
just there hey dude I almost missed you
want to go get something to eat today

this
and I just feel like our entire team
pours their heart and soul in this
project and we all take a lot of pride
in what we do yeah I feel really lucky
down to work here on the Apple bite all
my life you know I've had a dream of
being an action photographer and using
that camera to capture sports and
athletics and moving objects and
exciting adventurous things and now look
at me taking pictures of Brian Tong
pointing at an iPhone week after week
month after month
Oh what have I become I just gotta say

proud of and just say to ourselves as a
team as one group yeah I did something
special what's happening I'm Brian Tong
and welcome to a little show we called
the Alpha by for all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple the bottom
line this week I'm speechless

right we should really call HR about
that all right that's gonna do it for us
this week everybody but come back next
