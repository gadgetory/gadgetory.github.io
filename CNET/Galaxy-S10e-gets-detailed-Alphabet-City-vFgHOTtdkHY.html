last week with the Infiniti o display on
the S 10 the S 10 plus has that
pill-shaped cut out the S 10 has a 6.1
inch screen the 10 plus packs a 6 point
4 inch display when future also
published images of the budget s10 the
site says it'll be called via galaxy s
10 II I'll say that the e stands for
economy on the e you get two cameras on
the back one on the front there's no
curved sides on the 5.8 inch display if
you wanted a flat galaxy s you're in
luck
the fingerprint sensor will be located
on the power button and not under the
screen like the other two as tense
xda-developers found the FCC filings for
the s10 and found out that the s10 will
support reverse wireless charging and
Wi-Fi six also known as 802 11 a X on
Twitter a leaker says he's got the full
list of s10 models and pricing the e
would cost around 750 euro the s10 would
have two variants one at 899 euro the
other at 1149 euro the s10 plus would
have three configurations Randy from
$9.99 euro to $14.99 euro for some
reason meizu is introducing a phone with
no buttons and no ports it's called a
maze uu0

whole list phone that's something to
brag about

than a third of that
what about specs well it's got wireless
charging a virtual side button an under
screen fingerprint sensor there's no
headphone jack or USB C or SIM tray or
even a speaker grille the zero vibrates
