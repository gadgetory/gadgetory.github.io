and welcome back to another episode of
the 359 podcast this episode 180 and
today with us we have Alfred Inge and
Ben Fox Rubin good morning guys what are
we talking about dividing good morning
we're ganache so much so many they've
got the one year later after the Apple
versus FBI case where it's nothing
happens still all up in the air so your
privacy concerns there's no definite
answer to that yet yeah so we'll
definitely discuss that and you know we
spend a lot of time talking about that
last year and it's actually interesting
to see that it continues to be a damn it
that's right i went there boy we also
wanted to talk about HTC they disclose
that they're planning on coming out with
a mobile VR headset similar to daydream
or gear VR but they claim that it's
going to be a little bit more complex or
a little bit more sophisticated and
Alfred's gonna talk to us a bit about
rock climbing using a are yeah that was
a fun experience once I started getting
feeling in my arms again but uh and you
know after all the falling do you even
lift bro I don't that's but he does
break dance so he's cooler than I don't
know me either of at least yeah I I'll
speak for myself either way send in your
questions and comments we'll get to them
at the end of the show as always Brian
will pick out the best ones will try to
answer as many as possible and that's
about it let's let's get this thing
going all right we're gonna get this
recorded go ahead and submit your
questions and comments about the topics
at hand or anything else in the tech
world today and we'll get to them in
exactly three minutes and forty thirty
what's reported four seconds three
minutes and eighty-seven sec wait no
welcome to the 344 three minutes and 59
seconds from 32 welcome to the 359 I'm
Ben Fox Rubin I'm Alfred hang this time
last year we were talking just about
every day about Apple squabble with the
FBI in which the government tried to get
Apple to unlock an iPhone used in a
terrorist used by a terrorist in the San
Bernardino attack this issue dissipated
after the FBI dropped its request but a
year later this thing is totally
unresolved so I'll
Fred you think this thing is going to
you think this issue between security
and privacy is going to resurface at
some point this year again it definitely
will the Manhattan district attorney has
you know been pressing for this you know
it hasn't been getting as much coverage
but in a lot of cases he's always been
asking you know judges to get orders to
get you know information from people's
iphones that's how they caught a lot of
drug dealers in that sense and you know
it needs to be another major national
incident for this to pop up in the as an
issue for Apple and the FBI again yeah
when you think about that that almost
seems like a no inevitability like
something like that is just bound to
happen at some point if not this year
then maybe next year not that we want it
to happen but it continues to just be
this unresolved issue the issues the
reason why it's been unresolved those
because you know the FBI found somebody
else that was willing to do it for them
right in that sense it was oh all right
we don't need you anymore and then it
turns out that the company that did help
the FBI you know break into the San
Bernardino shooters iPhone that company
ended up getting hacked also which is
what Apple was concerned about in the
first right as far as creating a bath
yeah if the idea if we make this kind of
master key kind of thing what happens
when somebody steals that which is kind
of what happened to the to this firm
yeah one of the I I I so so you and I as
consumers we obviously see this thing as
a big concern obviously I don't want the
government cracking into my iPhone that
seems like too powerful a tool
potentially but to get the other side in
there I wanted to throw out an
interesting quote from FBI director
James Comey he said this last year the
notion that privacy should be absolute
or that the government should keep their
hands off our phones to me that just
makes no sense given our history and our
values so at least that's his position
to say that like this idea of absolute
privacy at least he's not buying it that
is completely absurd if he for him to
say given our history with that too so
yeah yeah next HTC plans to release a
new mobile VR headset as a follow-up to
its high end veve device what's
interesting about this new piece is HD
he claims it will be more sophisticated
than other other mobile VR headsets like
the Samsung gear VR the thing that I
think is really going to be key for this
is what's the price going to be the gear
VR is 100 bucks Google daydream it's
right now it's like fifty dollars what
do you think could work as like a mobile
VR headset I think if they price of the
same as oculus it should be fine I just
love their 100 bucks yeah I just love
their pitch right now where it's
basically I'm you but stronger what's
wit it's like oh it's gonna be like this
but more powerful but yeah that's very
specific thank you for that I it's it I
don't know if this is really gonna get
people like even more interested in VR
if they haven't already but maybe more
sophisticated with VR has been it's not
been as accessible as it should be you
know if everyone had one I think they'd
be way cool or in that sense you know
people making more content for it and
games yeah um last Alfred you had a
chance to go to Brooklyn Boulder to
check out a our rock climbing tell us a
bit about that so rock climbing is it in
its nature is already very difficult but
when you add AR to it so basically they
have a webcam you know connected to a
projector and the webcam registers your
movements and then it has five
checkpoints where as you go through it
it checks off one by one it's kind of
like a race I time trial thing yeah but
it's rock climbing so I know how to run
but I don't know how to rock climb and I
did very poorly with that was it was it
kind of fun like did it make it a more
interesting expediently definitely it's
you know it makes it a game if I ever
start exercising again I will definitely
get into that so if you want to read
more about these stories check us out on
cnet I'm Ben Fox Rubin I'm Alfred Aang
thanks for listening
for the record it's HTC vive yeah oh did
I say viv I don't want to call them out
on everything my mistake I must
mispronounce that every other time I do
say Vybz sometimes I swear at least you
understand the product maybe your
pronunciations off I mean like that's
that's very generous of you yes I
understand the product trying to lend
credibility to the show here trying
right I did confuse it with the company
viv that Samsung bought last year or was
that earlier this year that was a was
that their voice their voice recognition
yeah yeah just VIII IV this is VI ve I
swear I spelled it correctly so anyway
vive fair enough yeah we had to kind of
scam over but tell us more about the
rock-climbing experience yeah we ran out
of time on the podcast as always here's
a extra hours so I think the coolest
thing about it though is that they can
move the checkpoints around which is so
it took me like 35 seconds to do um the
course that they've set for everybody
which I saw a guy do it in like three
seconds right but he probably works
there right yeah yeah either he works
there he goes there a lot but he that
dude was incredible on it um but you
know they can move it around and then
usually in a rock climbing gym when they
need to you know remap like the course
it takes up to a week of planning
because they need to make sure that it's
actually Klima belen it takes like a
full day for them to like actually take
them out and then like put them back
into the other places but with a are
it's essentially they just like drag and
drop it on their laptop right and then
you just go and you like tap them around
they had other game modes that there too
but I didn't get to try them out there's
one called hex it's kind of like the
floors lava mmm but on a rock climbing
wall so like there's like certain parts
on the wall that you can't touch so you
have to like climb around it that's
pretty sweet then they have this one
called like ghost chaser or something
it's kind of like it's like pac-man so
like your rock-climbing but there's like
a little go somebody chasing you not
somebody but there's like a projection
of a ghost like chasing you that's
sounds terrifying I don't want to do
that apparently that one was like
incredibly difficult like no one could
do it yeah it makes a lot of sense to me
to integrate something like this because
obviously like changing up
well as you said can take a lot of time
just adding this additional yarn or
sorry AR layer I kind of wish there was
something like this but not on a rock
climber like running wise we're like is
gonna sound really dorky but like if you
get like the ghost thing but like you
could play tag like by yourself I'm sure
yeah I mean that does sound dorky yeah
no let's play tag with me point one
other thing I mean like I know ghost
mode from like racing games so yes
you're racing your own ghost though
right yeah yeah so like you could you
could go up against your like old time
from yesterday potentially yeah as like
another AR concept um so it is cool to
consider how you could potentially bring
a are into the real world in different
ways as opposed to like something like
Pokemon go yeah I'm just staring at your
phone screen like this way you're you're
actually like doing skin on you're not
tied to a device exactly playing it
which i think is kind of helpful the
device is kind of like it more in the
background then like the actual tool
that you're using maybe we talk a little
bit about where we're at with this whole
Apple debacle yeah yeah how much further
down the road we really need to travel
this trail before we see some kind of
resolution I it's to me what's what's
interesting is if if the FBI has the
tool that they need to open up whatever
iphones they need to open up or let's
say an android device what have you then
it's really not going to come to a head
the same way that it did last year I
mean this was definitely the Battle of
like two major players and it just
completely dissipated at some point you
know like the FBI got what they needed
they needed to get into the device apple
did what they needed to do which was to
say like look we're not going to create
a backdoor that's a skeleton key we
don't we don't want to what I have out
there that's way too dangerous but what
if what if Apple finds whatever bug or
whatever backdoor the FBI had discovered
then that this could potentially
resurface hmm so what you're saying is
no light at the end of the tunnel well
until our descent one official judge
like makes a call on it yeah the problem
that was the issue of this one we're
never officially went to court the
problem with a lot of these things too
is that
tied up with a lot of these very scary
incidents I mean this one in particular
was was a terrorist attack people died
another incident was a murder trial
where Amazon is involved where the
government was trying to get ya
recordings from an Amazon echo right so
it's it obviously puts the tech
companies in this precarious situation
where they're like fighting for privacy
but over over like murder trials
retirement rosso and that's that's
another hand Dora's box yeah it's not an
easy decision to defend and in both of
those cases that it wasn't there they
had no clear and present like warrant
for getting information off of that it
was just basically this is locked
information we want to see what's in
there especially if the Amazon echo case
totally it could have just completely
been a while in the warrant it was
basically saying you know that can pick
up hearing and we're hoping that you
know that might lead to something same
thing with the San Bernardino case dude
there wasn't exactly we know that it's
recorded on this we want to know what it
is it was maybe there's something there
which is not it would very shaky ground
if you're gonna take that can be I mean
I understand government officials and
you know investigators want to want to
turn over every stone and obviously but
it's it's interesting to see that at the
very least from a consumer perspective
that the effort that these tech
companies are taking a pretty hard
stance against this kind of stuff to say
like no we do not want to create these
back doors particularly after like all
the Edward Snowden stuff came out
totally they really do not like the idea
of presenting themselves as working too
closely with the government on these
things it's also why companies like
signal or basically you know bringing in
tools that that's basically even if we
even if we wanted to give you the
information we couldn't it's all
encrypted right not all says similar
stuff yeah which is which is interesting
and that definitely allows them to like
wipe their hands yeah situation calling
out to everyone in the chat how do you
feel about this do you think that there
is warrant and reason for federal
agencies to be able to obtain
information from your device's would you
volunteer it yourself do you feel that
that is a call that you as a consumer
should make or the company should be
able to entitle
just interested to see whether ins
perspective on this is I'd say if like
an agent came to me and was looking for
information I guess it man it's it's so
subjective it's really thorny like if I
was involved like if I was the somehow
victimized or someone I knew was
victimized I think I would obviously
volunteer that information but if it was
something that had nothing to do with me
personally I would struggle with that
the complication to is that you know if
somebody's gonna argue the case that
like you have nothing to hide like why
don't you just disclose information well
that's an incredibly slippery slope
exactly i heartily dogs and like once
you get once you go down there it's a
Pandora's box you cannot come back right
you're right you're basically I remember
listening to something NPR a couple days
ago that suggested that the way
technology is moving these days this
concept of privacy is something that
will have existed for several decades it
didn't exist in the past and it won't
exist in the future and like what we
consider privacy is is just is you know
an illusion that we're all under these
days I mean we gave up the console
arrived to see the minute we got
smartphones the minute you put a
tracking chip in your pocket sure yeah
ontario there are reasons for a number
of different things the amazon echo and
the google home is another really good
example of that where people very
comfortable with the idea of having a
live mic which granted is waiting for a
wake word but it's still alive mic in
your home people use nest cams all the
time which is which is you know very
much a camera like that's a Wi-Fi
connected camera you know like and
that's only as good as the software
behind it from you know getting hacked
and having people look inside your house
I mean like I'm not trying to like to
scare the hell out of people but you
know we're already there it says some of
these technologies it's the ultimate pro
con list right are these benefits and
advancements worth the risk mmm because
there is an inherent risk through all of
this right and talking to technology
companies if anything they're really
interested in getting more data about us
because they claim that that will allow
them to give you better products
understand you better give you what you
want faster more efficiently what have
you so it's I mean that balance is going
to continue well it's a similar fashion
with advertising and
cookies right when you're watching
online video it's like I don't mind ads
if the good ads sell me something good
if this thing can bring better aspects
to my life yeah let's fall back on the I
have nothing to hide kind of argument
but then I mean do they want to hear me
fighting with my girlfriend yes I'm the
echo or something like that right right
so my mind you it's unknowingly
providing fodder for a really good
reality show that's cat is really bright
that's some creepy that's the team's own
stuff right there yeah in the chat Jerry
says he would volunteer if it's going to
save lives but Danny says keep it locked
down period right there's a difference
between volunteering your information
though and having oh the the contract
you sign and title it to someone else
yeah right without your explicit
permission yeah absolutely yeah yeah
that you volunteering is you giving it
up and then other people like just being
able to look into your phone at any
point you know whatsoever without any
kind of discretion or warrant or
anything like that that's a little
different yeah yeah and and probably
some like people are probably a little
more comfortable with that idea the
problem with you know some of these
other aspects is a court is like forcing
the information to come out which I i
would think people are a little less or
a little more cautious about you know
because they're losing control I mean
ultimately should government agencies
police security type agencies have the
right to make that call it's he exactly
that a question yeah that's the question
and that's still very much still up in
the air yeah and like this this
situation with Apple and the FBI could
have easily gone to the Supreme Court
now that didn't devil's advocate do you
think and God forbid any more incidents
occur would that force the hand I don't
think it forced their hand but I think
it bring the issue back up again and
then now with a different president you
know that kind of chairs a whole new
perspective yeah absolutely whole new
perspective yeah yeah in chard tip
construe today as she mentioned that
during the campaign president Trump
while he was still a candidate argued
you know very strongly about the idea
that like who does Apple think they are
they should they should at least this
information that he came up with yeah he
called for a boycott so
totally but is it really about releasing
the information or is it about
protecting protecting the right of
choice for the company and its customers
well Apple was bringing up that it
wasn't it was more so about security
aspect of it where okay well even if we
did make this tool like there's like
it's probably gonna get stolen at some
point so exactly yeah right which is a
which they're creating the weapons of
mine yeah that's a very interesting it
wasn't we don't want to help you or we
don't want to give up information it was
yeah but think about how it'll affect
everyone else kind of thing yeah right
the thing the thing that is you get
Moshe to the castle yeah the thing
that's most intriguing about it is is
that behind the scenes there there is
that key that's available it just isn't
as publicly available you know like
there was that third party that showed
up what was it celebrate or what was the
company I don't remember it was either
way it was a cyber security firm that
showed up and was able to unlock the
iphone and that's what that's what kind
of cleared up the whole situation yeah I
mean it's obvious that it's not
impossible again right I notice these
are very good questions I don't know the
ads uncharacteristically heavy on the
show today yeah I mean the best really i
mean like to me this is fascinating
because i think both sides have very
legitimate argument absolutely you know
like there's no it doesn't get great
right answer there's no right answer and
had it actually gone to the supreme
court from just just from an observers
perspective I'd be fascinated to see
what their view of what's the balance
here like what's actually appropriate
man that's a tough one because you do
like I think there's an inherent
instinct to want to help right if
something horrible happen and you can
somehow provide an asset or information
to benefit that to solve it you want to
but it's like but then what happens when
they have they have that key to have
that weapon and they come back later and
they use it against you yeah because it
doesn't uh would happen that it could
happen and you can't on doing that the
best part when they unlocked the San
Bernardino shooters iPhone 5c was that
it had nothing on it they found nothing
there so I mean assuming that this whole
case had gone through and you know Apple
did lose like they would have all been
for you know
solutely nothing either well yes and no
it would have given the FBI a huge tool
for future scenario yeah really
basically like force the tech companies
to roll over and hand over their
information so do we have any more
comments by the way we should probably
get wrapped up soon uh props to death
omen in the chat who is currently
clearing their web browser history as we
speak uh let's break them all a second
we gotta go we gotta do end on a light
note jason wants to know if anyone here
would buy the Nintendo Switched
completely off topic would you buy the
new he's gotta switch expert Riley's
convinced after seeing it in person to
be honest I think it was the size that
like really got to me when I realized
it's about like the same size as your 2d
s that's my two days at least which I
carry around a lot it was basically oh
it's actually a lot more portable than I
think it is and they made a good point
so when they designed the battery life
of it the idea was basically the biggest
concern was can you play during your
commute to work right so right now it
had a lot of criticisms for being only
like three to five hours of battery life
but that's you know people looking at at
the from the perspective Nintendo's
previous handhelds with Chad you know
pretty good battery life on it but also
they were looking at it from the
perspective of it being a home console
which you know is it's just plugged in
all the time what can it can only be
charged from its own dockers at us bc
its USBC so you can cut charge it at
your desk at work and take it but about
so when they when they were developing
the battery life for it was basically
can I get this from my home to the
office and back you know and have it
last the whole day that was their
threshold for like what the battery life
is and I don't know I see myself playing
on on the subway coming in you know when
i'm supposed to be working during this
podcast yeah so you're dropping coin on
this i'm waiting basically i'm waiting
for like some kind of bundle because
three hundred dollars for just that
console is still a little bit like wonky
to me yeah i would wait until at least
seven more games to yeah basically well
do you see this is something that's
gonna like really help reinvigorate
Nintendo I mean like they've been losing
in the console game you can oh yeah not
you can only get so far with a console I
think they're gonna need the games to
back it up which they've always had the
games to back it up arguably yeah I
don't know if we have enough time on the
back I said I mean at least the the
franchise mainstays the the Super Mario
galaxy's yeah
the legends of Zelda is varying back and
forth never really completely falling
off it definitely will be interesting to
see like how that plays out like for
their mobile strategy because legend of
zelda mario galaxy you know sunshine all
those games those are not games that you
play like on a commute like you'd have
to be no you're safe at all the times or
something like that because like I can't
like there's certain games that I don't
play on the subway because I know like
I'm gonna miss my stop or something like
that if I like and I can't like just
like shut it off or anything like that
i'm currently frustratingly plowing back
through sonic CD on my commute and it is
infuriating yeah exactly that's the so
it'll be interesting to see those games
layup but for other they do have other
kinds of games you know where it's just
you know play and then you need to shut
it off and then you know keep playing it
again later on like Bomberman 5 being
one of that yep yeah I'm very excited
for that one by the way I don't know if
it's five it's our it's Yeah Yeah right
I've been playing bomberman 5 that's why
I've been I don't game I haven't been no
I have a I have a ps4 and I have the you
know xbox 360 which I had been playing a
little bit so I've been I just finished
DMC but I haven't been playing Nintendo
that much no I haven't thought like
consistently played Nintendo a hundred
of time I'm not in the market for this
way the last night I don't have a
gamecube I'm yeah in the gamecube was
phenomenal you know what I love that
system you know what pull me in if they
had an augmented reality peripheral and
you could play metroid first person that
would be pretty oh that's coming that
was your eyes and wait you'll never see
me again ever alright cool i'll be about
time to wrap it up yeah good show guys
all right the 359 podcast is available
on itunes to an insta Shore soundcloud
feedburner google play music and i think
