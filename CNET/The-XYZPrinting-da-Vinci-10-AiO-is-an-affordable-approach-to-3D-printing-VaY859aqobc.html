da vinci 1.0 all-in-one 3d printer from
XYZ printing now this one here can do a
lot more than just printing 3d objects
for example take a look at this lovely
skull here or maybe it's not too lovely
but let's just make a copy of it anyway
that's right the machine here can also
scan a 3d object into 3d model file so
you can make the replica of the object
now note these laser scanners here and
this turbo platform as the platform
turns around the laser scanned the
object and after a few minutes
voila we have ourselves the 3d model of
the skull now the next step is to print
this modify into a new object this part
took a very long time so I'm going to
stand here pointing and staring there
you go I haven't even blinked and now we
have a freshly printed skull take a look
at this it looks almost identical to the
original and by identical I mean not the
color because the color of the print
here depends on the color of the
filament now this one here is a single
extruder printer meaning it can only
bring object in just one color now
filaments is the Prima Tyrael for 3d
printing they are basically plastic
string that the printhead pulls in melts
and then extrude on the print platform
to form the 3d object now overall the
machine here worked really well as a 3d
scanner and a 3d printer and it's also
very easy to use you can use it wrap the
box without having to even calibrate it
because it is pre calibrated it also
very easy to install the filament on
this printer because instead of using
open spool like this one you actually
use cartridge basically the filament is
locked on the inside and you can install
it cut right here the way you do toners
for laser printer now in return though
this mean you have to buy the film and
from XYZ printing and it's quite
expensive this cut should hear how about
one point three pounds of
filaments and it cost $28 however even
with this approach to filaments the
protocol is still a great deal because
it costs just $800 in u.s. or second 50
pounds in the UK
now remember other printer costs some
$2,000
even without the scanning function for
more this machine hey check out my full
review at cnet.com by the way try to
scan my thumb but it didn't work nothing
wrong with machine turnout I'm so unique
one-of-a-kind fascinating that none of
this can be replicated where I guess
it's because I'm dumb oh and this has
been the first look at the da vinci 1.0
all-in-one 3d printer from XYZ printing
