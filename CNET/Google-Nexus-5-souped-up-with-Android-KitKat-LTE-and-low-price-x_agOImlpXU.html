affordable Google's flagship phone of
the season is finally here hello
everybody I'm Lynn LA from CNN and today
we're gonna check out the unlocked Nexus
5 at four point nine five inches the
five has the biggest screen of all past
Nexus handsets the display features 445
pixels per inch and like the Samsung
Galaxy s4 and HTC One it has a 1920 by
1080 pixel resolution images and videos
are bright and vivid and look razor
sharp now even though the display is
bigger the device is still comfortable
to hold and pocketable in fact it's
actually thinner and lighter than the
previous Nexus 4 the phone comes in two
colors black and white and features the
smooth matte soft touch coating I
personally prefer this over last year's
design since that models glass back
panel fractured quite easily inside the
Sansa is a powerful 2.2 6 gigahertz
Snapdragon 800 processor from Qualcomm
this is the same blazingly fast CPU
featured in the LG g2 with this
processor the Nexus 5 is a piece of a
handset especially when you consider
that both the GS 4 and the HTC One are
speed demons themselves and run
Snapdragon 600 processor 's the v also
has a non-removable
2.3 ampere hour battery which yields a
reported talktime of up to 17 hours with
data turned on now one issue the
previous Nexus 4 had was that it didn't
feature LTE support this wasn't quite a
big deal in other countries but for US
consumers LTE is more widespread when it
comes to highly anticipated top-tier
phones at least LTE is a standard so the
lack of it was a letdown with the Nexus
5 however it's great to see that it does
support LTE bands it will work on 18 t
t-mobile and Sprint networks but
unfortunately Verizon users are left out
from the nexus party as a Google branded
device the handset will get OS updates
as they roll in and not surprisingly it
runs the latest mobile OS Android 4.4
KitKat Kit Kat comes with a number of
new features you can move entire home
screens now
and there's a deeper more seamless
integration with Google Voice Search
okay Google what's today's weather you
can also search and directly call from
the dialer businesses or companies not
in your contact list Google also brings
new features to the handsets cameras
which by the way included 8 and 1.3
megapixel shooter for instance it has
optical image stabilization which cuts
down motion blur that may result from an
unsteady hand and there's hdr+ which
fuses together several exposures and
shots to make one ideal picture
additional features include two gigs of
RAM wireless charging and NFC despite
having all these components though the
Nexus 5 is still very affordable the 16
and 32 gig models cost 349 and $399
respectively for an unlocked phone of
this calibre that's an incredibly
competitive price point not only would
Andrew purists find this attractive but
just anyone looking for a solid handset
as well again I'm Lin and you've been
checking out the Nexus 5 from Google</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
