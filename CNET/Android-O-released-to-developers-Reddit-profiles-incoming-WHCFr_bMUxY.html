that matter right now Google's newest
mobile operating system Android Oh has
been released to developers we're
discovering a few of its main features
first and foremost it's taking aim at
improving battery life the new system
will also add new kinds of notifications
and dynamic icons but a lot of what's
new probably won't be revealed until
Google i/o conference this mag reddit
has started to roll out profile pages to
a small number of users the idea is to
make the site a bit more accessible and
perhaps less anonymous to the rest of
the Internet even though it continues to
be one of the most traffic sites online
users will be able to follow others via
a profile at which point stories would
appear in a user's from page profiles
will roll out to all users very soon and
finally twitter says it's continuing to
crack down on extremist accounts
suspending 377,000 users in just the
last six months of 2016 these users were
removed for quote violations related to
a promotion of terrorism interestingly
enough nearly seventy-five percent of
the accounts suspended were found by
internal software within the company
you can say if to date with the latest
by downloading the cnet tech today app
in the Apple or Google Play Store</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
