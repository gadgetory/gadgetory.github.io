college students
maybe you're heading to university or
maybe someone you know is beyond shower
shoes what else should you buy before
heading back to school well that's what
we're here for
at number five is the Ultimate Ears
megablast it's always good to have a
portable Bluetooth speaker the UE
megablast boasts great sounding audio
it also has Amazon's voice assistant
built-in if you connect on megablast
using Wi-Fi maybe you want to drag this
to the beach or the shower the UE mega
blast is fully waterproof it can be
immersed in liquid up to one meter for
up to thirty minutes now we're at number
four the Roku streaming stick plus
sometimes you might want to watch
something like Netflix on a bigger
screen than a laptop or a phone the Roku
streaming stick costs a ridiculously
cheap 54 dollars and you get tons of
streaming app options 4k and HDR video
output and even though it's really
inexpensive the stick plus is really
responsive
it also offers private listening if you
use the Roku mobile app that means you
can connect a pair of headphones to your
phone while running the Roku app you'll
be able to hear what's playing on your
Roku without disturbing others now it's
time for number three the Nintendo
switch the switch is hard to beat
because you can play games on a
television or decide to take your games
with you wherever you go since it's both
a console and a portable you won't find
Super Mario Odyssey Kirby star allies or
the upcoming Super Smash Brothers
ultimate on the playstation or xbox the
switch might not be as powerful when
compared to Sony and Microsoft's
consoles but Nintendo's hook has always
been great game play with excellent
first party titles the switch comes
through in those departments coming in
number two is the Jabra active elite 65
T yep these are truly wireless
headphones and they sound better than
Apple's air pods the active elite
65 T headphones can go for about five
hours before needing to be recharged its
caring case can give these Jabra
headphones another two charges the
active elite 65 t headphones are noise
isolating but the companion app can let
you turn on a feature called hear
through that will let sound leak in if
you need to be aware of
your surroundings oh did I mention these
are fully sweat resistant yep
and number one is the Lenovo yoga 9 20
you are going to spend a lot of time
with your computer during college so it
might as well be really good the yoga
920 runs Windows 10 so it can support
older legacy programs and you're not
locked down to the Windows Store for
apps right now it starts around a
thousand bucks
also since it's a yoga it can act like a
tablet and that tent mode is pretty
helpful for trips if you decide to visit
the folks now just be aware that if you
were interested in max we're holding off
on math books for now since there are
rumored updates coming dick thanks to
Don Falcone for his help if you're
wondering why there are no phones on
this list it's a really weird time
there's a new note with a new iPhone and
pixel expected then there are rumors of
the S 10 showing up early in 2019 so for
right now we're gonna hold off on a
phone recommendation
what other tech do you think would be
great for students let us know I my as
actor no see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
