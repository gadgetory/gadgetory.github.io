unveiling of LG's new flagship
smartphone
we're just a few minutes away from the
unveiling please make your way to your
seats
ladies and gentlemen I am pleased to
introduce the president and CEO of LG
Electronics mobile communications mr.
Jin o ch√£o
good morning ladies and gentlemen
I'd like to thank you all for joining us
today I am so happy to introduce a truly
exciting product in this historical
place and the early days of mobile phone
era there are a variety of designs
available however fast forward a couple
of decades
no not that years with the introduction
of the smart phone now every phone
looked at same as if someone decided
there was a right way so at LG we began
to ask ourselves how can you give smart
phone a some character and originality
together with comfortable grip and
usability as a smart phones with
high-resolution displays and hyppolit
cameras they came on the market they
gave rise to a very unique generation of
the people the visual generation what
this generation value most is to share
their personal experiences exactly as
they say so this is where we felt we can
make a significant difference beyond a
simple joy of record life's memories
then there were other challenges there
are those who always challenging
something different from their
smartphones but at the same time there
are many many average consumers to them
smartphone is still very difficult
device to master so for us it's a really
challenge how could they provide a
unique
there was a simple to use for the
average consumers but yet still offers
something new for the expert uses the LG
g4 studied with this small but
meaningful goal in mind the purpose of
innovation should not be to just show
off new technologies it must be based on
understanding the user and consideration
of those who benefit from it this is the
philosophy behind the g4 and the
starting point in LG's long time
aspirations innovation for a better life
since taking charge of LG's mobile
operation five months ago I have been
extremely proud of what I have seen but
nothing gives me more pleasure than to
show all of you the result of our hard
work now the moment we've all been
waiting for
ladies and gentleman please say hello to
LG g4
even more than ever the user is the main
focus of the G for the question that was
repeated over and over during the
development process was what actual
value with this provide to consumers
without this foundation all we would
have be a hunk of metal in class
what matter most is how that design
delivers on convenience and accenture
the lifestyle of the users from the
beginning our aspiration was to convey a
personal ones as through design elements
there were based on analog sensibilities
around state-of-the-art digital
technologies we endeavor to create a
device that brought to mind a handmade
masterpiece exceeding elegance and
comfort you have my word this phone is
simply very comfortable to Caribbean use
and it is very steadily built now let's
talk about LG's camera and display
technologies which are second to none
village' for refer competent that we
didn't need the most megapixel or even
the most a higher resolution make a
substantial improvement we sought
innovation on an entirely different
level
the LG's laser can F 1.8 camera captures
a a seems like never before you see
around is a great in a landscape
anything you can capture that it's the
closest we ever come with to emulating
what we see with our naked eyes and
those images are rendered more vividly
and actually on the new IPS quantum
display
this combination of camera and display
technologies exist on more the
smartphone on the market and this is
what we exactly mean when we say that g4
offers a great visual experience our
learning from you belief is embodied in
user experience behind the g4 l g ux 4.0
a delivers a simpler and smarter
experience for all users whilst still a
leading to simply use we expanded the
options of the camera and calendar
options features to satisfy expert users
the human central us understand and
takes in consideration the unique needs
of every user to provide an exceptional
experience for all as we have a
announced within recruiting consumers
from all around the world for the three
for a consumer trial programs well they
will be able to experience the g4 before
it is even available for sale this
consumer experience program reflects a a
level of confidence we have in the g4
but frankly this is a bold move for us
there should be for any other companies
while our expectations for these are
high but we are nevertheless a humbled
by a groundswell of interest that we
have received throughout this a
communication period I hope all of you
will see and experience the g4 for
yourself today thank you very much
now we have a special guest who has
joined us today to help introduce the g4
ladies and gentleman please welcome dr.
Paul Jacobs executive chairman our
budgets long-term partner Qualcomm thank
you for
thanks for the introduction and good
morning everyone it's really an honor to
be here with you today at this LG g4
launch event because I'm really always
excited to work with LG LG and Qualcomm
have built this really close
relationship over the past 20 years and
our work together is founded on this
shared vision that we need to deliver
the best mobile experiences that are
fully optimized to add value to
consumers daily lives now the latest
realization of that vision is this LG g4
which features the Qualcomm Snapdragon
808 processor with x10 LTE now LG and
Qualcomm technologies we collaborated
really closely from the initial stage of
the Snapdragon 808 introduction to
expert we tuned the technologies and
make several of LG g4s unique features
possible the resulting g4 smartphone is
an ideal example about how the best
optimized technologies can come together
to meet consumers needs and with this
snapdragon powered LG g4 you're really
going to notice the difference in areas
like call quality and overall audio
quality and you're gonna also see an
immediate difference with the
lightning-fast x10 LTE modem has
download speeds of up to 450 megabits
per second if you think about it this is
really important in a world where the
smartphone is becoming our primary
device to stream and consume media and
with the LG g4 and Snapdragon 808
processor you're also going to have this
combination of an incredibly smooth user
experience an advanced feature set and
power efficiency that few smartphones
can match the internal testing we've
shown that this LG g4 gets more than a
full day on a single charge and in part
that's due to this really exceptional
integration with the Snapdragon 808
processor but there are other things
beyond performance and efficiency so
here's some other key features that the
Snapdragon 808
help us drive on the LG g4 so the LG g4
is capable of capturing 4k video that's
truly rich and stunning and that's based
on a combination of LG software and the
Snapdragon processor and the LG g4
boasts state-of-the-art graphics
capabilities which is enabled by the
audrina 400 series GPU so this Adreno
GPU it has 20% faster graphics
performance and its predecessor and it's
been designed specifically for this lg
g-force high quality quad HD display now
there's another thing the LG g4 is the
first to enable sensor assisted
positioning to support more accurate
location based experiences even when
you're indoors or near tall buildings
and it combines qualcomm technologies is
that technology with the location data
sensors that are already integrated into
the phone so you can more accurately
keep track of where you are even in
challenging environments like cities or
inside buildings and whether you're in a
car or you're on foot so the depth the
depth of our collaboration on the g4
it's really been unique in my experience
and this this phone delivers this
optimal mix of real-world performance
power efficiency functionality and
absolutely beautiful design to achieve
unprecedented new mobile experiences for
consumers so thanks everybody for being
here for your time and I want to say
personally congratulations to LG on the
launch of another industry-leading
smartphone in 2015 with the LG g4 so
thanks everybody
and now please welcome Frank Lee
director LG Electronics mobile
communications us
thank you ladies and gentlemen today I
have the privilege of being a part of
the team that's introducing a truly
great smartphone the LG g4 and the
privilege it is because this phone has
been the result of a long journey of
hard work and effort to fulfill our
brand's promise for innovation for a
better life LG g4 is full of innovations
and it will take me the entire day to go
through all of them but since we're
about making lives better
I'll just focus on the highlights the LG
g4 is built on three primary principles
that were just presented by mr. Cho
comfortable elegance a great visual
experience and of course a human centric
user experience you've already heard a
little bit about the g4 but now let's
take a deeper look at some of more and
ambitious capabilities of this smart
phone so let's begin with design the
concept of comfortable elegance as mr.
Cho said in the early days of the mobile
phone era we saw some exciting things
happening from the design from some form
factors and technology there were brown
groundbreaking but over time there was
some uniformity and it got kind of cold
and for some of us what's wrong with
that well you know they're thin they're
slim but you have to wonder whether
these designs truly cater to our needs
let's think about the angular design for
a moment they aren't very comfortable
and with all the glass on the back you
end up with a lot of fingerprints that
you have to constantly wipe off by the
LG were committed to innovation for a
better life so we look to design phones
with you in mind so we looked and how
could we create a different type of
experience that could deliver a better
smartphone our answer was to combine a
real sense of elegance and humanity into
the g4 something that everyone could
relate to we wanted to create a
smartphone that was more beautiful and
so fit the contour of your hand more
naturally the solution is the stunning
and ergonomic slim art design we didn't
just round off the edges the slim art
runs along the entire body of the g4
it's clearly there more for than just
looks the nature of the arc means that
the LG g4 has about 20% better
durability than a flat smartphone so it
stands up better to those accidental
drops many phones now have non removable
lower capacity batteries just to shave
off a few tenths of a millimeter so we
asked people what they cared about the
most and the vast majority of you said
that you would happily give up some
slimness for a decent battery and the
ability to swap it out if you needed to
so with LG we decide to give you a
high-capacity 3000 milliamp removal
battery
what's more the slim and attractive arc
which runs along the phone offers a
comfortable exceptional stable grip when
you hold it in one hand manufacturer
becomes more of a challenge when you
leave the world of flat phones but the
result as you will see is worth the
extra effort the LG g4 is natural fit
slim arc creates us feeling of beautiful
design while delivering more
practicality the g4 has a sense of grace
and beauty that you just can't get with
other phones once you hold it you
understand why the design element is so
important to us well as touch screens
have dominated the front of the phones
the back is where we felt that we could
differentiate in terms of design so we
sought out colors different finishes
different materials to really set the g4
apart and as an example the g4 will be
made of high-grade genuine leather it's
hard to imagine that we would take such
a challenge through a technology company
we spent 12 weeks alone inventing a new
method to present the leather in such a
way that it retained as
real leather feel that premium tanning
process not only preserves the feel but
also the overall leather characteristics
that you find in luxury hand goods LG
provides a smooth durable finish and
LG's property a proprietary treatment
sorry you can see and feel the
craftsmanship that went into the entire
process well we really got right down to
the intricate details even down to the
quality of the thread if compliments
rather than just stands out this is the
true passion ship at its finest the
natural patterns the grains and the
colors of the leather make each LG g4
unique because over time as you hold the
phone and put it to use the leather will
take on even more character making the
g4 even more personal and that's one
major thing that differentiates it
creates comfortable elegance but it's
not just about the leather we've also
selected other beautiful materials the
contoured ceramic back and the hammer
metallic finish have a sophisticated
diamond pattern that offers a refined
look as well as a comfortable grip so
the design of the LG g4 is
technologically there but also with a
human perspective to give you that
comfortable elegance again
genuine leatherr
an ergonomic design for the perfect
credit room now let's take a look at the
camera but let's hear from an expert
that's much more qualified than me on
this subject to talk about photography
hi my name is Colby Brown I'm a
landscape travel and humanitarian
photographer from Boulder Colorado and
I'm truly excited to give you your first
glimpse at the brand-new LG g4 camera
over the last few years a lot has
changed in the world of photography
using just their mobile phones people
are able to take decent images without
ever having learned the technical side
of the craft
however the truly powerful features such
as exceptional image quality for
typically only available and
professional-grade cameras but now
that's about to change
the new LG g4 offers you many of the
great advantages of a professional-grade
camera in the convenience of a mobile
phone with a fast F 1.8 lens and unique
color spectrum sensor the g4 allows you
to take great photos even in the basic
or normal modes however if you really
want to make the most of your images
then you want to work in the brand-new
manual mode which gives you the creative
freedom to customize your shutter speed
ISO and white balance settings
this takes mobile phone photography to
an unprecedented level of quality and
control essentially the LG g4 brings the
power of a professional camera into the
palm of your hand it's simply amazing
there's a whole new world out there just
waiting to be captured the LG g4 a great
visual experience
now Kobe just showed us some amazing new
features that are on the g4 camera so
let's take a closer look
critical to every great picture is focus
and it doesn't get much faster than our
laser technology in the g4 and if you
have laser autofocus then you better
have a camera that launches just as
quickly by incorporating both technology
in terms of hardware and software the LG
g4 has a noticeably faster speed when
launching a camera in just 0.6 seconds
well that's not all the g4 not only
launches the camera but in fact takes a
picture by just double-clicking on the
rear key we call this feature quick shot
while other smartphones can only launch
their camera by double clicking the home
button now to create a great camera we
need to we need to do more than just be
fast it has to be sophisticated as a
standard camera and just like the root
of the word photography implies light
plays an incredible when it comes to
photography to that end there are two
essential prerequisites first how much
light can the camera draw in then what
specs should you look forward to see if
the camera is actually capturing the
light simply put it's the f-stop and
that number should be as low as possible
and the image sensor should be as big as
possible the f-stop number tells you the
size of the aperture that is the opening
the eye of the lens to let how much like
a come tuned into the camera so the
smaller the f-stop number the more light
is able to pass through the lens and
reach the sensor to illustrate if you
look at the full aperture of 1.8 it
Lentz it lets in about 80% more light
than f-stop of 2.4 and that's found on
most average smartphones today after the
light passes through it lands on the
image sensor again a larger immersive
image sensor can have larger pixels so
capture more of the light more of the
information as I mentioned earlier a
lower f-stop number is meaningless
without a larger image sensor so we've
the g4s lens with a larger image sensor
as a result g4s camera captures more
light and also how it allows you to get
that better photo this is essentially
important in low-light situations like
indoors or at night so in order to
accomplish this the G spores Oh is
optical image stabilization 2.0 performs
twice as well as the previous version Oh
a s plus so we've extended the range of
stabilization from on the X and y axis
from one degree to two and for all you
golfers out there that makes a big
difference so it means that g4 offers
more stabilization than any other
smartphone on the market because we've
also added a z-axis so that also
compensates for movement and supports
the cameras ability to focus faster so
g4 has a aperture of 1.8 a 40% larger
image sensor and now a 3-axis oh is 2.0
that's an improvement over the past so
we're getting a lot of light into the
camera so we've got all the
photographer's and room excited but
let's see what this means for the rest
of us let's just see how it looks in
terms of photos which one looks better
needed to say
LG's g4 with the again the 1.8 you get
49% brighter images and they're
absolutely breathtaking okay how about
these can you see a difference
jeez four cameras awesome even under the
most challenging light situations thanks
again to the 11 percent brighter lens
that the 1.8 provides now once we got
enough light into the camera we have to
be able to process it better so anyone
know what this might be in the back some
of you might say it's a dual flash or
the infrared sensor but really it's a
color spectrum sensor not just merely a
IR sensor the color spectrum sensor in
plain English is a technology that
allows the camera to recognize both
light and objects it understands the
light around the subject that you're
trying to capture and it reads that
color exactly as you see it yourself
with your own eyes the LG g4 is the
world's first smartphone with this type
of sensor
it reads both RGB light and infrared
light when you combine that well let's
just look at the graph the infrared
shows you where recognizes an object but
the RGB that's where it actually sees
the color the actual frequencies coming
off an object so because it interprets
the objects in light the way our eyes do
we're gonna get better performance it
recognises the differences between RGB
and infrared light now I know going to
science here but what this does it
allows the camera on a g4 to
automatically adjust the flash color
temperature white balance so you get a
more natural and increased clarity and
overall a real life natural result so on
a cloudy or rainy day and thank God
there wasn't one today you're gonna have
this great view most cameras struggle
and this is where the color spectrum
center kicks in because it knows
precisely what colors are in the scene
so let's look at these images and
compare them the colors that the g4
captures are much more accurate to the
real subject you've got to check this
out and experience on after the
presentation I guarantee what we have
back there will provide you with a
really great visual experience
now as Kobe showed us earlier in camera
mode of the g4 you have both simple and
auto however there's no substitute as
you were saying for the human touch when
it comes to photography that's what
inspired us to include a manual mode in
the g4 it gives you a similar level of
control that you see on a professional
grey camera or the digital SLR that you
also have in the manual mode you can
save your photos in RAW format in
addition to JPEG by one simple touch you
can also control the white balance
and of course the ISO and the shutter
speed it's been said that the best
camera is the one that you have with you
at that time the g4 is now a legitimate
option when you don't have your digital
SLR now one cool trick that manual mode
is capable doing is you can catch those
those streaks of light those those light
trails by simply slowing down the
shutter speed whether it's 1 2 even 4
seconds or up to 15 or 30 none of the
major smartphones released this year
have this capability today now as I
mentioned briefly earlier one other very
important feature for some photographers
is being able to save it as a RAW format
this allows you to edit them look at the
histogram and do it on your laptop or
computer at home now using your USB
cable you can transfer your photos to
the computer or after that you can
transfer the phones wirelessly the
photos wirelessly via Wi-Fi or the cloud
now there's no need to worry about
storage capacity for your RAW files
since the g4 has a micro SD card SD slot
so take as many raw photos as you'd like
and feel free to expand your memory any
time so we want to give you lots of
choices and I'd say that gives us a
little bit of an edge over the
competition
now as all of you know you can take
selfies with the front camera so we
boosted the front camera on the g4 to 8
megapixels in addition to giving you an
8 megapixel front camera the gesture
shot has been improved it's more fun
it's more useful the new gestures are
allowing for great photos space 2
seconds apart it uses the same gesture
except you just do it twice even Colby
as you can see had a good time with it
crisp photos in low light with a
brighter f1 pointing lens so looking
closely at how technology develops it's
easy to see that camera and display
technologies obviously go hand in hand
so it's just important that display
technology developed in a similar
fashion with higher pixel density and
the gradual shift so that colors look as
close to the original as possible so we
look at these images these are actual
shots taken on the g4 by Colby they're
absolutely stunning with the g4 you can
actually capture images as you see them
so what do we do we created the new IPS
quantum display to more closely match
not only the theater quality of DCI
standards but in fact to deliver 20%
better reproduction when it comes to
color than conventional LCD panels the
evolution of display technology means
that there are less colors that we
cannot see and more in terms of the
range of colors that we can see
historically making the exceptional quad
HD LCD display on the g3 to meet these
new DCI standards was a challenge and
while the color gamut is impressive the
revolution is that the IPS display goes
even further all LCDs work by twisting
polarized liquid crystals going back to
science class they block or allow light
to travel through the pixels in the g4
we've gone with a new type of liquid
crystal instead what we've done is we've
charged the polarization on the vertical
top and the bottom what this allows us
to do is we can control the pixels with
even greater ability which allows for
more light to penetrate through and we
boost brightness by 25% furthermore a
photochemical treatment using UV light
allows us to create deeper blacks
sharper text and a 50% increase in
contrast ratio
the high-resolution quad HD improves
color reproduction increased brightness
and greater contrast this is coupled
with our embedded in tech touch
technology and of course a clearer more
vivid viewing experience when you're
outside with these tremendous
improvements it can only earn the name
IPS quantum display oh and just to
clarify the difference between IPS
quantum display and quantum dot display
you'll see both the display technology
looks similar but quantum display allows
you to give a thinner and slimmer bezel
well that's how long with LG's IPS
quantum display the picture quality is
so realistic you can almost taste the
strawberries I'm getting hungry this
isn't just the best display it's a real
step forward with all these great new
display technologies
you're probably wondering about the
power consumption but rest assured we
kept that in mind when we created the g4
the g4 utilizes a special graphic ram
that puts the CPU to sleep when
displaying a still frame so there's less
battery drain when there's no action
going on on your display and again as I
mentioned that knew else liquid crystal
technology where we increase the
displays brightness while we're able to
reduce the amount of battery that's
being used
if that wasn't enough there's also a
more subtle approach that we're taking
when it comes to battery life
LG sends you notifications through smart
notice and it'll let you know if there
are certain apps renegade row gaps that
are still drawing power when you have
the phone display off that notification
allows you to manage them so these three
factors contribute to 11% lower power
consumption and with its large 3,000
removable battery the LG g4 is the ideal
smartphone for everyday use with the
best display quality with real user
benefits with its advanced camera and
improved IPS quantum display the LG g4
will truly deliver a great visual
experience
the IPS quantum display for vibrant
colors
now let's talk about the last but
definitely not the least great new
pillar for the LG g4 it's the user
experience as you've already heard about
the LG's UX 4.0 we designed it with you
in mind debuting on the LG g4 it's
simple to use and you have to expect
that but it also allows you to customize
as a great example in the gallery view
we have a new memories feature memories
organize your photos and videos into
vent albums based on the time and place
they were taken without having to upload
your photos or videos to the cloud it's
simple and convenient within the gallery
you now have a timeline so g4 users can
easily sort through photos based on the
day the month and year they were taken
and now scrolling up and down is
extremely fast even if you have a big
photo album like I do now next smart
bulletin gathers notifications from
multiple apps onto the same page so you
don't have to look for different apps
and that goes through the hassle of
wasting and swiping from screen to
screen and the UX that expands a wider
range of choices based on your user's
preference the event pocket gathers
everything in your busy schedule from
multiple sources images texts memos and
tasks and you can simply add them to a
date by simply dragging them to the
calendar we introduced smart notice with
g3 and since then this feature has
improved now it's notifications and
alerts are even more useful and personal
and clearly today is not a reflection of
the weather
quick help does exactly what the name
implies it gives you simple answers to
any questions as you use a G for all you
need to do is click on the question mark
icon ask your questions and they'll
begin to instantly search for your
answers along with our other great
features we've worked closely with
different partners to make the g4 user
experience more enriched of course our
relationship with Google in addition to
the 15 gigs we all get for free on
Google Drive Google is going to give
them a way to every g4 owner an
additional 100 gigabytes for two years
in addition now g4 owners can use their
existing Google ID to register your g4
and log into their LG accounts as well
so this works straight out of the box
even if you reset your phone Google Docs
sheets slides they're also pre-installed
so g4 users can get the convenience of
securely securely collaborating with
friends and family even without a tablet
or laptop so we're constantly seeking
out collaborations like this to create a
better all-around smartphone ecosystem
now LGG for owners who are also
Volkswagen drivers will be able to take
advantage of mirror link to activate a
simplified safe driving interface on the
touchscreens of their cars we're working
very close with Volkswagen and we're
gonna roll it out to our next update and
they'll be available in select markets
so up to now we focus on developing
features that provide a better
experience across the board with LGG for
all your unique needs are taken to
consideration to create a great
experience that you can see and view
when we made our new smartphone we put
you at the center of the g4 experience
we didn't just chase technology for
technology's sake we kept true to our
promise for innovation for a better life
this world is one great experience your
smartphone should enhance it it
shouldn't interrupt it and life's good
and the LG mobile we want to make sure
that we are helping making it great
an impressive viewing experience is
important
but what's more important is what it
inspires
beauty in itself is in what matters
what matters is that it makes you feel
beautiful
pursuit of a high level of technology is
meaningful
but even more meaningful as technology
respecting your lifestyle
innovation
of the center of the special experience
see the great feel the great LG g4 now
it's your chance to go and try out the
LG g4 for yourself behind you is an
