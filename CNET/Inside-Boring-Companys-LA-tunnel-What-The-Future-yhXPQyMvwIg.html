show autonomous shape-shifting robots
Halloween's best dressed robot and a
near seizure-inducing look inside one of
Elon Musk's flagship projects give this
little robot a job to do it'll figure
out a way to get it done even if it
requires a little shape-shifting
engineers at Cornell University designed
it to observe its surroundings and adapt
its shape to accomplish the task at hand
so watch this here they told the robot
to retrieve that pink object on your
screen now the robot recognizes it's too
wide so watch what it does
like a glove okay let's take it up a
notch here the robots playing mailman
it's got to deliver a package at the top
of those stairs so that worked but we
should tell you that one delivery took
24 tries still better than on track
those cubes attach magnetically and
cameras collect data about the robot
surroundings it chooses its shape from a
library of 57 possible configurations so
this type of technology could be
incredibly useful in disaster situations
when robots could be used to rescue
people trapped after an earthquake or
during a hurricane cleanup this bot did
some shape-shifting of its own for
Halloween this is Oregon State
University's robot named Cassie now they
built Cassie an ATS T costume for
Halloween if you're not familiar ATS TSR
transports used by imperial troops in
the Star Wars but they didn't stop at
the costume they went the extra parsec
and shot a video of Cassie blasting
lasers in a forest which may or may not
be Endor now according to OSU's YouTube
channel
no Ewoks were harmed in the making of
this video here's the best glimpse we've
gotten so far into Elon Musk's vision
for high-speed travel he tweeted this
30-second time-lapse video
it's a walkthrough of the tunnel his
boring company is digging under la he
didn't say how long it is right now he
just said he walked the full length and
called it disturbingly long the plan is
to make it to miles the idea here is
passengers would be transported on
skates in groups up to 16 at speeds of
up to 155 miles per hour definitely
faster than sitting in LA traffic though
that's a pretty low bar musk said the
project is still on track to open
December 10th with test rides starting
the next day okay time to take a
question from you guys Sean John asked
us a while back if the Bourne company
project is safe enough for an earthquake
now surprisingly enough engineers agree
that tunnels are actually one of the
safest places to be during an earthquake
that's because underground structures
move with the soil they don't sway back
and forth
like buildings do okay what makes you
say WTF let us know in the comments
that's gonna do it for this show
I'm Andy Altmann thanks for watching
what the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
