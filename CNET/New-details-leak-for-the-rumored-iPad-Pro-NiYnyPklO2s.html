to the apple byte for all the good of
bad inside the world of Apple and
remember what I told you all the
Warriors yeah these Warriors check it
out huh like that would take the NBA
Finals in six and be your world
champions and you know what they don't
call me no shirt on us for nothing did
someone say future it's me yes me is
nastradamus your future floating friend
all right i'll spare you non NBA fans
from any more basketball talk but on to
the show and the gadget i still can't
wait for the ipad pro developers have
been digging into the iOS 9 code for the
past two weeks as Steve trow Smith has
found that the rumored iPad pro will
feature a 27 32 x 2048 screen resolution
with a 12 point nine inch screen giving
you 263 pixels per inch now all that
additional real estate will almost let
you run to current fullscreen ipad apps
side by side also images of the leaked
keyboard from iOS 9 shows its ability to
readjust itself at higher resolutions
allowing for a tab and dedicated caps
lock key on the left side and a new row
of symbols on top now check out your
iPad or keyboard right now it doesn't
have that it's just another sign
pointing to the inevitable new iPad then
there's developer Adam Bell he's also
played around with iOS 9 in hacked it to
enable the picture and picture feature
to work not only on just video but on
any app that can be minimized and
displayed on top of other apps his demo
uses the game Doom but maybe we'll see
it used with more apps other than
Apple's intention to make it just for
video I'll write in a small iphone
update KGI Securities analyst ming-chi
kuo reports that the next iPhone will
use the same 7000 series aluminum used
in the Apple watch sport the next-gen
iphone could be slightly wider and
taller by just point 15 millimeters to
account for the stronger aluminum design
now Kuo also reports the iphone 6s what
it's rumored to be called will be
slightly thicker by point 2 millimeters
to accommodate the force touch screen
and also the next iPhone is X
acta to come in a rose gold color like
the current apple watch edition all
right on to apples music service and the
big a confirms they will share 71.5
percent of revenues with music owners in
the united states that's really more of
the standard rate but they won't pay
music owners anything for the songs that
are streamed during the initial three
month trial period but see that could be
an issue for labels after UK music says
independent ones may not agree to apples
terms really a three-month chunk with no
royalties is a big deal and it could
mean artists like Adele or arctic
monkeys would not be part of their
3-month trial plan and in some news that
might make you throw up in your mouth
just a little bit a team of researchers
from several US universities and Peking
University exposed a series of security
vulnerabilities that allow malicious
apps approved on the App Store to gain
unauthorized access to sensitive data
stored in other apps like your iCloud
passwords and authentication tokens and
Google Chrome saved web passwords and
more now the biggest issue to me here is
they told Apple in October of 2014 about
the flaws and complied with Apple's
request to not publish anything in the
next six months but Apple never got back
to them see the flaws still exist but
come on Apple patch this up as in now
and for that you all know what it is
you're getting a bad apple and also if
you're at a local apple store you'll be
able to finally buy an Apple watch in
store sometime this week but you might
be even luckier because Apple is also
giving you and only you a surprise
collectible bag
all right let's get to this week's
giveaway and something way better for my
friends at mophie for those of you that
own an Apple watch check this out it's a
stand called the watchdog and it's my
favorite of the bunch because of its
classy design and aluminum and let their
construction so how do you win this all
you have to do is tell me the two
biggest things I liked about iOS 9 from
WWDC and last week's show plus your
favorite type of sandwich and i will
