European sports car traditional your
decision has been pretty easy you go in
the Audi the BMW or the Mercedes in 2016
though things get a little bit more
complicated Alfa Romeo is entering the
game with this car is called the Giulia
it's absolutely beautiful and yes is
coming to the US the Julie is aimed
squarely at cause like BMWs and three
particularly in this the Quadrifoglio
trim which is easier to look at than to
say that also explains the four leaf
clover sitting there in the fender this
high-performance model has a 505
horsepower twin-turbo v6 sitting in
front under the hood but thanks to a
variety of weight savings measures
actually offers a perfect 50:50 weight
distribution which should make it
amazingly balanced through the terms a
lot of aluminum and carbon fiber were
used in the construction of the car most
evident being these carbon Aero bits
including a front spoiler that can
actually adjust its speed to give you
more downforce carbon ceramic brakes
will make sure you can stop quickly and
when you're accelerating if you can get
from 0 to 60 in just 3.8 seconds but of
course the real story is the design it's
a more sultry shape than the BMW m3 or
Audi s4 or the like something that tugs
at your heartstrings it's absolutely
beautiful again yes this car will be
coming to the US as a 2016 model but the
big question is cost and that's one
alpha hasn't answered yet but with
European pricing starting at 72 thousand
euros 90 thousand for the performance
model it surely won't be difficult to
option one of these well into six
figures small price to pay for looks
like these</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
