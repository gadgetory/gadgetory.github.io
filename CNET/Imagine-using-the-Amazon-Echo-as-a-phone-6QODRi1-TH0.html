calls to their connected speakers that's
according to a report in the Wall Street
Journal saying the tech giant's are
working on the feature for echo and home
Google's got a bit more experience than
Amazon with voice calls because of
services like Google Voice and project
fire echo users can already send text
messages using the send message skill if
they are AT&amp;amp;T subscribers so what could
making a phone call on a home or echo
sound like this is totally simulated by
the way Alexa call the pizza shop
calling a pizza shop hi pizza shop how
can I help you hey I'd like to order
three extra large pepperoni pizzas
double the cheese and three times the
meat both the home and the echo keep
voice recordings on file four things you
asked and it is important to note that
you can delete them the Wall Street
Journal reports cited a source saying
Amazon wouldn't record conversations but
it would keep the length of calls and
numbers dialed just like most cell
phones do because if they did record
imagine what could happen Alexa what's
on my to-do list you ordered those large
meat monster pizzas maybe you should go
to the gym and we don't know what it
would sound like for the caller on the
other end if you've ever listened back
to the voice recordings you'll know that
they aren't exactly high fidelity
the report says voice calling features
could arrive as soon as this year but
privacy telecom regulations and
emergency service access are all some of
the current holdups so don't cut your
landline just yet for more tech news
