won't entirely outraged the Sierra Club
let's drive the 2012 kia sorento IX and
check the tech the sorento is in keeping
with Kia's ethic more on the handsome
side of the Hyundai Kia duo a fairly
crisply folded crossover with a third
row of seats they take up the cargo area
though so you'll face choices like
passengers or luggage
not and inside I find key is to be
affordably handsome sort of like a suit
from the gap you'll want the premium
Plus package though to get 10-speaker
infinity sound and built-in navigation
but if you go that way you can't get the
UVO system which is their advanced voice
control for entertainment and such
Bluetooth hands-free will be there in
any case of course we would opt for that
premium Plus package for the better
audio and navigation and skip UVO at
this point but that's not a choice you
should have to make media sources will
be am/fm CD USB plus iPod bluetooth
streaming and an aux jack
our e^x is a mid-level vehicle and it
has not to be six or the old
four-cylinder but a brand new more
modern direct injection for that is 2.4
liters cranks out a hundred and
ninety-one horsepower and a hundred and
eighty one foot pounds of torque both
those numbers improved over the last
four it'll get this vehicle to sixty in
a little over eight seconds while
delivering 22 32 mpg and both those
numbers are up to from the previous
engine power goes out through a
six-speed automatic in all cases to
either the front wheels or optionally
all for the handling is good the ride is
firm that's sort of a Kia trait anyway
they generally tune that direction
compared to equivalent Hyundai's a
Sorento X starts at 27 grand adds 1700
for all-wheel drive the big one is the
Premium Plus package its $3,200 and
there's really nothing else on the
option list you have to think about to
roll scene that style</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
