is your car poisoning you KO de teases a
car that's greener than the Prius and
Ferrari just wants to go faster this is
car tech live for februari third 2012 I
am Wayne Cunningham in the studio with
antuan goodwin and emma chang at the
board Brian Cooley is not with us today
got better things to do I guess then
talk about cars but what better thing is
there to do than talk about cars drive
cars drive cars that's true crash cars
backflips and cars the things in the
backseat of course well yeah okay it's a
long list it is a long very long list
yeah so what's this about toxic cars
like that toxic cars yes there's been a
new report just released by the does it
healthy stuff torger I guess that's the
site where it came out on and it let's
see they documented actually it's the
the ecology center they documented all
the the toxic materials in cars you know
you know cars out gasps mm-hmm that and
I guess that's what they're slightly
what they're dealing with here is the
amount of bad stuff in your car and so
that you know there's one chart here
where they're actually looking at well
first off let's talk about which cars
scored the worst the mitsubishi
outlander sport actually did apparently
has the worst materials in its cabin and
they're talking about things like the
front seat has bromine lead antimony and
mercury and they rated in parts per
parts per million parts per something it
might be parts per million ya ghous
missing parts per million ppm armrests
has fairly similar quantities of those
materials and all the new mercury and
armrests strangely enough shift knob as
chromium steering wheel has chromium all
that stuff I I guess can be bad for you
so I mean is it is this just like being
emitted like you leave your car parked
in the Sun is like the dashboard like
silently like emitting this in a
chemical reaction or are they just
saying don't eat it
I think this stuff slowly emits overtime
anything everything you know they
mentioned you know the all the yep I
mean some of the stuff goes for like the
fire retardant materials and things like
that they mentioned a polyvinyl chloride
PVC brominated flame retardants those
are all in there and those are all you
know they're kind of supposed to stay in
the the seats and the plastics and all
that but in the materials but you know
you can't keep that stuff down and it'll
slowly sort of I mean you're sitting
amongst it all right so there will be
outgassing or off gassing I guess they
call it and you will breathe in some of
that stuff I mean they mentioned that
the new car smell and what I've
generally heard is that you know if you
can smell it it's in your system right
well that's like always the thing they
tell you about like when you go into the
restroom and it stinks this is just like
well there's particulate matter in there
I always like to tell people that when
they're eating too gross them out like
oh yeah there's that particulate matter
which means that it's all over you at
this point oh but yeah I mean so I'm
trying to figure out word in it how much
of this does it take for it to really be
dangerous or is this just you know it is
the most dangerous car still
statistically insignificant is what I'm
trying to figure out right now that is a
good question that's what they don't
really cover here you know I don't think
if you jump and I've driven the
mitsubishi outlander sport and i'm alive
yeah a week in it maybe you know shaved
off a second or two of your life sharing
what i live who wants to live forever I
guess the car that scored the best
though the least toxic materials inside
was the honda civic hmm and you've
driven a lot of Honda Civics this year
so yeah I think I've done every honda
civic they make but it's a good thing
that they're low in that because I don't
really want to really want to have an
issue but I guess what am I looking up
here like for example the federal
government allows six hundred parts per
million of lead and household paint so
that's what the government considers to
be safe we're looking at the front seat
of this Outlander it's at four hundred
and fifty four parts per million so it's
not if actually less dangerous than
leaning against the wall sitting in this
seat right and I think all of these
things will come
and under you know under federal
regulations I mean that's why we have
federal regulations on these types of
materials so these are all considered
safe by the government I mean there's no
car not even the Mitsubishi bitsy
outlander sport which has the you know
the most amount of toxic materials is
over the the federal limit mm-hmm so you
know so it could be perfectly safe or
anyway the chart that we have here sort
of covers things I guess that's like a
one through five scale to go from or
actually it's less than that they go
from point 46 which is the honda civic
all the way up to the three-point 17
which is the mitsubishi outlander sport
chrysler the chrysler 200 came in even
with the mitsubishi outlander sport hmm
the prius is the second least toxic at
least the 2011 prius Pacific is greener
than the previous apparently yeah your
help by what is that some some amount
some very small amount point five five
versus point for six right yeah you're
getting an a minuscule stuff there other
notable cars on here we have the avail
the chevy aveo five 2.89 that's that's a
totally different generation than our
yeah ours is probably like five a nice
even 540 doesn't seven it's a 20 oz I've
actually just been rubbing lid also the
inside of it gives it a nice sheen on
the dashboard uh yeah I don't have some
interesting sort of thing going on here
I I'm not really alarmist and I kinda
also kind of have a mine state of pretty
much everything we touch is gonna give
you cancer so I don't really I don't
want mopping up at like freak out about
that interesting to the audi s5 2012
audi s5 only a point 74 hmm another what
is it like under one as what I'm seeing
here is under one means that you're good
to go yeah and above what it means that
you need to think about uh your health I
don't know I guess don't if I guess
bottom line is if you're pregnant don't
buy mitsubishi outlander sport yeah
maybe you know putting an infant in one
of these cars yeah I don't know if
that'd be really
again yeah take this with some what of
it you can get alarmist about it but I
don't think it's too much be concerned
about I'm scared to come around and I'm
feeling a little panicky about this
watch out those cars you have before we
get any new car and we'll have to look
this up on the chart see where it stands
and see if we can actually minimize our
time inside it I can see now where it's
like a car comes in wings gonna look it
up on the char and he's gonna go like I
want to take the finish one yeah oh yeah
I know it's a much faster a nicer car
than the what the other one but it's
instant death all right i'll take the
crv you take the Bentley ok again worth
worth a brief shortening of life span
that's how I think giving it right
around and event late all week yeah
toyota is actually bringing a new small
hybrid to the geneva auto show and
that's actually in a couple weeks we're
going to be there so we'll see it live
then right now they've only really stole
a little bit of teasing on it there
there's a sketch and you got some more
information about that than you and
alright so they first they came out with
this sort of overblown sketch so you
don't really see a lot of details you
vaguely tell that it has two wheels and
then it's got like a really streamlined
profile this is their f TBH that stands
for future toyota which is all of their
concepts have that prefix the b b
segment and h of course hybrid so this
is a vehicle that's going to be about
the size of a yaris may their they're
saying actually that it's going to be a
little bit bigger the next day actually
we got a closer look at some some really
up close teaser pictures of like the
headlights and the squiggly LED tail
light sort of thing in a hybrid badge
but they're saying that it's it's going
to be less that it's going to weigh less
than the Toyota AYGO which is actually
even too small for our market it's going
to be under 1,700 pounds so that's
actually lighter than a first gen mazda
miata by about 400 pounds so super light
it's about the same size as a yaris like
i said with more space on the inside and
they're saying that it's more
aerodynamically slick than the upcoming
a scion fr-s or the if they fit the gt86
because it comes from the
the toyota UK design or at least they're
there they're the press release came
from the toyota UK but the most
interesting thing about this is that
they're saying that they're building
this concept using a commonplace
economically viable like materials and
techniques so it's not like they're you
know doing some crazy you know like I
guess the it probably won't be built
using the same sort of fusing metal 222
composites that they were using in the
LFA ittle bit it's designed to be able
to build beep actually built cheaply hmm
so I think this is interesting because
it is it it's a goofy-looking concept
I'm sure it's going to be but it's
interesting because it kind of also
because they're they're trying to figure
out ways to make economically viable to
produce its we're going to see that
trickle down into the next generation of
toyota vehicles we're think we're going
to start seeing their their their our
next generations of hybrids and even
their next generation of regular
internal combustion vehicles just
getting lighter overall and it seems
like that's the easiest way to to make a
car more efficient right so this is
strictly a concept and it will be will
be concept when we see it because i was
interested that you mentioned it's a
b-segment car and that's about the same
size as the toyota prius c which is
coming out soon right so yeah it would
seem to be a strange and like a
competitor to that but if its concept
then it's just more the maybe the future
direction of the prius c right i mean
you think about it like how we saw the
what is the fth something which ever
would the the FG concept that ended up
becoming the LFA came out like seven
years ago oh yeah so it's i think that
it's kind of more of a i think what
they're trying to showcase is the
lightweight construction and it's
basically you know a really neat sort of
way to get people looking at it but then
also to kind of Hammer in that PR
message of going like we're trying to
figure out how to make things light and
cheap i guess it kind of goes along with
you know they're investing money into
developing cheaper carbon fiber and
waste
build carbon fiber some of the auto
autumn other automakers are doing that
but so I guess until the cost of carbon
fiber comes down to a point that you can
put it on like an economy car I think
they're I think they're probably just
going to start using plastics for a lot
more thing plastics yeah so they said
hybrid but they didn't specify anything
about the powertrain it makes it
downsized full hybrid car train so it'll
yeah probably be the one that's in the
prius c right well the Yaris hybrid on
1.4 1.6 with you know the standard
toyota electric synergy system connected
to it may be going to i mean they
haven't kind of lithium-ion batteries
yet not for their standard system so i
mean this if they're trying to keep
weight down that'd be a good way to go
that's true that is true and that it
seems to be the trend among automakers
in trying to get more efficient cars
like this is decreasing the weight and
there's so much to be gained in with
that so you automatically fix everything
that's wrong with a car it becomes
lighter on its toes it breaks it flows
down better accelerates better it's more
efficient you you kind of immediately
touch every dynamic of the vehicles on
the road demeanor by basically shaving
off those pounds yeah so we're likely to
probably see more lighter cars in the
near future by I know they're lightning
them up I think the yeah a couple of
cars we've seen recently have been
lighter than we would expect even so
yeah it's good trend in the field of
automotive infotainment electronics
that's something we obviously put a lot
of attention on here it's cnet car tech
we're seeing some reports that there's a
lot of projection for growth in this
area one stat I've heard along or a
while back some Institute last year said
that motor said that automotive is
actually the third fastest growing
mobile platform for electronics we're
getting some new studies that just came
out today IHS which used to be called I
supply IHS is a market research firm
they do a lot of stuff in automotive
electronics they did a study that shows
I mean this doesn't sound
but tackle early fast-growing but they
said that they're just so steady growth
in automotive electronics and this is
going into you know factory installed
dashboard systems this kind of thing and
these numbers mean that you know if
you're in this business it's a good
place to be right I mean eventually
there there's a show projections all the
way up to 20 16 by then Carl to be
driving themselves so you're going to
need something to keep you busy what's
right in the world's your oyster at that
point is for it's like what kind of junk
you can toss into the dashboard yeah
they're talking about increase in
production or increase in electronics in
money in this field from four point
seven two six point four percent ranging
from so they're seeing average maybe
five better than five percent growth by
2016 from now right so that's a nice
steady growth and they're talking about
it you know currently it's about surge
230 3.5 billion this year and be a
41-point forty 1.2 billion market by
2016 so a lot of lots of money in that
field and that that just relates to all
the new electronics were going to see in
cars and certainly the chip makers are
trying to cash in on this you know I've
talked to the people and NVIDIA a lot in
Intel freescale they're all they've got
chips to sell into this market and then
there's all the stuff that you actually
see in touch like the touch screens and
all that and along with us this is
interesting too similarly and
contributing to this automotive
entertainment statistic back up camera
sales ours are expected to double in
from 2011 to what are we talking about
2014 think oh no actually there when 245
everything uh what is it about 2015
they're going to be basically pumping
out about eight hundred and eight eight
hundred eighty thousand units by then
though that and then you know once you
start getting you know path path let me
pass that it just continues to grow and
I think I kind of have a bit of an
understanding of why why is the case and
the problem is that
you can't see out of the back cars
anymore I mean just if you look at the
way the design goes and I talked to it's
funny because whenever i mentioned to
people casually like you know in a bar
that like oh I review cars like one of
the questions that always comes up when
I start talking to two older friends is
why can't you see out of cars anymore
they're always just like you know why
the cars have these really high selena
the window sills have risen the roof
lines have dropped the the rear quarter
windows behind the cpanel have all but
disappeared from cars and it's just
you're getting you're getting to a point
where when you get in a car like like
the toyota yaris that we have in now
which is basically all greenhouse its
just oh I can see around and it's a bit
amazing yeah it was surprising in that
car you can actually they have high
windows hi were young yeah and it's just
you where the windows are getting even
more more and more gun-sling I just
think it's because they as the the
manufacturing process gives you know a
little bit more sophisticated every year
automakers can actually do these things
that that you used to only kind of see
you know chop tops that were customs or
you know that when you didn't have the
option to even add a backup camera
option well some of it is safety too as
far as raising the belt line goes
putting stronger reinforcement side
reinforcement indoors and making the
whole structure stronger to bri's a
side-impact right front impact and and
the great test is at any car these days
any new car try up try opening the
window and putting your elbow over the
window not possible no they're kind of
like up like this yeah third back in the
day you could like I'd feed people with
their whole arm just hanging out yeah
just really weird pick up the aluminum
cans on the side of the road as you
drive along yeah yeah but I mean I think
maybe it's the conspiracy theorist in me
but i think that there's a little bit of
uh hey you know we've got it eleven
hundred dollar back up camera option and
you can't really see out of the back of
our cars that's alexa feature just give
us the 1100 bucks I think they're kind
of building in a little bit of that
blind spot to fill blind spot detection
systems and rear view cameras yeah part
of the test drive is to actually back
into a space
or it's just not as much of a design
imperative because you can use the
technology of handicap in the designing
when you went before a rear view camera
or radar cruise control or you know the
the sonar blind spot detection was even
an option when you designed a car it had
to you had to be able to see out of it
because there's no other way but now
it's just like Oh we'll fix it in post
will just add a backup camera option and
we'll be good to go it doesn't matter
you can't see anything in this area we
can fix that with tech I like that fix
it in post yeah and designers can say we
don't need a huge back window and that
range rover evoque we had in recently
that had a very small rear window and
good thing that had a backup camera it's
funny when lots of times when I didn't
drive in somebody around and a lot of
people don't get in the newest cars and
I start parking in the city and they see
that the backup camera image come up on
the center dash and they're just like
whoa that's so cool you know and it's
and I'm used to it I see this a lot it
is that these are complaining you're
like yeah but that the trajectory lines
don't move it's not really that big of a
deal yeah well this article on that we
have on the back up camera sales
doubling they mentioned that and this is
something we've known is that by 2014 I
guess cars are going to have to have
backup cameras that's a federal mandate
and that's comes from the fact that a
lot of people have backed over their
kids in the driveway yeah they always
use the kids the option I mean that is
the the kits your attention sort of
thing yeah you're not so safety is I've
never liked over kid in my life oh
that's good that's good but they also
they also mentioned not for lack of
trying they mentioned some aftermarket
camera kits you can also get for your
existing vehicles you know anything
that's pre 2014 that doesn't have a
camera so you can actually add a camera
and they mentioned a few companies here
but one that kind of caught my eye was
honey boy yo B 0 y 0 which apparently is
going to offer a HD backup camera yep so
I mean cuz you need that right got a
wide screen and ram ten hundred giving
you a 1080 lines of resolution into your
tiny backup camera screen on your
dashboard so you can see the look of
fear and like
yes you're packing in nice detail yeah I
think what's interesting the things that
you want in a backup camera are well I
mean you want good night vision because
sometimes the the the reverse lights on
your car aren't very good so the best
backup cameras will offer a really good
night vision I want them to be not
easily stealable and sometimes it's as
simple as just using the right bolts
when you're you know couldn't you know
attaching it to your license plate frame
is how most aftermarket cameras are
added and then if at all possible and
I'm starting to see more of this is in
addition to the backup camera which it
already usually has a really wide angle
that allows you to kind of even see a
little bit into the blind spot for the
car when you're backing up which is good
when you're kind of turning into a spot
but if you can get something that has
like proximity detection usually that
involves drilling four holes in your
bumper and putting sensors down there I
think Alpine has a kit that does that
but that's like an extra layer of
protection just to let you know how far
away from something you are because
sometimes when you get that really wide
fisheyes difficult to judge distance
interesting thing about most backup
cameras is the distance if a bit
logarithmic so what looks like an inch
away from the bottom of the screen is
you know about six inches the next inch
up covers about two feet the next inch
up sometimes covers even more feet so
it's difficult to gauge distance again
you'll find that you approached via
things a lot more quickly than you would
if you were just looking directly out of
the window that's why it's good to have
those distant its distance lines if
someone's overlaid on those things I was
thinking about this you know mandate on
all cars and there's some cars I don't
think really need backup cameras I mean
certainly trucks and big sedans and
things like that sure but you know my
own car is it's a small you know BMW z3
I think you know back of camera that is
almost ridiculous guys know because i'm
looking at a tire height behind me
tuesday night i was sitting in a car
parked on the side of the road i was
waiting to go into a bar like the band
didn't start paying playing till 9i got
there like 845 so i'm sitting in the car
listening to the radio and this dude
pulls up in a miata Mazda Miata
first generation Tiny's car in the world
and he still like plenty of space in the
spot still does the bumper chick like
dude like he could engage how much space
is behind his card I'm just like it
doesn't really matter what kind of car
you're in there's always gonna be
someone who's just not comfortable with
like gauging distance and the cats can
help those people that's true that's
true i mean what i found in my car is i
usually underestimate how much space i
have so if i'm backing up i'm like oh is
there still enough space back there then
i get out of the way after i partly i
get out of the car there's like five
feet between me and the what's behind me
better safe than sorry moving on to this
is a story you picked up this this this
week right most powerful Ferrari ever
tell us about it so the Ferrari 599 skin
little bit long in the tooth due for
replacement and so Ferraris actually
came out with a teaser video kind of
showcasing the car that's going to
replace it I think they'd actually be
taken the wraps off of this car on the
twenty-ninth the rumors are stating that
his car is going to be called the
Ferrari F 620 GT it's going to have a
you know v12 engine up front end of the
hood rear-wheel drive kind of the same
configuration of as the Ferrari 599 but
what's interesting about this car is
that Ferraris claiming that it is the
most powerful Ferrari ever right now if
you're talking about production cars I
think that title belongs to the Ferrari
FF shooting brake which is putting out
like 660 thumb on horsepower you could
count the Ferrari 599 GTO which puts out
661 horsepower I'm pretty sure they're
not counting the 599 xx which puts out
720 horsepower because that's like a
extremely limited race variant that
strictly track on that card not a
road-going car we're guessing about 660
horsepower from the v12 that they're
going to be bringing out sometime soon
I'm pretty sure looking at the profile
that is just it's going to be heavily
based on the the Ferrari FF maybe with
more power definitely without that
Ferrari like for fr whatever there-there
all-wheel drive system is called and
that's as simple as
chopping the front transmission off of
that the interesting thing about the
Ferrari FF is got to gearboxes one in
the back of the engine that has like
seven or eight even one at the front
that has two speeds and it only engages
the front gearbox mean you need all
wheel drive so if you just drop that off
change the shooting break into a coupe
at a couple more horsepower I think
we're pretty close to what we will
expect to see in this next Ferrari yeah
a little profile I mean it's a pretty
heavily masks are in the video and the
the screenshot you grabbed here but it
does look like a GT car yeah a-and which
you'd expect if it's a 599 replacement
it's interesting that Ferrari is going
more powerful and so many cars somebody
cavities are you know losing horsepower
and trying to get fuel efficiency but I
guess where I doesn't really care that
much about that let's Ferrari so I mean
how many other gonna sell a year 10
that's true and I mean it also has to
live in the same world as the Aventador
I wish I don't know if it complete if it
directly competes against the Aventadors
that i will drive mid-engine car but I
mean as far as just like a halo vehicle
you know between those two Italian
companies that are that are pretty
different in their philosophies I think
it's interesting to see Ferrari kind of
throwing its hat into the horsepower
race there yeah so the wraps come off
this on febre 29th yeah leap day so
that'll be this week we'll be looking
out for that one and certainly want to
get as much information on it as soon as
they make that available and hopefully
we'll see that car in Geneva 2 seems
like you know they're taking the wraps
off on this week then yeah it should be
it should be ready for next week it
should be there should be ready for
deneva I'll try to touch it is seriously
doubt I'll Drive it yeah yeah yeah hard
to get in those sometimes last door we
have is a Porsche which has been kind of
teasing working around letting us know
somewhat about a small mini or a small
SUV they're working on something smaller
than the cayenne and they've at least
released some sketches and sub like that
we know they're working on it they so
this week they came up with a name for
they they said okay here's the name for
our new car it's called the mech con
okay or the Macan
or the Mossad we're not getting any
better M acan yeah i mean that's yeah
first stop people gonna be like how do
you pronounce that i'm sure that the all
sorts of variations i'm sure they'll get
the hang of it just like they get the
hang of every other awkward name cayenne
cayenne came and came into that hard
boxster um this doesn't matter I mean if
we within VW Group the Tuareg oh yeah
pork is a tough one this car was
originally sort of named Cajun they're
calling occasion which I kind of liked I
the case is very unfortunate well you
know that Cayenne occasion cayman it all
kind of made sense I thought Creole
people that be and I said that that
would maybe be a better name of the pan
America Panamera the Panamera that's
when they call it the Creole I think it
should be called the Creole gonna be a
better name if they want to be
consistent you have you call anything
it's funny cuz Porsche is they sort of
insist on there um and then the press
release for this car they insisted that
you know every every one of their cars
as a name that represents the car very
well it represents its attributes and so
they mentioned and but they don't have
any really consistency in those names so
what is the 911 doesn't have anything to
do with attribute number now yeah that
vet came up and they totally ignored
that and then their press release but
they mentioned that the Boxster
describes a combination of a boxer
engine and a roadster the Cayenne stands
for sharpness the Cayman is snappy and
agile and a Panamera is more than a
grand turismo capable also winning the
carrera panamericana a long-distance
race so they're working from a lot of
different books here yeah they're all
over the place that they're naming at
the end of the day though I don't really
care what badges what the vet says
what's interesting is is about is what
this car is now I don't really have a
good idea of how big we expect this car
to be because in my mind I'm looking at
the picture I'm thinking something the
size of the evoke because that's just
for a mine state is would be interesting
but I mean if it bigger than that or
well actually it's already confirmed
that
share a platform with the audi q5 so
that is a kind of smaller SUV right and
I think it will probably likely have the
3.2 liter v6 of that car because they've
sort of gotten this whole thing we're
Porsche and VW and audi or sharing a lot
of their power trains at least at a
certain segment so I wouldn't expect any
really high ribbon 3.8 boxer engine in
this car and the more I look at this the
more it looks like less like a flattened
cayenne and more like a stretched
Panamera on really big wheels like
someone just decided I want a Panamera
donk and that's what they did of course
with all those sketches you know the
designers always put on the biggest
wheels possible it's like we're gonna
have 30 s on this car someone should
actually just make a car that is
designed around 30 inch wheels I Drive
it then they could like put on their
press relief biggest wheels ever in a
production the world's largest Libby
blah that's kind of seems like they like
to do that so someone should just take
advantage of that I also got to mention
to makan actually means tiger in some of
their language indonesian indonesian
they say so that's where this car gets
its attributes from i guess it's like a
tiger lity gonna latika that'd be even
better lity great the bushes are to me
orange with black stripes about one
morning black spray fulfill everything
else first one just to prove a point
right it might be Oh probably the least
expensive Porsche ever or you know
currently two in the line is yeah but
moving on I think we've had said enough
about the Porsche makan let's so let's
go on the road in the range rover evoque
one thing interesting with this car is
it's got a 4 cylinder engine it's a two
liter direct injection turbocharged
engine that's very unwrite land rover
yeah it's supposed to get good fuel
economy because of that so the epa
rating is 18 city and 28 highway and
i've seen definitely in the mid range of
their around 25 miles per gallon with a
decent amount of highway driving so
it'll get probably better mileage than
any Range Rover Land Rover that's gone
before it's probably the best range of
her that's suited for the road also the
sort of like low ride height very car
like again that small engine I mean this
car doesn't really make very many all
throat free chances you do have the
buttons right here for your sort of like
tracks and control systems for things
like snow or uneven you know sandy
terrain but I mean it's not really the
same as the I would think is the system
that's been the bigger for example lr4
or the lr2 even and this being a ladder
over to this is a luxury vehicle so we
have a really good audio system near
meridian it's it's definitely above
average I would say it's the best I've
ever heard but it's it's really good
it's pretty fine detail we also have a
navigation system here with one of these
interfaces Land Rover and Jaguar which
kind of the same company now they tended
to go for these these very graphic heavy
interfaces I think this is a little too
complicated a little bit slow it's like
you hit a button for like menu for
example then it has to think for a beat
and then you get to watch a nice little
half a second animation of the menus
rendering and it's just you really don't
want that when you're driving around you
just want the menu so you can get your
eyes back on the road but there is a lot
there also a lot of buttons throw it on
around here which it could probably be a
slightly better graphic design because I
don't think it's the best in usability
and like in Jaguars we've got this crazy
little shift knob which rises up out of
the center console and it's really just
a dial it isn't actually a shifter
because you know all cars are pretty
much electronically shipped it now so I
can work with that we got paddle
shifters to it for the 6-speed automatic
transmission
one last thing I got to say that I think
is interesting about this car is that
the engine mentioned it's a two liter of
direct injection turbo and it produces
240 horsepower and something around 270
pound-feet of torque and those figures
are exactly the same as for its EcoBoost
engine huh so I think it's the same
engine you think yeah we haven't proven
that yet but there's a good chance that
Land Rover is sourcing their engine from
the scar from Fort we actually think
have confirmed that now that it is the
EcoBoost engine report it's actually not
quite the same as the one in the edge
EcoBoost the edge produces 270
foot-pounds of torque the the evokes
engine only does 251 pound feet although
does have that 240 horsepower the year
to which matches and I've out read
elsewhere that this is sort of a subtly
different version of the engine that's
in the Focus ST you so yeah yeah it's
the same technology it's the direct
injection and the turbochargers
basically the same engine different
slightly different tuning on it though
I'm not sure why they would tune or lose
some of the torque on it I'm not quite
sure where that would happen I could
come from anywhere it diff they're
measuring the power at the flywheel I
mean it could be a different flywheel
than used to meet up with their
different transmission I could be minor
difference in the length of the intake
any number of things could cause you to
lose you know a little bit of torque
yeah now this car the Evoque has been
just it's amazing like every week I get
in to get a press release from Jaguar
saying well we won 10 more awards for
the Evoque it's the truck it's the north
american truck of the year it's the i
think it is the north american truck of
here actually it's a you know the truck
of the year all over the world and it's
winning this award and that award and I
don't get it yeah I mean well first
starter is it's a good-looking car like
I'd if I ever meet the person who
designed this I will shake their hand
like I I mean that's it first start I
mean they do all sorts of like there's a
lot of like neat touches and it just it
feels like it was designed by one person
supposed to a lot of cars that are just
like oh oh we'll just take the lights
from this car and and then or you know
our other car has boomerang-shaped
taillights we got to figure out a way to
make that happen it's it just looks like
it has a singular purpose things like
the fender vents which I normally hate
but if you look at them they line up so
perfectly with the headlight that almost
looks like the headlight goes through
that sort of flared fender it just it's
just cohesive design it just looks like
it's you know machined from one chunk of
metal now I would not argue with you i
think it is a good-looking car as well
well not all of our readers agree but
yeah the i do you like the look of the
car but i guess from the rest of it it's
I'm just kind of like and what's so
special well it's late over well
actually yeah it is it is it I the
official name I think is that 2000 well
land rover range rover evoque then
whatever suffixes you want to add F at
exactly yeah you know it's a
good-looking car and it's a nice it is a
nice engine but as we've seen it's it's
a Ford engine mmm I but it is good in
high tech I'm just not sure does this is
better than say about eq5 or something
as an example uh better maybe not
definitely not I mean like okay if
you're talking about cabin techno yeah
it's just that the system the system in
the evoke is it's relatively new as I
mean you're the accurate system hey uh
but it just already it felt dated when
it came out and so it just it still it
just feels a little dated there's just
like a lot of just watching you know
menus load which is if not just when
you're doing it on your laptop and you
go to a website that's too much flash
it's a in my opinion a little dangerous
in the car right you can't actually turn
off those animations which is good and
and there really is no reason to put
animations in a cart in a cabin tech
interface because yeah when you're
looking at it you're just looking at to
find the button you need to push then
you're looking back at the road then
you're looking back at it to see what
screen you're on now you don't want to
see those animations happen or if
they're happening they're not happening
while you're looking at it right or they
shouldn't be
uh yeah it was it was fairly basic cabin
text app it's good but it's not you know
cutting edge and that's why I think in
our estimation car technology you know
car tech it was like yeah you know it's
okay but it's not something blowing me
away it's not and you know it's not a
connected car or anything like that
right but I mean would I rather be seen
in audi q5 or in a range rover evoque I
think I would rather be seen in the
evoke hmm I just I mean it's it all
comes back to the styling and I hate to
keep like being that guy who's just and
this is a classic case of form winning
out over function for me because I mean
I feel like that the all-wheel drive
system the off-road chops that it may or
may not have or a bit of a non-issue
when you're talking about the target
market for the video this vehicle but i
mean its people want to be seen in a car
when you're talking about like a premium
vehicle premium soft roader I mean it's
already kind of the vehicle that exists
for its maybe because it exists I
doesn't really serve a purpose and so
you come down to the point where you're
discussing style and it's just the idea
vote it feminine and masculine at the
same time I feel like you you wouldn't
feel you know less manly driving this
around at the same time like you know a
woman wouldn't feel like she was riding
around in a very she wouldn't feel like
she's in a jeep wrangler yeah it's way
easier to get into and out of than any
other range rover that I've ever driven
yeah it's way too stylish to be a macho
people but I mean it doesn't it's I
guess it's kind of like a you know the
suits are kind of designed around a
function so if you look at certain
styles of suits you'll see that they're
based on like riding gear so you know
the original intention is that you know
you ride a horse in this sort of outfit
and it was designed to be practical but
then over years it becomes stylish and
it's kind of the same thing here where
you can kind of see the you see the the
land rover and range rover styling cues
so it's like there's a echoing back to
this sort of like yeah I can go anywhere
and you know drive through the Sahara
Desert and whatever in this vehicle but
without sort of the the overtures
yeah I think it borrows a lot from
Jaguar or two which is interesting
showing more that Jaguar Land Rover
collusion well definitely on the
interior thing was lifted yeah out of a
Jaguar definitely about that drive
selector for example a good example but
the also i think the rear windows and
this kind of remind me somewhat of the
that new Jaguar XJ with the big sort of
sunglasses style rear window this also
has that that like you know slit
sunglasses kind of thing looking in the
back in that really narrow rear window
interesting to this car we have the the
five-door there's also a coupe version
now I don't know if you can actually get
that in the US the coupe version but it
would be primarily less functional
because getting the back seats you have
to crawl over let's see it's it's more
of a European thing I believe it's
already kind of looking like a mini
cooper from the side angle the more I
look at it you take off two doors and
it's I mean oh yes it starts getting
into mini countryman well it's probably
that that roof which looks you know kind
of a cap on top of there because they
have the black pillars and then the the
body color roof that definitely has sort
of a mini cooper look to it one thing I
found two from this car and you didn't
really say you experience but I think
you drove it as much is that I felt it
lunged a lot when you're trying to drive
to be trying to keep a smooth steady
pace and then you just give a little gas
suddenly it's like roll it wants to like
bleep forward and you're just like no I
don't want to hit the car in front of me
sure you do because you can ride right
over it because it's a Land Rover you
don't have enough ground clearance that
that's true that that may be something
I've seen a lot of videos online of
people 14 rivers and going up my you
know muddy or rocky services and it
seems to do all right but it doesn't
have that adaptive it doesn't have this
especially can lift right you can
actually get a magnetic ride suspension
port which will make it corner better
and handle really well if you're
blasting around on roads right but that
doesn't really help you in situations
where you're you're off road and you
need more ground clearance yeah so that
won't be able to drive this on the moon
which is ever I believe that you should
actually be driving this on the moon
yeah look I'm just expecting to see this
like you know in
in somebody's like the science fiction
movie where they're like we're on Mars
and we're driving around out in the
desert would like a red filter and the
range rover evoque and I believe it I
think we need a third opinion here from
the family man in the room a Mitch as
far as toting your family run would this
be a car you'd prefer to do it in no I
think the back is too small mm-hmm put
car seats on no no way how much makes
the kids take the Seas and you known in
and then the you know the state of
California is thinking about making it
changing it so that even if you're I've
got the weight like you basically be
eight years old but if you're under a
certain way you have to be in a booster
seat mmm that that's gonna be seriously
stigmatizing 4 for 8 year olds it's
gonna be really difficult for brian Tong
driving his hahaha can you fit a bit I
need to be in a booster they can anchor
seats down in the front seat of his feet
don't reach the pedals anymore well that
was the 2012 range rover evoque the
video and review are all online at seen
at cars cars scenic ami and check it out
there let's take a look at what's in the
scene at garage so we've just reviewed
the honda crv the jeep wrangler and the
range rover evoque lot of SUVs in little
off-roaders hop rotors and right now in
the garage we've got the BMW 328i 2012
version with four cylinder and the new
toyota yaris it's a car it's a cup just
like you have to say that just say your
identity this has been car tech live
