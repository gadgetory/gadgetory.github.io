cnet.com and right now we're taking a
first look at the hot watch so made by
pH TL labs this device is essentially a
SmartWatch that lets you see
notifications such as Facebook alerts
emails text messages things like that
that ordinary smartwatches do but what
is very interesting is that it will
enable you to receive calls on the watch
itself by using a in-line directional
microphone and speaker here on the watch
band so you can basically just you know
put it up to your ear like this when
it's on your wrist and answer calls and
take calls privately you can also end
the call by waving bye-bye and that's
pretty everything so we're getting a lot
of this new gesture-based controls of
the phone function in the watch and that
essentially lets you interact with your
phone without having to pick it up or
take it out of your bag another
interesting feature is you have this
touch screen on the front which enables
you to not only view all your messages
and alerts but you can also change the
watch faces you can draw you know
letters on the screen virtually to
enable different functions and abilities
on the watch itself another thing that's
very nice is that it connects to your
smart phone whether that's an iPhone or
an Android device through iOS and
Android apps and it connects via
bluetooth 4.0 so that enables you to
have a very long battery life much
better hopefully than other devices out
on the market it also has an e-ink style
display here similar to what the Pebble
watch uses you can also download new
watch faces and they say they'll you'll
even be able to create your own custom
watch faces without having to be a
programmer there's basically going to be
a watch face simulator that you can
download which enables you to create
your own watch faces on your own without
any training or anything like that so
that's a very cool feature now just
looking at the hot watch Smart Watch you
can tell it's very thin it's only eight
millimeters thick which is a very svelte
looking design
we're looking at right now is a
prototype of the hot watch so right now
the bezel and main watch area here will
look very similar to the finished
product but the strap and the
directional microphone and speaker here
will actually be improved once the final
model ships in the December time frame
so there's another feature on the hot
watch which enables you to protect your
phone in case someone tries to walk away
with it or maybe you'll leave it behind
this feature is called never leave your
phone behind essentially it will send an
alert to the watch to let you know that
your watch has become separated from
your phone so right now the hot watch is
available on Kickstarter as a project
but it will be shipping by December and
hitting retail stores the pricing for
the watch will basically start at 169
and range all the way up to 249 so there
are gonna be four different models for
the hot watch and each different model
will have different build quality and
different materials so on the high end
you'll have titanium and leather bands
and on the lower end you'll have more
rubber plastic or silicone that kind of
thing but you'll have an option to buy
them in a retail store hopefully after
December the company behind the hot
watch has just been awarded a patent
which enables all of the gesture
controls and the call answer capability
through the directional speaker so it's
a very interesting product it's
definitely using a lot of advanced
capabilities I'm Brian Bennett for
cnet.com and this has been a first look
at the hot water smart</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
