that many of you have written and asked
about so we're kind of do a little Q&amp;amp;A
session around this one first of all are
they making it yes sort of they've made
about 50 so far another two hundred are
coming in q2 of 2014 that should be the
whole production run so production is a
funny word at numbers that small next up
why isn't every car like this this being
a turbo diesel hybrid one of the rare
cars in the world that does that 31
miles of electric range something like
240 us MPG I mean this is a stunning
achievement right looks a little funny
but hey I think it would find a market
except for one problem the price we
would be about 150 grand us if you
converted it from the European price
they're selling it to people at so you
can't live long enough to make the fuel
economy of this vehicle ever pay for it
even at 2 40 mpg now the other question
is why don't more cars have this magic
combo of the efficiency and torque of a
diesel with the efficiency and torque of
an electric that should tip you off of
the problem the two kind of overlap too
much they both do the same thing
efficient low-end torque a gas hybrid
combo they kind of help each other out
more they don't step on each other as
much another reason is cost diesels have
a price premium electric has a price
premium put them together you get a big
price premium that most buyers aren't
interested in back here is the motive
power area a little two cylinder turbo
diesel it's exotic in its architecture
and displacement and then of course you
got the hybrid gear coupled with it but
notice what's all around us here carbon
fiber that's not exotic that doesn't add
cost part of reason this vehicle is
exceptionally expensive and it's low
volumes now as I was one of the ten
people who loved the original honda
insight as you can imagine I also love
this guy the seating configuration is
similar it's tiny it's tier dropped the
seat over here is kind of offset it's
pushed further back it's not your
conventional car and with this big old
seal getting in it makes getting into a
Countach look easy Oh notice we've got
the car show classic screens with
cameras instead of side view mirrors but
it does give you an
idea we're engineering can go in a real
production car today if you're looking
for high MPG at any cost</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
