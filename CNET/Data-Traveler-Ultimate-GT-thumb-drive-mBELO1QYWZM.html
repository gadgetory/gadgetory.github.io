ultimate GT from Kingston the very first
thumb drive on the market that has up to
two terabyte of storage space basically
it moves then double the capacity of
these two laptop combined and it's fast
too in testing it has to average speed
of some 330 megabyte per second one of
the fast drive on the market so the
question is can you afford it probably
not now this 2 terabyte drive right here
cost some $1,600 $1,600 basically more
than the cost of this two laptop
combined but the thing is you might not
want it either here's what first is
really bulky really let's take a look
here I have a some of the typical thumb
drive right here and see how boss the GT
is the system must go thin in this case
it's a bad thing
now take a look if I plug the computer
right here it will lift it off the
surface not a good way to use the laptop
now our desktop is hard to fill in and
if you can well it will block the
adjacent USB ports to deal with the
problem kingston includes this extension
cable right here but really do you want
to use a thumb drive with a cable and
even then you cannot use it with a new
MacBook because there is no USBC
connector so calling the GT a thumb
drive is a bit of a stretch if anything
is a toe a big toe drive and the fact
that it costs an arm and a leg makes my
head spin I can put my finger on it
considering this glib drive right here
to tear by by the same physical size is
better and faster overall can be half or
just about $800 so pay the full price of
the GT if you want but only if you think
the box here and the pounds are on the
inside are worth $1000 because honestly
the drive itself should go more than few
hard bucks but if you get it for free
though it's a great thing to have and
I'm talking to experience here and
that's because I'm dumb low and this is
the data traveler or with GT Drive on
Kingston yeah I like it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
