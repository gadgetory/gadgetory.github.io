hey Glen Glen over here hey Glen let me
out Glenn Glenn come on hey what's
happened in brian Tong here and welcome
to the apple pie for all the good and
everything else inside the world of
Apple now let's get to the show and we
start off with the success of google
maps that racked up over 10 million
downloads for the free app in just 48
hours after the app was released now
some of you have decided to stick with
apples Maps because it does work well
depending on where you live but here's a
really sweet tip for you if you want to
use google maps with Siri without
jailbreaking your phone now if you're
looking for specific directions to a
location make the Siri prompt appear and
ask something like find directions to in
and out burger via transit by saying via
transit will be able to select the
location you want then you'll see a list
of your transit apps up here and Google
Maps is one of the options just press
route and it will take you directly into
the Google Maps app or any transit app
of your choice that you have installed
and voila there you go see you guys I
know it's an extra step but it makes
using google maps easier without having
to jailbreak your phone and trust me
you'll impress your friends with this
thanks Brian you're the best thanks I
know now according to The Wall Street
Journal the big a is said to be in talks
with Foursquare the social check in
application and is looking to add the
company's data to its Maps application
neq even use the app to check in to a
Lakers Knicks game but unfortunately he
also showed us that he's pretty bad at
taking pictures with his iphone now the
hope is to give users more detailed
information and tips about locations
from users to compete
the recent release of google maps apple
also just released an over-the-air
update for iOS 6.0 point2 it's only for
iphone 5 and ipad mini users and
addresses a Wi-Fi bug issue now also
sticking with iOS the Cupertino kids
have also released the fourth beta seed
of iOS 6.1 to developers updates will be
minimal but up to this point we plan on
scene and improved apple passbook some
tweaks to Safari reworked music controls
on the lock screen and ticket purchases
through fandango in serie all right guys
let's take a look at what Apple is
thinking about in the future and here's
an interesting one that Apple might
include in I devices that involves their
cameras having a combination of a
pre-installed database and new
recognition software that will be able
to recognize famous objects like iconic
paintings or famous landmarks like the
spectacular Golden Gate Bridge or even
better famous people like honey boo boo
now it obviously wouldn't be a killer
feature but a bonus that could propel
you into a career as a paparazzi see
look at that job it's a dream come true
and guys the US Patent and Trademark
Office has awarded Apple a patent for
the design of the first generation
iphone that was released in 2007 and
created in part by Steve Jobs and Johnny
I've it was a design that truly changed
the smartphone industry moving forward
with its two tone back mostly made of
aluminum and its finger driven
touchscreen all right guys let's take a
quick break to show you a pretty cool
accessory from Logitech that's worth
checking out hi I'm rich brown fur cnet
today we're going to take a look at the
logitech bluetooth illuminated keyboard
k810 so as its name implies this is a
wireless keyboard that connects to your
various devices via bluetooth it has
some unique features to it it's also
pretty expensive so one of its biggest
selling points is a series of buttons
here at the top and the function row
you'll see they're labeled 1 2 3 and
what they do is they actually swap
between devices you've already paired to
the keyboard them as you can take the
keyboard use it with a computer but then
grab a tablet grab the keyboard go get
some coffee somewhere and just hit the
button to swap over the pairing and then
you can just type away so you can pair
the keyboard with up to 3 devices and it
works with and
iOS OS 10 windows 7 windows 8 I even
connected with the ps3 all of which had
no problems now it is actually a Windows
specific keyword and then it has a
windows button down here but it will
work with those other devices no problem
along with those other buttons on the
top there's also a honky that gets you
back to the home screen on whatever
tablet or smartphone you might be using
that said it does what it does very well
and it looks great doing it so I'm rich
brown this is the logitech bluetooth
illuminated keyboard k810 thanks rich
and did he say luxury because you know
I'm all about the bling bling on to the
quick bites and in some quick apple vs
samsung news Apple has lost their bid
for a ban on 26 Samsung devices in the
u.s. they were still pushing for it but
US District Judge Lucy Coe said in a
statement samsung may have cut into
apple's customer base somewhat but
there's no suggestion that samsung will
wipe out apple's customer base or force
Apple out of the business of making
smartphones and we can all agree on that
point for sure and earlier in the week
Apple announced they have sold over 2
million units of the iphone 5 in China
just three days after its launch for
their best first weekend sales in china
and also our good friend Raul Madera
wrote in with this so I was strolling
through Dillard's the other day and I
