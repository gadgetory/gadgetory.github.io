this one has two cameras this just one
but does one out to do two or two out to
do one my journey comparing these pocket
photography Wizards took me across land
and sea and proved both phones were
skillful enough to capture the world
around me
my quest started at the Ferry Building
in San Francisco home to skateboarders
Gandhi and pornographic ice cream both
phones took appealing pictures but for
different reasons photos taken with the
no date had boosted contrast and
saturation mimicking a frame of film
from a dramatic movie pictures of the
pixel to excel had a pure cut Akal pity
with expertly rendered detail and
highlights this photo taken with a note
eights telephoto lens shows off the
beautiful oranges and yellows of a
sunset behind the Golden Gate Bridge the
pixel to excels standard angle lens
rendered the same scene with cooler
tones and more detail in the waves
I headed back to land for some games and
to test out portrait mode which gives
photos and artistic blurry background on
the note aid it's called live focus the
pixel to excel portraits had better
detail and better focus fall off from
people's heads to the background note
eight portraits with warmer and rendered
a more pleasing blurry background
whether on a boat or a cable car or just
taking pictures of pets the note eights
two times optical zoom allowed me to get
closer to my subject without diminishing
image quality the pixel to excels single
rear camera only has digital zoom which
can produce softer looking images with
more color noise then there's video the
note eights video stabilization is could
but the pixel to excels fusion
stabilization is the best I've seen on
any phone yeah go ahead and film your
best Goodfellas Steadicam shot imitation
video image quality from both phones was
good but a bit of a letdown compared to
how nice photos are especially video
shot in low-light the note 8 and pixel
to excel are capable of jaw-dropping 240
frames per second slow motion
unfortunately it's at a not quite so
jaw-dropping 720p resolution however the
pixel to excel can shoot 120 frames per
second at 1080p producing dramatic slow
motion without sacrificing resolution
also worth mentioning the no take can
record time lapses and has built in
snapchat like stickers the pixel to
excels front-facing camera lets you take
portrait mode photos and they look
amazing
look trying to determine which phone has
the best camera is complicated if you
like to zoom and want a gorgeous display
to view your photos the no data is the
way to go if you want the best pictures
the steadiest video an excellent
portrait mode selfies go for the pixel
to excel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
