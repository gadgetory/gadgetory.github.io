cnet.com and I'm here with the JBL
charge Bluetooth speaker this is the Big
Brother to the JBL flip very similar
design but it is a little bit bigger has
a little bit bigger sound and does cost
a little bit more at $150 instead of $99
why is it called the charge well aside
from being a portable speaker you can
use it to charge your mobile devices as
far as battery life the speaker goes it
is rated at up to 12 hours of battery
life that's pretty good for a small
speaker I have the light blue version
here but the speaker does come in
multiple colors i like the flip speaker
it can be set down horizontally like
this or stood up vertically there is a
port that does fire from the top so you
do have to make sure you stand it on the
right side of the speaker there are very
few buttons on the device itself there's
really only a power button and a volume
control button so it's very simple to
use you simply turn it on and pair it
with your Bluetooth enabled device I
listened to a lot of these Bluetooth
speakers and this does sound better than
a lot of the smaller models does have
its limitations of course it's not going
to fill a really big room with sound but
it certainly can fill a small room with
sound if you play it at the right volume
and don't try to crank it too much it
does offer a clear sound good bass and
again you can't expect the world from
these really small speakers but this
certainly will impress a lot of people
with it's big sound for its small size
this does come with a neoprene carrying
case and it designed to be portable and
I do think it's a nice compromise for
someone who wants a little bit bigger
sound than something like the jam box or
the flip but doesn't want to go up to
something like the big jam box which is
a larger speaker and really isn't quite
as portable as you'd like it to be so
the JBL charge is a nice compromise it
also has that charging option and I do
recommend it I'm David Carr know and
that's the JBL charge thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
