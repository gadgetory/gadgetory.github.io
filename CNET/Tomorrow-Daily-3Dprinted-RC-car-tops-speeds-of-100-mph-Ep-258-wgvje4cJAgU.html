welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk-show in the known universe yes talk
shows usually have more than one person
in it but we're waiting for our new set
to be built so you're just gonna have to
wait until then all right let's have our
very first headline of the day is about
a little RC car that can go over a
hundred miles per hour check this thing
out
James Beswick is the designer of this
amazing little RC car he has been an RC
enthusiast for quite some time and 3d
printing is actually taking his cars to
the next level which is pretty cool his
most recent car as we said goes over 100
miles per hour and Beswick attributes 3d
printing to his success saying it speeds
up building processes and lets him pick
out the best materials to make his cars
with a Bestwick is determined to keep
making new 3d printed RC cars until he
can break the world speed record the
Guinness Book of World Records lists
that as 200 and 2.0 2 miles per hour but
honestly I think he can make it okay
produced I can play that clip again so
we can hear the sound going from the
ground to outer space NASA this week
released some amazing high-res images of
the biggest planet in our solar system
Jupiter the Hubble Space Telescope sent
some spectacular images of Jupiter which
NASA created two new maps from and a 4k
video showing off the new information
there's some really interesting changes
happening on Jupiter including a new
filament we've never seen before and
confirmation that the great red spot we
all know and love is actually shrinking
and also shifting in color to a slightly
more oranjee hue if you're watching
today's show on a smartphone do yourself
a favor and toss that big beautiful 4k
video NASA made up onto the biggest
highest resolution screen you have
because honestly it's pretty inspiring
to check out okay so the very last
headline we have today is about
temperature controlled Digital robotic
fingers this story comes from
researchers at Florida Atlantic
University they're using temperature
changes to curl and uncurl robotic
fingers designed to look and feel like
our own human digits now actuators for
flexing and extending were trained
to take specific shapes when
respectively heated or cooled
unfortunately since it takes a little
bit of time for the actuators to cool
down using them in current technology is
not quite the best choice for things
like human prosthetics so they think
that underwater robotics might be the
best place to start testing ultimately
their goal is to in fact adapt that
technology though to human prosthetics
making it a really cool thing to check
out and also pretty intuitive so nice
work guys all right let's go from
headlines to mod squat this is easily my
favorite mod squad we featured on the
show thus far and it's about lifting
Thor's hammer Allen pan is known on
YouTube as sufficiently advanced and he
made this amazing modded out replica of
Thor's hammer Mjolnir that only he can
lift
it's powered by Arduino and a large
electromagnet from a microwave plus a
fingerprint scanner there are more
elements to it than that which you can
check out in the video online but the
basic concept is this the hammer is
placed on a metal surface the
electromagnet gets switched on and
nobody can lift the dumb thing up unless
you're Alan pan whose fingerprint shuts
off the magnet and lets him hoist
Mjolnir as he is worthy still it makes
for a really fun party trick I will give
you that Alan nice work all right
let's check out your pictures
our phone talker for the day today is
Jen who took this picture with her
iPhone 5s she emailed us and she wrote
very briefly but very succinctly you
have my permission to use photos of my
very dramatic baby Claire on your show
she loves tech and says it tastes great
this is what takes up all the memory on
my iPhone 5s well Jen yes your baby
Claire is super adorable and I'm sure
she loves to taste all of the different
piece of technology that you buy in your
house as babies do uh but yeah super
dramatic picture I love the shadow and
the color and the lighting it's really
great and if you guys want to send in
your phone tog Rafi to be featured on
the show you can of course email us
tomorrow at Cena comm is the email
address send us your name the picture
what device you took it on and tell us a
little story about it oh and give us
permission to use it on the show if you
want to share the show with somebody
which I would really appreciate you can
always give them the address tomorrow
daily comm you can find us all over the
Internet at tomorrow daily on your
favorite social media sites
unless it's snapchat and you can find me
in producer Logan online on twitter
@ashleyesqueda Moy well that's it for
today's show we'll be back tomorrow with
a brand new docket of weird science tech
mating science fiction but until then
big in humans we'll see you guys next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
