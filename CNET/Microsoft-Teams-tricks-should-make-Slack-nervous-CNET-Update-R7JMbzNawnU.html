brand-new work collaboration tool that
just may be better than the competition
Microsoft teams is a group chat
application fold it into the
subscription of the office 365 suite of
programs think of it as a network to
chat with your colleagues at work about
projects as an alternative to email it's
going to begin slack which many
companies have already adopted over the
past few years
Microsoft teams will benefit companies
that already use office products because
of how it weaves together other
Microsoft tools so you can easily attach
a Word or Excel document for editing or
jump into a Skype call but it also works
with outside third-party applications
another perk is that teams supports
threaded conversations so you can follow
the trail of a discussion that's a
feature lacking on slack and it's been a
big complaint for many users teams is a
free add-on for companies that already
subscribe to office 365 but individual
home consumers will not be able to try
it out it's just for the workplace yet
it's not limited to Windows machines
Microsoft is also making this accessible
to Mac iOS and Android devices teams is
launching at the start of 2017 but
enterprise customers can preview it now
creating networks for companies to
collaborate in real time is a hot area
right now it's why Facebook recently
launched Facebook for work and it seems
even before Microsoft teams officially
launches slack is worried it took out a
full-page ad in The New York Times it
made a blog post a friendly advice for
Microsoft welcoming the competition
it was so awkwardly written you could
just smell the fear I am Bridget Carey
