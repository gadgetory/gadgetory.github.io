heavier than some cars I've owned - it's
great soft dig rump the Continental GT
exists for one reason to transport just
two people in a manner that says the one
on the left has arrived let's drive this
2012 version with the w12 motor and
check the tech
everywhere you look the Continental
prints like it's a hundred and fifty
percent scale model of a regular car and
the details I love include this window
opening when all the glasses down and
you go pillarless and these uh turley
flush understated taillights
now inside this Bentley we happen to be
awash in piano black and stern black
leather finishes with their signature
diamond quilt but this is a bespoke car
you can order this thing any way you can
imagine we're not going to go there
let's go tech finally Bentley's got a
new more modern head unit and let me get
on my soapbox for a minute I think a lot
of the manufacturers of these extremely
expensive cars figure well we're going
to Bowl them over with the interior the
performance the styling but the folks
who buy these cars are the same ones who
buy the new iPhone the new iPad every
iMac a so knows music system they are
technology elites you can't be throwing
anything but the best tech in front of
them with that in mind this is a very
good VW derived piece Volkswagen owns
Bentley little quirks though you can
have either 2d 3d topo or traffic you
can't have traffic on 3d for example or
traffic on topo but beyond that the
quality of it is good especially when
you're zoomed in to a certain level it's
a hard drive based system
now here are media choices am/fm and HD
radio are standard on this guy satellite
radio of course under the media tab we
get the more interesting stuff optical
discs here optional with a package
brings us a six disc in the glove box as
well you also spotted that MDI
controller it's a multi device interface
we happen to have a pigtail on there for
an iOS device we've also got an SD card
slot right here for the four of you who
do that you've got a sim card slot so
you can have a phone sim in the car and
look at this welcome to the 80s this is
called the privacy phone for your
passengers to use they can call and do a
booty call while you're driving you
don't know it because they're speaking
in code heated and cooled seats with a
special feature when they're on high
cooling they are the loudest seats I've
ever heard I got in this car and they
were on cooling three and I thought I
was dragging something behind me that's
a hell of a noise you hear that the
shock absorber button brings you this
screen to set up your suspension for
settings from comfort to sport needless
but fun stuff like this you can play
with the wing raise it up and down and
not just leave it to its own devices
that gets old after about a week we have
the name audio system na I am it's an
English boutique audio manufacturer and
that gets us 11 speakers driven by 16
channels not quite sure how that works
but
anyway it's in there and they use these
special drivers speakers that are
flecked which they say disperses audio
much more naturally and evenly all I can
tell you is this
like so many high-dollar systems and
this one cost like 7 grand optionally it
makes CDs sound tremendous satellite
radio guest lis in back is the county
jail you'll put someone back there
unless they've been real bad drinking
fighting cussing behind that is one of
the biggest trunks in auto making it
goes on free yards one choice only on
the gearbox in this guy six-speed
Automatic drop back for sport mode over
into this gate for shifting mode you
have column mounted paddles I normally
love these because I like my paddles to
be in the same place however I Drive
down here not up here because I did
driver training couple decades ago but
there's nothing to reach for shifting I
want some little ears that come down now
the engine is quite a thing in the
Bentley Continental GT
it's a w12 that's a Volkswagen thing
it's sort of like a v8 with an extra
bank of cylinders nested in there it's a
brute we're talking about 567 horsepower
516 foot-pounds of torque
thanks to that twin turbos like 12
cylinders wasn't enough 0 to 60 is 4.4
seconds that's impressive enough but add
in this fact this car weighs 50 100
pounds the last man that moved you
weighed less than that the mpg is the
downside 12:19 when your grandma's
driving probably single digits when
you're
or try the new engine option in this car
the four liter direct injection
twin-turbo v8 they uses cylinder
deactivation direct injection and an
8-speed automatic to get you much better
mpg 1524 while delivering 500 horsepower
487 foot-pounds of torque and 0 to 60 at
tick slower at four point six now
driving the Continental GT is like going
to dinner with dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde
in Drive every day driving going back
forth to work or whatever it's kind of a
bore it's a big old barrage of a thing
and feels all 5115 of its pounds but
then put it in sport mode or better yet
shifting yourself dial in that
suspension to a sporting setting and
stand on it and this car pulls a Jenny
Craig I swear to god it loses 2,000
pounds and it turns in really nicely
because I think I forgot to mention its
all-wheel drive one thing it doesn't do
is get rid of its body lean this car has
a lot of body roll but luckily it's got
a lot of tire as well and a lot of power
to get all four paws crawling you out of
trouble now the kind of power this car
delivers and if you're really stand on
it it's unbelievable
is not the most responsive kind of power
it's big displacement although it is at
12 that means that the cylinders are a
little more responsive than if they were
large in 1/8 but there is some turbo lag
in there and generally speaking some
thinking lag as all those sensors and
processors figure out if they really
want to do what you just asked them to
it's amazing that you can throw a car
this big and this heavy through turns
this hard and come out with a shiny side
up but you're never given a stake in for
a sports car
okay let's price the Continental GT
because I know you like me you've got
200 grand laying around to go spend on a
car that's what it costs about 195
something based but 3,000 of that is gas
guzzler tax 2600 his destination chart
now the options it'll take you seen that
style the name audio system is about
seven grand
I'm already skeptical but I'm definitely
gonna skip that option on the check
sheet because I'm not going to hear it
when the seat coolers are on then
there's the $4,100 convenience package
now we're talking that's going to get
you adaptive cruise control that kind of
cool little privacy handset phone thing
and the valet key
