and it's like no blackberry that's come
before there's no physical keyboard no
blackberry operating system just a super
thin super light phone that runs Android
6.0 in fact blackberry didn't even make
this phone it's actually an Alcatel the
only major difference is instead of alka
tells classy glass back you get this
dull gray plastic ouch
still Alcatel makes a pretty decent
phone this $300 handset isn't as snappy
as my galaxy s7 but for the money it's
not bad it's got a cool programmable
button to quickly launch any app you
like and stereo speakers that still work
when the phones face down but why not
just buy the Alcatel instead of the
BlackBerry software perhaps but I can't
say I was all that impressed with any of
BlackBerry's apps I don't know about you
but my friends don't really use bbm for
messages anymore the BlackBerry keyboard
is a little sluggish too and not great
at predicting my words I've got to admit
the BlackBerry hub is cool letting me
answer all my emails tweets and slack
messages in one place but you'll get
duplicate notifications unless you tweak
a lot besides you don't really need a
blackberry phone to get the BlackBerry
hub anymore and don't get me started on
BlackBerry's claim that this is the most
secure smartphone ever Android
marshmallow phones already come standard
with full disk encryption and they
already make apps ask for permission
before they pry into your life
so BlackBerry's dtek software is kind of
worthless also this super secure
smartphone doesn't have a fingerprint
sensor go ahead look for it so there you
have it the blackberry detect 50 for
$300 it's a pretty decent phone but I
probably buy something else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
