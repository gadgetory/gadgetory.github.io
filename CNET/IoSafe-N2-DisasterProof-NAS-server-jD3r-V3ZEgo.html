ask me what I should bet on as a bet on
this and maybe you should too and that's
because this is a waterproof fireproof
Nass server from IO safe now this a do
on base server re on inside as two hard
drives as me you can set up in red one
to protect it against a single hard
drive failure the question is how do you
actually get to the drive there's a hex
rival right here and let's see how I do
this it actually easier than anything to
open it and there you go here is the
drive door and it's feel like that a
revoked and this protect the drive from
the extreme heat up to fifteen fifty
degrees Fahrenheit and on the inside
here there's another layer of protection
and this poor take the driver inside
form water and you can see here a su
drive on inside that can be replaced by
you now the device really really heavy
but that's good thing because it make it
harder to be stolen or the chain of you
dropping on yourself is very low now if
you look around here this is the booth
of semiology the question is what is an
outside right doing here in a booth of a
different company and that's because on
the inside is powered by Synology nas
offering system and that's a very good
thing because in my experience synology
is one of the best if not the best when
it comes to network storage that's set
this device right here offer you the
best of both wore the most protection on
the outside from our safe and the best
feature on the inside form synology now
i haven't had a chance to witness how
this one we stand disaster but over here
there's one that's being done and you
can see that the driver inside should be
saved from fire or water now my guess is
this Soviet going to give you great
performance but make sure you check back
at the show for the full review once the
game is don't go and this has been a
very brief look at the brand new Nath
server from Iowa safe n 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
