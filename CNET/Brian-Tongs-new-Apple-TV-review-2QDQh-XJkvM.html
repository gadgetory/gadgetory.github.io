the Apple bite it's everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple and we
know some of you have been able to play
around with a new Apple TV and some of
you are still waiting to make a decision
on it so let's see what the Apple bytes
best product reviewer thinks oh thanks
Brian ok guys so check this out this is
my quick review of the Apple TV really
the things I like and dislike about it
so let's start off with the likes number
one the UI and the touchpad interface
are smooth it's buttery I love using the
remote navigating around it feels really
tight and it looks fresh and new that's
one of the things that I love about the
new Apple TV secondly the potential of
the App Store now it's not there yet
but we've seen apps like QVC which
really gives you an interactive TV
experience then you have games like
jetpack Joyride and Crossy Road this is
just the beginning but this is really
like having an iPhone connected directly
to your TV set and then thirdly I do
like the Siri search you can drill down
into TV shows and movies by actor by
genre by the year that the movie was
made that's really cool but then if we
transition over to the flip side of
things I dislike Siri is great but it
doesn't work across the entire OS Apple
says it's coming to Apple music in the
future but they really need to make it
work with everything that the Apple TV
has to offer
and then of course Apple's walled garden
really restricts you from getting other
content from great things like sling TV
for a TV subscription or for Amazon you
can't do that because Apple is really
controlling its own ecosystem that's
always going to be a negative and then
thirdly this does feel a little rushed
and what I mean by that the Apple remote
app on iOS devices isn't compatible with
the Apple TV you have the podcast app
where people subscribe to podcasts audio
and video that normally syncs to iTunes
that's not currently available on the
new Apple TV and then also Bluetooth
keyboards where you would use to search
and type in your credentials that's not
compatible right now so although I do
like the Apple TV it does feel like it's
a little pushed out there earlier
instead of polishing up those minor
things overall I do like the Apple TV I
love the new UI
I think the app store potential is going
to be huge and if
you're in the Apple ecosystem this is
really a nice upgrade for you and it's
only going to get better so there you
have it thanks Brian in you know what
sometimes shirt you've got thanks Brian
and you know what you got pretty good
taste yourself all right in other
tidbits for the Apple TV it's already 3d
compatible out of the box games from
Pangea software like bug dumb and nano
sore are already working in 3d you'll
just need to turn on that feature with
your 3d compatible TV but the actual
games have to be made to support it now
Pangaea is offering a developer tutorial
for adding 3d TV support so that's
pretty sweet alright some of you have
complained to me that Siri on TV OS
doesn't work in your country yet and you
know what you're right it's currently
limited to 8 countries on launch because
it needs to be trained for more accurate
pronunciations with a wide range of TV
shows and movies out there now we know i
OS supports 15 different languages and
over 30 countries apple says TV OS
support for more languages and countries
is incoming but they didn't have a
specific timing for availability and the
official Plex app is now available for
Apple TV giving its loyal users more
media streaming options with their plex
media server ok a 9 to 5 Mac report says
Apple will start selling the new 12
point 9 inch iPad pro on Wednesday
November the 11th Apple's retail staff
is expected to finish their iPad pro
training on the 6th with the Apple
pencil and keyboard case also being
available on the 11th as well now see
that's just a week away and yes I am
excited for it the Apple pencil will
also now ship with an adapter which will
allow you to charge it using a standard
lightning cable according to
nine-to-five Mac the adapter will fit
over the end of the pencil and it's also
the same side that would go into the
iPad pro so if you wanted to you know
hold it up like a protest sign you could
still do that and in the latest iPhone
rumors KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi
Kuo believes Apple still has a 4-inch
iPhone that resembles the iPhone 5s in
the works the phone is expected in the
first half of next year with an a 9
processor but will not have the latest
3d touch now Kuo also says the iPhone 7
yes we're talking about it based on this
report will come with an upgraded a10
processor and Apple will differentiate
between the two screen sizes with the
4.7 inch model having the same two gigs
of ram while the larger iPhone 7 plus
we'll have three gigs of ram again this
is all rumor and speculation but kuo has
had some pretty reliable Intel in the
past and the US Patent and Trademark
Office granted Apple a patent for a low
travel keyboard design that uses force
touch like sensors to measure the
pressure place on its keys the patent
details how the keyboard would have a
switch list keyboard mechanism that
would help cut down on the height by
removing physical switches that are on
current Apple laptops this would also
help make their MacBooks even thinner
and we know how obsessed Apple is with
making things as thin as possible but
users would need to get used to losing
the tactile feedback they get from a
traditional keyboard this doesn't mean
Apple is planning on implementing this
but it's where Cupertino is thinking is
that and if you want a little piece of
Apple art from iconic painter Andy
Warhol start saving up now so the buys
or Sotheby's or so khabees I know what
it is we'll be auctioning off a
contemporary Macintosh painting from
Warhol featuring Apple's old rainbow
logo placed between the words Apple and
Macintosh the acrylic and silkscreen
canvas painting will start at a measly
two hundred eighty thousand dollars and
is estimated to receive between four
hundred to six hundred thousand US
dollars at auction like I said start
saving all right that's going to do it
for this week's show you can send me
your questions and comments to the Apple
by that cnet.com or tweet me at brian
tom thanks so much for watching we'll
catch you all next time for another bite
of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
