one's brand new Mac Mini may not be
looking so good I bet you're wishing you
went with a bigger hard drive where that
has filled up or simply died
there's no Gnaeus spend your hard-earned
cash buying a new model or paying
someone to swap out your faulty one I'm
dan Graziano and I'm going to show you
how to replace the hard drive in Mac
Mini models from 2005 to 2009 the Mac
Mini is like Apple's forgotten stepchild
the company redesigned the small
computer in 2010 adding some new ports
along with a removable cover that gives
users quick and easy access to the
memory and hard drive while the process
to get inside is a little more difficult
for older models it's nothing you can't
handle to get the job done you'll need
to their paint scraper or a putty knife
a small Phillips head screwdriver a pair
of tweezers and a replacement 2.5 inch
hard drive or solid-state drive
I also recommend picking up a can of
compressed air to clean away all that
dust that has been building up all these
years make sure to work on a static free
surface like this wood table and to
discharge any electrostatic build-up
before handling any internal components
you should also transfer your old data
to a new hard drive by using a program
like time machine or superduper the
cover on the Mac Mini is held in place
with small clips that must be dislodged
with the putty knife gently shimmy the
knife in between the cover and the case
while slowly working away around the
devices for edges once the clips on
three sides are dislodged you can lift
up the cover on the inside of the device
you must remove three antennas the two
on the left simply lift out while the
larger one the right is held in place
with a small clip that must be squeezed
from the bottom to be removed under each
antenna or springs don't lose these as
they're required for reassembling the
device for now simply place them aside
for screws which can be found here here
here and here
must be unscrewed to remove the CD drive
before you pop the drive out be sure to
detach the ribbon cable using your
fingernail or tweezers the hard drive is
located on the back of CD Drive and is
held in place with four screws after
unscrewing them
the temperature sensor on the top of the
device then using the tweezers for help
gently lift the drive out of its socket
once it's removed don't forget to peel
the two anti-static cushions off of the
old drive and place them on your new one
then slide the new drive into the slot
replace the four screws and reattach the
heat sensor place the CD drive into the
case and secure it with the four screws
the three springs should be placed on
their corresponding antenna post
followed by their antenna themselves
also remember to reattach the ribbon
cable to the CD drive replace the cover
and push down evenly around the edges of
the device until it clips in for more
