industrial design the only problem is it
looks like every other MacBook to fix
that give it a little personality I'm
going to show you how to print your own
custom vinyl sticker that you can put on
the lid now the first thing you'll want
to do is find some artwork you're gonna
want something that's black and white
and high contrast now for the sake of
not getting sued by using someone else's
art I'm gonna use something I own which
is my bands logo a loja screwdriver now
to print this out onto adhesive vinyl
you're gonna want this this is the
Cricut
so I'll surround $300 and you can think
of it like a printer that prints with a
razor blade cutting out exactly the
shape you want into the vinyl now to get
started we're gonna sign into the Cricut
website and click on Cricut design space
create a new project and then click on
the button for upload image I'm gonna
upload my logo and then select simple
image next I'll use the Select tool to
erase the white areas in the background
leaving me just with the black logo and
then I'll save it next I'll place the
logo in the top left corner this way I
can use the ruler to scale the logo to
exactly the size I want when it looks
good you're gonna connect the Cricut to
your computer with the USB cable and
then hit go at this point you get a
preview and if everything looks right
hit go again if our next step is asking
us to load up our material in this case
we're using adhesive backed vinyl to
load this up first I have to put this on
the cutting board I'm gonna line this up
so it's nice and straight and we want to
squeeze out all the air bubbles and in
fact Cricut includes a little tool here
to help you squeegee these out you open
this up it's a little tool here used to
just flatten this out get it nice and
smooth and the whole reason you're doing
this is because you don't want any
wrinkles in your final design ready to
load up I've got it all perfectly
mounted on the board here smooth up now
we're gonna put this in the Cricut and
we're ready to go
hit the flash and Cricut button so right
now the instructions from the software
are telling the Cricut razorblade
exactly where to cut in the vinyl to
make the design that I'm telling it to
make
kind of reminds me of the old dot-matrix
printers so now I'm gonna need to peel
away the piece of the vinyl that I don't
want to do that I'm gonna use the little
cricket tools that come with the cricket
this one looks like a little dental tool
but it's perfect for getting inside the
letters and peeling away the inside of
the oh here the little bit inside the a
that I don't want transferred onto my
laptop lid get the inside of the oh all
right now and start peeling away the
background and this is where you got to
go really slow make sure you're not
taking the the logo with you or whatever
you're printing look at that now that
looks pretty awesome now for the next
step we're gonna use some adhesive
transfer paper to get this design off of
this cutting board and onto my macbook
cricut cells their own adhesive transfer
paper but I got this stuff called
frisket film for my local art store it's
gonna do just fine the trick is that has
to be sticky enough to pull the design
off but not so sticky that my design is
hopelessly stuck onto it
so there's my logo on the clear sticky
film
look at that now that is pretty cool
this is a macbook i can be proud of
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
