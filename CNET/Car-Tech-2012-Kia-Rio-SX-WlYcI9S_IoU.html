automotive business here's the ninth the
kia wields the all-nude REO we've got
the top trim the SX let's drive it and
check the tech now the inside of the REO
looks a bit like their upscale cars
they've got the chrome trim of the
sporty kind of shapes you definitely
don't get a downscale feeling but
remember we're in an SX with the top
trim that Premium Package also rolls in
a rear camera though I think you get a
rear camera optionally on the II X the
lower model as you can see it's a nice
clear rear image but there's no
trajectory projection just three
different distance lines and no fancy
camera angles as for the nav itself
we've seen this before it's a well
rendered if a little bit busy looking
system but it's got a nice easy-to-read
set of street names roads are pretty
well displayed so they're clear this car
does not have the UVO voice command
system which is one of they did with
Microsoft like the affected line instead
I preferred to jump here on the
old-fashioned buttons and just start
entering things with the touchscreen
which moves quite nicely by the way this
works while you're driving not that I
want you to be doing that but your
passenger can get on it and all your
other ancillary buttons for doing things
are nice and big and clear I like that
about this system now in terms of Drive
electronics in this vehicle you've got a
one choice only 6-speed automatic here
shiftable gate pretty garden-variety
stuff no paddles even on this sx sports
edition over here this button says
active eco that takes you in or out of
an economy mode where it really dials
back throttle response and generally
shapes the engine response curve to sip
gas what you don't have in this car is
the auto start/stop technology that
doesn't come on the sport model this SX
okay in our audio sources being a kia or
hyundai you've got this guy here this
aux USB right next to each other that
use a special cable that can go into
your iOS device or of course you can go
one or the other thumb drive or aux
cable AM and FM radio no HD radio on
this guy satellite radio is Sirius that
also powers the live traffic to the nav
system three months complimentary when
you buy a new one of these
optical disk is up here for your cd's
only you've got bluetooth hands-free but
there is no bluetooth streaming four
speakers is standard in a real and then
you get these two guys in the pillar for
a total of six these tweeters are SX
only a couple other touches we have in a
premium package which is where we got
the navigation system brings you this
power glass roof up here this push
button start stop leave it in your
pocket wireless key and these heated
leather seats now let's go check out the
engine bay
now under the hood here's a pretty good
example of mainstream modern engine
making circa 2012 a sub 2 liter engine
1.6 in this case in line for sidesaddle
driving the front wheels of courts
direct injection allowing them to get
138 horsepower and 123 foot-pounds of
torque out of this guy
2500 pound car gets up to 60 in around
mid 7s high sevens and that while
delivering 30 40 mpg for knees the magic
number if you hit that you're in a
special Club by the way if you get the
lower trim version the e^x you're going
to also have the auto start/stop
technology applied here but all the
gains U is 1 mpg city so it ok let's
take a little spin on our Kia Rio now I
try to cup with some headline for what
this car drives like and I couldn't it
just drives fine there's nothing bad
about it
nothing notably good about it it's not
terribly sprightly it's not terribly
sluggish the ride quality is not harsh
the ride quality is not amazingly nice
and it's a very nice compact car
visibility is actually quite good and if
that matters to you but there's a couple
things that I would call out that are
interesting that mpg number I'm at what
mid thirty one's right there that's
actually low when I was on a trip over a
lot of mountainous highways and shifting
it manually a lot I was around 33 34 I
couldn't beat the 30s out of this thing
it does really well in actual driving
fuel economy and that's a big part of
why you buy this car I did find that I
missed paddle shifters which I often
consider to be a gimmick but on this car
it rewards manual shifting when you need
to get a really significant response out
of it the only other note I would make
is that as you drive this car you don't
get the feeling you're in as inexpensive
a car as it is largely because of the
interior appointments on this SX trim
level they've really done a good job I
think for the amount of money they're
the extracting from your pocket oh by
the way taking off the Eco button didn't
make a big difference in my estimation
our behaves about the same way maybe a
little less sluggishly to get the high
MPG that it does it of course clings to
the highest gear compulsively
countenance
okay let's price our cheap and cheerful
2013 Kia Rio SX this is the top trim car
eighteen five
antwon's porkpie not included on top of
that you are going to get the Premium
Package or you're an idiot it's an
incredible value 2350 brings you
navigation rear camera push-button start
Wireless key power glass roof heated
leather seats are you kidding of course
you will</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
