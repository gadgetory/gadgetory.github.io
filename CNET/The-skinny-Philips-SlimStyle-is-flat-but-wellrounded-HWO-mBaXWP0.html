got a review of the Philips Slim style
LED and don't be fooled this is not a
pint sized ping-pong paddle this is a
light bulb it's got a unique design that
spreads the diodes out along the
perimeter of this kind of horseshoe
shaped body and that makes for better
heat dispersion and means that the bulb
doesn't have to rely on heavy aluminum
heat sinks because of that this is a
very light weight LED it weighs in at
just two point two ounces and that's
less than half of what you'll see from a
lot of other LEDs including Philips is
own standard 60 watt equivalent LED the
slim style puts out 800 lumens of light
from a power draw of 10.5 watts and
that's very good that gives it an
efficiency of about 76 lumens per watt
not quite as good as what you get from
the cree LED but still very nice another
thing I like about it is that it does
indeed seem to do well with heat we
tested over time to see how heat affects
the power output of these bulbs all of
them are going to drop off a little bit
in the first 30 minutes after you turn
them on as the heat cranks up its gonna
effect that power output slightly not
that noticeable it doesn't make it that
much dimmer but it still happens with
the Philips Slim style though it happens
a lot less if you look at this graph the
purple line on top there that's the
Philips Slim style you can see the power
and the brightness dropping off a couple
percentage points after you turn it on
all the bulbs do that but it flatlines
right about 93 percent and that's higher
than any other bulb we tested that means
that the heat is affecting it a lot less
now the translation for practical
purposes is that if you want to use this
bulb in a enclosed fixture you're
probably going to have good results
compared with what you might get from
other bulbs where that heat buildup
inside the enclosed fixture would affect
performance over time maybe shorten the
lifespan a bit you won't want to use it
with a dimmer switch though there are
better bulbs for that purpose that won't
buzz or flicker quite as much as the
slim style will you can pick up the
Philips some style 60 watt equivalent
for about nine dollars and at that price
it's a pretty good deal so if you like
this design or don't mind this design
maybe I say check it out we've seen that
I'm right Chris
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
