phone in the form of the V 20 and this
is it here let's take a close-up look at
some of this new camera features the
first thing to note is that on the back
of the camera are two separate camera
lenses one of them is a regular camera
and one of them is a wide-angle view
that the wide-angle camera has an 8
megapixel resolution while the standard
view has 16 megapixels so you'll get a
lot more detail from those shots there's
a wide-angle option on the front-facing
camera as well although in this one
there is just that one camera it
achieves a wide angle effect using
software rather than a lens but it does
mean that you can cram more of your
friends into your picture without having
to use one of those ridiculous selfie
sticks the rear cameras use three
different types of autofocus as well
there's laser autofocus phase detection
and contrast detection so really you
should be able to get crisp sharp shots
quickly whatever conditions you're in
videographers among you haven't been
left out either as the phone also has
optical image stabilization to keep your
shots nice and steady
and what about your audio well it will
capture sound in a lossless format for
better quality and there are three mics
as well to help capture sound in noisy
environments without distorting which is
great news if you like taking your phone
and videoing gigs that's about it for
the cameras from me but if you want to
know everything else about the LGV 20
then make sure to keep your eyes firmly
