the first floor in san francisco
california it's the apple byte extra
country podcast with your host mr. brian
Tong what up what up everybody welcome
to the show it is a new place a new vibe
a new feeling I'm looking around I don't
even I'm far away from steven i can't
see what what i look like like he
controls all the cameras i see nothing
this is episode 53 of the apple byte
extra crunchy again the show is all for
you if you want to call us and leave
your voicemails by the because i
mentioned it last week we had a boatload
of calls phone number is 1 800 61 62 63
8 that is to leave your name where
you're from and your comment question or
your bad apple get into it so we can
actually recall you guys are guys and
gals are still calling away too long
it's like way too long we have some
minute long call longer than a minute
yeah longer than a minute it's like get
to it but get to it so look this week is
the week really we're about four or five
days before apple's keynote that is
happening on sep tember the 7th that is
going to be this coming wednesday at ten
a.m. pacific time in san francisco at
the bill graham civic center is it the
civic center auditorium or is it to the
civic center i think it's the civic
center auditorium i believe so so we're
all amped about this this is an official
you know officially officially happening
after all these rumors and all this
weight and I've got to tell you right
now beach that the timing of what has
happened outside of Apple could not have
been more perfect yeah for them to have
this keynote next weekend for all of the
you going like oh I know what he's
talking about I'm talking about this
this note is on fire literally literally
on fire um you know it I'm not gonna say
it happens it has happened to ipods and
iphones in the past that are exploding
but they never did a recall they've
never done a recall because of the
number of cases it's been pretty minor i
mean we know that lithium ion batteries
have the potential to explode but from
what it appears samsung officially has
recalled
their entire flight of notes Evans up to
this point what they said is that there
were 35 documented cases up to this
point where notes Evans had actually
exploded that's over the amount of 2.5
million units sold up to this point and
so look there be no sorry see that
number again how many how many sold or
how many have exploded oh if you have
that I have that number for you 35 okay
that warrants a recall for sure you
might have a handful here there but this
is 35 out of and someone's like oh I
have 2.5 million but this is an issue
that can plague any company and my hunch
i have samsung is not revealed the
details of why it's happening if it's a
specific supplier if it's a specific
connector or chip or a factory that made
a certain batch of batteries that are
having a tendency to overheat we don't
know the specifics they have officially
state put out a statement for recall my
hunch is that and people that have used
the phone say it does get warm over time
but we have just what about how it's
just an amazing phone technically and
there's so many things going on with it
and I just wonder if that screen that
amazing screen that makes it so special
in combination with that battery has
just made the phone too hot over time
possibly I don't know we don't know
where were these batteries are
notoriously dangerous though I mean like
hoverboards just had a big up aboard low
battery I've actually had an iphone 3gs
the battery like expand inside oh yeah
so it was like three years old so the
phone like kind of bursts open right
yeah like I hopped open but it had been
turned off for a while I was having
problems with it you know it was more
than three years old and it been turned
off for a while and I turned it back on
and I tried to charge it yeah I'd like
expanded inside the phone and then it
was done yeah and so we'll wait and see
what happens the reason why this is
perfect timing for Apple come on let's
be honest Samsung has all the momentum
right now as of well as of today they
did or as of yesterday they did I mean
they're coming out with products the s7
phone built momentum then the note 7
really again technically feature wise
the best phone of 2016 and
ones like the iPhone you know whatever
we may or may not upgrade it well now
it's kind of looking like apples going
to be about least mentally
psychologically and from a marketing
standpoint kind of turn the tables
you've got to it believe they're gonna
say something about the batteries oh for
sure they're gonna have some little like
why some wit some little bit
wisecracking there about that but they
to me they can't because their products
have exploded as well like we just did
like a month ago or within a month we
had the guy that was on his bike and he
fell on his butt yeah and his battery
exploded on his leg because the impact
and went boom that's that's dangerous
that's know about that is dangerous so
um we'll see how this recall falls you
know comes into play they really have
are jumping on it now I'm just curious
of this story of this recalls gonna go
beyond a couple weeks or if it's gonna
be an issue with other products out
there that's gonna last more you know a
few months cuz you want to just nip this
in the bud if your Samsung yeah yeah
well well last week it's funny because
we were talking about iphone possibly
having the recall because the touch the
touch disease problems disease but it
makes more sense that this is dangerous
like fire causing fires and stuff so it
makes more sense that they would recall
it you know rather than the iphone
having a loose microchip yeah but it's
you know they can't apple also though
they can't go they can't go too deep
into samsung meaning apple had
antennagate okay yeah Steve Jobs said
you're holding the damn phone wrong and
then they issued cases for everyone okay
it's funny they they didn't have to do a
recalled at the time people were calling
for a recall an apple basically did
everything in their power to be like you
know what if we give people free cases
at least we won't have to recall the
phone and it won't be as bad and no one
has ever said Apple recalled phones
right you you want to do everything but
recall the phone quite honestly right so
Apple can't get diggin on them and then
with this whole touch disease issue
we'll talk about it later in the show
but there's a class action lawsuit and
we'll get into some of the details with
that who but people are like hey this is
not right either and we'll see how they
respond or don't respond because there's
a lot of people out of warranty that
have been left in the dust by that so
like we said perfect timing for Apple to
kind of swoop in this is that time of
the year where everyone's trying to
figure out what phone to get if that
note 7 was that
you know the ideal phone and now people
are gonna there's going to be a
percentage of people that say uh I'm
worried about it I'm going to maybe just
end up getting another iphone for a year
now hmm right there's going to be a
majority I'm not a majority a slice of
the segment of techies and people buy up
during the phone that are going to do
that now well do we know what Samsung's
doing like they're recalling the phone
where they're going to replace it or
give you a new battery are they just
taking back the phone and get they said
they're gonna replace said they will
replace the phone okay with a different
is gonna have a different battery in a
problem well whatever back yeah whatever
they identify we really just don't know
they have not specifically outlined the
plans of the recall the details of which
models are affected or not they're just
saying we're doing a recall so we'll
just have to keep posted on that but it
does affect the overall Apple story now
let's look back at this invite though
this is the fun parts that we like to
decode the Apple invites so for those of
you watching that don't have access to a
computer if you've seen the apple invite
it's a lot of blurred out kind of
background lights with a black
background that um form the shape if you
don't have eagle eyes like like btz does
can you can you identify that shape
Beachum I don't come on come on don't
see a shape okay what if I did I see
when I when I this is what I think I'm
gonna see when I die just like yeah it's
like disintegrating what if i told you
that is the top of the apple logo can
you see it now oh yeah yeah i see yeah
see all right eagle eyes okay nice one
up on you now there's other Apple always
likes to bury hints within their invites
and we've heard a lot about this chatter
about a DSLR like dual lens camera
system coming to the next iPhone okay so
you can see that blurred out effect with
the lights in the background that's what
is referred to as the bouquet effect
bouquet bouquet is that what you throw
at weddings know the no I throws at
weddings and see a lot of people are
getting mad because like people
mispronounce you know do not pronounce
this properly there's plenty of
mispronunciations like bouquet bouquet
it's supposed to be from what I gather
bow k bouquet you guys can correct me on
that but uh because the way everyone
knows like the whole jif gif 88 here at
there are plenty of the tomato tomahto I
mean even that's been a life that's been
that's been a lifelong debate so that's
that effect is specific to DSLR cameras
shallow depth of field being able to
blur out parts of the image by using a
DSLR lens that's another hint but look
if you look carefully there's also these
like two like white dots kind of like a
little off left center you see that on
the logo yes yes could those could that
mean there's a dual lens camera lens
camera yeah we're really digging too yep
is that a reach or not is that a reach
now you know you're not reaching it
could be possible they always tried it
you know do something funky with this
and then in addition the invite is dark
black so everyone's talking about hey
maybe low light photography low light
photography yeah Beachum is not buying
beef is not buying any of this I just
you know it's funny it's funny how
people parse this it's an invite it's
it's literally an invite and these are
people that have nothing better to do
with their lives like myself so again
the event will happen next week
wednesday we'll have our live coverage
live show it'll be a little different
because we're in this studio someone on
periscopes like bow k ka why I've heard
bouquet I'm gonna say but we're gonna
kabak wet it's not Boak wet we're gonna
let the internet decide this not us okay
we're gonna let the internet decide this
but just a few little quick nuggets
about the iphone 7 upcoming things that
we haven't heard yet and you're probably
just you probably want to throw up when
you hear about the stuff but i'm just
gonna run through them okay spec sheets
rumored spec sheets from away bulb lot
microblogging site have shown that the
iphone 7 will potentially come with 256
gigs of swords as the iphone 7 plus
booya according to the spec sheet we
already have heard rumors about the
minimum 32 gigs which is a good thing
finally after all these years but also
the details on the back of this again
rumored specs sheet have indicated that
there is going to be a light earpods
apples current headphones earpods with a
lightning connector okay so wired ear
pods but also there will be a lightning
to 3.5 millimeter jack adapter that is
supposedly allegedly included in this
box as well that's nice so hey they're
covering your butt's until you lose them
in you have to pay twenty dollars from
that's nice also just kind of set
reading the tea leaves Apple has been
granted product certifications
specifically for two new iPhones also
though for products with the name air
pods mm-hmm what could that be the
Eurasian Economic Union has approved
that and ear pods is also a u.s.
trademark that Apple using kind of the
shell company this fake company apply
for back in October so I've got to
imagine that we're gonna see the air
pods at apple's keynote well I mean what
do you think I hope so I mean I'm way
down you know like we already did the
whole dick uh you'll owe me a pair of
bluetooth headphones that didn't fit my
ears just in familiars either but yes if
they are the current ipod ear pods that
are bluetooth I'm sold see I will wear
them I'll get them I will use them as
well now here's here's another fun
little thing that we don't know what
it's how it's going to come together but
there have been these headphones that
were kind of showed off at CES this year
for the first time from a company called
Bragi okay they're called the Bragi dash
headphones and these are literally what
you would imagine wireless bluetooth
earbuds to be like with touch-sensitive
controls okay on the actual earbud so
not on these big knock you know these
cans that I have in my ears also the
ability to track your heart rate through
your ears okay that's cool well on bra
gi's Twitter account they announced that
they have big news sep tember fifth
which is monday of next week in
cupertino at 10am where and Cupertino is
the obviously the home of Apple
computers now everyone starts trying to
put these pieces of the puzzle together
I don't know it would make sense that
Apple has some sort of a partnership
with Bragi just because they're ahead of
the curve on this also at the same time
I always imagined Apple doing their own
headphones like it wouldn't is Yahoo
just gonna sell their headphones and
Apple stores why
where does Bragi come they have beats
where does Bragi come from it's so
random is it just for the Bluetooth
technology probably they're trying to
the design is very Apple right and my
hunt my hunch is that Bragi is kind of
leveraging the fact that the apple
keynote is happening on the Wednesday
they're playing up to the hype and that
they'll announce maybe that their
headphones will be sold in Apple stores
right like first major retail
distribution so Apple stores branching
out and just letting they sell other
products right like cases and stuff but
that never had fun other than beats no
headphone phones or other kind of
peripheral back in the day they used to
but you're right they kind of day for
what little time for a small time they
actually removed bows from their shelves
oh really yeah and then brought him back
because like everyone buys bows like
what are you doing what are you doing
Apple uh but maybe the other the other
thing could be what if they were in a
partnership or what if Apple is
acquiring Bragi to be basically the
in-house bluetooth headphones that will
become the air pots that's a possibility
as well that's cool I mean looking at
that video the design looks awesome the
design is slick yeah it's super sleigh
according to other reports leaked out
beats products will debut new headphones
alongside the iphone 7 on wednesday that
is pretty much assumed to be some sort
of beat headphones with a lightning
connection and then another little
tidbit is that the iphone 7 might have
we always talk about these colors of all
these phones it might again might have a
fifth color that they're bringing the
table deep blue is out which you are fan
of ah come on no deep blue till midnight
blue no midnight blue you my boy ah my
boy blue but they will have gold silver
space grey rose gold we all like rose
gold and a new glossy black according to
this leaked picture of SIM tray the
little sim tray slot gloss black sounds
cool I don't know I want to know what
the people think I'm just gonna let
people listening right now China was
what would be their favorite color from
those five I mean what I like the gloss
black honestly well as as a person who
always wears black t-shirt I'm probably
gonna roll with the end black shoes yeah
gloss black is probably gonna be mice
well well well I thought your rose gold
Beecham no way
I've been like okay you know how lame i
am I've been like trying to find the
right pair of kicks that could enable me
to come up with some sort of a rose gold
ensemble that doesn't look too fruity
that looks cool not fruity uh-huh not
that there's anything wrong with that
but you know rose gold is it's an
interesting color it is cool yeah you
know I have to give you props though on
your Sphero Jedi yeah a costume that you
wore you have the right shoes for that
too i saw i was noticed your shoes you
like those shoes yeah you know you know
you did you know what she was those were
no but I know there there was probably
some really high end high adidas ultra
boost baby people that no shoes no
adidas is just wreck in the game all
right we're not going to talk about shoe
sponsors because we have a real sponsor
yeah that's a part of a show let's just
take a little moment to thank our

right I will tell you when I listen to
the show just a critique it last week it
sounded very nice when we did that okay
good one of the joys word i can't read
i'm like i'm reading this is amazing
okay more stories and scoops this is
going to be important for all of you
that are wondering what's happening in
the future of the Apple lineup if we're
talking about macbooks and iPad pros an
Apple watch obviously we are expecting
to see the apple watch too at this event
there's been some leaked images of a
thinner actual screen for the Apple
watch but a thicker larger battery which
pretty much lines up if we just kind of
quickly wrap this up an Apple watch too
with no LTE chip so that means it is
still going to be dependent on our phone
which is the big bummer but Apple tried
to make that the big innovation for this
next one they said the cellular chips
available today would not allow them to
maintain enough of the battery life for
the device that they wanted so this
phone this Apple watch excuse me will
only come with a GPS chip which is still
cool so you can eliminate a you know
your phone at least for gps tracking if
you're running routes or trails but also
have a better waterproofing faster
processor and better battery life and of
course we're most definitely gonna see
new watch band so I'm I'd the biggest
for everyone that has listened to me the
biggest part about the new Apple watch
order the current Apple watch is gonna
be watch os3 watch shows uno watch this
dos tres oh that's the bigot that that's
a game changer for the Apple watch so I
it sucks because I got a review these
products beach him like should i buy
another Apple watch I don't know I was
here I was I was so tempted the other
day because I don't know if anyone
follows a cheapskate yeah but there was
a deal when 99 yeah I work for Apple
watch which is really good deal do I
deserve this yeah and I think they sold
out really yeah that's why I think
that's why I had them for 190 even for a
limited time I thought someone asked me
about it and I said yeah do it that's
what that's worth it yeah 194 a current
Apple watch with a new watchos trace
watch those threads what thoughts traits
you got to do it uh looking down the
road what's coming in october i was
under the kind of thinking that we'd see
ipads and macs together
the October event and yes Apple has done
back-to-back events in the past but what
I want it but what I think is happening
is that well not what I think what
Bloomberg the thinks and what other
people are saying is that we're only
going to see macbooks and Mac upgrades
in general in October so according to
the report mark Gurman and company new
macbooks and iMac and get this a new
apple display are expected they're
working on right now but at least a
majority of these products will be
announced in October apple's mac book
pro right with the oled touch bar we
have talked about this a bunch it's that
OLED bar that's kind of replacing your
row of function keys it will morph and
change and adapt different button
commands depending on the app you're
actually using that will be a part of it
also a new macbook air laptop with USB
sea ports that are more multifunctional
in addition they say that there will be
an imac a new imac but that you'll have
an option to upgrade its graphics card
with a and with an AMD graphics card
that'll be kind of one of the bill to
order options that makes it different
but the big thing is LG and Apple have
been according to this report working
together and collaborating for a
standalone 5k monitor Wow a 5k apple
display stay with me 5k apple display
nice a lot of people been calling us and
asking us like what's going on with the
display so that's good news for them
yeah so with all that Mac action and
let's not forget one of the key elements
of this working is something that ties
it all together our good friend Mako's
Sierra haha I gotta give the answer
handsome like a music thing you know
machal see we can work on that yeah I
know what we'll figure it out so where
does that leave the iPad according to
this report as well the iPad may roll
out new software features this would
include enhancements that are part of
the current iOS 10 but specific to the
new iPad it'll have improvements to the
Apple pencil which allow it to do
handwriting I mean you know not allow it
to do handwriting it already can but
it'll be aimed more towards
professionals in addition allowing users
like ourselves to
annotate objects and be used across
multiple core applications kind of like
a what the note does before it exploded
so I'm just kidding guys come on don't
don't get all mad don't get your panties
in a bunch when I say that so we'll see
how that plays out also the new iPad
hardware that is believed to be working
on and will be released next sometime
next year not this year would include
faster display technology that would
allow for smoother zooming panning and
scrolling but again according to the
report they're not expecting to update
the iPad this year but instead next year
and we've heard also rumors of three
different iPad sizes potentially next
year the current 12.9 a new 10.5 inch
and then a 9.7 inch and no talk of a
mini oh no talk of a mini to speak I
quite the bike how was the mini now I
feel like it's about before the since
they've updated it I feel like it's been
here two or three years maybe more like
to I mean from a form factor standpoint
nothing's like significantly change I
feel like it's like around two years but
don't quote me on that alright so we
will see but that I'm not saying it
makes me feel better because I didn't
want to buy another iPad this year well
after I was screwed from a true tone
display four months later ah this make
just make you feel bad yeah I don't you
feel icky I hate I went through it man
you went through it you felt my ipad 3rd
gen ipad 3 jay-z yeah so we'll see what
happens um we also want to follow up on
the touch disease lawsuit that is now in
play right this is the touch disease
issue where there has been from I fix it
they documented it in detail how
specific chips internally in the iphone
6 integrated circuit chips a become
loose over time and prevent the touch
display from working after we reported
about this and we kind of piggyback on
what other people are talking about
let's be real everyone's talking about
it now I can't tell you how many tweets
people said oh my gosh my iphone 6
stopped working it was out of warranty
and ended up going back to my 4s Wow I
had at least four or five people men
in something along those lines where
their phone touch screen stopped working
and they ended up have and because it
was out of warranty instead of buying a
new phone they ended up going back to
the previous phone that was even some of
her co-workers right oh yeah it Mitch
had it happened one of our co-workers
had it happened to his phone twice ah so
a lot of people are now like hey two
years coming around my iphone screen
stopped working perfect timing Apple
well there has now been a class-action
lawsuit filed by three people in three
different states you can also jump on
board to join in on the class action
lawsuit but it's very early right now
but this is for the touch disease or
what Steven beat him and I
affectionately called last week the
iphone 6s TD I forgot about that he did
is pretty spurt hey everyone everyone
should forget about them okay um and
then finally another story just to kind
of wrap up on some of the I don't want
to say trouble but controversy Apple is
dealing with the European Union earlier
this week hit apple with a 14.5 billion
dollar tax penalty ruling that its deal
with Ireland was illegal now this is
what has happened and Apple is not the
only company that does this a lot of US
tech companies have benefited from
basically stashing boatloads of their
cash overseas so they won't have to be
taxed on it they're trying to basically
avoid paying the hefty taxes that they
would face if they brought all this
money from you know their multiple
countries that they have sold products
in if they brought that money all the
way back to the US I think the penalties
or the not the penalties but the tax
rate is high as something around like
thirty five percent in the US Wow so
Apple made a deal specifically with
Ireland to stash their cash their other
again other tech companies have done
this and in return it's kind of like a
friendly deal that apple would then also
help create jobs or provide jobs for
people to to work right in Ireland in
Ireland now the European Union has
decided to sweep in on this with this
ruling but quite honestly if you look at
the specifics of this although your
in Union want you to step in here it's
not big right now the way that the laws
are written technically technically
apple and these other companies have
done nothing illegal now I wonder if
this has anything to do with brexit just
have to do with brexit like by light I'd
honestly could not tell you if there's
any kind of feels like before we break
away from the European Union you guys
better pay up real quick you know get a
get a somewhat get us some of that dough
so Tim Cook is pretty calm confident in
Apple's position this is not something
that's gonna get resolved in with
overnight it's going to be a long
process is gonna take you I was like
Jerry appeals on appeals was picturing
lawyers mobilizing you know like getting
their suits on like you know like Batman
like montage just team of lawyers
getting ready for the briefcase yes the
iPads like times you know everything's
like really intense yeah they're there
they're ready the lawyers are the ones
that are gonna get the bit the best out
of this whole thing maybe like two years
for a trial between the EU and Apple
I'll take that money cachinga chinga
Chang jjjjj so I'm Tim Cooke in 800
words statement said that does ruling is
disappointing but Apple is confident in
their appeal and the process may take
several years to get resolved but uh we
will see how that all plays out and
before finally before we get to our
awesome voicemails from all of you and I
will try and scan some of the questions
that you guys have shot out to us on
twitter at brian Tong not trying to get
followers trying to get questions but
you can't follow me after I on top it's
a good metric that I can use um Apple is
finally re reactivated it's Twitter
account okay okay okay yeah yeah I got
it right here no no it's fine i mean
look know it why did why are they why
are they anti Twitter so here's the
thing they created this account in 2011
I remember when they first created this
account I follow them and they didn't
say squat it was just like this oh we
have this twitter name or maybe they
figured I remember always trying to you
would sometimes tweet and be ad like at
Apple but then it was actually there was
nothing there it was like no one or it
was at the time I can't remember if it
was like someone else if I got there
goes timeline it's so full of tweets
yeah so yeah so right now this is crazy
there right now
timeline has literally nothing no no not
a single tweet so I threw out a poll on
my Twitter let me see if I can pull it
up because uh I was just curious and I
want to you guys and gals to help us out
and be like what do you think what do
you think is the first tweet that Apple
puts out like what do you think I'm
trying to find your your tweet it's it's
like three or four tweets down just go
to uh we go to twitter.com / brian Tong
i remember remember that remember that
everyone brian Tong just kidding i don't
care i could have four followers i don't
care so is it a pole yeah it's a pole so
I said what will Apple's first tweet be
either a Hello be good morning three the
apple store is down or four we don't
explode dot dot dot as much so I'll let
you all jump in on that pole based on
the current results 703 votes forty-one
percent have voted for hello seventeen
percent have said good morning eighteen
percent apple store is down twenty-four
percent we don't explode as much mmm
very nice but then of course we always
have like different people that want to
contribute and I love this about the
internet cole says Skynet is live they
won't say anything like they will not
Kareem says don't get burned by buying a
galaxy note 7 come on oh we could do
better this a lot of people are like
hello world that's kind of like a
classic you know hello introduction so
generic nowadays something from do you
think it'll be Seri maybe it'll be Seri
that says the first thing who knows I
forgot what was the firt what was the
first computer that said hello world I I
can't it's out Watson it sounds really
stupid for me to say that but I know
someone's gonna be like duh hello world
was first on this like IBM blah blah
blah like that was the first you know
like words a computer said whatever you
guys they should quote um what's her
name the beetles woman who was married
to the beetle Yoko Ono yoga owner they
should quote Yoko Ono what she says
hello earth how are you oh no she said
people of Earth how are people of Earth
how are you eva is this this is a note
this is on your twitter feed
guys at the note 7 right there oh yeah
its pants on fire it is I just found
that amusing I know yeah it is it is
nice okay um let's get to the calls i
will talk about our little apple TV
giveaway for everyone that's watching we
do have an apple giveaway it's a
sweepstakes it's done by the apple byte
and cnet it's apple.com apple byte
sweeps so don't do it sorry it's cnet co
did I say I see Nicole / Apple Apple by
sweeps okay that's it then I don't think
it went to the right place it's okay
don't worry either way we're giving away
to Apple TV's to brand new spanking
apple tv's and that's all i wanted to
say to make it worth your time if you're
still like a guy what do you guys talk
about this is lame okay so we get two
voicemails yes yeah right we've got a
good we've got a good batch from yells
got some good voicemails thanks guys the
first one comes from heavy stuff heels I
think that's his name okay it's hard to
hear but let's let's see what he has to
say I got to turn this up here we go hey
Brian and beach Danny beer AK heady
stuff here from Orlando Florida with all
the controversy surrounding the mission
of the headphone jack on the iphone 7 i
started thinking about the durability
and longevity of using the Lightning
port I personally don't think it's
better in this regard what do you guys
think excellent show and thanks for
keeping it real right we like to keep it
real here and in the question just over
about the durability of the Lightning
port uh nope we'll see what happens it's
gonna be frayed within six months it'll
be the cable connection yeah yeah I mean
unless they make that dongle like
industrial strength the Ghadir yeah the
I've got imagine there's gonna be a lot
of issues more with the cable than with
the actual port the port has shown that
it's pretty much gonna be pretty durable
historically ever since they went to a
lightning port so I wouldn't worry about
that it's more about the cables yeah
definitely more worried about the cable
than the port like all of my lightning
cables are coming apart and I even like
shrink-wrapped some of them just to fix
them to like so they
last longer and it's still they still a
coming apart yeah it's right off you
next voicemail next call Shamar from
Hotlanta hey guys it's tamar from
atlanta just wanted to provide some
quick insight as to why a one-year
device as cell phone has a one year
warranty and you often sign the two-year
contract if something goes wrong with
that device within that two-year period
your carrier was supposed to come in
offer you a contract renewal and a new
device in order to stay on the service
so is it coincidence and now that iphone
6 is having its touch disease issues
right around the time iphone 7 is
supposed to become available just like
iphone 5 had is battery issues right
around the time i phone sixes come
available so whether it's just
coincidence or scumming business
practices i'll leave it to you guys to
make the call so i just wanted to drop
that quick nugget thanks guys what do
you think about the timing of how
historically sometimes when phones
batteries have started to die or be
faulty or now that we have touch disease
coming out right to around two years
before an iphone Oh incidents or no no I
I mean it could be coincidence but it is
not that he's not the only guy saying
this like we've all been saying this for
years like my phone starts to fall apart
after two years and that makes sense
because I mean we'd aren't handling our
phones and they we never turn them off
they're just on all the time we drop
them we do all kinds of crap to them you
know so it's hard to say it's really
hard to say I think it has to do with
just basically general tech durability
yes like any product you have look they
they can say these things last forever
but quite honestly from a speed
standpoint and then how they upgrade
operating systems and then just purely
the hardware itself typically you're
just gonna feel like oh man this is way
slower around the one and a half year
two year mark oh yeah this nurse get
sluggish we've seen this sure you can
say oh I hope my laptops for years fine
laptops maybe three years but I remember
for a while I would just sell my laptop
right when a new one came out on ebay
get the most value for it with the
applecare and then get a new one and
then you always like on top of the game
yes so
I think I don't think it's coincidence a
combination of just that's this way Tech
is these days yeah unfortunately and for
people that are like I can't hear the
voicemails it's because we're in a new
studio so that's just the way and it is
for the next few months so sorry very
sorry watch both watch the tears go live
and hang out on the YouTube yeah you can
allow you to bin live stream all three
of them on everything what are you doing
seriously okay drew from Philly checking
in well it's true but I'm from Philly
and I'd like to know if there's any
isn't going to be like any new updates
to the macbook pro or use MacBook Air
because it's not been completely
refreshed in a while thank you yeah
smart man asking about macbook pro
updates I think technically the design
for the macbook pro hasn't changed in
like over four years now wow like the
act the fundamental design hasn't
changed in over four years so we will
definitely see that and you know we
talked a little bit about the macbooks
earlier in the show but expect to see
big revamps for the pro this year this
if they don't do that do it they should
all be really shocked but we've been
expecting it for a while cool on one
last call he did not give his name here
he is hey let's go Brian a great show
watch it every week I'm just wondering
do you think that apple will come up
with a VR set in a year or two Thanks
what do you think about this Beecham
apple and virtual reality headset in two
years in two years that's way way too
soon i don't even too soon for app I
don't think so how long it took oculus a
long time yeah I think that we it may
not even be a VR headset per se it might
be like a combination of the movement
that you're starting to see now is a
combination VRA our headset that we've
heard in rumors from other companies
well right hollow lenses right now is
really an AR well as the bomb micro
cannot everyone's like they are honestly
who's played pokemon go still none of
y'all we're happy people what happened
to those 27 freaking seen at videos in
one week oh I don't see any more I'm
we were jumping on a trend man the vevo
the vivre I'm sorry I played it you like
you our Wars oh ma you got that blew you
away our two handed me a lightsaber I
firearm troopers I'll give you that I
that memory lives in my head is if it
was a real memory that I live I know I'm
look I'm a huge fan of the VR thing
everyone that knocks on it everyone that
I've talked to that hasn't used it once
they use it there like a kid I great
right that's exactly what I did I was
like I get it yeah yeah this is it this
is the future I can't it but the oculus
makes you sick so be careful with that
listen to the kids bro listen to the
goods bro I get it so uh from a
standpoint of Apple actually doing
virtual reality they've already said
that they are they all look at Apple's
general statement is we are exploring
these areas Tim Cook outright said that
they were at a their earnings report I
don't think it was this most recent one
but it was from 12 to earnings ago so
around six months ago again Apple's
trying to do a smart car are sorry a car
we don't know exactly what it is if it's
it could be at onimous vehicle we'll
find out Apple's checking out a rvr but
we don't know what they're doing we will
find out but let's just before we wrap
up the show like I think that coming up
with this keynote from Apple I have
always felt for a while now that at
least if you're an iPhone user who uses
a 4.7 inch screen and does not care
about the 5.5 inch screen yeah I have
felt that this is the this is arguably
the least exciting announcement for you
as a phone owner the least compelling
reason to upgrade for an iphone if
you're someone who does not use a large
screen phone and does not care about
having a DSLR camera I just feel like
why are you gonna buy one now and just
get the 10th anniversary phone I still
like coming back to that what Tim Cook
said there's gonna be stuff we cannot
live without so we knows we don't we
don't know so I'm hoping that they
really wow me because we have seen so
much stuff on the rumors like I think
the dual camera is going to be awesome
but for me there's no way that I'm going
to just all the send decide I've got to
have a 5.5 inch screen
just because of that camera yeah
definitely it's not a simple take care I
don't care I don't care about the
cameras already amazing enough it's it's
great right yeah it's great so I'm not a
professional well I am you are
professional you are professional
professiona professional photographer
but you know I mean we know that there's
rumors that the new camera on the
standard size phone I guess I should
call this down the 4.7 inch will have
optical image stabilization so that's
gonna be a big deal that'll be a nice
improvement enough but are you telling
me that it is enough to get everyone to
upgrade I know that it'll be interesting
to see interesting to see the numbers of
who upgrades and who doesn't this time
around there will still be tens of
millions oh yes but I'm just do you
think there's mean lines this time
they're all in line well people sleeping
I don't I sense there will always be
lines like that but even even with the
fact that i do reservation system online
I just don't see or feel the the same
amount of excitement i'm excited because
i always love Apple keynotes they're fun
like we just goof around oh we're gonna
go glass we're gonna have a blast
Wednesday yeah next Wednesday we will
cover it but I'll wait to see if Apple
can genuinely wow me and it's not
because of these rumors that have leaked
out I'm just curious what's going to
happen so we will see I know you all
will see I let's be honest my credit
card will be will be just sitting on my
laptop zama by so imma buy something I'm
gonna buy something so uh yeah let's so
we will see how it all plays out okay
