well here we are and Ferrari is first
all-wheel drive car a four-seater that
looks more like a wagon put on here
let's drive the Ferrari FF check this
out
ergonomically what is an FF it's a car
with four seats the back two of which
you'll notice are actually pretty
credible two doors of course ferrari
swears up and down they will never ever
ever make a four-door they're looking at
porsche when they say that a v12 of
course this is a very premium car for
Ferrari and a GT meant for long-legged
athletic touring not so much track use
and of course the thing you either love
or hate about it is this shooting-brake
design as they call it kind of a
hatchback makes a wagon with a cam back
cutoff rear lid it gives you a fairly
good cargo space in the back and flying
over all of this is an optional
panoramic glass roof perhaps the biggest
I've ever seen
I could actually sleep on that it
doesn't have any movement not till not
slide nothing but it does let in a ton
of light and supposedly only modest heat
because of a special hi-tech film
now the inside of the FF is a beautiful
cabin very kind of low slung and
sporting it matches what you'd expect
the instead of a Ferrari would be like
the first thing that draws my attention
there was an unfortunate thing this
ancient Chrysler parts being head unit I
think the last time I saw one of these
it was literally in a town in country
about four or five years ago it's not a
non functional unit it gets the basics
done but it does not befit the quality
of this car the map display is crunchy
it's also very small on the good side
though it's touch screen is
exceptionally responsive things move
quickly and it's voice command is
actually very quick as well it doesn't
need any connected services there's no
app support you've got real basic sort
of built in media here and a crunchy
looking map now let's get out of some
things that this car has that are unique
first of all over there on the
passenger's side
that's optional for thousands of dollars
I wouldn't spend the money but it gives
your passenger a look at your rpms trip
odometers mile-per-hour gear position
and all kinds of stuff that I guess
keeps them from being bored it's one of
the oddest displays I've seen in a
production car I would say something
otherwise for what's in front of the
drivers is a great driver's office in
the center a great big mechanical tack
on the sides all video-based gauges
either a digital or analog speedo on the
right and on the left you've got various
settings but primarily you're going to
look at your VD a your vehicle dynamics
setup which will change depending which
drive mode you're in
speaking of those drive modes that
brings us to the manettino the little
handle here on the steering wheel going
all the way from snow to wet comfort is
your standard mode then there sport or
hold it over on the stability off
position and it warns you it's all your
problem now start buttons are common
these days on the wheel not so much so
that's very Formula one stuff this shock
button doesn't change through all of
your different suspension modes the
manettino does that but this does put
you what they call bumpy road mode it
actually does soften things up you would
look at these think they're shift
paddles in fact the paddles are these
nice big magnesium guys behind here on
the column these are your turn signal
it's a Ferrari thing left and right it's
actually very intuitive not so much so
the horn
you can press here all day and all
you're gonna get
is an angry airbag the horns up here on
these little delicate buttons under the
leather and behind the wings of the
wheel to go with that Chrysler head unit
are the classic Chrysler fingertip
buttons when you operate my feel and not
sight they change track adjust volume
things of that nature over here on the
lower consoles more your drive control
are for reverse auto is putting you in
automatic mode the car doesn't
necessarily default to it as much as
most cars do and PS is some Italian for
launch control we've got a rear-view
camera in this car standard thank you
this little button here changes it from
normal mode to weird mode I'm not quite
sure what the value is and we have a
front camera on this car as well but
that's optional now let's talk about
these back seats here in the second row
it's a big part of this cars claim to
fame are they the real deal well first
of all these are full-size seats a
little dinky than 911 seats or something
the only downside is of course the cars
got a certain limited wheelbase and if I
sit behind my own adjusted driver's seat
as you can see I got a you know spread
my knees apart to let this thing sit
there it's a little cramped the Headroom
is great though and like I said the
seats full width and quite comfortable
oh you may have noticed this also behind
each of our headrests we have optional
integrated iPad minis they're quasi
integrated they're sitting in mice
leather holders on a strap on the
headrest
and they connect to power so they don't
run out of juice beyond that they're on
their own connection they don't talk to
the front head unit or do anything more
electronically magical than just this
now up here is a big part of the reason
you buy an FF because it's got one of
these beautiful Ferrari v12 I could just
look at this thing all day and not even
care how it runs but it does run the
numbers 651 horsepower 504 foot-pounds
of torque all that accomplished without
any turbos or superchargers it is a
direct-injected v12 with an
extraordinary piece of balance and
engineering art to it you're going to
hear it later and love it now it's a
front mid-engine they call it because
basically the entire engine rests behind
the front axle line helps to put the
weight where you want it and not hung
out here where it makes the car nose
heavy and want to plow through corners
now the power coming out of this guy
you'd normally expect goes to a
transmission right
there instead the transmissions way out
in the stern when you put it back there
it's called a transaxle and it's a
7-speed dual-clutch automated manual as
you might expect but because this guy's
all-wheel-drive which is one of its
headlines there's another little mini
transmission up here on the front of the
engine called a power take-off unit it's
basically a little two-speed gearbox
that runs just the front wheels from
time to time we'll talk more about that
we get on the road you're gonna get this
4,100 pound car up to 60 in a very quick
3.7 seconds so far nothing here under
the hood is disappointing except for one
thing the mpg if you care in a car like
this its 1116 figure you'll get 10 or 11
arrows the first thing you notice on the
road is that incredible exalteth sound
even before you pick up on the
performance it sounds like it's gonna go
fast and then it does
in comfort mode it's the most athletic
thing you've ever driven in sport mode
it's even more so what might surprise
you if you drive this cars are not this
massive kick of low-end torque the
minute you tip in on the front but the
power comes on smoothly and evenly for
so long does that lofty redline is not a
false promise dual clutch transmissions
are not always the most refined this one
absolutely is when you want it to behave
like an automatic you hit the auto
button put it in comfort mode and this
is a very refined boulevard cruiser and
then of course when you get into sport
mode drop it into manual shift mode
bang-bang-bang
it's like a Ginsu knife cutting between
the gears it's sharp and it's quick and
it just takes a flash now note about the
all-wheel drive in this car it's kind of
a all-wheel drive light or a helper all
at most it can send twenty percent of
torque to the front wheels that's it it
is often letting the rear end do all the
pushing and it just sits out until it's
needed contraction or cornering and
torque vectoring it only works in the
first four gears of the main
transmission and using its own two gears
and I never stop being surprised at how
well this car takes a set and dives into
a corner without a lot of weight being
thrown around or effort on my part other
cars may accomplish that by doing some
inside wheel braking or reducing torque
to certain wheels but this is just more
alive and active impressive for a
biggish car that has a biggish engine in
front of the driver
okay just for fun let's price our FF not
exactly in my price range maybe it's in
yours
that would be 298 thousand or so
delivered with a hefty destination
charge then you start to add the good
stuff that truly makes it seen that
style God love that panoramic roof hope
you like it $18,000 worth adaptive front
lights are a trivial mm that interesting
passenger displays a little over 4 grand
carbon-fiber steering wheel with those
ship lights almost 5 grand at a front
camera to the rear for 3200 upgrade the
audio to quantum logic for almost six
grand and integrate those two iPad minis
on the backs of the front seats for
$5,300 the pair and you thought Apple
charged a lot for those things all in
we're at nearly 350 and I haven't even
begun to pick up all the different sort
of exterior and interior customisation
options the ffs not just unique for
Ferrari it's a unique car with its
all-wheel-drive it's sort of gentleman's
express layout it's purebred v12 and
it's exquisite handle
