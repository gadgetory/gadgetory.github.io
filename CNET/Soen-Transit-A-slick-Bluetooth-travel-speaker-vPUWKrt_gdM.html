inside today's TVs and laptops and now
it's got its first standalone audio
product a slickly designed $200 portable
bluetooth speaker called the transit hi
i'm david carr noi and i'm going to give
you a quick tour of this product which
hit the market in late 2013 as you can
see the speaker has a trapezoidal shape
and one of its endearing design elements
is a retractable switchblade style stand
that springs out with a touch of a
button allowing you to prop the speaker
up at a perfect angle it also shifts
with a magnetic cover to protects the
front and sides of the speaker well is
it water resistant or ruggedized the
trend it seems well built it's finished
in the type of TPU rubber armor that
you'd find on an iphone case and as some
brushed aluminum trim that ups the
sleekness quotient I really liked its
look and feel in keeping with the
minimalist design the trends it doesn't
have much in the way of buttons or added
features it has a built-in microphone
for speakerphone capabilities but that's
about it there are volume controls and a
bluetooth pairing button unfortunately
it's labeled with an infinity icon as
well as it power switch an audio input
for non Bluetooth devices the speaker
charges via micro USB and is rated for 8
hours of battery life at moderate volume
levels that's about average for speaker
this size but some portable bluetooth
speakers in this price range
particularly the UE boom are able to
exceed that number for small speaker the
transit sounds quite good some of these
speakers can end up having a harsh edge
to them this one sounds pretty smooth
and well balanced decent clarity it has
two drivers and is described as being a
stereo speaker because with all these
super compact bluetooth speakers you get
little to no stereo separation if the
speaker has a short come gets in the
base department the l√∂wen actually
holds together pretty well at higher
volumes but the speaker just doesn't
have all that much kick to it and while
it plays pretty loud and filled my small
office with sound it sounded more
restrained when I took it to a larger
room like the room you see that I'm
shooting in here and all I like the
transit it's a really nice little
speaker the only problem is that for the
same price you can pick up the equally
slick and impressive sounding bose
soundlink mini as well as the UE boom
which offers even bigger sound and a
water resistant design it's hard to give
this speaker than not over those models
but as I said it's well designed and
worth considering i'm david carr no I
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
