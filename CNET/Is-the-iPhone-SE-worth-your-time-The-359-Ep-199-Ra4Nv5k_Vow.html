episode 199 359 podcast and apparently
everybody's grooving today yeah
what are we doing that for me well
you're not I get to be on the one before
200 yeah that's correct
everyone remembers that every baby
absolutely ship remember okay I see what
it is
slow Thursday I'm the opening act for
your - oh no no no no we've got we've
got Scott Stein on to talk about two of
his stories we're talking about the
iPhone se and why he believes it's the
third best iPhone in Apple's lineup yeah
come a surprising call given the success
out there we'll also be talking about
misfits new watch which is an Android
wear device that Scott believes is the
one of the best fitness watches out
there he'll explain why it could be yes
we'll talk about that and then lastly
we'll be talking about the efficient
body power suit which promises to give
you for a four-hour the equivalent of a
four-hour session workout session in
just 20 minutes
it's like electric stimulation sounds
dangerous it's like the hyperbolic time
chamber and Dragon Ball Z yeah except
extend the nozzle working like that at
all
terrifying no there's no time travel
involved with with this particular suit
so all right let's get started as always
if you have any questions leave them in
the comment section Brian will pick out
the best and we will get to them in 3
minutes and 59 seconds from exactly
three
welcome to the 359 where we talk about
the top tech news of the day and all the
other crap we want to throw in brother
Chang I'm Alfred Inge and with us is
special guest and our Apple authority
Scott Stein hello
he wrote today that he thinks the iPhone
se is the third best iPhone behind the 7
and the 7 plus somewhat of a
controversial opinion Scott why did you
make that call
I guess so well I looked at it and I
thought first of all then the se first
came out I thought was a good value pick
and it was pretty much the same under
the hood as the 6s - like 3d touch yep
which you know one uses and or most
people don't and now a year later it's
annoying that it's all as the same specs
except for the storage but yeah it also
means that if you're wanted by the
bleeding-edge iPhone for now it's the 7
but after that do you really want to go
success or do you want to go with a more
budget pick which basically has the same
internals right to me Mac sure makes
more sense to get it over a success a
year later than it did when it first
came out where you may say ok I want the
best with the biggest screen why hedge
the bet because the savings on the 6s
are not that great over the 7 and and it
doesn't I feel like if you're doing that
and spending all that money wait for the
8 or if you're ok with the 7 it's funny
over time I feel like the 7 is fine but
it doesn't have that many changes that
are that noticeable it's kind of like an
invisible update and so Alfred I mean
you you actually interested that see you
would rather get this then wait for the
8 yeah I'm a big fan of the sa I'm not
really into the whole bleeding edge
market right you need to have the best
phone possible and I think Scott's point
about it being a great budget pick is
what really wanted me over with it
especially he's right it has the same
interiors as a success but it's you know
got a much to me a much better form
factor right and now with the updates on
its you know storage that it just makes
it all that more enticing to me and plus
plus it has the headphone jack yes yes
all right and the battery life is is we
view more tests but it's all right next
up misfit is out with an Android wear
watch which got called one of the best
fitness watches available why well it
could be you know we haven't seen it yet
but I looked at a prototype before there
are a lot of Android or Watrous misfit
as one of the first this come aboard to
make a from fitness standpoint to make
an Android wear watch and if you look at
the specs in the price and one
99 it's got GPS it's got 50 meters water
resistance those are not that common on
the lower end pics and Android wear and
and misfit you know it's fully round
display and maybe misfits gonna take a
few more of their tips about how they
track Fitness and put it into it it was
an interesting entry into a space where
you don't really have like great hits
LG's watches that came out for Android
war two were not good and they were not
great and and they weren't even that
good for a lot of people fair and I were
talking about this before just in terms
of smartwatches like no it's there's
nothing exciting about these things
right no I mean Apple Watchers hung in
there and I think for what it does it's
fine it would be really nice to have a
better battery life but in the Android
wear space there's been no hero watch
you know there's been no great watch now
who knows what that's gonna be and
misfits got as much of a chance as
anyone at this point to stand out in
that market yeah it's so kind of wide
open because there just really is
nothing out there that's really that
sexier grab G+ I don't think a lot of
people even want tomorrow watches it's
not really like a booming market out
there no I think that's why Apple kind
of repositioned the Y Apple watches as a
fitness tracker too right it's not just
yeah it's not the core SmartWatch
SmartWatch experience with that it's
like it's what Fitness so you can play
pokemon go on it alright lastly if you
need an intense workout we don't have
time the vision body power suit promises
the equivalent of a four-hour workout
session in just 20 minutes thanks to
electrical muscle stimulation sounds a
little scary
what do you guys think it's ridiculous
so it's one of those things where
basically like just like not really
shocks but like vibrates your like body
so it's like working out all your
muscles right in that time but at the
end of the story there's like a research
that says look like we don't know if
this thing actually works on my chances
are probably doesn't yeah I don't want a
vibrating bodysuit I just know I nod I
just don't have time for that I've do
many other things to charge alright from
all these stories check us out on CNET
I'm dr. Chang I'm Alfred hang I'm Scott
Stein thanks we'll swing
I'm gonna take a shot at this name but I
apologize if I butcher Nehemiah as
asking when the iPhone 8 comes out do
you think there will be an se Edition as
well um so I wrote about that in the
piece kind of wondering about that I
don't think so I think this is probably
as good a time as any to get a budget
phone I don't think Apple's gonna be
interested in offering any sort of
attempt at a budget thing when the eight
comes out so in that sense it seems like
a safe time to go with the budget pick I
don't you know the question is your next
year older be another that's a year away
right is it your way and it's a weird
usually a once a year with iPhone so
it's like a little bit off cycle but I
think it's a better time than six months
into the iPhone 7 if you're gonna spend
that much money on the 7 at this point I
think you might as well wait through to
see what they have in the fall and as a
follow-up to that should Apple keep the
S II screen size but you know maybe mix
up the design sooner or later it's a
good question a lot of people like that
size see the shake-up but I don't think
that's gonna happen I think the fact
they're keeping it in that body allows
them to keep it as a cheaper phone yeah
they're basically using exact parts the
the manufacturing process that's already
in place helps them cut down it helps
them to cut down the cost and keeps that
phone at a lower budget rate I mean you
could eventually if your tournament you
know like a larger screen into a smaller
space by reducing the bezel like you
could go there bill exactly that would
take a design yeah
effort which we're not denied to know
into a budget though its biggest selling
point would be lost at that point yeah
say though it would be kind of nice and
or refreshing for phone makers in
general to put money into like smaller
phones that are nice like I know that's
not that we're in but you know they're I
really should be there are people out
there who want smaller phone I missed
that trend back when it was basically
let's make the smallest didn't like
thinnest phone possible and then it just
jumped in to help me the Zoolander trend
where's the tiny yeah phone that I could
pull out just maybe let me go with you
know give smart tech is that what that
was called that's the Motorola StarTAC
Motorola StarTAC sorry star tech that's
right even we have smart glasses and
stuff we'll have a little tiny phone I
got my um my iPod Nano today
it's a small clip one mm-hmm and I was
like man this was a phone this would be
totally awesome I mean like Millennials
telling you to make the phone the size
of a smart one no but you can't call or
anything you can't you can't on some
ensemble but you don't need a phone and
that's like a lot of talk I just wanna
like all right clip your phone dear so
just respect it right just take this and
then look at this look how cool this
looks oh my god look at this okay I'm
doing the rest awkward you're like an
reinventing wearable tech why is it
marked earring in the Bluetooth via
headpiece you get it right about mmm how
is that not happen yeah well the
Bluetooth headpiece could just be the
phone forget the phone
yeah of course that's terrifying amount
of like radiation right in your ear we
get worried about cellphones up what
Street bomb was in your ear what would
happen I don't know gonna be there soon
yeah yeah maybe it's already on my wrist
whatever I don't know I'll be implanted
well it will be human funds breaking off
the current topic for a second Assad is
asking will CNET be covering the Galaxy
s8 event no nope not at all wait there's
an event I've just taken a vacation next

entire stream in itself yeah so we're

the sa why shouldn't i it everything you
need to know come next week Wednesday
Wednesday mornings and there's already
stuff like Charlotte up can already went
out to Korea to talking about now no
well unveil that soon
spoilers spoilers let's
go back into the chat well se be able to
handle updates to Siri if gets
significant improvements
I don't think series like all that hard
to update I mean my 5s still continues
to get the updates to Syria that's like
extremely old I don't know how long down
the line you're thinking of like how
long are the iOS like update cycle is
one like they they get like taken out of
it what's like the last iPhone I always
10 yeah that's a good question yeah
gonna come in ready with that but
usually it tends to fall in like it had
been like a three year window but they
had extended that were phones are bring
support you know phones and iPads were
being supported but you tend to find
like for instance you know if you have
an iPad 2 if you know iPhone 4s that
stuff is you know out of the loop but um
but let me check I I need to actually
find out but I think that's part of the
reason why Apple decided to remove some
products from the lineup yeah like the
iPad Mini 2 yeah I think Apple is only
for updating the S II though I mean it'd
be like kind of dumb if they did it oh
it's going totally the update it I think
what's happening is it's it's a well it
is now like a two-year cycle piece of
hardware and then you would imagine that
the following year that there would be
an update to that yeah I don't know if
it'll be all that exciting I mean look
Apple does of a history of doing modest
updates to products and keeping them in
a very very long long tail afterwards so
if you think like it's gonna be due for
some sort of radical update probably not
just look at the MacBook Air or even
look at the iPad like I can see the s
age is kind of staying the way it is
with enough necessary hardware updates
for like but a fair amount of time but
what our viewer is asking is about
updates to Siri and that doesn't
generally come with iOS updates it's
just it's its own eyes yeah it it's not
as except it is hi guys what's up yeah
yeah it is tight like sometimes you
don't get all the features depending on
what version you have scorpy bud wants
to know should they add 3d touch and
water resistance to the iPhone se I feel
like that's pretty no-brainer really
yes every phone I don't think they'll do
it though
I feel like it's what our distance they
 water resistance there's a lot of
things that Apple should do that right I
just don't know if they in the
calculation of like how much money can
squeeze out of these phones yeah it's
really worth it to add those features
and they definitely want to like
maintain some separation between the
seven or like their flagship phones and
the se right like if you want certain
things you're gonna need to pay up but
at a certain point I'm starting to think
that like water resistance is gonna be a
standard for like pretty much every
device but yeah take a few years to flow
down Samsung a handful of phones
exactly yeah it's only high-end models
that water resistant feature hasn't
really flowed down but my idea is I like
it's like enough people are gonna have
these devices that it's gonna get to a
point where it's you know it's a
make-or-break fact or like if this phone
isn't water resistant I don't think I
would right I don't think we're there
yet I think water resistance for other
Western customers it's like one nice to
have but it's not a most interesting way
in Japan like basically every phone is
water yeah yeah it's like it is a make
or break option there but it's it's been
like that for years how could that be so
what does do people before the iPhone 7
in people in Japan just not have iPhones
then or the lot of them chose other
phones now Sony actually did pretty well
over there because their phones were all
water-resistant so let's talk about
storage sighs I'm gonna bundle two
questions together from Daniel and Jay
Jay is interested in the iPhone se
thinking about getting it for the size
and in congruence Daniels asking what
your opinion is about the 128 gigabyte
storage should these guys go ahead um
well it's tough because now I think
you're really wanted was 64 which is no
longer being offered right no this is
weirdly 64 is great and they totally do
it on purpose yeah absolutely
64 is a great storage thing 30 to romp
against a wall 16 is absurd yeah 32 is
like I mean look if you don't care
32 is totally doable but you will if
you're doing any everyday stuff with
photos yeah you're gonna start finding
if start clearing out stuff so 128 is if
you're using it a lot as a camera you'll
use that storage but
no I'm I'm yeah you're shooting video
your video uses that I use 32 on mine
and it's perfectly fine I mean right
you're right I do like how to clear out
stuff but that's just because I like to
keep it neat yeah yeah right Firth at
because they psyche you know yeah I'm
putting everything in cloud etc I don't
want to keep a lot of crap on my phone
yeah so 32 at least now 32 is a very
valid option for you and considering
yeah the other thing is for the price
you may say to yourself you know what
that's all I'm using the phone for and
that's fine I was almost offended when
you know the SC came out originally and
I was like oh we're just 16 gigs are you
kidding me yeah like that's not a
standard anymore you get out of here
they did that with eight for a while
it's like you know just get away as long
as you can and with the iPads now it
shifted away from that but thankfully
that's that's gone it had to with the OS
that was a big reason why I chose not to
buy an se when it first came out and I
got a 5s it said because they offered
the 32 gig model yeah which is now
available for the yes II so yeah 32 is
like my money please yeah that's your
basic solid storage and I don't know I
always feel like I want to go with more
storage on the more expensive phones
because then you feel like you've
already invested so much yeah like
what's another 100 when you're spending
a thousand dollars right yeah but if you
if your budget it's like it is a little
weird and I'm not gonna be watching like
as many movies on a small screen you
know like though if you know how this
would not be an issue if you just
allowed for expandable storage on you
can switch Android if only there were a
small card that would have a lot of
storage
the problem is article and pick it up at
stores so beautiful but then the problem
of Android phones is that they don't
have the size or form factor that the
IPOP same form factor okay sorry the
iPhone or factor alright one more before
we wrap it up is asking for a 256
gigabyte
I see two months oh yeah he's doing come
on own me yeah what what is the point
that I mean why if you're looking for
that that kind of extreme spec I don't I
have every single Star Wars movie in 4k
on my phone I don't even know unless you
using it as a yeah as an HD video camera
if you're if you're filming your
independent film yeah
all on an iPhone se sure I mean a
Diebold actually yeah I could see for
its size however that there are some
people that might say if I want to use
it as a GoPro etc and I and I'm going to
just have that tiny thing I can put
anywhere they make a camera I just want
to have a lot of storage okay but
otherwise no don't ya sorry that's too
much future proofing walking around we
have a portable hard drive they'd be
virtually no different if you could
actually you know jailbreak it so they
could use it as custom storage I
wouldn't hate that personally because I
do have to carry around a lot of files
and so yeah there's like yeah I like 256
on on the iPad we already know that
there don't get as much storage on the
atom soon so like just wait for that
well that's relative term yeah right
talk of many many many years soon so
yeah oh one more Scott sorry this is a
good one I have an iPhone 6 and thinking
about getting the iPhone 7 or the iPhone
se what do you think about downgrading
to the iPhone se from a 6 it's not
downgrading it is you're upgrading yeah
the specs or a success right yeah I
think it's pretty pretty much just down
to personal preference inside yeah yeah
I mean it depends on what you want if
you've been waiting to upgrade to a nice
phone where you're like I I want to you
know take in blah blah blah all these
features I would maybe wait and see what
the iPhone 8 is all about because it's
supposed to be a big update the 7 is a
good update from the 6 but yeah I mean
honestly like I don't think there's a
lot that's really that memorable about
it now six months in it's like it
doesn't have a headphone jack as the
thing is still sticks of the me actually
one of those memorable things and it's
and the waters is I don't drop it in
water very much I was gonna ask you
shouldn't do
like water splashing from the sink like
you're saying I feel safer with are you
checking messages time the shaving don't
you need both hands to wash are you I
throw my phone boiling water for poss
it's kind of that's the thing is if
you're gonna get a seven I would think
about the seven plus all the bells and
whistles are there anyway because the
camera is really nice and has a few
extra features and the screen I don't
like the size of seven plus but I have
gravitated to preferring it because of
the extra battery and the screen size
and everything maximizing and it just
works out better
the point being SE you be a very fine
upgrade if you're if you're okay with
the fact that you just want a better
functioning phone that's more portable
and creatures stay largely the same it's
all about your vitality and storage yea
eyes in comfort I don't think you're
gonna feel it's not yet pocket space but
you're not gonna feel so much of a I got
a brand new phone feeling yeah like so
you you know how desperate is your
decision right now it's a weird time
happy three years it's like I forgot to
do this on the podcast about the read
just add a plug to a new podcast we're
launching you know about a week and a
half from our colleague Ian sure status
update it's a podcast about parenting in
the age of tech this is unlike the 359
this is more of a monthly series longer
form a lot more in-depth he's done a ton
reporting I've ever listened in the
first episode it's fantastic kind of
goes to the history of a photo-taking
like literally from way back in the day
up to our modern phones and the impact
it's had in our lives as a parent and
and as a parent myself it's it's
absolutely fascinating so I would
definitely when it launches we're gonna
talk about this a bit more when it
launches but be on the lookout for
status update our new podcast and then
we got to make one last plug before the
big episode yeah so if you've been
following for a while you realize that
we're coming up on episode 200 we're not
gonna do anything too crazy but we
wanted to celebrate somehow we wanted to
settle
one of our most loyal fans Christian who
has coined the catchphrase ongoing punt
I want to punch Roger Chang in the face
so we're giving everyone the opportunity
to show us how to do that if you go into
the description of this video download
the file
it's a high-res photo of Rogers mug and
you can do whatever you want with it
within reason we want to see it I saw an
example yet we want to see how you can
either because it will take video we
like video if you got animation print is
face out but on a punching bag Photoshop
damage control all over them we've seen
some examples yeah we've got some
contributions
there's still time if you want to
participate we'd love to put them on the
show if we dig it maybe we'll try to
send you a t-shirt or something
either way we appreciate you we love you
coming back every single day except for
Friday's we've been trudging along with
this show for far too long and yeah
thanks everybody
