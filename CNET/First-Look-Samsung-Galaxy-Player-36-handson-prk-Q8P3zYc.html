i'm here to show you the samsung galaxy
player 3.6 this is Samsung's most direct
competitor against the Apple iPod Touch
got the same screen size around 3.5
inches it's a three point six ish inch
screen thin and light design it's got
all those media player capabilities in
running Android 3.2 point 6 and it's
priced really well it's priced out a
hundred and forty nine dollars so that's
fifty dollars less and be paying for an
ipod touch I also have to say I really
like the design i've handled to other
galaxies players before they're the
larger models more expensive models this
one actually feels more like a high-end
Android phone without the phone on the
back you've got this nice kind of
gunmetal finish you've got the two
megapixel camera on the back on the
bottom here you've got the headphone
jack and the micro USB port for charging
and syncing samsung also includes some
headphones with some replaceable ear
tips and a microphone on the headphone
you also get the charging connector here
so you can charge this up not much to
complicate things for that and also on
the back here I also like another thing
that's carried over from the phones is
that you can rip off the back and you
got the replaceable battery here and
you've got the microSD memory expansion
so if you want more than the eight gigs
of storage that come standard you can
plug a micro SD card up there and store
more stuff so what's the bad news the
bad news is is that the screen is not
that great so 480 x 320 resolution
screen has a pretty bad viewing angle
for the extra fifty dollars you pay for
an ipod touch you're going to get double
the resolution much better viewing
angles you're going to get an HD camera
on the back knowing samsung the price
here is probably to dip towards that
hundred dollar ninety nine dollar range
if it gets there i could probably look
past the screen and just buy this to
have fun with as an android fan
something else i can keep all my apps
and games and I not to worry about
running down the battery life because
it's my phone so there you go that's the
samsung galaxy player 3.6 if fun device
probably one of the best players I've
seen great price
mediocre screen still worth checking out
especially with that price gets down
towards one hundred dollars for cnet.com
I'm Donald bell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
