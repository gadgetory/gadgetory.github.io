to the apple byte is the show for
everything good and bad inside the world
of Apple so let's get to it and we start
off with the latest iPad rumors and
rumblings now according to the korea
time sources at an apple display
supplier production of the rumored 12.9
retina display to be used in the next
gen ipad is underway with the tablet set
for release in early 2014 now the report
also says the rumor display will have an
improved resolution nearing ultra
high-definition quality with more pixels
than the ipad air now again these are
still all rumors but there have been
plenty of stories in the past lean up to
this point we might end up seeing it an
ipad pro type of product after all now
not all is good on the ipad front after
some and again not all retina ipad minis
are showing image retention issues after
running what's called the grid test it
was the same test used on the original
retina MacBook Pros as well and in most
cases this honestly isn't really
noticeable but another report from an
antec and results from a comparison from
display mate also show that the retina
iPad Mini has a narrower color gamut
compared to the ipad air and other
competitors like the kindle fire HDX and
the new nexus 7 which leads to poor
color accuracy now the smaller yellow
triangle you see here in this chart
represents the ipad mini compared to the
other so yeah that doesn't look very
good it doesn't make it a bad product
just uh you know something to note also
we talked about the Apple TV project
getting pushed back because of the focus
on the iWatch but this is an interesting
story from Israeli newspaper the
calculus that reports a deal is on the
verge of being completed with Apple
agreeing to purchase primeSense for
approximately 345 million dollars now
primeSense is the company behind the
original 3d body sensing tech used in
microsoft's kinect platform there have
been plenty of reports of Apple looking
at a Kinect like motion control for its
future TV set in the past year and the
big a has patents that were filed and
granted before the Kinect even hit store
shelves a couple years ago now the deal
is not done yet but it's very close and
it's just something you know we're
keeping an eye on all right in iOS 7
News game controls
the exciting developments from the
original announcement and we're now
seeing two options for you all to check
out logitech announced their PowerShell
iOS 7 game controller it works with the
iphone 5 5c and 5s and 5th generation
ipod touch it also charges the device
when it's being used and the controller
is available online now for 99 bucks and
moga who is known for their android
gamepad accessories also released the
moga ace power iOS 7 game controller
it's also 99 bucks it's compatible with
the same I devices and charges them as
well and i'm a fan because these
physical controllers could really open
up some new types of games for iOS now
alright let's take a breather in I just
wanted to show you a quick little trick
with control center it's one of the best
features in iOS 7 but it can sometimes
you know get in the way when playing
games that require swiping so did you
know that you can disable it when using
apps I didn't know that Brian all right
Vanessa now check this out here's how to
do it go to your settings then find
control center and there's an option to
access within apps you want to turn it
off and now when you play that fruit
ninja or any other game it won't
accidentally show up thanks for the tip
Brian and parece que se muri√≥ en tu
cabeza well um you're welcome Vanessa
and I have no idea what she said but I
like it like a lot I'll write to the
quick bites Apple's released the first
beta of iOS 7.1 for developers some
tweaks include bug fixes a new toggle
for a dart keyboard no longer restarting
when you choose the bull text option and
yes the new yahoo logo also a few apple
apps including find my friends I books
and iTunes U gets in iOS 7 facelift and
the iPad gets its own dedicated apple
store app with its own unique interface
that's really elegant and clean looking
and Apple gets the final approval from
the city of Cupertino for its spaceship
campus by the Cupertino city council my
hometown by the way cupertino mayor or
in Mahoney says we're eager to see it
happen go for it and that's just really
inspirational stuff all right everybody
we have a quick give away from our
friends at speck products we're hooking
you up with five spec cases that are
compatible on your iPhone 5 or 5s there
