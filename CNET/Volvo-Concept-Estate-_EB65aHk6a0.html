the auto shows especially here at Geneva
is less having to buy a fancy car to get
the fancy tech the 2015 ford focus is a
good example of ash there's the new ford
/ aston martin ask face but inside
things get interesting notice they've
sort of cleaned up and changed the head
unit and the area around it this is part
of some learning for its head lately
that myford touch can be a little
complicated when it's all on screen
instead they're breaking some functions
back out to very clear easy to
understand physical buttons beyond that
the screen interface has been smoothed
out and cleaned up as well and showing
all of those improvements a bigger
physical screen now the driving
technology Ford was pretty early in
having assisted parking which is not
exactly self-parking you operate the
pedals it operates the wheel now you're
going to the point where this kind of a
car is going to operate the break in the
accelerator and the steering wheel it'll
also go the other way parking spot exit
and this parking deck will work for the
dreaded parallel or the much easier
perpendicular parking you know where
we're going in a few years the kind of
car that parks itself while you're
completely outside of it even in a spot
that's barely big enough for you to open
the doors and get out of an example of
another big tech trend we're seeing here
under the hood which is really high
strung small displacement engines in
this case it's one liter three cylinders
turbocharging of course direct injection
what Ford calls EcoBoost but what
everybody is using in combination these
days this is a big rush to say you don't
need to buy a 40 50 60 thousand dollar
car to get the latest tech pricing and
availability this cars a late 2014
release in the US except for this one we
still don't get the wagon ah
