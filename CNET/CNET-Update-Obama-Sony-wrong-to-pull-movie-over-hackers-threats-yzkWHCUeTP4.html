have pulled the movie the interview I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update the Federal Bureau of
Investigation officially accused the
government of North Korea of being
behind the cyber attack on Sony Pictures
Entertainment which pressured the studio
to cancel the release of the movie the
interview the FBI says it has enough
information about the malware that shows
the North Korean government is
responsible in a year end news
conference President Obama said sony has
made a mistake in pulling the movie and
that the US will respond we cannot have
a society in which some dictator some
place can start imposing censorship here
in the United States north korea has
denied allegations of its involvement
back on december 7th but it also
expressed support for the attack the
hackers stole and published private
financial documents emails and personal
information about employees and
celebrities the cyberattack crippled
Sony destroying many company computers
you can expect companies to start
scrambling now to better protect
themselves against similar attacks and
perhaps invest in some sort of hacking
insurance in other news t-mobile has
agreed to pay at least 90 million
dollars to settle a federal trade
commission lawsuit that accuses the
carrier of cramming cramming is a term
used to describe when a carrier profits
from cramming a bill with unwanted
charges from outside services like
premium text message subscriptions for
things like horoscopes or love advice
the FTC says when people sign up for
these premium text messages they
unknowingly were being charged extra
sometimes because the charge wasn't
clearly labeled in the monthly bill
carriers like t-mobile can benefit from
these extra charges taking a percentage
of the fees sometimes as much as forty
percent the FTC also says it was
difficult for consumers to get refunds
this agreement means t-mobile will pay a
fine and issue refunds to customers that
may have had these charges back in
October ATT also agreed to a settlement
for the same thing paying 105 million
dollars a few days ago sprint was
with a lawsuit by the government for the
same practice in November major US
carriers agreed to stop billing
customers for third-party services so
this isn't going to be an issue going
forward and in the world of apps
facebook has launched yet another app
believe it or not stickered for
messenger lets you put facebook stickers
on your photos and then send those
photos to a friend with the messenger
app why can't this just be folded inside
the main messenger app the new sticker
tap is on Android now and it's coming
soon to apple's app store that's your
tech news update there's always more at
