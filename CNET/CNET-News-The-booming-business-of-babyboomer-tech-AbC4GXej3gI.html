dollars an hour the senior gets a
notification of who's coming while
caregivers use the app to get background
information and keep track of tasks
family gets an app on their phone that
shows them who's going to be going to
their parents house what they're going
to do and then after they visit what
they did while they were there honor is
one of several matching services

have already received tens of millions
of dollars from Silicon Valley investors

administration is also exploring ways
tech can help seniors technology

do more to ensure that every older
American has the resources and the
support that they need to thrive owner
