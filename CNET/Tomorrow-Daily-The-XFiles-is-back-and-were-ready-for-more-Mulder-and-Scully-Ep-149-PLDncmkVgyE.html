showing off a bionic limb that you
control with your smartphone and one of
the best sci-fi shows of all time is
making a triumphant return that show it
rhymes with x-files didn't think doctors
know you really didn't and we have a
robot that might change the way phones
and tablets are assembled in factories
here we go it's gonna get exciting
tomorrow daily
fruiting citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I'm your
host Ashley skala joining me as always
kill anonymous happy Saturday said oh
he's a happy died but again no this is
the tube well new releases Santa too
yeah it's Tuesday Tuesday we can find
out what all our money is going to this
crazy it's been a crazy day like we were
joking around on the internet with the
x-files thing it was like if you had any
news today just try again tomorrow like
because this was the big story yeah this
is yes getting all dwarves I know it
discovers miracle cure forget it sorry
xbox yeah so let's let's talk about
robots and X Files right now you weren't
supposed to spoil what my story was
gonna about I think I'm 3 X Files sorry
like spoilers guy I guess so yeah tell
us about these uh tell about these this
is a very interesting bionic limb so
we've discussed prosthetics before on
the show at length we saw recently the
really cool 3d printed bionic limb
before the little boy that was like iron
man's arms it was amazing you should i
watch that episode we should you totally
should so this is from a japanese
company called eggsy a TX III and they
have handy which is aj md III okay so
they talked about in the video so
problems with prosthetic hands obviously
they're expensive and they also rely on
really big kind of custom complex
computer setups to control this on the
other hand handy works with a cell phone
so it's it's processed all of the
signals are our scent processed and sent
back to the arm via phone the future is
now features now everybody in it yeah
that's fantastic that's a really big
price sale mejor and then the other part
of it is the hand is 3d printed so easy
to repair easy to expand easy to
customize you can make it all different
colors you can switch out this the
fingertips which i thought was cool you
can switch out no oh first day yeah
finger parts so like you can do like a
screwdriver no like they have all these
different types of
her tips that you'd be able to use what
dr. gadget knows where you are it's
amazing yeah this is in movies anytime
soon as a robot arm have it good like
exchanging yeah hearts you're like now
now is the time you're gonna die or I
need to pick a lock and they switch it
out it's like a saw blade although okay
like a Swiss Army knife this is what a
lot of us were hoping is the people that
had the arms are gonna have better
better options yes okay so enter than
our dumb thing it's run by the phone you
can select custom skins and stuff right
we do print it so basically how it works
with the smartphone is it hasn't eat
there's an EMG sensor on your arm it
takes that information so you're kind of
telling it what you want it to do it
sends that info to the smartphone that
processes translates of data and then
sends it back to the hand-to-hand e to
complete that action wait how do you
tell it what to do so there's a sensor
that's on the arm oh alright but like on
your actual here and your phone is the
process your phone is the processor for
this instead of a large third computer
setup that is kind of common with bionic
limbs like this but they were showing it
off at South by Southwest and so here it
is they were checking that out that was
at South by I don't know if you got to
see it maybe you didn't I didn't get to
go to the floor unfortunately yeah so
they're doing a lot of really cool stuff
with this and I think that what they the
coolest part of this is that eggsy wants
to make this hamp handy open source
totally open source so they want to put
out all the information the 3d printing
info the the programming information the
software stuff and they want to have
people just iterate on the design and
make it more functional they want it to
make it more beautiful they're like just
go for it like we want to make an open
source we're gonna give this to
everybody to improve on and you're
welcome so super awesome I would like to
give them a hand no that's great I love
that anything anytime they say open
sores I like that the most exciting
thing especially if it's already made
really compounds yeah exactly by the way
that was a huge crowd around that booth
huge crowd yes sir sorry South by
Southwest booths that today yeah tell
myself less interactive like usually you
see maybe like five people like maybe
milling around a booth one of them is on
a cell phone not really paying attention
that like this had a very rapt audience
who are the guys that are doing this
they're called eggs eex
III okay they're from Japan which is I
mean it's just so cool so nice job XE
let it go no just that we need to make
baymax and then we're good I know so
close to the pinnacle of our species
okay can we talk about x-files now I
mean if you're nice piece yeah we're all
talking about x-files x-files coming
back yes okay hopefully you're jumping
in your chair or you can your car don't
jump at your car so basically Fox is
bringing back the x-files this is not
good it's not gonna be a whole season
but it is a six-episode miniseries who
remember they did that with 24 yeah all
right yeah they did this special like it
was a big to-do where they brought that
Jack Bauer I met him this weekend by the
way that's a weird name drop but yeah
that's that's that's what bar better be
as cool as I hoped but the even more
amazing news is that Dave de company
jillian is it's Gillian Anderson thanks
Jillian it's Gillian Anderson and
executive producer chris carter are
coming back so they're all coming back
for 6s for six episodes uh oh my god
yeah it's gonna be great um yeah that's
gonna do TV I like I like the quote that
Carter released it goes I think of it as
a 13-year commercial break it's that's a
really long commercial break but okay
the good news is that the world has only
gotten that much stranger a perfect time
to tell these six stories which I was
like like successful sci-fi shows that
are happening right now like black
mirror and spring this is there's never
been a better time in and thanks to
netflix a lot of people have caught up
with all the stuff they've missed now an
x-files speaking of Netflix and X Files
this is an important piece of advice for
you I am assuming because X Files will
be coming back to Fox get in your
viewing now because it's not gonna be on
those networks very for very long yeah
like I don't think it's gonna be on
netflix and I think it's hulu I think
they're both on both of those I would
highly recommend if you have not caught
up get it done sooner revving later but
that I mean we thought this was gonna
happen with like there was like rumors
about David company was gonna be
involved and and like with it this was
happening but it was confirmed say that
they're filming the summer so that
they're there's there's a reality folks
official it's actually happening so
again if you haven't watched X miles
make sure to catch up like ashley said
now a small piece of trivia Oh Vince
Gilligan creator of Breaking Bad yeah
wrote for the X yeah yes he did I'm
really curious to see if maybe they
bring him back to write in episode you
know they're gonna do that'd be so great
I'd put money on that I sure got some
really good writers to come back and be
I hope so too I really hope so I'd be
fun so so that brings us to our hashtag
a witch uh we're gonna read in two days
and I'll explain why and user feedback
okay our hashtag of the day today is TV
TV event mm-hmm and the question is what
cancelled show do you want to see
brought back for a small mini series of
special event miniseries run whether
it's like one episode like 24 they did
like two of them I think they did a
couple or if it's something like this a
six-episode miniseries but like can't be
any more than six episodes you get like
half a season all right what show what
show is it obviously I know a lot of you
out there gonna say Firefly I'm gonna
make that exempt because that's always
the number one answer right no fire fair
enough yeah you're absolutely right we
don't fire why I mean and I agree with
you I agree and now that it's Fox maybe
you never know but let's just guys
really you've got what I feel like
you've got an answer or loaded up so why
don't you get down go ahead and start
you get started it's the winner of
Esquires the data bracket this weekend
about like which canceled show need to
be brought back I voted pushing daisies
was number one oh wow six more episodes
of pushy jay-z's was number one they
beat Firefly they'd be perfect so I see
pushing daisies folks we got a brother
love pushing daisies we paste and the
pie we had bring at the pie maker and we
got to bring Nick olive snook and the
darling mermaid mermaid darlings that
show is the best show and it was
cancelled too soon it was a it was a
terrible casualty of the 2008 writer
strike and we need it back but please
travel travel boutique yeah was one of
the coup de coeur buggered up in the
city the cool decor I that was great
about Charles that was a great show it
was Bryan Fuller who is currently busy
doing Hannibal I don't know if you know
but he was pushing pushing daisies harsh
and pushing daisies he was pushing our
and dev like me and wonderful yeah like
I just love down like me and nobody
knows what her falls amazing grace don't
pretend like anybody knows what I do
what're Falls is very so good amazing
right person cases that's what I say
what do you think I want to know what
else is on the list but I I want Clone
High to come back for sure Clone High
won't I if you don't know was an
animated show that was on MTV of all
places and it was done by Chris Miller
and phil lord they did the lego movie
they also did 21 Jump Street they did
cloudy with a chance of meatballs they
have a very good sense of humor it
started Will Forte as Abraham Lincoln
mom and I forgot the rest he's always
busy right now in the last man on earth
yeah but you know do you want my second
choice yes cop Rock what you remember
cop Rock cop Rock was a I think
maybe one person is gonna be like look
kill you deliver it and something and
everybody else is just like gonna skip
this one there's a reason it was awful
it was it's more like Denver the last
dinosaur that's what I want that let's a
pic obscure shows it was a cop like a
procedural show like a rock no no it was
caught but it was a musical it was a
musical cop procedural and it was awful
there is it guys I'm telling you look up
the baby merchant cop rock there's a
musical number girl the baby it's awful
is the worst thing ever this you're
gonna cut out so funny I'm not going to
okay well then I'm getting one last one
in to God buchinsky it's about that's
called Poochie yeah it's about a cop
that dies and inhabits a pit bull s to
solve crimes as a dog seriously if you
love weird internet crap Google pooch in
ski oh yeah buchinsky and Kyle I'm gonna
go look at copper right way we has a
ruin people's technic you're well no we
just made your day so much better ok so
that was x-files TTT TV event that's
right so tell me about Sawyer ok so
let's talk about Sawyer really quickly
Sawyer comes from this company called
rethink robotics and they have this
robot right now called Baxter and Baxter
is kind of he's huge he has like two
arms he's really wide like we here's
some footage you're back haha thanks to
the rock is ginormous Baxter looks like
a bouncer at a robot nightclub ok so
he's huge but the cool thing is is that
Baxter paved the way for Sawyer so
here's Sawyer and you can see Sawyer as
they go through this video is a lot more
svelte then maxtor and he only has one
arm and you might think that robots with
one arm might be not as good as robots
with two armed but not the case with
Sawyer there's better so why your isn't
that better so his focus is actually
tending machines testing circuit boards
and doing these really tiny little small
precise tasks that you might see on an
assembly line so you might see people
and we've seen probably footage from
electronics factories in China where
they're putting together everything and
they have these people like testing out
the circuit boards doing all these
really precise small tasks and they're
literally lined up right next to each
other very tightly if they're packed in
like sardines yes so what they're saying
is what they want to do is because labor
costs are rising for people like that
because obviously it costs money to take
care of them um they want to sell these
robots and have the robots to it because
the turnover rates and these factories
are very high they can be up to
twenty-five percent so twenty-five
percent of your workforce is just
constantly turning over that's a quarter
that's a lot okay there's a lot of
economics it's a lot of mash is so much
figure out job loss but it's not job
wise people quitting they're quitting
they really don't you think is right for
the product right profit I so it's just
supply and demand yeah yeah it's all
very complicated but so Sawyer fits into
a two by two by five space so it's just
a two by two space and five foot high
and then his arm can reach down and his
his hand like the where his hand is
there was a camera there so somebody can
supervise what the robot is doing and
then there's another camera on the face
of Baxter that can actually have a
better overview of what's going on in
the factory smaller it's faster smaller
more precise I does cost more than
Baxter costs about twenty nine thousand
dollars but it gets 30,000 lifetime
hours of use which is pretty good and it
is also sealed against dust and sprays
which is something that obviously a lot
of factories would like um but yeah
you're kind of taking you on the costs
of you know like I said turn over and
all this other stuff but that's their
goals rethink review didn't watch at
home why did it have eyes why did it
have creepy cartoon eyes that i hate
this for more fun
and no I get it makes people more
comfortable when it's a friendlier
looking robot like it's maybe a little
bit more easy factory oh he's cute
though like I got adorable ya know he's
got the paperclip eyes from the
Microsoft the paper cutter gloopy ICS uh
guys that's a great video though they
nobody's really showed off what you know
the kind of stuff you can do so so
you're coming to a factory near you yeah
good job there there I think they're
saying like they're selling them in i
think was North America Europe Asia like
they pretty much like almost everywhere
they want to sell them and like install
them and see how they do and factories
which is pretty cool cool I'm sure
somebody's gonna correct us on the whole
taking the job thing they're gonna be
like you don't understand no cannolis
well it's just like Charlie the
chocolate factory where it's like his
dad loses the job doing the toothpaste
caps of the factory cuz a robot can do
it but then he gets a job at the end of
the movie fixing the robot that does the
toothpaste caps so they're making see
you there's jobs I kept seeing the robot
is like Charlie unshy like Willy Wonka
the Chocolate Factory fair enough here
we go we're back to pop culture that's
okay all right we're gonna take a quick
break and duke it out over those over
those movies and we will be right back
with your bets with new releases you
look like the Fighting Irish logo for
Notre Dame feel like I should get you a
little bowler hat and we'll be back with
new releases and your user feedback and
of course our phone talking for today so
don't click away it's tomorrow daily
welcome back to tomorrow daily uh you
okay are you okay I was to say your
first punching then then rock concert I
thought maybe you were driving a car for
a second the evolution of dance oh oh
okay all right good uh well it's Tuesday
which means it is time to talk about all
the things that as kill said will empty
your wallet it's new releases
some really good stuff this this week
smell a small group of things only three
things but the number one thing
everybody's talking about on the
internet is blood blood more blood borne
is out finally here hey guys all your
money for this game a lot of people
arguing this is the this is a console
selling game oh really that maybe you
would buy a ps4 to play this this is
sort of a I would say a spiritual
successor to Dark Souls like the Dark
Souls franchise I have heard it is very
difficult yeah what are the reviews uh I
know gamespot gave it a nine I read the
review today 99 saying it's a lot of
people saying this game is very good
very very good but also very frustrating
oh good what's a new thing these days
you know it's I'm well it's like ninja
gaiden black remember that it was like
that game was so freaking hard but you
know was it everyone was excited to see
sort of this like revival of really
difficult game so I think this is kind
of the same the same in the same vein
very you know obviously very visceral
it's called blood-borne you guys you
know what you're getting is what I'm
saying yeah you got a ps4 it's like you
have to you have to buy your exclusives
when you have a console do it like uh
yeah good even if I don't do it for the
exclusive ah but I yeah this is
definitely one of those ones I'm very
excited to check out on Twitch ya see
cuz you get that taste of like this is
what it is yeah my kind of game yeah and
I think a lot of people are already you
know really on it like people I'd like I
thought I saw well twitch said to change
your passwords today because they got
hacked but is that what happened I they
said there's some kind of breach so we
got all everybody got either passwords
reset producer Logan are you gonna buy
this game yes or no no reason to Logan
says no I guess not not really snotty
back wasn't so busy with GT I'm saying
he's busy hi Steve it's either he's
doing either doing homework or playing
GTA that strip which is also homework or
doing homework to do highest in GTA it's
like he's doing his heist homework ice
not work ok what's the other one what
else we got I've never heard of this I
thought this was very interesting so
this is a game on iOS it's called rebus
re be us and if you've ever heard of
Rita it's like riddles like these sort
of visual puzzles and so they have this
some trailer video so they'll show you
exactly what a revis is so you can see I
love when you find this stuff because I
wouldn't have found it otherwise oh god
I was I was looking and I'm like okay
but what do we have today so here's Olga
em over the word day obviously the
solution is monday cuz it's em on day 0
0 these puzzles I remember doing these
in elementary school yeah they're kind
of like that and so they have the one
what's another hundreds of puzzles
what's this one it's a tea made of rain
so train oh boy and then like the word
the letter L and the Annan amber sand is
land l and they're like little worried
you take other people on and doing it no
but there's I think that's like role
puzzles like you're supposed to click
cross a bridge a troll would be like
what is it G with the top right that's
in your life Rivas I've got you here
okay so having a troll your pocket it's
like having a Rivas bridge troll in your
pocket that's exactly that's pretty cool
how many hours have you logged I've
played it a little bit uh because I have
the flight test or the test flight demo
but it comes out on the 26 so it's in a
couple days like the official version
comes out a couple of sorry um and then
also in theaters home is out this week
for those for those of you looking for
an animated film to enjoy I thought this
looked really cute it's not getting
amazing reviews it's not getting like
ninety percent on rotten tomatoes but it
does look fun it's about aliens a race
of aliens and their leader whose voiced
by the guy who does Sheldon Cooper oh oh
you can be all right there as your head
you know where do we have CBS executives
they can come in here and tell us yeah I
mean they really should um but yeah the
guy who plays Sheldon Cooper is gonna he
plays the alien and then Rihanna plays a
character like it looks really cute and
I thought maybe if you were so inclined
you would go see you this weekend are
you gonna look it up right now I'm
trying to don't I keep it I don't think
of I keep trying to think of when he won
21 Emmys for playing Sheldon Cooper but
I just associate him so deeply with
Sheldon Cooper that it's it's like oh I
just remembered it's Jim Parsons Oh Jim
Parsons yes of course which we were on
this screen when I was writing it up
well yeah Jim parson nobody noticed it's
all good it's all good so there's gonna
be a scenery goes
penny penny penny yeah exactly um so
yeah I thought are you gonna go see this
I probably know what I probably cannot I
don't think so i think everybody is
waiting for the i forgot what is it
inside the disney movie oh yeah inside
out inside out yeah I think everyone's
waiting for that that looks really you
look at this movie and you're like
that's not that movie no it's waiting
for that movie wait that alien kind of
looks like the inside I'm know it's kind
of slow kind of some movie yeah okay
we're building up to the the summer
season so everything's kind of
whispering today whittles its way down
and then explodes and then avenger
explode so um okay guys it is now time
to discuss a user feedback that is going
to extend for not it for two days so
we're gonna get a new user feedback you
guys and your AR vs. virtual reality oh
do they go really mad people went to
town right let's hear it I want to hear
we got so much feedback you're gonna
have to bring in some tomorrow from
YouTube because we got so much feedback
I could only pull from Twitter and email
and even then I couldn't pick everybody
and we're gonna do this over two days
that's why I was saying we'll get to
your TV event tweets on Thursday but for
the next two days we're gonna do t.t DVR
VAR which you guys in a lot say let's
hear it tom says AR for sports giving
players interactive information while
they're on the field or court is a game
changer oh it also seems kind of cheap
didn't even think about that that would
be cool though you're like you got your
you know you guys come up with a plan
the huddle but you think he changes yeah
and then it's all of a sudden just
changed like in everybody's you get it
your headset lappy yeah but then it's
gonna be there's no no like roller ball
or something I don't know there won't be
any audible anyway okay what else you
got Neil wrote in and said I'm more
excited for AR but not all the broken
bones I'll get from punching real trees
while playing Minecraft like that that's
true yeah killing chickens and what yeah
cortland wrote in and said I would want
a are just because I wear glasses but if
VR was like in dot hack or sword art
online than I would
vr do you realize that was bad they got
locked into the game and if they died in
the virtual reality headset and sort
online they die in real life I think I
think you mean you want AR and not sort
out online but yeah okay but you're
you're crushing it on a are like
choosing a are so most people okay most
people pick they are but sort our online
i would want to do that too so fantasy
book Rick Rhoden said I'll go with AR
cuz someday it's gonna replace every
device we own one device to rule them
all I hope hololens hits the mark I
think a lot of people feel like that I
feel like I want any any AR that pulls
it off to be I want a competitive market
a little bit too yeah I want a
competitive market let's do this Chris
wrote in an email and said I'm much more
excited about AR because of its
potential to be useful throughout the
day the tipping point for me will be
when the AR headset is not much more
than a pair of horn-rimmed glasses that
can offer various levels of augmentation
I do not want the device only to lay
images over my field of vision i also
want to tilt my head back have the
lenses go opaque and be able to fully go
online or watch media i like that the
lens is going opaque when the headset is
a combination of google glass of musics
headset and transition lenses i will be
totally on board and even pay Google
glass prices what are going 1,500 bucks
I will not pay 15 hi if it did all of
those things yeah well I prob yeah my
phone is like a thousand dollars got off
contract yeah that's true so maybe yeah
maybe okay um and then also just as a
side note my friend desiree uh who never
talks to me about this show sent me a
message about the show and said and she
said she thinks that AR is like the
consumer friendly the more mainstream
consumer friendly product as opposed to
vr she's like AR will she feels like AR
will be for everybody in VR will be for
like gaming like specific niche
applications until until we start living
in a digital world meaning when we put
it on we exist in like Facebook is kind
of a crash ya know kind of her I just
started reading that ok ok don't spoil I
recommend it we're ready player one but
you should read that one I am reading
that that got it in a loot crate oh ok
right but until that kind of thing
starts existing
it's just gonna be kind of a toy so you
kind of like this fun thing that makes
us think about all the possibilities but
it's still gonna be like not a thing
that my mom is like I gotta go get one
of these did you see it on the Today
Show she doesn't talk like that I like
that I like that though but yeah so so
how is this what the tomorrow is gonna
be all the VR ones no no we're just
gonna do more for tomorrow cuz it was a
win there was no people that were like
VR a hundred percent VR all the way no
no no buddy I which was shocking to me
because I really felt like but somebody
made a good point and said with a are
you could look at a wall or you could
you could have a screen and resize it to
anything like you could resize it to any
size you could fill up your your view
you could be could make it small if you
remember one week when we first did the
hololens video that was the thing I was
most excited about was I could be
watching a TV and then just make it
small a lot of companies are gonna go to
business I need a TV I think I always
need a TV be on the toilet just watchin
nope nope always need a television I
always need television um okay guys it
is time for our last piece of user
feedback of the day which is always our
phone target for the day
