also the 7 plus so what exactly is
different
well the seventh plus gets you dual
cameras this just has a single but it's
still a revamp camera with better light
levels in a new image signal processor
but also this is water-resistant both
new iPhones are ip67 so if you drop them
in a pool or a tub or a toilet or
something they probably should be okay
don't leave in there too long
there's no headphone jack because both
of these use lightning and lightning
adapters but there's also new wireless
ear pods that will be able to connect to
them and play wireless music pretty neat
stuff these also come in a few new
colors and the new processor in here is
more battery efficient so you're gonna
get more battery life on the iPhone 7 a
couple hours more according to what
Apple claims
we'll have to test it out and see but a
better battery water resistance new
processor or new cameras and no standard
headphone jack are the big things or
today we mentioned that this is a new
home button that doesn't even click you
press in on that and feel solid-state
force touch basically which is pretty
neat so that's the iPhone 7 in a
nutshell looks pretty similar we're
gonna take a look police on the outside
a lot of things a new on the inside and
we're going to take a look at this a lot
more soon I'm Scott Stein at sea now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
