rule of thumb though most of us ignore
it daily as we bury our heads in our
phones but Billy Whitehouse of
Australian company wearable experiments
has a forward-thinking answer navigate
jacket is the urban wayfinding jacket
it's giving your eyes back to the city
it's an ability to walk around the city
without having to look at a map so it's
Matt free travel this prototype was
designed for women but a men's version
was just unveiled at the South by
Southwest Interactive Festival the
Blazers communicate via bluetooth with
your phone enter your destination in a
mobile app and let the jacket be your
guide so we're building a language
around haptic feedback around vibration
sensors built into the shoulders that
tell you when to turn left and tell you
when to turn right and then we have a
countdown on your sleeve that allows you
to know how many meters until you turn
sewn into the jacket is a Bluetooth
module and a circuit board wearable
experiments is aiming for a battery life
of seven hours for most of us it's
difficult enough keeping our phones
charged do we really want plug in
clothing as well but what if powering up
was simpler as simple as taking the
jacket and hanging it up we hope to
build induction charges into a current
hanger that specifically made for the
jacket that way you don't have to go
home and think about charging another
device I think that's where the wearable
technology market is missing its key its
legs at the moment we don't want to have
to think about all these other devices
to charge and to turn on we want them to
be really intuitive into our lives the
company says the final version will
feature removable electronics and it'll
be washable and they won't stop there
we're really looking forward to
eventually working at making it
voice-activated and also having it of
speakers in it so that people who are
vision impaired could be directed in the
load of different ways throughout GPS
jacket wearable experiments hopes to
license this tech to another company to
manufacture so no word yet on when the
navigate jacket will be ready to wear
though it has launched a clothing
product in Australia the alert shirt
also has built-in vibration sensors it's
designed for Australian football fans as
they watch a game the shirt simulates
the sensations of player feels in real
time
from full-body tackles to heart thumping
pre-kick jitters so if you're wondering
about the future of fashion chances are
we'll be decked out in tech in San
Francisco I'm Sumi das cnet for CBS News</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
