apps already available for the Apple
watch where do they like how do you put
them on and how do you take them off
I'll show you how first you're going to
need your iPhone that's paired with it
now there are 3,000 apps available on
the Apple watch but all of them use the
iPhone to load its apps onto the watch
automatically so if you browse the App
Store or you browse the App Store that's
on the Apple watch app on your iPhone
they're downloading iPhone apps contain
within is that nugget and it
automatically pulls on and it connects
now how do you get it off is the
question well there are two ways to
delete them you don't have to delete
them from your iPhone but you can remove
the one on your watch if you look at the
grid of apps which you get to by
pressing in on the digital crown and you
swipe around any of those little app
icons you can press and hold until you
see them all sort of wobble like iPhone
icons then there's a little tiny X at
the top you could tap near that and then
it brings up the option to delete the
app delete the app few seconds later
it's gone
you can also do that from your iPhone if
you don't want to fiddle around with
those apps on the watch if you open your
Apple watch app on the iPhone you see a
huge long list of all of the apps but if
you have as many as I do that you've
installed tap on any one of those and
you have very simple options inside you
can offer it up as a glance or at the
top it says you can remove or or add
that app to your watch toggle it so that
it's not green that removes it from your
Apple watch now if you want to get it
back on to your Apple watch it's still
listed in your settings you just go back
into that setting and toggle it back on
and then it will reinstall now if you
want to do something a little cool to
take care of your apps and be able to
get to the newer easily you can activate
glances and if you activate that from
that toggle or from a glance a submenu
you can get a little card that appears
when you swipe up on your watch you can
get your key apps a lot faster so I
think you should cherry pick maybe your
five or six most interesting apps make
sure you put them in glances and then
you get to those apps a little faster
that's apps on the Apple watch
have fun exploring they're a lot
