the Philips booth at diva 2014 in Berlin
we're here to check out the new Philips
hue beyond lighting system so we have
here our three light fixtures there's
one in your ceiling there's one there's
a pendant lamp so there's a table lamp
and each has two banks of LEDs inside
and they're designed to be controlled
from your smartphone they're similar to
the Q connected light bulbs that we saw
a couple years ago so the idea is that
like most smart lights you can control
these with an app if they were tablet or
a smartphone and they have all kinds of
different programming functions you can
time them you can put them on a schedule
you can have them switch different
colors when a certain event happens like
say you get a new email or some kind of
social media event they also support
IFFT which is IFTTT if this then that
the standard that lets them talk to all
kinds of different other smart home
devices and services makes it really
pretty flexible if you really want to
dive into that home automation thing now
they are not inexpensive for the
baseline price you're going to pay about
299 pounds right now for the table lamp
without the connected kit that gets the
thing on the internet that's sort of
assume you already have one if you're
going to get the whole kit for one of
the ceiling lights or the pendant lamp
you're going to pay about 499 pounds so
they're definitely not cheap right now
they're only available in the UK and
Europe they'll be coming out to the US
and the rest of the world later we don't
know pricing it but we'll have that as
soon as we can
so I'm rich brown this is the Philips
hue beyond lighting set
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
