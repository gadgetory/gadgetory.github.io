coming this spring but Apple released it
to developers and let us have a look to
see what's in store for your images i'm
jason parker for cnet and this is a
first look at apple's Photos app the new
Photos app will display your photos much
like it does in iOS letting you switch
between moments collections and years
also like iOS you'll be able to click
and drag to scrub from photo to photo on
the wall to edit a photo you just click
the edit button in the upper right
photos will have the one-click enhance
button just like iOS that automatically
adjust levels and brightness for you to
get the best look it also will have
rotate and cropping tools that gives you
a handful of filters to give your photos
that retro look or black and white and a
few others the adjustment tools are also
really cool because you have a choice of
doing something the easy way or digging
down into various adjustments for more
specific changes if I wanted to change
how a light and image is I can use this
slider and you can see how the photo
changes but there are several changes
happening behind the scenes if I click
this arrow I can see all of the more
minor adjustments like exposure
highlights and shadows and it can adjust
these individually as well the same is
true for color and black and white
everything I've shown so far is into the
Photos tab but there are four main
buttons across the top including photos
shared albums and projects as this is a
demo machine from Apple I haven't made
any shared albums but the shared button
is where you'll see all the albums of
photos are currently sharing and the
ones shared with you you can create a
shirt album easily by naming it adding
friends or family then add a comment
from there you can add photos and
everyone will be able to see and comment
on the photos you at the album's button
is where you'll find all of your created
albums a double click on an album brings
up all the photos in the collection and
another double click opens a photo but
also in the album's section are Apple
designed collections that will help you
find the photos you want across the top
here you have all photos faces that I
photo users will recognize last import
favorites and several other categories
including the various video types it's
great for viewing all your panoramas for
example and lets you look at them
individually on a black background for
the best
experience next is projects here is
where you can get ideas for displaying
your photos or you can spend a little
cash to order hard copies of your images
and a bunch of different formats there
are things like calendars greeting cards
where you can choose what's on the front
inside and back and several others the
most striking I saw at Apple was the
large hardcover book with two page
layouts where the photos bleed off the
page and it allows for different types
of layouts the Photos app will be a free
upgrade that comes with the next version
of Yosemite sometime this spring i'm
