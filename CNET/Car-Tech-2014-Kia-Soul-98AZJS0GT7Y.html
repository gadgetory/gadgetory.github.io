gift box as somebody stepped on one end
of it's got an exclamation mark as part
of its formal name and this one's the
color of a sick man's urine what do you
say to a car like that turns out nice to
meet you would be about the right line
let's drive the rather impressive 2014
Kia Soul it and check the tech now the
Kia Soul is a car that has never hidden
its quirk never hidden its soul if you
will but if you think this thing is a
joke the joke's on you it sells like mad
in fact the soul in 2013 in the US
outsold the Scion xB the Honda Fit and
the Nissan Cube combined by another 40%
put another way it sells as many as BMW
sells 3-series in America every year
this is a bonafide homerun let's find
out why now inside this theme of getting
a lot for a little is really pronounced
this is one of the nicer looking cabins
in a little cheap car you're gonna see
now admittedly we are full trim on this
car but here is your 8 inch touchscreen
LCD with optional navigation this is not
your base head unit in any soul but it's
a well packaged option as you're gonna
find that at the end of the piece it
only gives you some basics there's no 3d
bird's-eye mode this is what you're
gonna see it doesn't have Google search
to NAV it doesn't have any of the really
fancy later stuff but the guts work
really well it's bright it's colorful
they do a very good job of calling
things out at a glance I think and since
there's no controller it's touch your
voice only both need to work well so as
you're gonna see as is always the case
with Hyundai and Kia I don't know how
they do this they have the fastest
responding touchscreens
in the industry nobody can touch these
people and I don't know why and the
voice command works well in expensive
car but it still lets you do a big price
car trick which is enter the destination
is one burp
find a dress please say the editors in
California 2 3 5 second Street San
Francisco
you can say start guidance trying again
okay quick and painless got it right the
first time that's the way navigation
should be now let's talk about the media
settings here's where things get a
little bit kind of crunchy as you can
see we have radio and media divvied up
into two buckets I always hate that and
when you go to media it immediately goes
to the last one I was using but where
are my other sources
if I hit media again I go to this medium
menu but that's not everything either
because there are also some apps that
you don't see here so I got to close
that go back to I forget some kind of a
main menu here we go under all menus and
there I'm gonna find Pandora
so it's this scattered mess of stuff
spread all over the interface when you
get to Pandora the frustration continues
look at that works only with an iOS
device and only with a cable no
bluetooth streaming for the app support
and no Android devices or Windows or
Blackberry so super limited for app
support what may be able to save this
though is that Kia is part of that
recent Apple announcement of supporting
iOS in the dash so perhaps the 2015 Sol
is gonna bring up the iPhone in a really
iPhone style as we've seen previewed
we'll see also Kia's sister company
Hyundai signed on in January of 2014 to
support Android in the dash which may
then trickle over to Kia so there are a
couple ways this could fork but right
now this is not your apps powerhouse
beyond that your sources are pretty
classic am/fm Sirius HD radio is here
but it's optional and you've got USB and
auxiliary jack notice what you don't
have no CD this is one of those first
cars to say that's it CDs are dead not
available period this is interesting the
satellite radio automatically records
the channels in your first six presets
and lets you pause play and jump
segments I've seen one channel before
but not six automatically it's kind of
like a high-end multi tuner DVR let's
talk about how you hear your media we
have an optional infinity sound system
with a center speaker not to be confused
with a center channel as far as I can
tell this is not a surround system this
is just a system with a center speaker
there's an important difference there
and we've also got a subwoofer in the
back also optional are the speaker
lights you remember these it's a Kiev
rings around the speaker that either
glow in colors randomly or follow the
music like one of those weird color
organs at RadioShack used to sell back
in the 70s and here's the knob that
controls it over here you can turn it
off blessedly
or if you're really into it you can
crank it way up now unlike some $80,000
Mercedes I can think of this guy gives
you a rear camera stock and that's on
this trim level by the way it's a simple
one though but look how big and clear
and bright it is that's a very good rear
camera for doing what our rear cam
supposed to do show you it's back there
you do have some color zones that
indicate how close you are to whatever
you're about to run into so here's a key
thing you got to know about the Kia Soul
they allow you to appoint it really
nicely that's part of why this car is
unusual in its sector look at it
panoramic glass roof a big boy you can
get on here as you can see this wheel is
heated that's also optional but bow it
gets really hot over here heated and
active ventilated front seats are
available same package brings you heated
rear seats you don't see that in the car
like this very often that glovebox
that's got an air conditioner in it this
driver's seat 10-way power adjustment
though oddly there's no memory for where
you adjust it to but the theme here is
little car that can be nice not just
cheap now one of the short chunky schnoz
of this car you find the quote big
engine this is the 2-liter sidesaddle
inline 4 it is a direct injected gas
engine no turbo something like that just
plain old naturally aspirated the
numbers 164 horse hundred and fifty-one
foot-pounds of torque
perfectly respectable especially
considering this guy only weighs 2,700
pounds that's 2,700 wind resisting
pounds given this shape as a result the
MPG is kind of underwhelming
23:38 is the rated on this with a one
choice only 6-speed automatic zero to 60
eventually if you drop down to a bass
sole you can get a 1.6 smaller engine
but a 6-speed manual a different driving
experience some 30 less horsepower but
it might be more engaging hard to say
let's get on the road now and see how
this package all comes together
now underway the soul doesn't have a lot
of soul to be honest the horsepower
looks good on paper it doesn't get
transmitted all that well I blame the
transmission aren't the engines fine but
this transmission is real kind of loopy
and vague in fact both Antoine and
myself has the double and triple check
the specs because we could have sworn
this was a CVT and that's not a
compliment on the other hand the ride
quality is good it's not super tense and
bouncing it hard like cars in this
category can be all souls every single
model comes with if they call flex steer
normal Sport and comfort steering
settings there's an intrusive but not
unpleasant engine no you hear that
little busy for working but it doesn't
make sounds like you know bolts in a
coffee grinder like some other vehicles
in this category I can think of a couple
other notes I think you've noticed
behind me you've got a lot of greenhouse
so you can see out of in this vehicle so
rearward visibility is quite nice the
fact that it doesn't have any blind spot
or lane departure or cross traffic tech
available is at least forgivable under
these kind of visible conditions now
you've probably heard you can get a sole
for under 16 grand that's true but not
this one once you get into this
exclamation mark trim level we're just
over 21,000 base delivered now to make
it seen that style you want the Sun and
sound package for 2,600 bucks to get the
panoramic roof infinity sound speaker
lights
unfortunately 8-inch with Nav HD radio
it's a screaming deal but really go
beyond that and get what they call the
whole shebang which adds to that HID
headlights a centre LCD between the
gauges push button start that's where
you get the leather trim heated and
cooled front seats heated rear seats
heated steering wheel we're kind of
talking about a little baby Korean
Bentley at this point
now what Kia's done here for about
twenty six thousand dollars all loaded
up CNET style his create a car that
speaks to the modern market where they
want something very small quite
affordable but also with lots of quality
premium touches that aren't just
gimmicks the text pretty good I think it
might get better in the 2015
