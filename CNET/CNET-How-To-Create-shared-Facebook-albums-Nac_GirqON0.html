create collections of photos from
multiple users they're called shared
albums and they're great for parties
weddings and holidays where everyone's
snapping pictures and needs one communal
place to share them so there are two
ways to get started with shared albums
the first is to find an album you
already have and open it up to friends
on your computer click photos from the
side bar then select the album's tab
select an album you want to let others
contribute to and then press the button
for make shared album from here you'll
be prompted to name the friends you'd
like to contribute to the album you can
also dictate what level of visibility
the album will have so if the pictures
look like scenes from the hangover part
4 you can limit the privacy to just the
contributors but if the photos are
g-rated or you simply have no shame you
can go all the way up to public now this
can be a little confusing just because
the shared album is public doesn't mean
that any random person can contribute a
photo it just means that anyone can see
it contributors have to be invited
individually and once they're invited
they can also invite more people a total
of fifty people can contribute to a
single shared album and each person can
share up to 200 photos now as the
creator of a shared album you have
privileges that no one else has first
you have the power to delete anyone's
photos contributors can only delete
their own photos from the album they
can't touch anyone elses also you have
the power to kick people out of the
album to do this you go to the album
click the edit button and then click the
X next to any contributors name now
finally the second way to create a
shared album is to create one from
scratch as usual click the photos option
from the side bar then select create
album from the top right select the
photos you want to upload give the album
a name and then select that same make
shared album button name your
contributors select your privacy and hit
save the album you created will show up
on your timeline as well as the
timelines of anyone you invited from
their perspective they'll get a
notification that you shared an album
with them and when they click on the
album they can add their own photos by
clicking the add for
but next to the album title they can
also add additional people by hitting
the ad contributors button entering
additional names and hitting ad so there
you go that's how to get started with
shared albums on facebook for more how
to's like this head over to how to cnet
com I'm Donnell bell for cnet I'm
tagging myself from photos as quickly as
I can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
