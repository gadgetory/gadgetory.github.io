here with the Frigidaire Gallery f G H I
to 1/6 for Q F now this is a top freezer
refrigerator that retails for $1,300
that's about as much as top freezer to
go for and it's got a very nice
stainless steel build on the outside
with frigidaires smudge proof stainless
steel finish so it's a little better
than the average stainless steel fridge
at repelling fingerprints inside you've
got twenty point five cubic feet of
total storage space fifteen point four
of which are allocated to the fridge
that's a nice number but not quite the
biggest top freezer that we've tested
probably the key feature of the interior
is this custom flex door and that's this
door with all these kind of modular
attachments you can put in where you
want different things like a butter bin
and drawers and a little rack for your
sodas a little mini bin for kids snacks
you can kind of customize this to your
heart's content
and each of these units cost about 15
bucks if you wanted to buy a second
thing for soda or a second kid bin
pretty easy to pick up online and stick
it right in the fridge wherever you want
once you've got everything you want you
can move things around by sliding them
along these little sliders here it's
kind of sticky at times but overall
pretty nice so there's a lot to like
about this fridge that might have you
tempted to splurge but I say not so fast
on the upgrades take a look at this
performance results this is the fridge
running at the default setting for three
days with an average temperature for
each region inside and as you can see
everything is up above 40 those are not
good averages the default setting should
usually get you closer to 37 or 38 and
so that's why it's all orange that's not
good at all even down at the coldest
setting dialed down to something that
should be about 33 or 34 degrees we're
still getting very high numbers
including some hot spots those orange
regions in the top and bottom of the
fridge and then a door just not good
performance not good enough if you're
upgrading and spending little extra on
this thing for my money there are better
top freezer upgrades out there this
kenmore unit that we tested just a few
weeks ago that's a much better
performing unit and also a bigger fridge
so I say go with something like that
instead of this for more check out my
full review at cnet.com and follow me on
twitter if you need any fridge advice
for seeing that I'm right Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
