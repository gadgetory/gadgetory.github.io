3d cat whoa Oh yep yep but it's working
oh my god wait that's crazy
whoa it's kind of fun
she's like 3d without 3d glasses it's
really bad yeah I don't like it's
possibly because I'm very old
yeah and suffers from the same problem
the 3d film does and that it's
distracting I have so many questions
right now that range from like why
why indeed why would you put 3d on a
phone I think I know why it's fun it's
cool it's weird and it's kind of awesome
what it is this is a regular 2d screen
and underneath it they have this nano
light technology and it makes things
appear 3d and that's why if I'm looking
at Instagram which is a 2d app it looks
2d but that go to hala pics and app by
red I see all my photos in 3d pretty
cool and just remember this video you're
watching is in 2d and any of the images
from the phone will not be in 3d with 3d
what's interesting as soon as you
mention it this little filter goes off
in people's mind because I don't know if
anyone's ever seen truly good 3d I know
I haven't now if I said hey take a look
at this picture of my cat and it's a 2d
photo no matter how good it was if she's
doing something cute you'd be like oh
you cat but if I showed you a 3d photo
of my cat all of a sudden you start
becoming aware that you're looking at a
3d photo you start not only looking at
the cat but you're looking at all the
imperfections or the differences that a
3d photo does and I think that's the
biggest hurdle we have with 3d right now
this gets pretty close there's a time
where I'm watching a clip from the Pixar
move you're brave and you're shooting an
arrow there's a thing called the
hydrogen Network which I can look at
videos and I can rent movies that are
done in 3d there's this laya app like
the princess and it allows me to play 3d
video games which is pretty cool there's
a thing called hollow pics which allows
it's kind of like a 3d Instagram and not
on here yet but a demo I had was for a
video messaging app that was in 3d and
that is pretty cool I think
so let's talk about these cameras so
right now on the back if you have a dual
rear camera and a dual rear camera on
the front now if you take a close look
at the dual rear cameras in the back and
you look at them compared to something
like the iPhone or a galaxy phone pretty
much any phone with dual grill cameras
you notice one difference off the bat is
they're further apart than other dual
cameras that's how they're able to
capture 3d video and 3d photos also
they're the same camera like one's not
telephoto one's not black-and-white they
do the exact same thing and they're
paired stereoscopically
but as far as pictures on this when I
take a picture they look pretty good I
like the way they look they don't have
the digital perfection of a pixel three
photo or even the smart HDR on an iPhone
they have more of a kind of an analog
film quality so if I was to take a
picture in an old camera and got the
film developed they look more natural
because of that and I like that take a
look at these photos took of my friend
Becca this is using the portrait mode on
this phone and it looks pretty good look
you kind of had one job read you guys to
amazing cinema video and video out of
here and daylight looks pretty good but
it's very cropped in especially 4k it's
noisy it's a little soft especially if I
could pair it to something like the
iPhones video again the iPhone is
designed to just shoot that video out
it's gonna look great
just as is but I could take these video
files and using an app on this phone and
try to clean them up I just don't have
that app yet so when I look at the
videos I'm a little disappointed even in
slow motion ah slow motions like 720 at
120 frames per second very sad Patrick I
just wanted really good video however
that's not the full end of the story
parlor is nearby on this phone is
because of these little copper Pogo pens
and that's gonna be four modules and
there's two that we know that are coming
out one's gonna be a battery module and
the other is going to be a cinema camera
module which has a larger sensor and
even has a lens mount so you could put
on a canon lens or you can put on a
Nikon lens or whatever lens you want and
when that comes on
then we're gonna really truly see the
true cinema power in this camera but out
of my pocket without that module it's ok
at video it's not horrible so let's talk
about it as a phone it's big it's made
of aluminum it's probably the size of a
razor phone too however if this thing is
built is like built like a camera it
just feels nice and dense and solid it's
more solid and dense than pretty much
any phone I can remember picking up and
I like that feel it has Kevlar on the
back got a headphone jack has a 5.7 inch
display and the colors look nice even
when it's not in 3d it's a very nice
bright display perhaps my favorite
feature on here is the giant 4500
milliamp hour battery this thing lasted
around 14 hours an hour battery test
which is really good in its existing
form I think the 3d is really neat I am
entertained by it I love that aha moment
when I show it to people for the first
time however the thing that's so
frustrating is I have no one to share
this content with I can't send it to my
dad or brother because they don't have a
red hydrogen phone I can't send it to
co-workers who don't have one either
and right now that's the biggest limit
is getting that 3d content out someplace
but if you've been watching this video
and any part of its been like that's
pretty cool I would kind of dig that
then you should definitely go check this
phone out
but if you've watched this whole video
and you're still asking why this phone
is probably not for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
