the 4th Windows RT tablet yet released
and is the best one
since the Microsoft Surface when those
RT is simply the light version of
Windows 8 with RT you still have access
to the Metro interface and all of the
ARM based apps from the Windows Store
you can get full Windows eight versions
of Microsoft Office and Internet
Explorer what you don't get is the
ability to run other normal Windows
programs so from a design perspective
how's a yoga different well unlike every
other RT tablet the yogas keyboard is
permanently attached I can fold back
into a number of revealing poses
there's laptop mode then there's what I
like to call downward dog mode good for
just using the tablet on a desk if you
want to watch movies and be able to
easily adjust the display there's this
mode and if you simply want to go full
tablet just fold the keyboard back and
you have this the only problem with this
is that it makes for a pretty thick
tablet because like I said you can't
separate screen from keyboard and at two
point six pounds that's kind of a bummer
to carry around still that same weight
makes it a pretty light laptop the yoga
has an eleven point six inch screen
that's about 1.5 inches larger than most
tablet screens and about an inch larger
than surface thanks to the larger screen
the tablet has a wider than usual
keyboard and is a bit more comfortable
to type on than smaller tablets
left-side physical features include a
headphone jack a full USB port a full
HDMI port speaker grille and a volume
rocker on the front is a power button
and on the right edge is a charging port
a full SD card slot another full USB
port and another speaker grille and the
top of the bezel is a 1 megapixel
front-facing camera navigation
performance opening apps stuff like that
is as snappy as it is on surface but web
speeds were consistently a few seconds
behind the yoga eleven comes at 64 gigs
of storage for six
$49 that price does include a larger
screen that most tablets and a built-in
keyboard surface makes for a better
standalone tablet for the yoga's
flexible keyboard in many full-size
ports will make it appealing for those
looking for a productivity laptop
