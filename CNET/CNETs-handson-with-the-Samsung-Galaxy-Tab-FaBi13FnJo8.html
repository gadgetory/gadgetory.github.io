show travel down the hall was also a
telephone and only by this time from
actually make calls with us this is the
home screen of the samsung galaxy tab as
you can see it's got a pretty nice
display it's an LCD display samsung took
a little flack for not going for mo lead
but they cited costs and power
consumption concerns maybe we'll see one
of those in future years Samsung has a
lot of display experience so this is
with one of the live backgrounds they're
really rich on this relatively large
screen for an Android device as you can
see you can slide around see different
screens there are five home screens
available here's the gadget for facebook
if you want to add a new gadget you can
simply hold down on the screen it will
provide you with some options we'll put
a new widget say the daily briefing
perhaps and it loads up pretty fast so
that's very convenient as with all
android devices so far you have the home
screen of course you can also get more
options if you click the applications
button this shows you all the
applications that are installed one that
I thought showed off the tab screen
really nicely with Google Earth will
load that up takes a minute for it to
load
it's a nice little geographic
exploration application here put in
landscape mode it's got a nice ability
to take advantage of the multi-touch
user interface here for example you can
change the view you can zoom in with
pinch you can rotate with by turning two
fingers zoom in a little bit more it
takes a while for the imagery to upload
but it's very nice and flick to zoom
around so it's fairly impressive
application on a screen this size with
multi-touch interface when it comes to
productivity apps these tablets are an
interesting new option because they of
course can show a lot more screen real
estate for reading email or checking
calendars one thing I liked about this
tablet is the
calendar actually seemed to take a lot
more advantage of the screen real estate
so there's some views of that however I
have to say that the email application
left me a little cold this is the
built-in email app that can talk to
exchange servers and I think it could
use the screen real estate a little bit
better if you one nice thing about it if
you have it in landscape mode then you
can see your email on the left your
inbox on the left and your contents on
the right but even when its vertical I
prefer to be able to see a bit more this
also applies to the google mail
application which i find has text it can
be a lot smaller it's nice to have an
option for large text but it would be
very handy to have to be able to read
more as you go one of the popular
applications here at the IFA show that
everybody is trying out is NFS shift
this is a car racing amplification from
EA as you can see
takes a little while for it to load
it's one of these drive around games and
it's a work in progress so some of the
glitches are unfortunate but not that
start a new race
this doesn't use the most advanced
graphics when it comes to actually
rendering while you're driving but it's
fairly respectable
it was pretty clear that we're going to
have a lot more android games hitting
the market as we have some nice displays
like this to show it off
clearly I'm not a born car racing
aficionado there
to the boost
and a crash video is a nice aspect of
the samsung galaxy tab and we launched
the video application here you get
number of options this works better in
landscape mode obviously let's watch one
of these videos here I've found
generally the video to be fairly high
quality sometimes lags but mostly even
during fast transitions it tends to play
very smoothly first the video option on
the tab here that's interesting is you
can connect it to your TV via hdmi which
is something of a novelty
there's also YouTube video let's go back
to the home screen
you can watch any number of online
videos if you like he nodded I just load
one up here to see looks like it's
pretty fast over Wi-Fi
and a fairly impressive high quality
display for streaming video on a small
tablet device one of the areas that
Samsung likes to highlight is the leader
application you can check out news if
you like their number of pages
photography oh here in Germany some tips
poke up zoom in
real newspaper takes a minute for it to
render a nice version we go back here
take a look at a book the book reader
seems reasonable sometimes it seems a
lag for me but that might just be a
matter of downloading take a look at
Michael Lewis the big short to see how
it works here so you flick to the right
there's no animation so you have to kind
of understand that you're changing pages
you can change a number of settings
versus day mode very handy you can
change fonts firms serif to sensory if
you prefer
and you can of course change the font
size if you want it to be larger or
smaller the tab comes with the swipe
interface for the keyboard if you like
that and we'll show you how that works
basically you just slide your fingers
over the words so you can type noaw for
example is it does good job T IME does
time and if you do like a little loop
it'll do two letters like a ll or g 00 d
so swipe is it fairly useful I actually
found I could touch type faster with
this nice large screen real estate here
it's not so constrained as a mobile
phone so swipe it's kind of a matter of
personal preference but it's definitely
not as necessary on device this size as
it is on a mobile phone
your built-in browser works pretty well
as you can say you can click on links
and they'll load reasonably fast at
least on this Wi-Fi connection you can
show the responsiveness of this
scrolling it's pretty good here can
follow links depending on the complexity
of the page I've been taking a while to
load but it's generally much better than
with a mobile phone as with Android
phones if you double tap it will zoom in
on a particular aspect of the screen
it's also available multi-touch is also
available so you can use multiple
fingers to change the size and a single
finger to pan around of course android
system still have a back button so you
can go back to where you used to be tap
comes the music hub application that's
powered by 7digital you can see here and
with it you can click on various tracks
and see how they sound you can see here
we get a one-minute clip a lot of songs
I've tried were just a 30 seconds but
it's a nice way to preview and of course
then you can buy the songs if you have
an account this one cause 9999 tents in
the UK
here's a look at the Android Market on
the galaxy tab loads a lot faster than
the Android Market on most mobile phones
I've used you can then look in and see
what the apps are it was relatively fast
if you're scrolling through this of
course it has to download the thumbnails
as it goes so that was always a little
bit of lag there check out the different
categories and the games are a relative
weakness of Android compared to the iOS
ecosystem that Apple's help build but
things are definitely improving now oh
nice feature of the galaxy tab we
haven't see on most Android devices is
extra use of the status bar here you'll
notice in the status bar you have
different options for turning hardware
off or on or changing configuration you
can put it in silent mode take it out in
silent mode you can lock the orientation
so it won't flip obviously you rotate it
and turn the bluetooth off and on no
bluetooth devices here it's particularly
handy if you are working with GPS which
uses a lot of battery power you can turn
it on and then turn it off and you don't
want it anymore</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
