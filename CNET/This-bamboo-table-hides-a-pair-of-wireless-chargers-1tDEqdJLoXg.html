the HEPA conference in Berlin Germany
we're here to take a look at the phone
salesman Wernicke wireless charging side
table so this is a prototype device it's
going to ship by Christmas if it's
indiegogo campaign is successful so what
it is is a bamboo table looks very slick
feels good nice and smooth it has two
key wireless charging pucks built into
the bottom of it here in the top you can
see these kind of discs cut into the
table let you know where to put your
phone or whatever other wireless device
you want to charge you have to run
cables into each of these pucks in order
to give them power but the table comes
with Clips so you can run the cable down
the side of the leg and there just
straight up USB cable so you can plug it
into any adapter in the wall pretty
simple there to play here is that this
is higher quality they say easier to
assemble just four allen screws on the
bottom and overall just looks really
good it's nice and light weight and
they'll ship anywhere in the world
these guys make other wireless charging
products that have a standalone puck
that plugs into the wall new puck in
these and we've noticed they were a
little bit quirky in a demo we saw here
they're working on it hopefully they'll
get it worked up by the time they ship
assuming the campaign is successful so
