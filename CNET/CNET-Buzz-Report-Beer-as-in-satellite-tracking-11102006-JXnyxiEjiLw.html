buzz report and now for the gadget of
the week the gadje of the week is the
microsoft zune it hits the market on
tuesday november 14th and it is a hotly
anticipated entry into the mp3 player
market now we got an early look at the
device and you know it looks pretty
decent it comes in brown which is kind
of neat the lack of compatibility with
place for sure is kind of a bummer and
the integrated Wi-Fi features are
interesting but maybe not a major reason
to buy but the real problem I think
might be the size I mean it's not like
horribly huge well I don't know I'll let
you decide for yourself what do you
think not that bad right and now for the
news as you know this week was election
day here in the United States and
millions of Americans cast their votes
on controversial electronic voting
machines but I'm happy to report that
there wasn't a single problem with any
Evo ting machines in fact our new
president r2d2 calls it the smoothest
election he's ever seen did we even vote
for president on Tuesday in other
election news after years of ignoring
the contributions of bloggers and
so-called citizen journalists CNN tried
to bring them into the tent during this
week's election return coverage they
held a blogger party where they
periodically check in on influential
internet writers and ask them for their
opinions then they get back to the real
news anchors and get on with their jobs
pretty much the same strategy is normal
dutch beer maker Heineken has developed
a new system for tracking its beer using
satellite technology the system works a
little something like this excuse me the
civil liberties group Reporters Without
Borders has named its annual list of
enemies of the Internet the group says
countries like Egypt Cuba Iran China
North Korea and Turkmenistan are
restricting freedom of expression online
but you know what here at buzz
headquarters we have a different list in
fact I humbly present you the buzz
reports top 5 enemies of the internet
number 5 Stephen Colbert Stephen Colbert
encouraged people to edit Wikipedia to
add false information about African
elephant
if you can't trust a fake conservative
on his fake new show to protect the
integrity of a fake encyclopedia who can
you trust number four senator ted
stevens on second thought i'm not so
sure about this one I mean is it fair to
call a guy an enemy of the internet when
he coined one of the funniest analogies
for the internet that I've ever heard
the internet is the series of shows ya
know I'm changing my vote Ted Stevens
champion of the tubes number three borut
Sacha Baron Cohen refuses to acknowledge
similarities between his Borat character
and 1999 internet celebrity my hair
Kadri who became famous for his I kiss
you website which contained invitations
for women to come stay at his house and
have sex with him but that's
understandable I mean that's not nearly
offensive enough material for barratt
number two BitTorrent if the movie
studios didn't have to spend so much
time and money fighting you guys they
could be building a sensible open
platform to digitally distribute movies
to the public or reasonable prices damn
you BitTorrent quit screwing around and
let those good people get back to work
and number one Britney Spears if she
wasn't taking up all the search results
for hot blonde on the internet then I'd
be number one boom enemy of the Internet
I'm mollywood and this is done the bus
