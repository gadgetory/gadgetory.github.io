things short and sweet it's not
surprising that Twitter released a new
app that lets you upload six-second
videos Valve's called vine it's
available for iOS devices and is already
being called the Instagram for video
let's take a look so when you launch the
app for the first time you'll be asked
to login by connecting with Twitter or
by using your email address once you're
all set up you'll see a feed of videos
uploaded by people you follow we'll get
to that in a minute and some editors
picks right now it's a lot of babies
dogs food and stop-motion video the
interface is pretty cool actually as you
scroll through videos and the feed
they'll autoplay with sound and if you
want to you can tap on a video at any
point deposit some of these videos do
move really fast so you'll want to get
comfortable with that feature now below
each video you'll see people who liked
it and comments and buttons for liking
and commenting on the video yourself ok
let's check out the other tabs tap on
the icon in this corner and you can
navigate to Explorer which lets you
browse by topic like how to nature or
food you can enter a tag or user name in
the search field up here or you can dig
around these curated collections like
editors picks or popular now there's
also an activity menu where you'll see
news about who's following you and who's
liking or commenting on your videos ok
and last of all is the profile tab here
you'll see all of your vine videos your
likes and if you tap this icon in the
corner you can add people by searching
for them in your address book Twitter
Facebook or by name also back in the
profile tab is your settings here take a
moment to fill in things like your bio
location and link vine to your social
networks down here so that you can share
your videos see
mostly now that I have all of that
filled out I think it's time to upload
my very first vine so I have this lunch
salad that I need to assemble and I'm
thinking that it might make for a good
vine video all right check out my
components and I'll need a plate let me
show you how to record a vine from the
home menu I'll select the video icon
here in the corner and the camera will
launch okay shooting video with vine is
a little different from what you're used
to to record hold down and to pause let
go you can keep doing this as many times
as you want until you hit 6 seconds so
since I can't make the salad and shoot
the video at the same time Chris is
going to help me shoot the video while I
assemble the salad alright so first to
go down is our letters and he'll do a
couple seconds of this next we'll do a
little avocado some cubed oranges
sprinkle some nuts and finally I'll hit
it with a little dressing alright so now
that we're done shooting it I can
preview the video and in the next window
I can add a caption if you want to do
include some hashtags I'll add some here
so hopefully anyone searching for food
or lunch will come across my vine video
finally I'll choose my sharing settings
tap Done and my video will be posted and
there it is right at the top of my
stream alright now it's your turn if
you're just uploading your first vine
tweet it to me and Android users
just sit tight Twitter does say its apps
should be coming to you very soon for
cnet.com I'm Sharon Vaknin it's time to
eat those salad
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
