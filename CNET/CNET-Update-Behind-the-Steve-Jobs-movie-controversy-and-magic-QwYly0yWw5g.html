movie there was controversy and magic
I'm Bridget Carey this is your scene
that update Steve Jobs had a profound
impact on the technology we carry in our
pockets today and in the movie that
bears his name screenwriter Aaron Sorkin
paints a picture of the difficult to do
with genius by going behind the scenes
of three of his major product launches
starring Michael Fassbender his jobs the
entire movie in all dialogue with major
people in his life happens 30 minutes
before he's about to get on stage three
different times to present the first
Macintosh in 1984 the next black cube
computer in 1988 and the imac ten years
later in 1998 I got to see a screening
of the film and Sorkin's writing makes
it an intellectual entertaining movie
but his template makes it implausible
that jobs would have all these amazing
conflicting conversations that sum up
his life and personal character flaws
with all these key people including his
daughter 30 minutes before showtime but
hey that's how serkan makes you feel the
pressure and drama at a Q&amp;amp;A with the
audience after the screening Sorkin and
director danny boyle shared some
interesting tidbits from making the
movie and the drama going on with
pushback from people who knew jobs the
movie is releasing friday in a cloud of
controversy with several high profile
people who knew and work with jobs
speaking out against the film including
tim cook and jony ive of apple and there
are leaked emails and reports about jobs
as widow trying to stop the release of
the movie to that note Sorkin says he
doesn't begrudge jobs his wife laureen
for what she's feeling after all jobs
died four years ago this week but Sorkin
says these people have not seen the
movie or read the screenplay and says if
they do he thinks they'd be pleasantly
surprised Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak
agreed to help out with the movie as a
paid consultant and as Sorkin and Boyle
described he's a sweet guy that's really
into magic tricks these days in the
movie he was played by actor Seth Rogen
so to get to know him better Rogen went
with was to a mecca for magicians the
magic castle in Los Angeles it's a club
for magicians in the area and woz road
they're on a Segway but not just any
Segway it was apparently the first
Segway ever made but the headlight was
busted so he had to tape a flashlight to
the
yeah what a character woz also perform
magic tricks at dinner with the film's
creators but as Boyle said he quote
didn't do them particularly well and
sore can also shared his perspective on
jobs the man and that he shares
something in common with facebook
founder mark zuckerberg Sorkin said he
believes that deep down Steve Jobs felt
he was irreparably damaged in some way
and was not worthy of being liked or
loved and that these computers were
something jobs needed to resolve those
issues Sorkin who also wrote the movie
the social network said Zuckerberg also
created something he needed at the time
a way for an uncomfortable 19 year old
to socialize Steve Jobs is in select
theaters Friday opening nationwide on
october 23rd and that's it for this tech
news update there's more at cnet com
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
