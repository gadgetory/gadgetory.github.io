the apple byte it's everything inside
the world of Apple let's get to it now
Apple's latest iPad air is getting all
the attention since you know it's
apple's latest new shiny toy so we'll
get to all the news around it but we
always like to look forward to what's
coming from Apple and even if the new
mac pro looks like an idea co tubular
trash can you can actually buy this
online right now primate labs is added
again with their Geekbench 3 benchmarks
and have estimated the new Mac Pro
performance based on apple's mac pro
specification page now you can dig in
deeper for yourself but their
estimations show that single core
performance will be similar for 46 and
eight core models but will be fifteen
percent slower for the 12 core model
because of its lower turbo boost
frequency now obviously in multi-core
performance the 12 core model will
perform the best with heavily threaded
applications that can take advantage of
it this thing is really beast then
primate labs also matched up the new mac
pro's and how they're expected to
perform compared for the last generation
of mac pro's with single core
performance being up to 50 and 75
percent faster in some cases and
multi-core performance being up to forty
seven percent faster than current 12
core models the new mac pros are still
expected in december so we'll see how
these results match up all right onto
iPad news and AT&amp;amp;T says iPad activations
have more than tripled compared to last
year's ipad launch the new iPad Mini is
still not available yet and it doesn't
mean Apple has sold three times the
amount of iPads but it's a good sign so
far now also a breakdown of the latest
iPad air from I supply reveals that
Apple is able to move to Sharp's IGZO
display technology shrinking down the
backlight assembly of the air using only
36 LEDs compared to 84 in the earlier
generation and allowing for a sleeker
and lighter tablet this is also allowed
for a smaller battery while still
getting similar battery life results now
I'm loving the lighter feel and design
of the ipad air and if you're still
hunting to find out if an apple store
has the model you're looking for it
might be a little tougher that's after
website Apple tractor calm was served a
dmca takedown notice by Apple now the
site offered a more efficient way of
checking product availability for all
ipad air models by color capacity and
connectivity at the closest 20 apple
retail stores nearby now the big a
notice use jargon like you may not use a
deep link page scrape robot spider or
other automatic device program algorithm
or methodology blah blah blah but let's
just keep it real guys that's a bad
apple and there's still the bigger iPad
rumor floating around after chinese
website pad news reports that Foxconn is
in the advanced stages of testing out a
new large format ipad that would support
a display of either 11.4 or 12.9 witches
and could be targeted for a march 2014
release really giving credibility to the
product name maxi pad that the apple
byte coined as far back as 2009 now in
some other cool developments after we'll
be building a new 700 employees sapphire
glass manufacturing plant for Apple
components in mesa arizona according to
the state of arizona which is also home
of the Grand Canyon National Park it
leads the nation in copper production
and petrified wood is the official state
fossil I don't know if that's something
to be proud of the big egg continues to
push its initiative for assembling and
now manufacturing some of its products
in the United States an apple already
uses sapphire glass to protect its
cameras on I devices and the home button
for the touch ID equipped iPhones now
the connection that everyone wants to
believe is the potential for it to
supply parts for the rumored iWatch
especially since sapphires already used
on high-end watches and could be more
feasible on a smaller screen compared to
an iphone or ipad and this may not be
the sexiest story out there but apple
recently released a report called a
report on government information request
after all the recent news about online
surveillance conducted by the united
states national security agency now in
the report apple says the vast majority
of requests it gets are related to lost
or stolen devices but a small fraction
of requests were related to personal
information on iTunes iCloud or your
game center account now Apple reiterated
that their business does not depend on
collecting personal data which is true
to a certain extent alright guys on the
quick bites Apple's responding to
complaints about the entire iwork suite
after its recent facelift removed
features that long time I works users
were used to apple says they'll be
offering software updates over the next
six months to address important things
like customizing the toolbar across all
apps and bringing back many other
features but Apple suggest using I works
oh nine that was previously installed on
your machine yikes also check out this
new iPhone app called knock that works
in combination with a mac app the app
uses Bluetooth Low Energy to communicate
and when the two are near each other
just knock on your phone and it unlocks
the mac without having to enter in any
password it's kind of gimmicky and kind
of cool at the same time so check it out
the knock app is 399 and here's a clip
from the Jimmy Kimmel show worth
watching five-year-old boy genius arden
Hayes who can talk politics and world
geography again this kid is five years
old also knows a little bit about tech
hey Guillermo bring out the presence we
have some presents for you alright guys
you're probably wondering what is going
on here but I'm gonna tell you the day
after we shot the show ABC took down
that clip and then reposted it without
the ending so here's what happened the
boy genius he got a sony xperia tablet
but then gave it back to jimmy and said
he was gonna get an ipad for christmas
instead so it makes me wonder why would
ABC take down that video did sony give
him the tablet hmm back to you Brian
alright before we go you all know I'm a
huge NBA fan and the season just kicked
off so call it a gift from me and my
friends at 2k sports to you I'm giving
away two copies of NBA 2k14 one for the
ps3 and one for the xbox 360 all you
guys got to do and gals is send me a
picture of you rocking your best NBA
gear pose do whatever it takes and I'll
