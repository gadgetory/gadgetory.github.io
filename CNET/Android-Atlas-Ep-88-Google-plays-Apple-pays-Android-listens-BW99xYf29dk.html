listens all that more on this week's
edition of welcome android Alice weekly
for March eat the 2012 special day I'm
Justin Eckhouse alongside jmark BB hello
and from New York City special guests
brian bennett is he there there is some
guys I like Harry good yeah thanks for
joining us we have an action-packed show
oh yeah isn't that what you're thinking
that's exactly nothing we are going to
fight to the death of three of us that's
why people tuned in android atlas for
the action well there was a there are
some interesting news this week actually
some interesting slightly confusing news
to me that maybe you guys can help me
understand so Android Market point away
or didn't go away or is kind of
different but is now called Google Play
does what if you want to walk me through
this what this means so dish android
market still exist right yes yeah okay
but then there's a google play thing
what is that it's part of google play
the android market so it's basically to
me it looks like just a big rebranding
thing so so the new google play rolls up
the sale of apps music movies TV shows
all that stuff books also android market
used to be the place you would go to buy
in addition to apps which i think
everyone knows movies and music and
books even if you work on an Android
device yes yeah i mean i think you could
buy that through there through the
website through a desktop Chrome browser
but actually the thing is is that and I
understand what you're saying as far as
a confusion goes because from what I
understand it hasn't actually hit many
phones yet right the new play app I
haven't seen it yet
seen it I have liked the music app so
the music app suddenly said play I mean
the market still says market i believe
exactly yeah my phone yeah it's called
playing music from my phone still has
the market but I got it on my tablet on
my samsung galaxy 10 yeah but I mean
along with the market being updated to
the Google Play name you know the the
google music app it basically just
changed its name it's it's pretty much
the same app but now it says play music
and then and then there's a play videos
or something like that so they're
basically trying to roll up everything
into one interface eventually and so you
have one wish a one stop shop right yeah
I mean it's dropping it looks to me like
they just kind of wanted to brand it as
a google thing since it's going to be
experienced across a lot of different
devices not just Android devices and I
think you know I think it's really
confusing now but I think in the future
it's it's meant to be less confusing for
everybody you know considering this
there's going to be Google TV boxes in
people's homes and and this mysterious
media box that we've been hearing about
that Google's been developing so it's a
good forward-looking strategy a minute I
guess the way it has been it's kind of
like if the I don't know I was going to
give an example of how the apple app
store or iTunes was called something but
then I realized that itunes is actually
kind of confusing because it's called
itunes but then they have apps and
movies in there mmm rebrand that too I
play Apple do you think play yeah but I
do see what they're doing here you know
and Brian it kind of reminds me of uh
remember of like the marketing around
sony products a few years ago and it was
all about play and had a big play button
and like that show it like the ads would
just show up with a big you know people
you know very hip looking people walking
down the street on some set and also
this big like neon play button comes out
no we're on the brick wall you know it's
like kind of like this weird thing with
they're trying to consolidate all things
fun into one place so you're tempted to
pounce and start spending money you know
because I think it's all about money
really it's all about making you buy and
purchase you know their their goods that
they want to sell and they're going
ahead again head-to-head against amazon
and and you know the Apple services and
everything so you know hopefully it'll
make sense eventually I think it does I
think it's really going towards and get
ready get your glasses ready to drink
here because this is going to become our
drink word the ecosystem right it's
going towards like this isn't just a
phone thing this is tablet thing this is
a set-top box it connected TV thing a
refrigerator thing whatever this content
is available everywhere and when there's
a lot of Mobile World Congress stuff i
think that Eric Schmidt and Andy Rubin
talked about they really wanted to push
content as a means of adoption for
tablets like they felt like the reason
people were not using tablets as much or
binds many Android tablets was because
the content side wasn't up to par with
competitors and you know I think this is
one way to try and address that as sort
of say like hey look we actually have
all the content it's been hidden in this
thing called android market before but
really it's a Content marketplace and
one of the things that has is apps of
course but there's also movies music and
blah blah blah blah so go ecosystem yeah
you definitely what do I stricken over
there remember no comment okay but the
good thing for everybody is that a lot
of the apps and movies and books and
music are on sale now just to kind of
celebrate their launch for the first
week I think they're offering an app a
day for a quarter and then their top 25
paid apps or fifty cents each which is
severity swelling price right there
people that get in there and start
buying stuff yeah it's not the first
time they did that right all summer they
had like the 10-cent apps or
yeah not summer winter I don't know yeah
apps and they put music on sale before
it's kind of Google's go to strategy is
make things cheaper makes things free
yeah you know here's the thing the
problem I have with this unit guys have
you ever bought an android app recently
like that you really want that had to
buy that you couldn't get for free uh I
bought several during the 10-cent sale
I'm curious which ones did you bike so I
haven't actually run into an Android app
that I that I would actually buy the
bolt that's a bold statement didn't
right there but just it's interesting we
have the discussion actually when
Antolin was on because he was like I was
like who buys that many apt and he was
like I don't know I by like five or six
apps a month Hugh's behind mainly games
I have bought like SwiftKey 00 keyboard
replacement that's fifty cents right now
oh is it yeah I think I've had a couple
dollars i bought my podcast client which
is dog catcher and i think i bought a
game or two for my son but it's true i
have not bought that many apps because
maybe this is where you're going what
the android store has done compared to
sort of apple stores really pushed apps
to do add based apps rather than pay
apps hmm so there's usually a sort of a
lighter ad-supported alternative to
anything yeah i mean i find you know
whenever I set up a new phone you know
testing phones and I want to kind of get
the experience of the phone I you know
start porting over my apps and almost
all the apps some pretty much all the
apps i'm using are all free apps there
were like google services or just stuff
that's for free like you know tweetdeck
some of the twitter facebook stuff
whatever and maybe you know google
listen you know that's one thing i
actually am addicted to and it's failing
me so i'm really upset by that out there
you guys Google if you're listening man
what's up with google listen yeah that's
been terrible for years which is why i
bought dog catcher because like just
yeah yeah
it was well worth the six bucks to get
rid of all the frustration but point
taken how about content I mean so have
you bought movies music books um okay
well let's see I I have taken the plunge
and I did buy tracks from amazon so I
definitely have done that before and the
reason why is because I have a you know
I tend to spend money on amazon so they
got you locked into their ecosystem yes
oh I fell into that one um yeah so yes I
am I have been into that that ecosystem
there that you know was certainly you
know I I like it and it's be honest I've
tried google music and I have such a
horrible experience so far with it taken
forever to upload tracks and oh alright
such a pain so yeah so uh the paid
content i've used has been really it's
just been google music sorry uh yeah
amazon music amazon music and you know
let's see that's pretty much it honestly
I haven't really I guess so much as a
cheap guy yeah I'm gone too but I mean
an intense one bought a lot of games and
I think that's really the big difference
if you do play a lot of games then there
are a lot of you know premium titles
that right I think you might want to pay
for you know just like shadowgun and
plants vs zombies and things like that
those are ya not available for free and
their games that a lot of people love
especially people that are really into
gaming even outside of their phones you
know yeah indeed Oh actually I will
amend this statement i realized i
actually bought a bunch of google books
Oh believe it or not did you read them
on your phone or a tablet tablet yeah on
a galaxy samsung galaxy tab I think
you're the first person I have met who's
done that really amazing well i mean
i've bought amazon kindle butcher using
the app too but yes actually i find that
the google books interface is actually
pretty good now and i dig how it does
that
you know animated page flipping thing I
know it sounds lame but I books does
that oh yeah I don't know well just for
the record I've never owned an iOS
device okay we applaud you wow wow like
when I pick up an iphone it's like I'm
like whoa okay all right I I know I
remember how to do this now and then
then I'm like wait I can't do this
android does this you know I could do it
like that and Android soon or not and
Apple Spy is where's know regardless of
what people get email after the show
alright so that's google play for you
let's move on a little bit and talk
about the Google I don't know how we can
say it without saying that Siri
competitor or the serie killer I tried
to avoid it there but it was going to
come up is going to get awkward so we
had heard rumors before about the the
Star Trek themed how do you say it in
major major major major major oh yeah
there's a new story out that is sort of
on CNN news about the Google assistant
project which really is it's rumored to
be coming out later this year in the
fourth quarter and it's supposed to help
people complete tasks as opposed to sort
of the voice based search that Google
kind of has now but it also helps you
complete tasks a little bit because you
can say navigate or text but this one
does seem more down the Serie line and
unlike Siri it will let third-party
developers tap into the sort of that
platform the voice platform to enable
their own apps do that and and what
their the rumors are at this is all
rumors are saying is that its most it's
supposed to be a do engine rather than
sort of a search engine but it will have
the full power of google behind it
unlike siri which has some weird search
engine that isn't google behind it i
guess my question is is this the same as
major are these two independent projects
that are you know just going to converge
at some point or they're being developed
together are these the same people doing
this I I'm just a little bit confused
because we're you know we're kind of
hearing different stories here right
yeah I mean this is kind of par for the
course with rumors right that we hear
five different ones and one of them is
right right maybe some of them are
missing information campaign by Apple
spies mmm that's which name do you like
better though major or assistant I can
say assistant without questioning myself
of how it's supposed to be pronounced
but may joel is much geekier it is
assistance a little too generic I don't
think they would call him angel because
of copyright issues though is that right
I think maybe CBS owns the right to Star
Trek we're always playing in the lobby
trouble with tribbles right I think
you're right anyway I'm pretty excited
for this I you know any voice
recognition stuff to make things easier
especially when driving is great and it
is kind of cool that you know
third-party developers would be able to
tap into it you know maybe a yam or
something you can tell that game you
know buy me a siege tank right or your
text messaging application I mean some
of the problem with the voice
recognition apps that I've seen is that
you're sort of forced into using their
Twitter interface for their text
messaging and interface if I could chew
pick and choose the apps that I still
want to use but those apps could be
voice enabled that would be awesome very
cool it's just an ecosystem full voice
on occasion they'll you know what it'd
be all you guys are drinking I mean I'll
put in my two cents to I mean I've been
living the past week in Bluetooth world
pretty much checking out some headsets
and learning all about Bluetooth 40 and
everything and a lot of it ties in a lot
of these headset makers have their own
apps like you're saying for voice
commands and it gets a little confusing
but still you can just flip over to the
already built in google voice actions
kind of voice record recognition
features you know and use that instead
with the headset so i think if they
build it in greater functionality that's
more like
Siri dare I say then a lot of those apps
may kind of jump on the built-in and
enhanced features that are in the OS you
know so that that would be awesome you
know that would be awesome and I you
know I do I mean I gotta tell you
believe it or not windows phone has some
interesting voice command features in it
as well ouch yes who has enough I
believe I said that right I don't even
know anyone who has a windows form
that's crazy oh yeah what's windows
phone well it's like a phone right and
it's got like Microsoft software oh I
remember reading about that company yeah
they're making the eighties I think
comes with like a dot matrix printer if
you okay get the order you know if you
order within 24 hours a little paper
clip that helps you dial oh my gosh so
if you can't wait for Google assistant
there is well there's a couple apps out
but one that just came out recently or
yesterday I think at the launch
conference and this is called Robin and
this it this is a voice app specifically
aimed around driving um I like this name
by the way you like it this name work I
do Robin it's like you're robbing to
your Batman I think so I think that's
exactly what they're going for good but
I love it so we were trying this early
on and I'll try it here the idea is that
it sits there in your passenger seat and
you can theoretically although we could
not get this to work at all wave your
hand over the phone this is not the
phone you're looking for and you then
ask it about the parking situation or to
navigate for you or the weather or
traffic and get this it gets its traffic
information from Twitter what does that
even mean like it just looks for people
tweeting about bad traffic and then it's
like oh oh first of all like who would
be tweeting in traffic that's a lot of
DIC people a lot of people that's
illegal yes we
in some parts of country it's illegal
here so here is Robin you and I'll wave
my hand and we'll see if it talks oh did
it work first off I like a navigate to
San Francisco International Airport
directions from your location to San
Francisco int'l airport in san francisco
by cops go back is that right yes thing
crush him navigation I'll be on standby
a damn body me what I'm not quite sure
so navigation did work in our test but
the weather would never work I've asked
him what the weather was and all it
would say is I'm putting out on the
screen now and then it would just remain
on the map screen so it just came out
yesterday maybe they didn't test very
much against ice cream sandwich come the
other thing is I cannot feel life me
figure out how to quit this application
like I go home and my gps like the
little thing saying you know GPS
continue go away that makes for a funny
sketch it maybe that's the deal it just
noted i know it exactly is going on here
yeah yes well basically you tried this
yesterday right or was it today today
okay today it's no coincidence that
we're having a cuddle storm of
proportion all right and i think that
somehow this this device has becomes
aware of itself it's now going to be
reaching out all your appliances
actually know your TV is going to start
talking to you like this it's gonna be
really wild Skynet are you sure you want
to be watching The Real Housewives I'm
not so sure that's good for you anyway
it's in theory it's pretty cool maybe
wait a month and then download it or
maybe or does it works better on not ice
cream sandwich phones I don't really
know but I'll tell you one thing I am
getting hungry yes are you getting
hungry I am a little dessert yeah
yeah we've got we've got a dessert based
rumor for everybody all right back at us
so it is rumored that as we had
speculated the the next android OS after
jellybean would be called KitKat we had
speculated that but that is not in fact
the case according to this rumor it will
be called key lime pie I am a big fan of
key lime pie altea I don't know key lime
pie I I racked my brains last night
trying to think of other k letter
desserts and I know I could not come up
with anything that was from this country
those were yeah uh i mean yeah i love
jelly beans to it's so weird that um you
know jelly bean it hasn't making it
firmed right have you heard a
confirmation Brian about the jelly bean
name no I don't believe it has been but
I mean it makes me that that that makes
absolute sense actually you know what I
think it was confirmed I'm gonna go back
and take a look because i think it was
actually thank google did make a slip
recently and said that are you talking
about the jelly beans on the table at
the mo yong gress yeah yeah yeah there
what I think there was there was a kind
of a slip confirmation so though I gotta
tell you when I thought about this
because i was chatting with some buddies
in mind a few months ago we're talking
about what would be the next versions
you know and key lime pie did come up I
mean we thought about that immediately
we're like that would be awesome that's
such a good name because everybody loves
key lime pie right it's delicious I love
jelly beans too though right an ice
cream sandwiches well I just can't wait
till they release it because we did when
ice cream sandwich was released we ate
ice cream sandwiches yes so first we'll
have jelly beans i'll bring those in not
that exciting I like jelly beans a key
lime pie yeah I'll be excited that's
another level right there who's cooking
that Steven pin i'll pick it up pick it
up at the store ah store alright that'll
work bacon up its store anyway you guys
think about that we
going to take a quick break and we'll be
back with some more exciting news about
lawsuits and all sorts stuff and read
related stay with us
well we thought this was semi-official
that uh we would just eat jelly beans we
jump in got a little bit here wow I
can't get any mmm here have some oh man
catch whoever gonna have like 3d glasses
mmm you might have talked to rest the
show cuz this was a terrible mistake and
Richard start about the ecosystem source
local well custom water system you know
what I actually during the break I was
just double-checking now because you got
you wet my appetite for jelly beans and
yeah it doesn't look like it has
officially been you know confirmed
actually Billy I just got a message from
Kent from Chicago in the chat room and
he put the story in there that says asus
corporate vp confirms jellybean is the
next android OS hmm so this is from
marsh fifth okay there we go Lee
apparently just slip firmed it is a slip
are those Joe has been confirmed by
Google though I don't yeah so days is
corporate yeah like those jellybeans huh
those are cool yeah can we not get some
of those please work on it mr. key lime
pie jelly oh my god key lime pie jelly
beans Wow okay let's talk about
financials damn financial applications
google wallet which I continue to be
excited about have siloed onto my phone
and have never used is going to be
released on 10 devices this year on
sprint so i think i am correct in saying
that officially google wallet at least
in the US has only supported on sprint
phones yep that's right right so you can
sideload it on to the galaxy nexus for a
verizon but
or onto the gsm version but sort of
officially just on spread phones but
there's going to be 10 more of them
coming out sometime this year and it's
interesting I really like the idea of
this technology but they're about to
face a lot of competition because the
rival service which is Isis his about to
come out and what so is that Isis is
like from verizon and some other people
yeah basically Isis is a I like using
this word is a cabal of you know
basically the three other major national
US carriers so we've got verizon
t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T which is probably why
they didn't want Google Wallet on their
phones right exactly exactly and the
ball should never do yes you know
they're plotting away in a mountaintop
somewhere in a Swiss Alps with long
beards and lots of phones that they're
trying to figure out what to put on them
and what not to and apparently that's
the thing because Google Google is in
direct competition with the carriers in
Isis because they want to have you know
they want to basically they want to do
is take all the information that you
will give them as you use Google Wallet
you know hopefully you know what you're
doing you know but they'll take all that
information which is very valuable to
them and advertisers such as you know
what what your purchase history is where
you buy it where you are you know just
analyze all that stuff and use it to
sell ads against which is a lot more
lucrative than just going to this
supermarket with a credit card or
something so so yes some coupon services
and all sorts of related it's a whole
new co system you can say uh yeah in
general I'm really excited about the
idea and I don't specifically care yet
which service I use I just want a
service
you know but I don't know the details
and I'm all for choice and I think that
you know if they think Isis is good then
why don't they just let Google NEX got
you know heck am I talking about here
google wallet on to verizon phones and
let consumers choose build a better
product that's on saying don't build
walls around yourself i'm not that
ecosystem exactly there's a lot more you
can do with what we call in this NFC
than just mobile payments though mobile
payments is certainly the number one
thing though we have some kind of
gallery here that shows all the
different stuff that you could do
there's some cool photos of like parking
meters and here's just like a payment
machine and like a restore that yeah the
next one is like unlocking a motorcycle
yeah start your engines pretty cool
right yeah troubling you can check in
with Foursquare you could play games
what I really want to do is to be able
to use our our elevators and our
security system here rather than
carrying on my badge I think I mention
this before I want to swipe my phone get
on the elevator I like that yeah NFC NFC
technically allows you to do that you
know once once the software is you know
it's enabled and all that stuff they
probably have to update our whole
building security system to it yeah but
besides not I don't even think they
would have to because from what I
understand NFC communicates with RFID
like it pretty seamless oh really yeah
so any RFID tag it should be able to
read that as well or you could do what I
do which is just slap your ID on the
back of your phone I'm pretend it's out
of thing and then you're you're good to
go pretty much anywhere you want to go
in the building that's good that's
awesome alright so
story wait do we have one more we have
do two more two more stories don't hang
up yet don't turn it us off this one's a
doozy yes this one's a doozy so we get
asked about this all the time when is
ice cream sandwich coming up for my
phone well I have an answer sort of not
really verizon is officially dishing out
ICS to more than 12 devices everybody as
far as when we have no idea but we have
a list of the devices that will be
getting it sometime sometime probably
before key lime pie comes out definitely
to go maybe not before jelly bean yeah
so there's the list right there yeah HTC
phones LG bunch Motorola and some
samsung galaxy tab yeah so if you've got
any of those devices just you know sit
comfortably for a while and you'll get a
good at whittling and you'll be all set
you know guys I want to make a
prediction here Oh see if this I got
burned on this or not but I'm thinking
that everything's related here man like
we've got NFC we've got google wallet
coming out and with sprint and 10
devices they want to put google wallet
on then you've got ice cream sandwich
coming to 12 devices on Verizon Verizon
is you know part of Isis so I'm thinking
and also speaking of NFC the motorola
razr droid razr and droid razr maxx have
NFC circuitry in them but they don't
talk about it yes and their number one
rule that I've seen don't talk about
anything right so I'm thinking that
these devices on verizon especially the
motorola devices will get NFC capability
or at least google wallet another on
google odd I Center some sort of Isis
wallet capability soon most likely maybe
even at the ctia and in May you know
maybe even sooner than that
just a prediction speak on its beak on
ya see here to hurt it here first so
you're saying by ctia and May early May
right you think we will see the release
of Isis and ice cream sandwich on a
bunch of verizon phones yes and I'm
thinking as well the reason why I'm I
was kind of thinking about this because
I'm checking out this bluetooth headset
by motorola called the elites liver
right now people look at this and say oh
it's just a headset but it actually has
NFC circuitry built into its case that
you use to pair it theoretically with
other bones without having to enter any
information or anything but it doesn't
work yet on any motorola device so i'm
thinking it's going to happen soon
because they're already marketing this
thing out there nordys they already
talking about how it pairs with things
so I'm thing is going to happen so for
those of you wondering i i i bind to
your belief i'll bet i'll bet for you i
just wanted to give a little education
to anyone wondering more about Isis in
case you don't know is a goddess in
ancient Egyptian religious beliefs she
is worshipped as the ideal mother and
wife as the major matron of nature and
magick and Isis I guess means throne so
I guess they want to have the mobile
payment throne well that's actually
really interesting because I spoke to a
payment digital payment analysts a few
months ago and he told me he told me
this buzzword this buzz phrase that the
one who the one who enrolls is the one
who controls he who enrolls he said
though the one who the one who enrolls
is the one who controls I like I was all
about control whisper deep heavy stuff
we're talking about alright well raise
your voices because we're about to talk
legalese or as much as we can pretend to
know we've had a lot
of back and forth but who's paying who
and just to confuse the issue a little
bit more we talked what is this like two
weeks ago maybe about how Motorola's
demanding patent licensing fees from
apple and apple had originally said whoa
that's crazy that's way too much money
they wanted like 2.5% but now according
to a Dow Jones news report Apple has
offered motorola mobility and samsung
electronics deal somewhere between
fifteen five to fifteen dollars per
device which apparently is in the one to
two and a half percent range so given
them about what they want and so now
we're in the situation where we have
apple for every iOS device that they
sell pain google essentially and we have
you know google or android a
manufacturer's paying microsoft for
every device they make and then we have
android maker like HTC pain apple it's
just bizarre like you know why don't we
just can they just all keep their money
and just make their devices and this is
insane so i guess if it's kind of like a
weird money waterfall that circles
around it's like a perpetual money
machine right and do they all going to
count this as like revenue their balance
sheet so it actually works out better
for all of them yeah i guess if 11 makes
one company makes a windfall it just
flows all the way around back again what
makes it worse for us because oh yeah
any crisis will just be probably driven
up probably the lawyers win alright we
are to the App of the Week point of the
show and this has been sort of exploding
I think over the last week this game
called draw something I see non-stop
tweets about it what is this yeah I mean
you know for a long time even still
today a lot of people were on the words
with friends kind of thing playing
scrabble against each other and then for
a little while they were hanging with
friends playing hangman and now it
appears that draw something is
ready to take the world by storm already
has in fact it's kind of like pictionary
but on your phone that's crazy hello and
welcome to tap that app i'm jason parker
and this is the show where we show off
the hottest apps in the mobile space
there's a hot new game that's made its
way to the top of the itunes app store
that challenges both your drawing
ability and your ability to identify bad
drawings it's called draw something it's
very similar to that old board game
pictionary where you would draw for
someone and they would have to identify
what you were drawing and draw something
there's no time limits on your drawing
because it's a turn-based game kind of
like words with friends where you can
take your time draw your picture and
then you send it off and then your
friend who will get the notification
will then have their turn to guess your
drawing and then draw a picture of their
own to get started you sign up within
the game or you can sign in through
Facebook or Twitter to find friends once
you have a game set up a screen comes up
asking you to choose an easy medium or
hard word so a word like son would be
relatively easy to draw with you know
just to yellow circle but then a word
like rapture would be much harder to
draw requiring a lot more work once
you've selected your word you can start
drawing right away or you can use the
included tools like line width eraser
width and you also have a limited number
of colors that are up here on the top
but you can buy more with sets using the
coins that you earn within the game once
you're satisfied with your drawing you
can send it off to your friend and then
your friend gets a chance to figure out
what your drawing is and then draw a
picture of his own for you to guess when
it comes back your way each time you
guess is drawing correctly you're
awarded coins based on the difficulty of
the word that was chosen so an easy word
would get one coin where a hard word
would get three coins you'll want to
earn coins too because you use coins to
buy more colors and you're only given a
limited number of colors to start off
this becomes extremely important when
you have to draw plants and you have no
green unfortunately color packs are
pretty expensive so you're going to have
to play a lot of games to earn enough
coins to get the green for those plants
the interesting thing about this game is
that you're not competing
against your friend the objects instead
is to go for as many rounds as possible
so it's like a team game you're working
together to try to get past as many
drawings as you can I should note the
game is very addictive and I already
have a few games going even though I've
only played over the past few days draw
something is on sale right now for 99
cents at the iTunes App Store but may
move back to 199 soon so you better grab
it while you can i'm jason parker from
cnet and this has been tapped that at
thanks for watching and we should
mention even though that's it in the
itunes app store it's actually available
in the android market as well the google
play store the google play android
market ekla ecosystems store for 99
cents but there's also a free version do
you know the difference between the free
and the paint it's ad supported but
don't you know it's pretty easy just
back out of the ads and you won't notice
them after a while that's what I do then
you start drawing pictures of like fried
chicken or you know pizzas and stuff
whatever you see subconsciously
subconsciously oh man i really want to
draw a coke that looks like a pretty
cool game I I will challenge you soon as
we get out please do you are I have
whipped but we don't play with each
other yeah well we'd be we'd be helping
each other alright I'm confused let's go
on to email Android Alice at cnet com
hey Android Alice I found your input
engine you know and love from way back
in the day with her palm OS trios Bobby
blah anyway he's sort of basically he
gives a link which will throw on the
show notes for graffiti pro because I
was you know getting all nostalgic about
the old days of my palm and using
graffiti and how that was awesome and so
there's this app and I think a free
version as well but this graffiti pros
299 and gives you sort of a full
graffiti access which is the app that
has its own sort of alphabet based on
the English alphabet so that it could
better understand your writing
because traditionally apps that require
just of natural writing are very poor at
understanding how people right anyway
cool thanks for that uh so I don't have
the person's name in here but thanks
next one is from Max I'm sitting here
playing the android game burning sands 3
any chance he like makes this game
always have to mention that on my asus
prime while watching your show and find
myself utterly puzzled with your
statements that there are lack of tablet
apps for android tablets all android
tablet apps work all android apps work
on tablets there are 300,000 tablet apps
to choose from maybe you need to put
down your beloved ipad and spend a
little more time researching android max
that's right all right max maybe you
need to put down your burning sands 3
and listen to our show a little better
because I believe what we said was
there's very few apps optimized for
tablet android devices and that those
that there are it's hard to find because
it's not really split up very well in
the android marketplace door there huh
maps thanks for your email thanks
Madison next one is hall again yes from
dame you love our viewers and our
listeners hi guys you said you thought
there was a difference between tablet
and phone graphics but that's not
entirely true when you make an android
app you create a high middle and a low
definition image to a 10-inch tablet
will use the same image as a phone with
a high res screen like the Galaxy Nexus
however in many cases you will want to
make a separate UI for a tablet but this
is still fairly easy in the UI on is
done by click and drag of XML keep up
the good work of the show ding yeah I
mean so I think he's correct here from
what I have seen in the from developing
android app the point being still to
sort of Max's point a danes point is
that really i think
not from a technical point of view but
from sort of a usability point of view
you really do need to create a separate
interface even if it's just somewhat
tweaked to work well with a tablet
versus a phone because you just use a
tablet differently it has different
challenges and it's a different size and
just stretching stuff out or even using
high-res images doesn't necessarily
solve what you're trying to solve in an
elegant way so solve it elegantly people
all right I'm gonna read this last one
from our good friend Stephen Colbert
sure sure not a Stephen Colbert another
the East even colder it's like wow you
guys are really pulling in the
celebrities here you know we got Larry
David Stephen Colbert says I'm a fan of
the Google Play branding except for the
market I'm going to be calling it the
market as long as I use Android
regardless but that's beside the point
why is my question I was reading an
interview from cnet with Jamie Rosenberg
where she said Google Play will become a
single experience for users this creates
a more powerful experience around
Android and also increases opportunities
for content partners to interact with
more of Google's offerings did Google
change the privacy policy again only
this time slipping and under rebranding
with the news of assistant coming out
now Google's moves to change privacy to
share content between more sources only
makes sense in the effort to build
something a step above Siri anyway it
makes sense to me but I'm also the only
place I've heard this room so I wanted
to hear your opinion missed having show
this week otherwise keep up the good
work I think he's see must have wrote
that yesterday yeah we having to show
this week Stephen Colbert yeah by the
way yeah right now and it's over almost
yeah I mean I think basically just given
a bunch of opinions here right did they
change a privacy polygon fidelity they
did well I mean no not not as a result
of the Google Play rebrand right yeah
but anyway I don't thanks for the
comments you have any specific be back
for him no I mean they did change the
privacy policy you know just a couple of
weeks ago
not sure if its last week yeah or last
week I'm not sure if he's aware of that
one but no since then we haven't heard
of any other privacy policy policy
changes slipped under the rebranding
that be sneaky that'd be evil maybe
mm-hmm that might disrupt the ecosystem
a little bit it would uh-huh all right
