nighthawk x''k Wi-Fi router Morrow
number are 8,000 now this is the latest
from Netgear that supposed to be a huge
upgrade to this our 7000 I have here
right here in fact is so huge like
having to r7 unit put on top each other
almost how am I asked well before I get
there let's check out this very cool
design right here the first clan it look
like the are 8000 here have no antenna
or has built-in antenna that's not true
you actually have a 6x long Turner right
here but they come in a design that
allows you to fold them on top of the
rail like this personally I love to
design because it allows me not to have
to detach them before we packing the
router which I always have to do after a
review the new router here come with the
usual four Gigabit LAN port and one
gigabit one port or Internet port this
is the port you want to connect your
router to your broadband modem there are
also two USB port right here the 2.0
port is for a printer and the 3.0 port
is to host an external hard drive now
come to the exciting part similar to the
our 7000 over here the our 8000 is a
dual man top-tier 802 point you have an
AC router meaning it can operate in both
the foggy head frequency band and the
2.4 gigahertz frequency band at the same
time with a top speed up up to 1300
megabit per second and up to 600 megabit
per second respectively but instead of
having just one access point on each of
the Bands the are 8,000 has two separate
access points on the five-yard ban
itself and that means it adds another
1300 megabit per second to it bandwidth
for a total of thirty two hundred
megabit per second in other words if the
our 7000 here is an AC 1900 rotor these
are 8,000 here is a very first AC 3200
router on the market now that sounds all
cool but in my testing doubling down on
the hood band doesn't always
return better Wi-Fi connections because
this is very similar to doubling the
amount
Blaine's on your home Street which only
better the traffic flow when there is
heavy traffic now if your Street already
have a four lanes adding another four
most of the time doesn't make any
difference because there are just not
enough cars to fill up the extra lanes
so here's the old situation where you
might see the benefits of this new
router if there are a lot of 5g Wi-Fi
clients in your home and I mean a lot
like a dozen or more of them and all of
those clients use the Wi-Fi connection
heavily at the same time otherwise the
are 8,000 here when working as intended
is about as good as the are 7000 here at
best and in my testing unfortunately he
actually wasn't always working as
intended and now I don't mean that it
was slow anything because at the
sustained speed on the Fatherhood band
of some 480 megabit per second it
actually was very fast however not this
pre-configured Network printed on this
label right here it's supposed to make
the router work right out of the box and
if you're okay with the default settings
all is fine but if you want to make
changes to the setting changes are
something bad might happen in my case I
had a hard time getting the 2.4
gigahertz clients connect to the router
until I reset the router to the default
setting I also had some issue connecting
to the internet via the router here
sometimes there was no internet at all
even though everything seemed fine now I
believe all those things just some bug
and will be resolved via a future
firmware update but overall there are
8000 here's seem to be only good for a 5
gigahertz only environment so getting it
it's like adding more lanes you Street Y
narrowing the sidewalks if that's not
crazy now here the price $300 this is
the most expensive browser you can find
on the market if I'm on this one here
check out my full review at cnet.com you
know it's not just an overkill router
but it's a rather wasteful one you get
very little extra
and mostly dismissing returns from it
that exactly why I got only one unit and
not - I did the 7000 here and that's
because well I'm dumb low and this has
been the first look at the nigh hop x6r
8000 Wi-Fi router from nephew</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
