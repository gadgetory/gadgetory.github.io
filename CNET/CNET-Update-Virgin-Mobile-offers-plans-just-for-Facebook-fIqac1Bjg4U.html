Facebook I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your CNET update if you're looking for a
cheaper wireless plan it's now possible
to fine-tune exactly what you want even
if what you want is just a data plan for
an unlimited Facebook
Virgin Mobile which is owned by Sprint
has a new offering it's called Virgin
Mobile custom and you can set how many
minutes text messages and data that you
want on a plan and it all could be
changed on the fly right on your smart
phone for as low as $3 a month you can
get 250 voice minutes $8 gets you 250
megabytes of data and if you want
unlimited Facebook just add another $5
to that and there are several
combinations you can tinker with for
different social and music streaming
apps this plan also is the first time
that Sprint is offering a family plan up
to five people can share a common bucket
of minutes texts and data only three
smartphones will work with this plan and
it's only available at Walmart but this
could be expanded to more phones in time
now it's easy to take Facebook and
Google for granted as basic tools for
communication but around the world there
are billions of people who don't go on
the internet about 30 percent of the
world doesn't go online Facebook is
trying to close that gap with its
internet.org foundation it's just
released a new app that makes Facebook
Google Wikipedia and several other
websites free to people in poor
countries and by free I mean that you
have to have a phone but using Facebook
won't count against your data plan the
internet.org app is first available to
Airtel subscribers and Zambia in
southern Africa the wireless service
Airtel will pay for that free access
with the hopes that maybe customers will
be interested in paying for data to
browse other websites of course this
means more people around the world will
become Facebook users and it's worth
paying attention to this service because
more access to information and
communication tools could help grow
Zambia's economy in other app news a
beta version of the blackberry messenger
app known as bbm is now available for
Windows Phone users
and it was designed to blend into the
style of windows foam the iOS and
Android versions of bbm make it a
redesign so the Android version has more
Android style and bbm for iPhone has
more of Apple style but if you're
looking for apps that are a bit more fun
than bbm Amazon's gave you a 30 Android
apps for free
normally worth $100 but the pack of apps
won't be free after Friday so act fast
you can get them through Amazon's App
Store which often has different deals on
apps that your tech news update you can
