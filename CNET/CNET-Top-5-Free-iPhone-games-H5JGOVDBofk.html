meet we count down another hot scene at
list I'm Tom Merritt I often get asked
about cool iphone apps and I often say
hold on a moment and I go get jason
parker from download com because he
pretty much gets paid to play with
iphone apps all day long the man has
never let me down and if there's one
thing you folks like better than the
iphone it's free stuff and video games
so let's count down the top 5 free
iPhone games and number 5 trace reminds
me a little of an aha video you draw
your little character and guide him
through a line art world to line art
victory this little guy I'll steal your
line heart coming in at number 4 jelly
car this was a favorite amongst the
folks on Twitter as well it's a 2d
cartoon game where you essentially try
to drive your car to the end tapping
your car makes it huge which can help
keep you from splurging on an SUV you
can't afford up to number 3 live poker
obviously yeah after like poker a little
to play this but for free you get to
play against other folks around the
world on their iPhones the money you win
is fake though come on it's a pre-game
sliding in at number two tap tap revenge
too this is the sequel to the insanely
popular tap tap revenge it is not a
dance dance revolution clone though it's
more like guitar hero on your phone but
it didn't win number one what could
possibly have beaten TTR to before we
get to number one a little gift for you
I surveyed the Twitter crowd on their
favorite iphone apps which one was
mentioned most often by the Twitter
crowd could be one of these or it could
be a totally different app post your
guests on blog sina TV com to the post

the first ten correct posts who will get
this slightly used 3d imperial star
destroyer puzzle it's not guaranteed to
have all the pieces but it is signed by
mollywood all right let's get to our
number one number one it's tap defense
jason is a big fan of the tower defense
genre and this is a competent and
importantly free example of the
game it's your basic defense of the
gates of heaven from the enemies from
hell and you can challenge yourself and
your friends to master levels and obtain
high scores so it's got that going for
it well that's it for this edition of
