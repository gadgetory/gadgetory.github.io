on oh it's 2012 like a Peter highs just
let go on point right there thanks for
tuning in its twenty twelve i'm jeff
bakalar be present you could say you
name it say it just be carried or ha
yeah now the last time I was here I
talked during the whole intro that's
right we were mad at you it's ok we have
her finger on the sensor button I'm
Justin you this is the show where Peter
ha has no inner monologue as we found
out firsthand in our lovely pre-show
program it's fine you're not the first
person to drop an f-bomb but you are the
first person to drop a G and then a
d-bomb before the f you could good eye
like great it was awesome today you know
what we really appreciate you being here
because we know you had a tough trip on
your way dead to the 404 you're coming
straight from San Francisco on like a
red-eye pretty much I'm doing it just
for you yeah oh you so we can't thank
you enough all right seriously yeah
you're welcome thanks for being there
dude yeah you uh what do you do at the
fine publication known as the daily I
write outlandish things on Twitter tell
Microsoft that our stories are true I do
that's right tell us a little bit about
that because I remember reading about
this last week but well we published a
story about Office for iPad hmm because
well it's real and someone showed it to
us and then Microsoft decided to say
that our story was completely fabricated
so this is that we photoshopped the
photo Wow which you did not that's a
huge egg I mean why would we why would
you what's the incentive to make up that
office is coming to ipad right where's
the inset IMA be headline but what other
sort of incentive and not to mention you
guys are not like you know some
rinky-dink blog this is the freakin
daily you know why why would you guys
put yourself in that sort of hot water
so can you run us through the
controversy what exactly happened well
sure so we've been chasing the story
since about November I'd say and you
know we said back in November that
Office for iPad was coming at
point in 2012 and then one of my writers
in Seattle finally tracked down a couple
guys that had it running on their iPads
and he was like hey you know show it to
me okay I did right and then we took a
photo of it and at no point where they
like hey this is embargoed hey this is
top secret no no which is the only
detail that matters yeah right again you
know he hit up his sources and sources
showed us what was going on and that's
that and they come out and they say hey
you guys made this up yeah they're like
oh those photo those images are
fabricated that's not a Microsoft
product yeah like why would we go
through the trouble of photoshopping
something so that you have the Starfleet
insignia on the wall then reflecting on
the iPad itself yeah what what's the
incentive I mean I sort of understand
where Microsoft is coming from oh I'm
sure there is did they must have been
pissed about it and there's a lot of
rumors going around right now just in
the tech industry right yeah all the
apple stuff happening like I don't know
I I can see where they would get that
paranoia from but you had it directly
from the source so that's a different
story absolutely I mean they went to
Twitter on their Microsoft a corporate
comms Twitter account to say that we
love you guys but you're totally wrong
Wow is blows my mind I'm amazed by it
yeah until don't really know so where's
that situation at right now so mean in
limbo I guess so yeah did you guys take
down the report no good we followed it
up action yeah next day yeah I said well
this is where we got it for him without
it giving anyone of course name or
division away but you know that's
unbelievable it's crazy story what's
what else absolutely what else is going
on at the daily cuz i've been reading it
I'm digging it mmm you're in this series
actioner yeah well maybe you look I mean
subscription for the ipad app I maybe I
do because somebody wouldn't hook it up
with a pre code that's why I don't hear
that during renewal it was worth it for
sure yeah you look it up next out of
every right on no yeah I love reading I
really do there's something very special
about it I appreciate I appreciate it
for sure make sure everything's perfect
just for you I feel
as if the publication is tailored
towards my specific yeah i make sure i
go through every pager tonight and if
you ever wanted to reach down to the
proletariat and release a version for
the HP TouchPad yeah i'll be first in
line to get into sure they'll be 11
issue a month that one's in the works
really no okay fooled me for half a
second uh we have to cover this even
though Wilson is no longer with us it's
a big news apple just sent out their
invites yeah March 7th the ipad event
will be taking place in san francisco at
the yerba buena center yeah for the Arts
in downtown San Francisco right uh you
know in the heart of Silicon Valley
right we're really going to find out
what's going on with a new iPad all
rumors are pointing to a 4g LTE quad
core ipad 3 with probably that Apple
tell you that yes did they know they'll
see that the DC in New York they do well
that's what they told CNBC tweeted this
morning that it was going to be in New
York they are wrong it's going to be
just gonna be C so do we even take their
all their other part of their uh their
there Scoob there that it's going to be
a 4g yeah quad core machine i don't know
but i think the big thing is you know I
feel like Peter and I have the same sort
of you know aggressively negative
attitude towards the world of tech we
sort of just lit up with it right you
don't like the cenacle Justin maybe a
little more optimistic about the
situation situation about um are you
like me in the fact that you just don't
care anymore what Apple does and think
that maybe perhaps we should stop giving
them the amount of attention that don't
get me wrong before everyone starts
going crazy yes they're the biggest
company in the world your shares are
going for five hundred dollars a piece I
get that they're enormous but I think
there comes a time where like maybe the
hype needs to plateau a little bit and
everyone needs to just take step back
and be like look there's going to be an
ipad 3 we all know this is gonna have
justwe have a better rest relax it's
going to happen I feel like you know
your thoughts and my thoughts could
generally just go across the board for
everyone right for everything much every
but what but seriously water I want to
get your take on because it's rare that
i find someone who sees this world the
way i do as well what window when I
think as we know how and obviously you
know you're a little more invest in the
whole situation as well because you work
for a publication that's primarily uh
distributed on trade ipad so so you know
you're surrounded oh you are I know that
I know that's news that mandroid tablets
uh so how do you feel about that silence
speaks balls apparently you're
speechless and I'm sure you know I want
to choose your words wisely the thing is
is that as sort of burnt out as I am
about this whole thing yeah there's just
something about being able to go to an
apple event and cover it and sit there
and see what they're about to do mainly
because they put on a really good show
yeah I mean that's probably the biggest
thing for me so you go for the whole
glamour of it all you enjoy yeah you
enjoy the spectacle yes that is an that
is an apple shutter it is because I
think there's more than what people see
during that live stream if you're able
to catch it right there's like bands
that play and like people that come out
and talk and then you see who's there
and who isn't there and it's kind of
like a guessing game as to who's going
to get it a review unit first and you
know when when apple pear isn't it sort
of whisk people away and yeah it sort of
thing now how do you feel about that
whole thing oh I have no comment you
have no comment you know we talked about
this story a couple weeks ago about how
I think it was someone from MSNBC was
blacklisted right and Apple can kind of
pick and choose which companies they
want to invite to those writings do you
think that's fair I mean just to allow
access to some and then denied others
because they're reporting on those
rumors i mean i know for a fact that's
seen it sometimes doesn't get ya invited
to some of those events because we've
written things that aren't so positive
about Apple I don't know if that's a
fair thing to do right Peter's a speech
like um I have no comment yeah I want to
know I understood I wouldn't want to get
black baldies I wouldn't want to get in
the middle of that whirlwind either are
you excited about the ipad 3 I mean you
have an iPad 2 I do seem like
there's a big incremental change between
the rumors we've seen so far in the last
one you know aside from the hardware
stuff it'll be interesting to see what
sort of software upgrades yeah that
they'll show with it I think that's
probably apples like biggest sort of dog
and pony shows or software the hardware
we can expect it's always going to get a
little bit better right right um but I
don't know do you guys think that
Cirie's gonna end up on the iPad all I
mean I still think series uh you know
overhyped and I think it's I don't think
it's a joke but I think there's been
stuff that does it just as well yeah
here a while and I think that you know I
think their commercials are misleading
yeah and an impractical for Siri
fortunately for series specifically i
think they show people like in the
height of emotion right you know and
they're just like all you know i love
you where can i find you know it's like
it's it just doesn't it you know just
not a good representation how people
will probably be using it in real life
right yeah i don't like it can pick up
on natural language but I don't think
it's at a point yet where you can just
sort of pick it up midst mid-sentence
and say oh I need this or whatever right
and not only that a lot of it there it's
sort of just gonna search the web it's
not necessarily gonna you know do the
steps to take you where you want to end
up right that's it would be great for me
if I could just tell Siri to turn Wi-Fi
on or off right or turn bluetooth on and
off so yeah like five buttons on the
phone or maybe you know uh priest like
make presets for for sound settings and
call me like yeah hey uh anytime Peter
calls me play this ringtone and then
when you're done with you know yeah what
would you have it play for me oh I don't
know I'm walking on sunshine what does I
just prefer Justin I would definitely do
telephone by lady gaga yeah there's not
a doubt in my mind okay like I had that
here in fact already does do it on my
android phone right away yeah I think
for me I wanted it to dictate my text
messages a little bit easier and that
was what i was looking forward to the
most i got my iphone arrest it just got
the Recoleta isn't there yes not and I
don't think I mush my words you know
enunciate extra hard when I'm talking to
and it still doesn't pick it up you
still have to look at it to vet whatever
the message is creating it's got it's
kind of a hassle than it's worth and you
know I mean I think Samsung is doing a
decent job it sort of given jabs to
Apple in their in their commercials yeah
someone's gotta look at those someone's
got to attack Syria someone's gotta me
you know like they're the biggest
company the one thing they're gonna
attack I'm just I mean when apple says
it's in beta 2 i'm not defending him but
it's like you're really gonna go off to
the weakest point what do you want going
that honestly for me well the biggest
thing about the iphone wife still is
like my main devices because the camera
so good cameras amazing get around that
i don't think there's a phone that even
comes close to how amazing the camera is
in the forest hands then I'm the first
to admit i have a samsung galaxy nexus
present can't even come close to what an
iphone 4 just goes to show you how well
something can turn out if you make sure
the hardware and the software are
talking for sure right absolutely now
yeah good my main argument against the
android and to a certain extent
microsoft phone or Windows Phone like I
love the Lumia 800 but that camera is
not good at all yeah like what do you
think about that 41-megapixel Cambodian
ends yeah 41 day I'd like the Nokia is
ridiculous it's like what I don't
understand that cares if it's 41
megapixels it's gonna take a crappy
photo I got it I think we'll do the
comic on that this week yeah sure what
you know just be like what are you doing
jump is ridiculous how about like 20
megabits yeah how about 10 and call it a
day yeah you know this ridiculous it's
absolutely ridiculous let's switch gears
a little bit so obviously the ipad
announcement coming next week will
report on that who knows you might even
do a live thing at the pens oh no how
the how the cards fall on the chips fall
let's switch gears our good buddy Adam
Sandler has broken new records not for
achievement in comedy but the exact
opposite he's been nominated for 11
razzies everyone knows what razzies is
they are the exact opposite of an Oscar
mm-hmm tell us more about this
experience so the exactly so you get the
Golden Raspberry these are some of the
war
first awards you can get for movies in
2011 god Jack man Jack and Jill really
secured a lot of the awards this year uh
I believe he got 11 uh concern yeah he
got 11 which is a record for any actor
on the Jack and Jill sorry I don't is
that the one where he plays his sister
as well yeah it's the one he's like the
brother in the sister right he dresses
up in drag or whatever face but uh yeah
so Jack and Joe got worse Picture
nomination sure it also got a worst
actor and worst actress both going to
Adam Sandler oh nice I was a green
ensemble for the entire cast of jackin
Jill I mean Katie Holmes got nominated
as were supporting actress for her role
in that and then Nick Swardson got were
supporting actor that's like five of the
11 and there yeah we're here that I can
read right now it's kind of a bummer
because I really do like Nick Swardson I
do as a comedian is a stand-up comic you
don't know who you are blond hair blond
hair do you see he's in like Sandler's
crew do you know I mean yeah it's in
their little uh get I what's a good way
to describe who was in bucky larson yeah
that's under like the one where kid
wants become a porn star this guy's not
register on that guy yeah that's uh
listen exported funny guy but yeah man
Jack and Jill was pile of garbage right
anyway yet no item yeah I don't know I i
did not get to see that one I you know
that was one of those movies where you
were just like oh man is this this is
the on-screen crumbling of Adam Sandler
yes this where it all ends unfortunately
that that's that's the case but I am
glad to see that the razzies also you
know gave some other terrible movies
right some attention like New Year's Eve
remember that movie they're just like
here's 47 celebrities became in a movie
go see it you moron right yeah so I'm
glad they did that also twilight saga
breaking dawn part one Transformers Dark
of the Moon and then the two movies talk
before those are up for worst picture
what happened to Happy Madison
productions I watched a Billy Madison
the other day because it's on netflix
right now and that's an incredible movie
and I feel like in the early to late 90s
those guys could do no wrong it's
we're along that timeline they just
started falling off another producing
these if got is me they were on fire
they were on fire for a while I think a
lot of it has to do with them growing up
and just being like hey I got days I've
got a family uh maybe I need to make
this movie you know palatable for a
younger audience I think they got really
rich and just really really lazy yeah
but Adam Sandler I think was rich after
you know Saturday Night Live after when
he started getting those one or two you
know movie deals where he was the
headline star right last Adam Sandler
movie I watched was when he was like
going back to that summer camp with all
of his buddies Oh grown up yeah that
would you do that funny really i think
that hey i think that advertises seven
percent on rotten tomatoes that might
have been the last straw though that was
it I was like a last good movie i
enjoyed with him was probably big daddy
yeah Big Daddy was good big daddy was a
lot of fun like Little Nicky everyone he
has anymore i'm saying is a little
Mickey I feel like is where the tide
started turning or that it's funny cuz I
actually enjoyed that movie gets better
with age only because you compared to
the crap that he's involved in her and
lately yeah you look back you're like
man Little Nicky All Things Considered
was not bad when you look at something
like grown ups or Jack and Jill yeah or
master of disguise that was I wasn't a
Dina cows Dana Carvey but it was made by
the Happy Madison guy that's not no no I
didn't clicking hot chick we'll take a
break oh my god that's right things have
not gone off too well for mr. Shannon
but we still love them more for four
with Peter ha right after this we'll be
right back this is the 40
forever effers the show where we all
sing songs
you
hey welcome back to the 404 we've got
peterhof from the daily on the program
today peter is a lovely gentleman with
fantastic hair I will be saved from now
on you will behave it's fine you get a
free pass because you came in on a
flight on a jet plane and we're just
happy you're here man thank you have him
here enjoys a good time and you remain
speechless on certain topics and that's
fine good we can understand that ah hey
can we just talk about your tattoo for a
minute ah Tenten let's talk of a dream
oh sure yeah so we were talking tattoos
in the different show because we all
have we actually all have tattoos yes a
lot you have a lot of tattoos yeah let's
talk about let's talk about your dish
let's talk about my journey I've got a
few you do and I love your tattoos we
were last night I don't know why I had a
dream where i got my entire arm sleeved
out like up to the wrist right and they
somehow were able to do like animation
on my on my arm so like I had one part
was just like look like an electrical
current that was like constantly moving
and then my favorite was like this
bubble that would look like a leveler
and was just sort of done I move my arm
the bubble would like go up and down my
forearm the electric current I get but
the bubbler yeah are you in construction
I don't were you feeling a hot you and I
don't dude who knows where dreams come
back I mean here they just a beer that
is a great idea though a leveller built
into your arm as a tattoo well okay if
your arm isn't level begin with well
that's true you admit that's how you
would know that your arm is flat but i
think the cool regardless of what it
actually was I think the whole concept
of like an animated tattoo is amazing
right it'll never have wheat never I
can't see the technology I was like and
there was funny because I remember
looking in the mirror in my dream and
just being like this is really sweet
this is something I'm gonna really want
to show off of you who is this is moving
my things on my armor moving right but I
woke up and uh you know reality smacked
me in the face it's a pretty cool dream
though I you had intrigued by I wonder
if at some point in time we could
actually do that I was talking with my
wife stays and she's like all men
she totally invent sparkly tattoos
sounds like what do you mean she's like
you know like instead of just plain
color ink let it shimmer and sparkle
maybe like man old trapper keeper yeah
exactly I was like oh I don't know if
I'd want that you know put into my skin
yeah permanent basis only if you get a
unicorn right I was gonna say what other
you know like what other type of those
tattoos that only show up in like a
black right glow in the dark one the
glow-in-the-dark ones and otherwise they
just let us clear hop out I don't know
if I'm into those know why would you do
that yeah you know in their role in that
unique situation where you're near a
black light I understand that though
well every time you go into Spencer
Gifts i return go to a rave yeah yes
yeah every time you go back in time ten
years were raised to be cool you know 20
years also those tattoos that look like
they're kind of integrated into your
skin like I have you seen those ones
like my knife people get like a shirt
tattooed on them that looks like it's
going halfway in and i doona back out
yeah yeah we're gross body integrated
tattoo I don't like that is it different
to those are different I'll wait for the
level of well I'm telling you man
animated tattoos committed gifts coming
to a sick you're like a rotating at
symbol on this one out GOC represent you
so badass oh that's awesome there it is
just a protest you want after the show
nice we'll go right over there a compose
oh I want to talk about the story it's
amazing it's entitled how I became
Amazon's involuntary pitchman for a
55-gallon drum personal lubricant on
facebook yeah please tell me about this
Justin because I know exactly what it's
about haha well that's the story I mean
the headline says it all this is kind of
insane a writer over at Gawker is Nick
burgas you know this guy no I don't hand
me the do I but you will soon because he
might pop up in your Facebook feed uh
along with a sponsored ad for this
55-gallon drum of personal lubricant so
the pack story is that ok i guess on
valentine's day of this year he liked a
post on like from a tweet that was
advertising this huge drum of personal
lubricant this is like the size of a keg
right anything like obviously this guy's
social network is pretty big so somehow
facebook got a hold of this and
apparently amazon is now paying facebook
to highlight his his post as a sponsored
tweet in their feed so now like you know
i guess he started getting a lot of
emails and IMS from his co-workers and
family and friends they're like why are
you showing up in my feed like Hawking
this giant yeah what's up with that
realm of lube so I don't know it's kind
of a privacy story because his facebook
didn't contact this guy and they didn't
bother to do their research on you know
whether or not this guy actually wants
to be an involuntary spokesman for
lubrication perhaps the most upsetting
thing about this entire situation yeah
is that somewhere in that fine print
right not terms of service it says guess
what we're going to use you as freakin
ed bait and not just his name his face
is right there to you could click on
like oh that's another big Fergus that's
not me that's not this Nick burgers
right no its you idiot I see your face
there yeah for people that don't know
that he works at Gawker now that he is
your big Network they might just think
like this guy from high school or
whatever amazon sells a 55 gallon drum
of Lou I think that's a big door I think
that is the bigger story here it's I'm
just like it is bigger than a keg it 600
it's like it's the size of one of those
orange you know huge things you see on
the on the unlike the right way right
right you know what I wanted yeah yeah
Jesus look at the size of this thing I'm
just who would buy that big I don't know
maybe like a place in Amsterdam or
something yeah you know just like me
that that were like a sex shop or like
yes I mean think about how much in
personal lubricant and really curious
yeah also wonder if he comes with like a
scooper like what is there like some
kind of strong yeah like a no it's a
test hahaha you just got to pump it
there you go telling you man wow that's
a lot of losses dip your arm in there
that is a buttload of do blue some
reason a scene from requiem for a dream
is coming to come on right and do your
mind there oh please don't do don't do
that i watch that the other week sure
let's let's keep it going with the
perversion here q are coded condoms
coming to a quicky Mart there
I guess I got to play the Wilson role
there's uh this is pretty ridiculous and
bring this story up as we talk about it
this is a Seattle chapter of Planned
Parenthood Peter I know that you know
what Planned Parenthood just by knows i
judging by your reaction or nauman uh
anyway they're looking to rope in
members of generation see this is a
different story but I guess our
generation is now generation c4
connected it's pretty lame came up with
that really medio y lot more Generation
Y why I guess yeah now that letter has
so we don't change Generation Y's stays
the same it's the it's the generation
below us yeah all generations we don't
yeah we don't assume that role we're not
multi-generational right so tell us
about this so anyway they're looking at
rope in members of this new generation
that are obsessed with online social
networks basically they're giving these
QR coded condoms the rappers have a QR
code right on top of it and apparently
after you use the condom you're supposed
to take a photo of it using an app and
now get uploaded to this website where
did you wear it calm oh good and that
will supposedly anonymize your post and
it'll also tell you where you had this
safe sex and the ideas they want to
eventually generate a big map of where
people are having safe sex the most hmm
but you know like that's the
introduction of the story there's a lot
of potential problems that I think can
happen here yeah not one I think people
people rip open a condom won't the QR
code just get busted to the point where
you came it's canutillo that's what
you're worried I mean like no one
gingerly opens up a condom to make sure
that the wrapper is intact right I don't
think anyone gives me leave f'd take a
picture of my use condoms yeah baby hold
on baby yeah let me just snap a photo of
this QR code before we do the dirty I
don't think a cot any condom in the
history of comms has ever been opened up
carefully right exactly so we go that
boy open yeah you you get you you know
you're not exactly i'm easy to rip it
open to you I not like a ginger like two
handedly I yeah
you just worry that over yeah exactly
yeah I don't know I guess uh there there
there I I appreciate what they're
attempting to do their hearts maybe
perhaps in the right place yeah but uh
you are codes and privacy leaks to you
got worried on that too like last week
we talked about all those email
addresses from pornhub getting put out
there wait what if oh yeah I know you
better gotta go you have a computer to
destroy don't you my work computer but
yeah you know could you imagine if all
these young people had their names and
addresses of the exact locations the geo
tags basically they say what app or
which platforms that they would have an
app for um I think there's an iphone I
mean any word homemade you get a QR code
app you can use this with unbelievers
achill terribly heaven it is a disaster
waiting to happen I'm surprised they
didn't try and do something where you
can see your partner's past oh you know
I mean like a history a timeline but you
know keep it anonymous somehow but be
like look in the last six months right
person a has done it with you know XYZ
right in the bathroom of you are that is
a can of worms that nobody wants to open
did you know some jency kid who thinks
he's super creative and funny is just
going to take a boatload of those and
take pictures and random places and
you're gonna look at the map it's gonna
spell out like yeah talk about adverse
what the hell owner or how do you mean
like there you'll see that on the map
back and I kids a lot of time on his ins
but he's not actually having sex in this
location or a bunch of jerks will get
together and do that yeah right yeah I
also think that i'm not sure if you want
to see a map of where young people are
having anonymous sex you know me like it
might just be all in like the norms
parking lot or like in like movie
theaters it's not going to be all in one
kids how are ya how's it on this one
person's basement i understand right
right it's gonna be like in bathrooms or
fast food restaurants next city jcpenney
all sorts of things i can go wrong with
this plan absolutely it's danger waiting
to happen oh let's talk about whole
foods for a second are you big whole
foods person you ever go there
ever been there Pete occasion occasion
yeah Eiling for chicks there at the
salad bar you do now oh definitely
someone told me that's what they do Oh
two chicks yeah it's not a bad idea I
mean it's not if there are worse places
to pick up chicks yeah jeez I'll it's
pretty good for singles there you go
just saying all right we'll go rap
singles so what's happening waka waka oh
god what's happening a whole foods is
trying out some new technology in the
shopping experience Jack I like this uh
we've seen Kinect being used in a lot of
creative different way sure and now
they're trying to take connect integrate
them into shopping carts to sort of do
away with a do away with customer
service colors and we call them grocery
store baggers that does not check out
people cashier yes she okay you've lost
that word for a second you work as a
bagger for a courtesy clerk currency
because the bagging is not the only job
that we do why would you sweeping okay
helping elderly women take the Krishna
oh that's sweet you ever get tipped out
no no Jerry women are bears out of it
with old ladies not just in general yeah
no no usually the bagger is in the first
place you'd go for a date yeah be like
oh thanks for helping me clean up the
pickle jar I broke thank you what are
you doing Friday night you want to date
a fingertip never had a nickname yeah
anyway so Microsoft is proposing this
new program they showed it off at their
Redmond location I guess last week
there's a prototype where they're gonna
have a motorized cart with the Kinect
built right in and that camera will scan
whatever you put into the cart and it'll
either recommend alternatives based on
your budget or it'll recommend
alternatives based on your health yeah
lifestyle so if you're looking to lose a
little bit of weight they'll sure maybe
that like 12 gallon you know drum of
lube or whatever might not be such a
great idea no one's eating lube you mean
like lard right yeah oh I would need
either of those things um so yeah I mean
they'll they'll make recommendations
based on those things those constraints
and eventually at the end though charge
you out so to limit
that cashier entirely right you just
walk right out of the store two things I
want to bring up its number one you
brought up yourself autumn self-checkout
yeah its worst thing ever worse right
what do you think never works it's
terrible terrible always tells you to
put it back on the sensor right it's all
convenient when you have like two things
yeah when you buy like a pack of gum yes
I thing stop with that not only taking
away jobs like start to pay attention
stuff like this right they have one
bozos like in charge of monitoring the
entire fleet of automated checkout
things and they always break they never
work it's time to eliminate these from
grocery store it was a good idea to run
with it to write like a solid for a
while yeah you know I was really feeling
it now it's done really for now it's
over how's a line always much longer
than the actual don't know what they're
getting done they really don't and you
know why it's not you know we be like Oh
what is it too complicated for you but
you know what it kind of is you know
there's like one do i scan my car when
do I do this when I do that enough ready
it's one of those things that you you
think we're invented so that stand-up
comedian sound like a new thing here no
it's been around for like six seven
years ago yeah hot so whatever sheriff
it just gone no I've gotten easier over
those seven years also want to bring up
the whole grocery shopping experience
you guys you do grocery shopping in a
restaurant i do first direct to what
about you yeah i do grocery shopping
there's a whole foods right on my part
so you'd with the card yep do don't you
think they need to maybe provide some
sort of like display for people i mean
like i wanted three things i want to be
able to use a little like tablet or
something on the shopping cart so I know
where I'm headed ah yeah I'm done yeah
you know I gotta go up and down 14
aisles right that's kind of crazy you
want to know you want to type in exactly
what you want and then it'll route a map
for you around the grocery store they
did a little asian way to do that's a
little too ambitious with the actual
traffic flow through a store what but
like tell me where in this 4,000 square
foot supermarket or i can find the
things i need to look for I mean you
could have the efficient more efficient
crowd control that way too i don't know
if you've been to the trader joes on
fourteenth Street no oh man have you
there is hell then like PE I guess the
way people do is they have the buddy
system all this going with 23 play I got
chosen will immediately jump in line
which is all wrapped around the
perimeter of the store the other person
will shop then the switch spots and even
that amount of time they won't have gone
to the firm line that's interesting
crazy laugh like that I think your idea
would help time to revolutionize that
shopping grocery shopping experience
greed I think it's been what 70 years of
the same sort of thing like looking up
at the aisle asking you know hey pimples
yeah the Torah ya know like let's let's
maybe evolve that to write a place
that's more efficient right let's do it
with the Oriental aisle 2 i'm just a
problem with that it's cold over the
oriental island yeah I've seen that sign
that's not cool see I think of notes to
that name in Oriental yeah all right so
you're okay with like objects being
called that well until someone asks me
where the Oriental aisle is ask oh yes
hey guy here it alls we got one call
from the public that we will play right
now I this is Jeff from elkhart I was
just listening to your show with my
class here couple students practice by
wearing helmets on snowboards and
actually showed me a type of material
called d30 thought I was some
interesting stuff because they actually
expected in the snow bear heads and then

guy getting hit the head with a shovel
online oh my god alright well just
thought i'd share that with you guys

the BMX no ms high school BMX is no mode
okay you know right yeah yeah I know
you're pretty badass with that stuff
sometimes its complement your just be
like yeah yeah yeah it cooks right um
yeah well first off i also want to
address the fact that he said he was
listening to our show with his class
yeah that are we considered education I
mean we've gotten a call from a teacher
before I wonder if they're the same part
of the same group I don't know teacher
who listened to our show together as
like a technology segment amazing day
sir that sir I think his name is Jeff
Rossen right we are not a reliable
source I want to hear more about this
experience about this teacher student

sounds intriguing want to know more
about that so let us know what rule if
my teacher played podcast back in the
day well be sick fantastic hey I'm down
for it so I want to look at this
material d30 it's goldie 30 d300 look
into them make some you know started
with a slalom skiers okay so they would
put it in their forearm and write your
shins me when going over the flags and
stephanie how it was yeah they say what
the material does is that it's very
malleable it's very soft but once any
amount of force or pressure is applied
entire thing like sort of stiffens up oh
the g forms is like the g it is exactly
like the team you hear about the g form
stuff is coming to g4 looking at the
website right now sure they copied these
guys yes sounds like it because i
remember they said this they got their
start making ipad cases and they based
it off sports protect you they're making
like that equipment and stuff like that
so this is like a soft material but when
you hit it with impact it's awesome
that's really cool that is cool alright
