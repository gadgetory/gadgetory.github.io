screens our time and apparently our
common sense here's a recap of this
week's biggest fails the live forecast
in Florida was looking pretty great
until it was interrupted by an anchor on
a mission for Pokemon that is the stunt
was apparently staged by the station but
the weatherman seems to have been left
out of the loop a man in Brooklyn was on
a Pokemon a role when he caught wind of
a lunar by the only thing between him
and the lure a pond best part about this
story he happened to be recording
himself as he was playing so we get a
first-person play-by-play of the dunk
the phone is currently in the rice bag I
see you so this one was only a matter of
time because you can hit way more pokey
stops in a car than on foot literally a
New Yorker in Auburn was allegedly
playing the game while driving and ended
up ploughing his car into a tree the man
survived the crash but no word yet on
whether or not he actually caught the
Pokemon and these guys take the cake by
a landslide two men in encinitas
california chased a pokemon off a cliff
one landed on a beach 80 feet below
while the other got stuck on a bluff a
few feet up and had to be rescued out of
there they both suffered moderate
injuries but their egos on the other
hand are way beyond repair</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
