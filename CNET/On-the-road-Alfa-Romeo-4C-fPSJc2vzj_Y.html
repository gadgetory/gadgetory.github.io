for its us come back with a minute
super guard his dead manual a
convenience there you almost never find
that thing
let's drive the Alfa 4c check the tail
ok anatomy of a supercar at in the
middle is a carbon fibre tub that's
where you sit on either end our
aluminium subframes that's what connects
you to the rest of the car behind you is
the engine behind that you're gonna find
it very small and the only trunk it's
warm place you wouldn't take a lemon
meringue pie to the track back there you
got to put that on the passenger's seat
the front looks like a trunk it's not
there's just apparatus in there it only
comes off with tools two people know
plus two
now while the 4c is little its body
still is not getting across that thing
is like taking a trip cross-country well
once you're in it's snug but not tight
you've got an LCD and rather compact
instrument panel up there it's kind of
godly rendered but it gets the
information across the head unit is an
afterthought in fact it's aftermarket
that's a parent Astro and Antoine
reviewed one of those years ago got a
little bit of app support but it's kind
of a weird little outlier obviously not
the point of the car the drive controls
are you've got asymmetrical paddles
downshift left up shift is on the right
here is your transmission drive control
for your dual clutch automated manual
one is the same as Drive puts you in
first gear
there's no park neutral reverse and then
your automatic or manual switch over
mode unlike many other cars if you grab
a shift while you're in automatic it
holds for a few seconds in manual mode
and drops back to auto this is an
interesting control down here you can
tell somebody at ofle is in love with
the idea of having a control called DNA
and what it does is control the cars
drive modes its DNA D is gonna be your
dynamic month and down one more gets you
into what they call natural mode and how
do you make a work what is that yeah
it's kind of tortured its all-weather
mode go up to dynamic though hang on to
that guy for like five seconds and
there's the Easter Egg you get into race
mode now your abs and your stability
controller both turned off you better
know your car well first
huge part of the story on the force sea
of course lies back here in the engine
bay mid-engine car rear-wheel drive one
choice on the transmission it's a
six-speed dual-clutch automated manual
now the engine itself 1750 CC
inline-four servo charged of course it's
also got direct injection and multi-port
fuel injection the idea is that each of
those is better at different parts of
the RPM range and driving load range so
the car will alternate back and forth or
blend them the number 237 horse 258
pound-feet of torque gets this car that
weighs about 2,500 pounds up to 60 and
around 4.5 seconds now note that if
you're one of our European or a rest of
the world viewers your 4c weighs a lot
less over 350 pounds less because in the
u.s. we have a lot of crash standard
apparatus especially at the front rear
ends and of course we're loaded up with
air conditioning under niceties that you
can strip out in other markets in a car
like this that matters a lot the fuel
economy if you care is 24 City 34
highway that's actually really good so
you're getting a really fast exotic car
that sips gas what's not to love first
thing you notice on the 4c which you may
be hearing
are all these glorious noises you've got
the spooling of the turbo you've got the
whooshing at the intake you've got the
Popoff valve blasting off once in a
while as they bleed off excess boost
this is the nearest thing to the sound
you get in a Veyron that's exactly what
it reminds me of the next thing you're
aware of is the steering it's high ratio
completely unassisted tuck into a corner
like this and the precision is amazing
there is prodigious power here but
unless you keep it on the boil you're
very aware of turbo lag it's not like
it's not there as either alpha or some
other reviewers will tell you but in the
car light this is not a big impediment
because you're happy to keep it's pooled
up keep your foot in it now Alfa Romeo
doesn't plan to come back to the u.s. as
a value brand but they kind of have this
cars a screeching deal for its exotic
engineering and extremely wearable
handling we're looking at about 55 to
face and then there are three things
we'd have to go see next time they can
be as packages 1800 bucks I'll get your
Park Distance sensors the only parking
help you can get on this car better
speakers an alarm and cruise control
Americans like that stuff the track
package for 2400 gets you a firmer
performance suspension some carbon fiber
trim I could live without and a rear
spoiler and if the base exhaust isn't
rowdy enough for you 500 bucks new to
the sport exhaust so your neighbors will
fully hate you all in about 60 grand for
one of the most distinctive cars that
we've ever driven and perhaps one of
those responsive ones you ever will
more cars driven see next aisle standing
