Carey very last day
extravaganza here on the peanut stage
today we are going to argue about tvs
and break down the reality of products
that we've seen over and over and over
gonna see us but first we get the
pleasure of talking to the 2017 CES
ambassador who also does some other
stuff too or whatever please welcome
actor comic author host and super geek I
should have ah hello I feel like I'm
like a middling middlin geek mouth super
geek like a lesser I don't know man you
play a lot of video games you host my
guy like I don't really have any powers
I'm just really good at like archery you
know name like I had my yeah that's
about my love it's like our lame is
super power play video games really for
gamers yeah that I do stuff that
everybody else does i like it like you
do yeah you get those hot NDA's though
that's nice you get to see everything a
little bit before you tiny bit before
yeah so you're the CSM basser this year
I am I am what does that mean to be
ambassador I have no idea no I'm I all I
know is I have to abdicate my post
before inauguration day you will cram
the netting replaced yeah you're also an
you're a host Aisha Tyler just like in
West world yes you're actually just a
robot welcome to seeing it um I really
hope there is a like a talking lady
robot or a talking man robot I'm you
know I'm not gender bias um I look I
think part of the experience of being
the Ambassador is just being the link
between the lay person who likes
technology maybe isn't hyper you know
hyper influencer and you know this world
experience everything talking about it I
mean for me specifically because I use
technology so much in my work I'm a
little bit different I'm not like ooh
look at vr I'm like this be our demo had
better be awesome i've already seen 17
that underwhelmed the hell out of me
think it's important though because to
be discerning here because there's so
much stuff ya can't be excited about
everything I mean is there any tech here
that actually has you excited or you're
hopeful for I mean or tech in general
you know is there a thin TV here seems
like there's always a big TV is a bitter
a thinner baby you're so thin you have
to use your imagination um you know I've
heard look I i I'll of technology as you
said I feel like coming to see us it's
like trying to have a sip of water from
a firehose it's impossible to truly
digest everything that's here i I'm a
filmmaker so I'm always in
then the stuff that feeds specifically
into content creation and that makes you
a better more powerful content creator
so I'll be excited to see you know
cameras and platforms and stuff that can
make me better at filmmaking I am
excited about the self-driving cars i
have a self-driving cars so if i see it
another one it had better be better than
the heat as i like to call her oh and
and i look at the televisions you know
because again if you're making films or
television you're excited about new ways
to deliver it and how you can better
create upwards to make sure that the end
experience is better for your viewer you
know i mean it those tvs are great but
there's nothing to watch on them there's
a problem and I think that's been the
disconnect specifically with the 4k TVs
previously yeah have you tried out
virtual reality does it get you
nauseated no you know I've been lucky
because I got to try it like way way
back when it first got acquired at
facebook when when they first got oculus
rift I tried it there I've tried it at
subsequent e3's I will say the last set
of demos at e3 for me were pretty cool
it still got a long way to go I put when
I put my VR headset on i'm a gorgeous
chocolate brown woman and then when i am
in VR i'm apparently a white dude i
don't know why i like a hurdle in
magical that we should work on that one
because when i create my own avatar I
look like myself with a mohawk and I've
got tattoos so I feel like we get that's
a pretty easy yeah we can get there but
um but yeah there was some pretty cool
stuff at e3 I tried the Star Trek the
Star Trek v our game and that was rad
that was and also it was controller
freight do you Ne which I really like I
don't mind holding controllers but it's
a nice voice commands and it kind of
recognizing your movement it was it was
pretty 360 and super interactive but now
it felt it felt very immersive and fun
and I did not get nauseated I liked that
quite a bit i'm excited for the holodeck
experience you know what i mean that's
that's where we need to be most like
like you're saying like lay people are
not super connected that's the thing
where they're like i'm on board when i
can see that when i can be in Paris and
go see the Louvre right and and it's
like a real experience I don't want that
either I want to be on Mars have it
having a fistfight with a Martian I can
go to the loo I mean you know not
everybody can go to move tomorrow
obviously be a cheaper trim it could be
a life but yeah I want it I want happens
I wanted to do space kungfu space confu
like that's my goal face kungfu Tyler
yeah I'm down for that uh so we want to
get some hot takes over you okay we have
three products that we chose that are
bonkers yes is a weird place you know a
lot of concept tech some time as we go
to you know certain places that maybe we
don't always think about going to that's
too far it's hard to find your niche in
the technological world you know when
you're trying to innovate you're also
trying to fill a need that you think has
not been filled before and that is
really hard when again there's this fire
hose the size of you know an elephant
shooting at you're never gonna get a sip
of water you're going to die yeah
exactly and everybody was trying
everybody's trying to find you know that
killer app everybody's trying to find
that thing that kind of breaks their
their niche open sure and I'm sure that
a lot of people here this year haven't
gotten it yet but they're looking
they're searching and if innovation is
about expansive thinking right you got a
drug bear you gotta go big or go home
okay so Bridget you all right you want
rethought off we'll have some lesson
let's start off with the tan vez okay
I'm hoping this is a base basically the
spray tan stuff with basically you know
when you're looking at something don't
you wish you could actually feel what it
was you know maybe you want to buy a
dress and you want to feel the texture
of the fabric well that's where Tampa
scums in field textures with haptic
feedback on the screen so the screen
will kind of feel like lumps on your
laptop I guess if it's a bogey typically
triggers me to make a genius bar
appointment there are lumps in my laptop
screen now doctor this is this is not a
real doctor stroke having a stroke
stroke um this is not is this a new is
this a piece of hardware is it's gonna
be software that's going to render your
your current laptop its be built into
the screen so its hardware too okay so
company who's designing story technology
made to be built into a laptop it's very
Fahrenheit yeah yeah I find there's a
little couple weird of options to you
don't on I also feel like look I think
we're gonna get more you know haptic
activated products going forward and
we're all ready for all ready for our
red ready player one haptics oh yeah I'm
super ready for that I can't wait for
that bring it out um but I I'm like I'll
just say for the record I'm not I'm not
a first adopter I'm a second adopter not
because i fear technology but because i
don't want to invest time and money and
it's going to die a terrible death three
months later so this is not something
that I would do right away okay um I
like to just order a bunch of stuff have
it delivered to my house and touch it in
real life and then send it back for free
all right yeah I like that's my plan is
we're skipping on so much memory does
need to happen in meatspace are we not
an against Turkish word on what they're
gonna use that for lumpy laptops you
know where that's good i know i know a
lumpy screen is going I me all know
where everything on the internet goes
yeah we all end up at the end of the day
all right product number two you're in
VR but you wish you could really feel
your it there it's still it's all about
feelings in so here comes tackle em with
VR shoes here was you're walking through
your virtual world you can find on has
those sandals you can feel like you're
on water grass and an old old lady
sandals yeah straight up man birkenstock
is rolling over and is great look at
those things they are okay I don't want
to make the tackle impede what's the
name was yeah you got it I don't want I
don't want to offend mr. tackle em so i
will say that that i'm sure someone
somewhere things that those are
attractive somewhere my mom my mom can't
wait to rock those with some fuzzy
slippers or maybe the toes where this
odds with the toes that articulate time
yeah yeah okay so what are we feeling
grass water and apparently the the mud
feels quite real a pretty good oh yeah
yeah slowly she can feel it kind of
decision okay I can't imagine you're
like going out with Danny yeah if you
want i feel the gravel underneath the
feet could cycads i mean i could see
this like it like in a foreign planet
iteration like a halo that could be kind
of cool yeah fighting what I'm doing
Mike my Mars come foo yeah um I think
that we are we need to look for like v2
or v3 when those things aren't so
insanely like sticking your foot into an
empty soup can but um but I I don't I
don't hate it alright I don't write it
don't hate it I like that's a definite
asset that was yeah don't know that was
not a faint faint praise fate but I
don't I don't hate the concept and
obviously they're different early
iteration of this product I've never
seen a lot of VR like how do you feel
like you're in VR they're just going
with the show yeah yeah and this is
obviously you know a very early it's
really naturally
growing space show okay all right last
one finally I have for this one if you
donating your you're in an office and
you don't want to be able to hear you
how about the hush meme bluetooth
headphones basically for your mouth it's
a voice mask it covers up your phone
calls and some people can't actually
hear what you're saying while you're
talking other sounds will be projected
out of it like squirrel sounds bird
sounds they even have Darth Vader
breathing I don't know in the squirrel
but just like a squirrel bar but yeah
monkey sounds apparently too and rain
and how to out of out of it yes out of
it can't hear you talking in it so again
when people want to feel like they're
having a stroke yeah that guy is making
squirrel sounds out of his mouth I also
smell toast I do I smell toast that's
all cuz my rank squirrels every day when
I wake up that's the first question I
ask myself am I see my smell toast first
question of the day so it also uh what's
this product called hush me but when you
want to look like the GIMP and pulp
fiction in an airport restaurant yeah
vain vain yeah yeah i'll be home at four
fifteen not rustenburg hahaha I gotta
tell you something I don't know what is
happening that looks crazy absolutely
bananas I don't I don't disagree with
the sentiment because it again that you
could bat be having high level
conversations I mean this is essentially
like real space you know like I can't
think of the word cuz i'm at because I'm
am having a stroke encryption right this
is like meets face encryption you're
encrypting your conversation in real in
real time I like that but um that's
crazy-looking and that guy right there
he agrees you he thinks it's crazy
looking he doesn't know what to do with
his eyes eyes are saying just kill me
he's saying help please help me go I'm
waiting for Bruce Willis to come here
and save me from these two crazy people
in this basement it's Nakatomi Plaza
hear anybody huh that is it that's all
the time we have for you I was super fun
I was yeah it was amazing I'm excited
going on beyond CES well oh I'm gonna
I'm gonna see and touch every single
thing on the CES for today after which I
will definitely have a stroke um and
then I just directed my first feature
which was an incredible experience it
literally just finished it
it wit with with in which technology
played an incredible part because you
know I tried to shoot a movie in seven
days for two hundred thousand dollars we
shot it digitally we could not have done
it any other way three ariel X and minis
over a very accelerated aggressive
production schedule we did it in just a
week and and then I edited the film
myself with the help of an assistant
editor and and it you know every part of
my life has been immersed in some form
of you I for the last nine months so
it'll be exciting to be playing for a
little while while I concept my next
movie and then I'll you know I'm also
doing who's that is anyway we're just
shooting the fifties in whose lives
anyway this spring I'm in the twelfth
season of criminal minds I'm in the
seventh season of the talk and we are
about to launch the eighth season of
archer so that's all the other stuff I'm
doings you can check me out in those
things and uh yeah and I also need a new
phone so anybody else I'm hoping there
you might find one ok someone flings a
phone of you like a frisbee down on the
floor yeah thanks pretty good hopefully
a haptic one have fast reflexes I'm
happy as we've established I'm a Martian
ninja I don't do you not we're not
listening no I got it I'm terrified
thank you so much again it was great a
stage that is it for Aisha Tyler think
we're so happy to powder here and
applause everyone yeah thank you so much
we are going to take a very quick break
and when we come back we are going to
argue about whether you would rather
have a flexible or transparent
television so stick around
welcome back to the show thank you again
to Aisha Tyler for stopping by our stage
but now it's time to get real that's
right we have a bone to pick with some
products that we see here year after
year at CES but they just never seem to
really break out of the trap of CES no
they really don't and not to name names
bortoli gonna name names a really good
example of this is lon droid that's
right okay so for those of you have
product amnesia oh yeah you have product
amnesia we know CES is a difficult place
it's easy to get assaulted with products
this was announced in 2015 but it's here
again and it's still in development we
have a video we can show basically droid
this is a well that's a cell phone but
there there we go this is something
where you just dump your clothes into
this massive closet and inside the robot
is folding your laundry problem is it's
still after all these years takes a long
time to fold each shirt yeah so for one
load of laundry have to dump your
clothes in there and it's an overnight
thing I believe it to run overnight and
it's not every Ivan it's a shirt yeah
too much that's too much time well also
can't even do every kind of piece of
clothing ya can't do socks socks too
hards not gonna match your socks for you
sorry I want you to do a lot of the I
don't know if every guy knows this out
there but I don't think I'd note knows
this but like female clothes are just
hard to fold too so I'm sure probably
like destroy evidence I won't bother
folding I just throw on a chair looks
like basically my whole life at home I
just I'm like I don't want to fold this
yeah I mean listen if I could have a
folding robot that does that really
awesome japanese fold that you see on
youtube all the time where people go
fold your clothes in two seconds and
then you do this thing and you match
stuff and then all of a sudden you pull
your hands out and and your clothes are
folded like that's amazing if a robot
can start doing that and start folding
shirts for me in quick succession i'm in
and i'll pay any price for that because
I
folding clothes and I hate putting away
laundry but five minutes of shirt not
good and this company just secured
another round 60 million dollars in
funding from Panasonic so they this has
been three years now it's been at the
show and it's still not out yet I think
they said this year next year they just
keep getting funny because we all want
to live that dream right CS full of
dreams that we have the cat grab on to
just yet I'm from Hollywood I know what
broken dreams look like and let me tell
you there are a lot of them here at CES
um so that's the thing we want we wanted
to just sort of complain about but
there's been a lot of stuff that we see
in development all the time it just
never quite make it right take and I
think that's a good transition into the
other thing we want to get into our
gadget battles oh yeah we got to have a
good old-fashioned gadget fight before
we go yesterday we asked you on Twitter
what would you rather have in your
future TV which rather have a flexible
ultra-thin screen or would you rather
have a transparent television so you're
like the important choices in life you
guys so we're going to get to the
twitter answers in a minute but for now
Bridget and I we used to have a minute
but I think we should up the ante and we
should make it 45 seconds all right to
make your case pick a side defend your
case and then you guys are actually
gonna tell us who won by applause so get
your hands ready to clap I need you to
clap please clap please come a little
more for me though you know yeah yeah
and Bridget will be handing out checks
if you clap louder notes are high there
is a tiara on the line so there is it's
a vegas vegas is full of sparkle full of
magic that's you know they kind of show
we have so that's very true okay so I'll
get the stopwatch ready which side are
you picking all right I'm gonna go with
the see-through TV you are gonna go to
see through TV you have 45 seconds are
you ready I'm ready go all right with
the see-through TV you know all right so
a bendable TV is nice and all but but
you know the bendable TV got that giant
sound bar underneath of the see-through
you have so much more options for your
to home decor if you wanna turn the TV
off you commit something else behind it
you want to put art put art you can do
that i'll put a fish tank do that too
doesn't have to be on a wall you can put
it in the middle of your room that some
sort of cool divider you can still see
through it and you know forget
screensavers like life is now behind it
ain't no life is great put in front of a
mirror or now me or
a window yes put a window see the real
world nature is still better than you
know you have walls five more sack okay
okay and yeah nature is why I went cuz
nature's better than blanktv blackness
all right that was pretty good those are
good points you can put it in the middle
of a room use it an art piece I like it
I like it like those are good points
those are good points but not enough for
me to concede madam not enough for me to
concede i am going to do you want run
stopwatch i will i can if you want i
have it out let's do it and then i know
i want to control the stopwatch alright
alright are you ready flexible TV
flexible ultra-thin TV ready go first of
all you can hang it anywhere it can go
anywhere in your apartment even if you
have a slightly curved wall you can wrap
it right around you can see in this
footage is amazing this TV will bend
just slightly you move it easily if you
need it also if you're hanging on your
wall and it soldier thin you have more
floor space for activities which is one
thing i really like you have to put it
on a big ugly TV stand uh you someday
I'm going to be able to roll up my TV
and take it on vacation and I really
like that and i think that's amazing and
also and i think most importantly i live
in california where there are
earthquakes where the ground moves and
things fall down and so i live in
constant fear of being crushed by my
television in high bedroom five seconds
wet know and apply if I'd ever have to
be afraid of that and I get to keep my
TV because I would just pick it up it
would just float to the ground I'd roll
it back up sambar okay thank you for
your just Oh choking on sound bar I
heard you all right look at the pole all
right yep let's pull up the pole all
right let's pull the pole what do we got
here what did the tweets what does the
tweets what are the tweets saying on the
Internet I think the tweets would you
rather we have over a thousand votes and
said thank you 71 percent of the people
say they'd rather look this guy's like
no wrong sky me on is like absolutely
not thin and flexible 71 percent of
voters with over a thousand votes I'm
sorry that is that seemed well you know
I thought there's still like an hour
left so if you you know if you really
feel motivated you could find like a
thousand people to help vote you all
right well the audience think i'm
personally i'm home based on the
arguments you've heard is there more use
out of a see-through TV or really thin
flexible t is it a c4 TV oh ma one guy
you have ones of people clapping for you
is it a thin flexible TV let's all be
honest is the thin slippery oh and
i take my rightful place as queen of the
CES stage i might not put this on but
not sideways yeah put on sideways like
to feel really oh this is even better
i'll just leave it like this it's fine
it's so good I'm gonna I'm gonna put
this on just a little bit just a little
little jaunty I'm trying to make it a
little jaunty today because i won and it
feels so good uh that is it that's
