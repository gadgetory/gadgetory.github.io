keyboard cover and Windows 8 OS
Microsoft's surface with Windows RT is
definitely a unique tablet but that's
just on the outside what about on the
inside let's find out I'm Bill Detweiler
and this is cracking open from a
hardware standpoint there's a lot to
like about the windows RT version of the
surface the ten point six inch IPS
screen has a true 16 by 9 aspect ratio
and a resolution of 1366 by 768 it has
stereo speakers a micro HDMI output a
full-size USB 2 port micro SD card slot
and 720p front and rear cameras
Microsoft didn't skimp on the internals
either it has a quad-core 1.3 gigahertz
NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor 2 gigs of ram
bluetooth for Wi-Fi and it comes in
either 32 or 64 gig models it's slightly
heavier than the third gen iPad and
galaxy note 10.1 but only by a few
ounces overall it's well-built and feels
sturdy in your hands and thankfully you
don't need a heat gun to crack it open
with the kickstand raised remove the two
Torx screws on the stands hinges and
then the stand itself the case screws
that were hidden under the stand come
out next followed by the thin piece of
trim along the top edge and then the
screws that were underneath that from
the bottom lift up on the back cover and
in the process disconnect the battery
from the motherboard and we now get our
first look inside the surface and can
continue our teardown the battery is
glued to the back cover but comes off
without much fuss next to come out is
the magnetic charging port and microSD
card reader assembly followed by the
speakers then what appears to be a third
smaller speaker and the headphone jack
and volume button assembly after
disconnecting it from the motherboard
and detaching all its connectors
we can remove the smaller touchscreen
circuit board last to come out is the
motherboard and once it's removed we can
detach the cameras pop off the shields
and get a good look at the chips to
power the surface at this point our
teardown is pretty much complete while
it is possible to separate the LCD from
the front glass panel the two are held
together with strong adhesive and I
don't want to risk damaging either
component by separating them now in the
past I would have criticized Microsoft
for using this construction technique
because it increases the cost of
replacing a cracked screen or broken
panel but having spent way too much time
trying to remove specks of dust from
between the iPads glass panel and LCD
I'll spend the extra money for a quicker
repair now the only real downside here
is that the magnetic contact for the
touch cover can't really be accessed
without removing the LCD a surface with
Windows RT isn't the most difficult to
crack open tablet I've worked on know
that title still goes to the iPad but
it's not a cakewalk either hopefully the
surface with Windows probe which is
aimed at businesses will be more repair
friendly now for more information on the
surface including real world tests
