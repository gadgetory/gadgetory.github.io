mobile Congress 2013 we're taking a look
at the Alcatel OneTouch fire so what's
exciting about this phone well it has a
3.5 inch display it's got a 3.2
megapixel camera but those things aren't
very exciting know what's key to this
phone is its software because this
mobile is running Mozilla's Firefox OS
which is a brand new operating system
that might take on the lights of Android
Windows Phone and maybe even iOS so
Firefox OS is very very simple
especially at the moment I was talking
to alcatel and they told me that with
this phone they've gone for the lowest
end hardware they can to try and make
the phone as cheap as possible they said
that when you do that when you have a
really really cheap low-end phone and
put android on it the experience isn't
very good so hopefully this is a kind of
operating system that's going to play
really well with that dirt cheap
hardware and that of course will result
in really cheap phones if you swipe
through to the right then you can see
all of your apps the home screen of
course is very basic and then if you
swipe to the left you get access to the
shop where you can buy more apps right
now there are only a few thousand
optimized apps hopefully that will grow
because of course that's not exactly
going to trouble a likes of Apple or
Android at the moment if you swipe down
from the top you get an android style
notification box which also has
shortcuts to the settings and the
ability to turn off Wi-Fi quite quickly
underneath here this is a
touch-sensitive home key so I open up a
nap and I want to quickly jump out of it
I just have to press there so at the
moment there is a huge amount to see but
firefox OS is certainly feeling quite
smooth and it's really interesting and
it could one day be a really really
amazing opportunity for people who don't
have very much money to get a proper
smartphone experience it feels quite
slick at the moment and my first
impressions are pretty positive this
phone is going to be very very cheap and
it's going to be coming out in the
summer I'm the West Road tew/cnet and
this is the Alcatel OneTouch fire
