at the Lenovo flex 20 this is another
one of the growing category of what I
call tabletop pcs a lot of companies
have these now they're essentially 20
inch tablets they've got batteries
inside they also have kickstand so they
stand up like all-in-one PCs and usually
come with a keyboard and now so you can
use it like that also HP has one sony
has one dell has one if you go down to
18 inches that's how big the dell one is
this one is technically nineteen and a
half inches Lenovo calls it the Flex 20
the main thing this guy has going for it
is that it's a little bit less expensive
than some of the other tabletop PCs
we've seen right now you can get this
for 750 and that's pretty reasonable
these are kind of low right inspection
Intel Core i3 in here just four gigs of
ram regular old 500 gigabyte hard drive
so no SSD no higher end processors I
didn't see any upgrade options right now
but if you want to try something like
this out from less you certainly can't
go wrong spending 750 bucks on a big 20
inch all-in-one that also has a battery
in it so the way a tabletop PC works is
you have it set up like this and then
it's got a hinge in the back with a
kickstand like this and when you're
ready you just push the table down and
it just lies flat and oftentimes it'll
launch a custom software interface of
lenovo has one called aura that lets you
manipulate stuff on the tabletop
differently than you would for example
in the windows 8 menu and when you're
done with that you just hit the latch
and the kickstand comes out and you set
it up again just like it was before
compared to some of the other tabletop
PCs we've seen other a few budget
touches to this guy the screen
resolution is only 1600 by 900 not the
1920 by 1080 on virtually every other
type of machine like this we've seen
there's only two USB ports and if you
use the included keyboard and mouse it
has a little receiver that eats up one
of those ports no SD card slot no
optical drive or anything like that so
who exactly are these tabletop PCs for
you know I think they make excellent
all-around family PCs you can push them
down put them on the coffee table put
them on an ottoman Vic great for playing
games of lenovo had some games built in
and you could buy some optional little
bumpers and joysticks or playing the
games
great for messing around with photos
even looking at maps or big news apps
really gives you a very sort of sit
around the table with the whole family
kind of feel if you want the most high
end of tabletop PCs lenovo has a new
version of their 27-inch machine coming
out later this year and that should be a
lot of fun but on the lower end you
can't do a lot better than this guy for
750 bucks
Ivan Ackerman and that is the Lenovo
