Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update Apple finally has revealed two
new types of iphones and yes the rumors
were true we have a gold iPhone 5s that
can read your fingerprints and there's a
cheaper plastic iPhone 5c here's a quick
breakdown of what you need to know the
top-of-the-line iphone 5s comes in three
shades a dark grey silver and gold and
it's pretty much the same design as the
current iphone 5 except for a few
improvements the biggest one is that the
home button can now scan your
fingerprint at a very detailed level and
even if your thumb is a bit off-center
it still should work apple says your
print is not being stored on Apple
servers this information is just saved
on your phone but it can be used as a
quick way to verify that you want to buy
a song or a nap no more passwords needed
and no more swiping to unlock there's
also a new chip inside called the m7 it
just keeps track of motion so apps can
know if you're walking or driving or how
active you are Apple didn't talk about a
SmartWatch but this technology is
something we could see in a future i
watch activity tracker now aside from
faster processors the camera also got a
boost it has a better sensor and the
flash is something called true tone
flash which white balances the photo so
your flash will match the color of the
room so if there are amber lights around
you it'll look like you have an amber
light flash instead of a bright white
flash app will also add a new software
tricks the camera can take multiple
photos and it automatically picks the
sharpest for you and there's a slo-mo
video capture mode the price is what you
would expect starting at two hundred
dollars with a contract but I hope
you're sitting down because you cannot
pre-order this phone and get it mailed
to you on the launch day if you want to
be among the first to have it in your
hand on September 20th looks like you'll
have to go to a store yep get ready for
the lines but you will be able to
pre-order the colorful plastic iPhone 5c
beginning on Friday September 13th which
will also arrive a week later on the
20th if you don't care about fingerprint
sensors and extra snazzy cameras
then the five-seat will save you a
hundred dollars Apple isn't selling last
year's iPhone 5 at all anymore but it is
selling the two-year-old 4s for free
under contract which is a little odd
since it's the only one that still has
the old 30-pin connector dock but even
if you're not getting a new model
current iphone and ipad owners can
upgrade to the new iOS 7 operating
system starting on September 18th it has
a completely new look and navigation so
it'll certainly feel like a new device
that your tech news update but you can
get more details on the new iOS 7 and
iPhone models at cnet com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
