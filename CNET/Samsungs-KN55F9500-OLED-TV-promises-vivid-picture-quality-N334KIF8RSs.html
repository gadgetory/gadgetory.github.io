2013 hanging out at the Samsung stand
with the company's new OLED TV okay this
is a 55 inch LED television samsung says
that it's OLED technology is better than
its rivals because it's using
red-green-blue OLED instead of the kind
of white Euler technology you'd find on
for example LG's televisions it's hard
to make a definitive verdict on picture
quality without putting it through our
rigorous review tests but I can say that
first impressions are extremely positive
OLED technology looks fantastic it's
currently a display technology that's
more popular on smartphones but when you
blow it up to this kind of scale you
just get these really really deep blacks
and these really vivid colors it looks
like a fantastic television
there's 3d on board of course as well
it's active shutter which has been
Samsung's kind of 3d technology of
choice rather than passive so that means
you will have to pay a little bit more
for spectacles if you want extra people
to view the screen the best news of all
however is that this TV is actually
going to be in shops unlike a lot of
other mystical OLED TVs that we've seen
that are just in concept stages for
example there's no pricing information
but you'd better start saving because
it's going to be astronomically
expensive I expect but it is coming out
this year on request wait the scene at
CES 2013 and this is Samsung's new OLED
TV</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
