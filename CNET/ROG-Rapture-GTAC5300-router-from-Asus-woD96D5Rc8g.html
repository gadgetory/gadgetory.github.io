router from ASOS now it's one of my
favorites for a few reasons
first ROG of course stand for Rogaine
see that's hook and secondly this one
comes with eight land poles and that
means you can plug more the budgets to
it before have to use Wi-Fi and you can
use two of those land pole together to
create a super fast to keep it per
second connection any type of Wi-Fi is
super fast too in my testing has very
good range and the speed top at some 750
megabit per second on the foggy hood bet
that is super fast
now this one here is a tri-band router
meaning having 12.5 hood band and two 5k
hood bands having low bands mean you can
connect more devices to it at the same
time also you have more options now in
this particular case you can actually
dedicate one of the five good band just
for gaming and speaking of gaming this
one comes with a lot more options for
example is a built in what the fast
client which automatically connects the
router hands your entire network to the
gamers private network and that means if
you still suck at that
mmm oh well don't blame the connection
he also comes with a lot of gaming
centric customization and security
options now of course you don't have to
be a gamer to use this router but you
have to be one to actually justify its
cost this thing is not cheap costing
some foreign dollars also the routers
interface which is organized and quite
easy to you but come with a very strange
thing that only nerds and gamers can
appreciate most home user would fight
correct daunting and by the way if you
don't like the interface there's also a
mobile apps that can do almost
everything the interface can for now
though the mobile apps only work locally
meaning your phone has to be connected
to the router Wi-Fi network for it to
work
so you know this is a very powerful fast
and pretty cool router if you are gamers
especially if you have already used all
the ROG hardware like computer screen
keyboard and mouse for the rest of it
can be overkill and for me that's one
particular reason why I like this router
well it looked like a gigantic belly-up
spider and the only gigantic spider I
would play with is the one that's dead
grilling and that's because I'm don't
know and this is the GT 5300 router for
myself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
