some screwdriving work my favorite now
if you're thinking i'm holding the
screwdriver on my left hand and that's
odd you have no idea because this
Pegasus j4 here is crazily odd this is a
thunderbolt device that can house for
into a drive on the inside but you have
to dismantle it before you can see the
dry at the bottom here you see there are
five screw you have to undo them before
it can lift the top up so let's do it
you can see I'm pretty good at this even
though I'm a lefty so another school are
you can lift the top up and voila here
are the internal drive now you do have
to unscrew one more to take a dr appt in
case you want to replace it there you go
the J for work with any internal drive
both regular hard drive or SSD now the
second odd thing about the j 4 is the
fact that even though its host for into
a drive it does not support raid 5 but
just raid 0 red one and jaybob basically
all that your mac open system support
natively you can find all the option to
configure the drive by using the disk
utility in your mac open systems which
you have to use to configure drive
before you can use it now on the bottom
you see another Bay right here is not a
driveway but instead is a place where
you can replace the fan now unscrew the
screw right here and you see you can
replace the fan itself but you don't
want to replace this fan though because
in my testing is really quiet on the
front the j for come with a ray of blue
airy light that show the status of the
device and on the back even if I to
Thunderbolt port very standard for a
thunderbolt device and a power connector
and also a power button unfortunately
there is no USB 3.0 port in my testing
the j4 offer very fast performance it
was also very quiet and cool base
what it has to offer justify it costs
which is four hundred dollars without
storage or eight hund'd dollars with two
terabyte and of course for the whole I'm
messing around like me the screw driving
work is a bonus note that the Thunder
boom cable is not included though so to
get one for yourself me personally I
don't care because I have a ton right
here but that's of course I don't know
and this has been the proof first look
at the Primus j4 thunderbolts or device
now for more information check out the
full of us calm and you can always
follow me on my twitter or facebook
which you should do until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
