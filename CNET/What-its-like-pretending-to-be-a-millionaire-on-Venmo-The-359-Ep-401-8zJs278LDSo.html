Alfred Eng so Alfred dedicated the past
few months to moonlighting on venmo
under the handle at John Legend he
stumbled upon a variety of fellow
celebrity impersonators on the app who
are able to exist in part because venmo
doesn't verify its accounts and it's
unlikely celebrities would use their own
names on the app for obvious reasons
so anyway what why do this in the first
place honestly most of it was because I
thought it'd be pretty funny to be John
Legend I tried taking other celebrity
names too
Mark Zuckerberg was taken as was Elon
Musk but I spoke to others that had
taken these names I spoke with the
person that owned at Miley Cyrus and at
Guy Fieri I did try speaking with the
person that owned the handle at Justin
Bieber but he kind of ghosted me after a
little bit so just yeah that we're still
friends though we're still friends on
vamo which is another weird thing you
can like add people as friends on venmo
yeah what was your experience though you
mentioned in the story about how I guess
it's like once a week somebody would
request money from you for various
reason yeah I guess it's I'm sure they
don't do it just to me I'm sure they
like look up all celebrity handles and
tried you know oh if this is a real
person they're a millionaire maybe
they'll just give me some money you know
ten millionaires respond to a request
for like you know five dollars that's 50
bucks I'm doing nothing so you know I
would get requests every now and then
basically saying like hey you're John
Legend please give me money look the
saddest one which I felt really bad
about was one I could tell that they
were definitely reaching out to a bunch
of celebrities basically saying hey
we're trying to open up a Children's
Hospital in Atlanta can you donate like
$20 or something like that or you know
of your vast net worth and it was just I
felt really bad about it because I
didn't have the heart cells like hey I'm
not not really John Legend and I don't
really have the money to give you for
that really quickly - you spoke with at
Betsy DeVos not the real Betsy DeVos but
after the Sean Spicer blow-up when
people found his venmo account
apparently this guy was absolutely
flooded with quests and was like trolled
so much that he had to close out his
account yes so people did not like the
new Secretary of Education so I got she
he got like 200 requests like an hour or
something like that and it was all like
you know hey we don't like you please
give me a hundred thousand dollars for
how he just screwed me over of my
college tuition and things like that
yeah being a venmo impersonator is not
easy don't try this at home
I just hope John Legend doesn't end up
hated one day and I get all this
next up China's ZTE which is the fourth
largest phone maker in the US looks to
be getting a reprieve from President
Trump after the president's own Commerce
Department imposed paralyzing bans
against the company Trump over the
weekend said he'd work with China's
government to help ZTE get back into
business now ZTE is they mostly do
budget phones but this definitely for
anybody that actually has a ZTE phone is
probably pretty happy that the company
is not just gonna all of a sudden go
belly-up which is positive for that
yes I've actually been following this
for a while if if you're not familiar
ZTE suffered these sanctions because
last year they settled the case with the
Justice Department and the Commerce
Department over selling us equipment to
countries like Iran and North Korea this
was like a more than a billion dollars
in settlements and then they were
supposed to fire employees who were
involved in it and then when they did in
the Commerce Department basically said
okay you're violating our our sanctions
we're going to shut off the US market
yeah they said yeah basically you did
like the Google Playstore all palm which
like powers all its phones Dolby
speakers it basically meant that they
couldn't make any more phones which is
which is like really staggering yeah
either way I wanted to get to one last
story our own Jessica Dole cord said
Google seems to be trying a little too
hard to make me friends with Google
assistant too late me and Google
assistant are actually getting married
but it does raise some interesting
questions I'd say about whether you know
we're getting a little too close to
these voice assistants or they're trying
to make them a little too much in the
uncanny valley yeah I have no problem
with a either way if you want to read
more about these stories check us out on
CNET I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm alfred ring
thanks for listening
alright thanks for joining us for the
recording recording of the podcast
everybody I'm gonna jump into the chat
now and take your questions in comment
so we can keep the conversation going go
ahead and submit them along this is
great news for ZTE needless to say well
actually great news so let's keep it on
keep a lid on it yeah not to get overly
political about this because obviously
this is a tech podcast but it is
obviously interesting slash ironic to
see Trump directly saying he's going to
help preserve Chinese jobs after really
one of the signature parts of his
administration and his campaign has been
America first and American jobs but as
we're talking about this CTE situation
they agreed to the fine they agreed to a
lot of these restrictions and then
basically the Commerce Department was
able to in effect force the company to
shut down it does seem to me fairly
draconian it's really weird like when I
saw Trump's like tweet it just it just
didn't make that much sense to me to me
mostly because it kind of goes directly
against not just the Commerce Department
but also every intelligence agency and
the military in the u.s. like you're not
you're not allowed to have a ZTE phone
on a military base the Department of
Defense has like stopped like anybody
from buying it and like with several
recommendations against it for like
security concerns so it not only is it
you know in conflict of the Department
of Commerce's actions but now like every
intelligence agency to which like I
don't I don't understand where any of
this is coming from but yeah it's the
timing is definitely very interesting
and it's worth mentioning to our own
Roger Chang has been writing all about
this and this comes at the same time
though Huawei another Chinese handset
maker was basically bounced from Best
Buy stores to so they're facing a lot
more hurdles in the u.s. trying to sell
to US consumers and we'll see what
happens now after Trump tweeted about
this whether some of that is actually
going to get relaxed and consumers from
a consumer perspective people are going
to be able to get these options yeah
because a lot of Chinese officials have
actually been lobbying us
what like US officials about this
there's been reports let during the
talks about the the us-china trade war
that was going on with the sanctions
that this was like a topic that had come
up multiple times et has spoken about
that as well when I wrote about this
when I reached out to the Commerce
Department they had basically said that
usually in these cases these sanctions
like that's it you don't get to
negotiate about it and but they've been
making a special exception for ZTE so
there's been like more negotiations from
that I'd like to know what ven Mo's at
John Legend has to say about this can we
can we talk to him first um I'll just
turn on the Google assistant and ask
okay
anyway what sort of questions do we have
coming in well I mean just on the front
of the ZTE there are plenty of consumer
level consumers who are very interested
in making sure that they can still get
their hands on these because there are
great discount phones yeah and and if
you already have one
these Commerce Department bans meant
that you wouldn't be able to get the
newest Android patches or updates even
if ZTE had created their own app store
to rival the Google Play Store it
wouldn't be able to populate it with us
apps yeah which is a lot of apps so you
could see why this is this was being
described as like paralyzing from from
CTS perspective absolutely let's talk
about venmo imagine sag he wants to know
wow alfred was that legal I mean it's
about as legal as somebody going on
twitter with the handle at John Legend
one or something like that sure people
impersonate celebrities all the time on
social media there was actually a scam
going around on Twitter when you know
bitcoin was at it's like big big like
selling point where people would like
make fake handles pretending me like
Warren Buffett or Elon Musk and like
they tweet at people saying like hey I'm
giving away free like Bitcoin just like
you know send me some money and then
when it raises up that's just about yeah
obviously but like that's them
pretending to be celebrities as well
that is actually illegal but dude did I
read this correctly in your story though
that
what you did was technically against
venimos yes policy yeah your so then
most policy is that you have to be
accurate and who you represent yourself
as so the folks that I spoke with like
at Miley Cyrus even though her handle
was that Miley Cyrus her photo was still
like of her and then the display name
was like her actual name not everyone
does that though you know I must doesn't
do at Elon Musk doesn't do that I don't
do that so it's it's not like Kanye at
Kanye West doesn't do that either I
reached out to like every fake celebrity
I could think of not all of them
responded because there they might
actually be the real celebrity isn't
really cool yep yeah Mike Sean wants to
know Alfred there's a cop here Mike Sean
wants a no but Alfred can you sing um I
can't no that's not that is not in my
wheelhouse
okay moving on to Google assistant Mike
Shaw says I love how Google assistant I
love Google assistant I think it opens a
door to the Star Trek computer could
totally get that actress a voice and
then coming from Michael Brown he says
back in 2016 there was a scene at video
about Google's Google now not being
personal enough or as personal as even
Cortana or a Siri finding that it's kind
of contradictory that we're being
critical of it right now let's remind
you like we there are people here
everybody's got an editorial opinion as
long as it's staged that way if we are
going to ask the three of us in this
room right now I'm nervous about it just
because it's not the fault of the
technology of course it's fascinating
wonderful technology to see it come this
far I'm more afraid of the humans that
are going to abuse it yeah and
addressing Michael Brown yeah Jessica
was looking at this more from like a
personal column perspective just to put
a little bit more meat on what she said
because we didn't get to this in the
podcast itself
she writes I don't need to be friends
with my technology I don't need to be
greeted I don't need to get to greet me
by name wait for it to respond or
pretend to know me and you know that's
that's her own personal opinion from
having written a lot about voice
assistance myself a lot of these
technology companies see it as a doorway
to getting you more comfortable with
using it and using it more often but I
could certainly understand what her
perspective is here but you offered I
mean I have no problem with it trying to
be more personal I actually like it that
way but like I said I I can understand
why some people might be uncomfortable
by that there are some aspects of it
where I I do wish like okay that's
pretty unnecessary like you don't need
to tell me good morning okay I don't I
know that's so basic though really yeah
but I mean maybe that's something that
could be said for people who it's part
of the child's regular ecosystem and
teaching the child general interpersonal
communication pleasantries greetings and
they're doing that they're doing robots
yeah I mean that's that's more specific
like for like an issue for me though
like I said like everyone has their own
personal preference on this I'm gonna
come grow up somebody on the train says
good morning to me like don't I would
anybody on the train one exactly I think
that that comes in grain from living in
New York right so using Amazon's voice
assistant in my house allied one of the
things that kind of bugs me we're
talking about like you know how how it
could have a personality or whatever
I'll ask for something she'll tell me
the answer and then I'll say thanks
because that's just like typical way of
like talking to a person that's what
I've done my whole life you just say
thanks and she doesn't respond ever
because the microwaves off yeah right
the like and and what would be required
from Amazon's perspective is so I keep
the Mike hide here you say thanks and
then just say you're welcome afterward
that's then a privacy issue they
probably don't want to wait into but I
just kind of feel like that makes it
more obvious that I'm talking to a robot
and it would make it a little bit easier
for me if it did say you're welcome
sometimes wanting Amazon to leave like
the microphone on to like so it can hear
you say thanks is kind of like the
person that like after they like say god
bless you after you sneeze they like
wait for you to say things like you're
welcome and technically technically I
could say Alexa thanks and then she'll
probably have a canned answer for that
I don't know that's what that's what it
should do instead of like the gap of
like waiting for you to say thanks so
you're just like passive-aggressive a
just like you're welcome by the way Oh
or or just keep like the light ring
going waiting for me to say something
when you don't I just like oh by the way
you're welcome if if echo and Google
start getting passive-aggressive you're
welcome you're welcome you can have look
that up on your phone it's right in
front of ya because we know where your
phone is
by the way Ryan Williams wants to know
how long until people start falling in
love with their assistants I mean or
what it's worth always end up talking
about my assistant is more helpful than
most of my friends oh yeah
I mean the movie her keeps coming back
with with this type of situation and I
think that's kind of what Jessica was
was pointing out to she's just like look
it's it's a tool it's a utility it's not
my buddy and I just want to get the
information out there so to that extent
if that's the direction we end up going
in I guess it might be easier faster to
get your information but I don't think
that's direction we're going in at all I
think if anything they're gonna do more
stuff like Google duplex where it's just
gonna be more uncanny and you're gonna
talk to it more often from sir enjoy
google's AI mimicking human tones is not
the real issue humans avoiding face to
face and vocal interactions with each
other is terminators of Skynet is a
fainter future but the recess a
reclusive human race aboard the axiom on
wall-e
is well in the present they had to bump
into and revive society and humanity in
that movie who will do that for us I
would make the argument that both of
those things can be issues they're not
each other the world sucks I call the
stepping stone
everybody is bad well I mean I think
that's exactly what Google is trying to
do with its whole digital wellness like
features coming out on Android pee where
you know they want people to interact
more of the world they like want you to
be on your phone unless they're giving
you the option yeah I put a tweet out
with this story like basically writing
like Willy Wonka wants people to eat
less chocolate kind of thing because
it's like really Google it is feel good
and I I definitely appreciate your point
that giving people the additional tools
doesn't necessarily mean they're gonna
use them at all and they've definitely
created these types of devices in the
interest of grabbing your attention I
mean I don't think people are as just
disconnected from each other because of
Technology as like people make it out to
be though I think that like we have more
options now to both disconnect and you
know disconnect like from people I mean
and and also like reach out to people
like because of Technology like I would
be gonna whale s birthday parties if it
weren't for like Facebook or anything
like that or you know people that I like
I probably wouldn't keep in touch with
if I if I didn't like see them on
Twitter or anything like that well
Alfred finding the silver lining what's
going on here sorry I wasn't paying
attention what were we talking about
like that like I plot you on Facebook
because your posts were really annoying
but that's the other point too where
it's like it's much easier for me to
disengage from people like in the sense
like oh like I don't want to talk to you
right now I'm just gonna stare at my
phone the whole time from Shane like
what he was doing so here here's some
nice in the middle responses to this
from Shane Tom it's not quite sure why
it's uncomfortable to talk to a digital
assistant if the end result is the same
does the journey matter from imagine
soggy why is this such an issue this is
finally a real assistant where a
computer can do the mundane task for you
good job Google mm-hmm
the other thing that's interesting from
Google is that having spoken to their
executives when we were at CES they
really view their assistant a little bit
more broadly than Amazon does to a
certain extent Amazon's Alexa is very
much like first a voice assistant Google
thinks of itself
Google assistant as like more of a
digital system yeah whether you're
texting or voice it's one or the other
and I I feel like with texts there's a
lot less noise or a lot less personality
so if you don't really like that maybe
you're more likely to like text with it
if you have an Android phone so that's
that's at least an option for somebody
like Jessica if you just want your
answer and you want to get on
with your day I just find it ironic I
got a text message this weekend which
was a very lovely message and I
appreciate it for the person who may or
may not be watching this but it was
funny to think that they spoke to their
echo and said text Brian so that it
would type a message to send to me and
it said text Brian first it said sent
from an echo which meant they spoke into
the echo Oh built a text message and
sent it to me I've got to try that I
still haven't used that why wouldn't you
call oh okay to avoid like a media I
wasn't aware of that feature I've got to
try that I want to send you a well wish
or information but I want to make sure
that this conversation doesn't go
anywhere yeah pretty much I mean that's
what I do when I text people like I
texted like happy Mother's Day yesterday
but like I didn't want to like continue
the conversation oh my god you didn't
call your mom where's my girlfriend's
mom oh Jesus thank God I called my mom
watch here was like shooting daggers at
you with our eyes being like you didn't
call your mother we don't have to shoot
daggers he's already a dead man I'll say
that I watched the movie valerian this
weekend valerian city of a thousand
planets it sucked but the entire thing
was predicated on the back of them
having a virtual assistant with them at
all times as anyone seen this movie no
it's basalt what's his name the guy did
fifth element right John's the guy who
did fifth element did a city with a of a
thousand play it's essentially it was
bad if like the International Space
Station's spun on a control and planets
from all over the place start
aggregating there and then of course
there's a military I don't want to give
away too much of the plot it's got Dane
Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne and
they're fun it's kind of silly it's
visually interesting but they they're
soldiers right and the entire time they
have this virtual assistant in their
neck like put on their neck that they
carry around it's called Alex go figure
and they're paralyzed when you're out of
reach of Alex like it becomes a
recurring plot point where someone you
can't do anything where it where's
where's valerian the guys name is
valerian where's valerian I don't know I
can't reach him
movies over like it comes to a
screeching halt over and over
yeah yeah it's a it was kind of like
douchey but it's like oh my god were
living that life yes it's it's a little
too close to home I have to say that if
I leave my phone at home which I haven't
done in a long time I feel like I would
probably have the same situation fair
enough
either way don't watch valerian it
really kind of sucks is that the space
Jail movie they're not in jail okay
because there is a space Jail movie that
I thought was really dumb but guardians
a galaxy topic no no no no it was like
they have a jail in outer space and then
like the president's daughters like
taking a tour of it and then there's
like a prison break or something like
that sounds awesome - that's was that
Riddick I hold on like the only pitch
black yeah there another something
called lockout I don't know yeah it was
really bad the star is guy Pierce I do
not know that was a really bad movie I
think this proves that I will watch any
piece of sci-fi trash let's take one
more question from Mike Shaw off-topic
but maybe related once we get 5g our
phones will be in our glasses and
augmented reality will give us info
about places and people around us useful
but maybe creepy and we're already
seeing a little that leaked in with what
Google unveiled with their maps AI at
i/o last week with the directions and
essentially ad placement of businesses
up in front of you if you're looking
they are through Google Maps trying to
figure out where you're going like maybe
you want to stop in for a coffee yeah
but like I'm not it so it's definitely a
good point that Mike is making but I'm
not convinced that all this information
is gonna be on glasses on your face if
all the information is right there on
your phone is it really gonna be that
much harder to pull it out of your
pocket and that way you can have that
information when you need it remove it
from your face when you don't want it to
be there and just I don't know having
seen Google glass and have it be like
such a huge failure i I don't yeah it'll
be something that'll be on on like all
times that doesn't really seem like
really used I mean like you never know
what the future is gonna hold so maybe
we're told
wrong about this and I can't wait to
watch this podcast in 2050 and be like
hahaha
boy was that wrong yeah I can't wait to
watch out on my glasses on my glasses
alright we are just about out of time
and especially since I seem to have
horrifically offended Alex Mitchell
sorry I did not like valerian I thought
it was like Twilight for space nuts okay
that sounds very cool then oh come on
because the movie that was a masterpiece
Alex liked it I was selected because he
was such a prominent figure in the movie
obviously the moon would be out at all
time so werewolves would be out at all
times and then I was like that more like
vampire bad cliche so acting okay so no
they're all wearing spaces anyways it
wasn't perfect it could have been worse
I guess but by alright I guess I'll take
us out 3:59 podcast is available on
iTunes TuneIn stitcher Feedburner and
google play music the Amazon echo and of
course Sienna calm thanks everybody for
