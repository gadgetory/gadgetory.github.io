to be a hit but that could be a problem
here are the top five reasons why the
Nintendo switch could be a dud and
number five it's too late
Sony and Microsoft have carved up the
home console market for themselves with
Sony at the number one spot the
PlayStation Pro should be setting a new
benchmark for home consoles when it
comes out in November
then there's Microsoft's revved up
project Scorpio version of the Xbox one

consoles could out Class A Nintendo
switch and number four portables are
dying so the switch is both a home
console and a handheld yeah here's the
thing about portable gaming that space
is being eaten up by phones and tablets
plus if you shell out money for either a
phone or tablet those devices can do
more than gaming and number three same
old stuff it's a me Mario but how many
times people tend to be a mushroom you
eating plumber make no mistake about it
Nintendo make some fun games but at this
point nostalgia alone can't carry a
console at number two where's the
touchscreen Nintendo switch video showed
a lot of things being done with the
console except for one thing no one
touched the tablet screen the Nintendo
3ds uses a touchscreen the Wii U uses a
touchscreen games built for phones and
tablets often use touchscreens when
asked if the switch would feature a
touchscreen Nintendo said we have
nothing to announce on this topic and
number one battery life this could be a
big deal for the Nintendo switch when it
is a portable device with two wireless
controllers you're looking at three
separate devices that need to have power
at any given time if any one of those
three are dead that takes away from how
good the switch could be this could be a
very real problem but we won't find out
until March go check out top 5 cnet.com

switch could be a success oh my as that
card I'll see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
