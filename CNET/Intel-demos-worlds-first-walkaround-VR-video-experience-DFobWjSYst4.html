next step a walk we want you to be able
to walk around while the video is
actually playing have that experience
like you're really there right the video
if you're that you produce in your eyes
moves with you allows you to travel
through the space that's what would be
cool with video or intel took the first
step towards this type of what we call
value metric video technology with our
acquisition of replay replay
technologies which you saw in the soccer
clip earlier which really allows you to
move within the space within a singular
video concept so as you put your
headsets on you've all seen traditional
360 video in VR where you can look
around and that's interesting and that's
sort of a first step but now we're
actually going to take you literally on
a journey to Vietnam so what I'm going
to ask you to do first is look at the
video around you just like you would
look at a normal 360 video but now sort
of tilt your head from side to side
around that barrel there this is in this
amazing waterfall in this very remote
area in Vietnam and you can see that the
water behind that barrel is like you
would see in real life like it's
actually happening now if you feel
comfortable sort of lean your head in
and over that barrel a little bit like
that yeah just be careful of the wires
that you've got it some of you are
really going for it which is great and
you seal everything is changing just
like it would in the actual real world
that's what's so it's pretty amazing to
watch you guys do this now go ahead and
look everybody to the right and you see
that water buffalo there that was
literally captured live volumetric
volumetrically in Vietnam and as you
move a little bit from side to side feel
free to stand up if you're comfortable
but be careful because you're tethered
and you can see the water Buffalo
Wrangler there behind and if you move a
little bit from side to side you see how
everything changes in the world that's
because every single pixel in this scene
is literally mapped in space which of
course is this massive computer
computing undertaking to actually pull
this off what you're seeing this is
something that's never been seen
certainly at this scale with this many
people we've only seen it in our edge
during labs with our engineers working
on this and it's fantastic to see you
all literally doing this and taking
video to the next level that's really
what's happening here so so this is
truly amazing it's fun to watch the
crowd if we just had a way to spray
water in their faces that I think
they're really big at the the waterfall
you know I got to imagine as you kind of
mentioned there's an incredible amount
of data involved in this experience yeah
the thing as you start to look at this
and notice what's going on this is high
fidelity video capture this isn't CGI
this is not a simulation this is really
actually captured material at a very
high frame rate with very high fidelity
which requires massive amounts of
computing which is why partnering with
Intel is such a smart idea for on both
sides of this equation because every
single frame of this video is three
gigabytes per frame as you look around
it so you can imagine the computing
power that's needed and really Intel the
only one that could help us pull this
off so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
