this smartphone plus tablet hybrid look
familiar to you it should because apart
from some internal changes and an OS
bump it's essentially the same device we
saw this March I'm jessica's all court
for cnet and this is your first look
here's what you get a sleek squared off
unibody smartphone made from aluminium
it has nice high-end specs like a 5-inch
1080p HD screen and a 13-megapixel
rear-facing camera the new model comes
with Android 4.2 jelly bean instead of
Android 4.1 so there's a little bit of
an upgrade their it's also powered by a
2.2 gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800
quad-core processor which is faster than
the previous models plenty fast
Snapdragon 600 ship and here's one more
reason to love this new version more it
tucks away a microSD card slot that can
hold up to 64 gigabytes in external
storage and that's on top of the 50
gigabytes of online storage that is
Sue's hands out with this product now
the phone here is actually the part of
this combo that is Sue's calls padfone
the pad part is technically called the
PadFone station it looks and acts mostly
like a tablet with a nice crisp 10.1
inch screen the difference is that it's
just a screen and the phone is its
battery its processor and its lifeline
as in past models you slide the PadFone
into the dock to turn it on there's a
screen lock button volume controls a
microSD charging port and a 1 megapixel
front-facing camera there are also
speakers as well you can answer calls
with the phone plugged in and take
advantage of LTE from the phone
everything you see on the phone you also
get in the tablet so you don't have to
sync content we haven't heard anything
about pricing or availability yet so sit
tight in the meantime I'm Jessica doll
court inviting you to read all about the
new Padfone and docking station at cnet
