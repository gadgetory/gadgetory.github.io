and substantial metal hardware and you
end up with the one hundred and sixty
nine dollar thermostat II the e is the
opposite of showy yet it's frosted lower
res screen and off-white plastic finish
we're designed with purpose both to
lower the overall cost and to be a more
subtle addition to your home at the same
time the e isn't a Wallflower it's a
truly unique counterpoint to the pricier
and flashy ernesta most at nests e also
supports almost all of the same smart
features from its integrated learning
algorithm to remote access from the app
or a Google or Amazon voice control
speaker the main thing you won't find
here is Farsight which lets you view the
current indoor temperature the weather
forecasts and more straight from the
Nest Learning Thermostat screen but that
brings up an important point if you have
less than stellar eyesight the e might
not be your best option however charming
it's watercolor painting inspired design
is this thermostat has four fewer wire
terminals as well meaning it won't work
with quite as many HVAC systems so make
sure to check compatibility before you
buy while nests II was clearly inspired
by the Learning Thermostat it stands
alone as an attractive yet discreet
device that can easily handle your
home's heating and cooling needs and all
for 80 bucks less</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
