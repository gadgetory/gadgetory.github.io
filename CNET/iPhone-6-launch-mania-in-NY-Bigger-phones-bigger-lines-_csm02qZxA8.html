lines I'm Bridget Carey with the special
edition of C net update in front of New
York City's iconic Fifth Avenue Apple
store around the world doors opened at
Apple stores at 8:00 a.m. the first to
buy it were in Australia we're here in
New York City where the scene has become
a bit crazy 12 hours ago at 8:00 p.m.
there were 900 people in line now
hundreds and hundreds more it's hard to
count they're squished in some probably
left from discouragement it's hard to
tell the line wraps around several
blocks and goes past 60th Street you're
waiting to Sun will talk in between 60
and 60 first and there is no systematic
rhyme because everybody just decided to
rush through it just run through I have
no idea why everyone just kept running
and running so literally like I don't
know what the hell I'm gonna do because
I've been in line for three hours and
now basically I'm out of line and all
those people are about on line two and
what are they gonna do make them realign
again I mean this is like I'm so freakin
mad right now I know if you can curse on
CNN you might be asking yourself why do
so many people come out when you can
order it online well it's a media circus
you have so many cameras all trying to
capture this moment the first people in
line
they're here for attention from the
media they're here to make money
my cousin been doing this for the past
five years now so we pretty much do it
for the experience but lately we've been
getting sponsored by these companies so
it's like a benefit now we're getting
free iPhones free food while we're here
ultimately we know that these lines for
the iPhones get tremendous amounts of
press and so what we wanted to do is use
it as a press platform for our
charitable medical app video medicine so
that's ultimately why we're willing to
be out here in the freezing cold really
most people in line are actually here to
make some money off of it to resell the
phone to places that aren't getting the
iPhone yet you see there's a little
document in international underground
market for reselling I
phones how much can you get 1500 where
are you selling it ya know a country do
you know anyone in Russia who will buy
your iPhone yeah everybody it's good
money though I know some people would
make at least $30 phone the first person
to walk out the door with a new iPhone
in hand didn't have to wait there for
three weeks
he ordered online for in-store pickup
every year the iPhone launch is quite
the experience in New York and this is
just a taste of what it was like for
seeing that I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
