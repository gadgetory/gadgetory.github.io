frankfurt international auto show we've
seen two high-end convertible sports
cars unveiled and i'm standing in front
of my favorite it's the ferrari 488
spider a convertible version of last
year's 48 gtb it's a hardtop convertible
the top drops in just 14 seconds it's
still got the same twin-turbo v8 putting
out 660 horsepower price is going to be
around two hundred seventy five thousand
dollars when it comes to the US next May
so you better get your order in now the
Ferrari is my favorite but Antoine over
at Lamborghini has a pic that he thinks
is even better now on the other side of
the frankfurt auto show were in the
Lamborghini booth taking a look at a
completely different blue supercar
roadster this is the Lamborghini Huracan
LP 610 for spider and I'm not going to
sit here and try to argue that it's a
faster car than Ferrari because well I
can't but supercars are about as much
style as they are performance and style
is something this cars got in spades I
mean just look at it with its angular
design and sharp edges it looks like
it's going to transform into a robot at
any minute it's also a lot cooler the
Ferraris got that turbo v8 but this
thing's got a v10 and all-wheel-drive
it's just plain cooler and while I'm
nitpicking Heric on is just a better
name than 488 I mean when somebody asks
you what kind of car you driving you
pull up in this thing you just say I
Drive a hurricane that's awesome so how
many horsepower on that Lamborghini and
talk about 609 610 so you got me beat
here yeah and I thinking pretty much
every other performance category too
right yeah hands down the Ferrari is the
passenger car no matter how you look at
it but the very different-looking base
yeah the the Lamborghinis got to be very
angular very aggressive for a brutal
look and this is more of a beautiful
curbing all comes down to which one you
prefer right Ferrari went with the
understated look they did a lot of
active aerodynamics under the car to
make it have downforce without big wings
Lamborghini always goes for the excess
and I think we can appreciate that can't
wait yeah I think often in its own way
and it's also spelled with a wine the
Lamborghini vs. spider spittle and I
bonus points for Lamborghini there after
lead on this point but if you had to
pick a winner if I had to pick a winner
I'm gonna go on performing and I'm gonna
have to give the edge to the Ferrari yep
ferrari 488 spider the winner
