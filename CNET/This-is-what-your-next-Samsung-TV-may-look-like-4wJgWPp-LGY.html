because two of these are not paintings
at all in fact there are TVs Samsung is
giving us a glimpse of what the future
holds in terms of TV trends these two
are their lifestyle TVs and they're made
to look exactly like paintings and go up
flush against the wall
what's cool about them other than their
slim design and their framing is that
they're in standby mode right now
they're made to display photos and
paintings Waller in standby mode so they
can integrate into your lifestyle in
your living room instead of having to
build your living room around that
massive TVs and in terms of the
technology inside the TVs it's looking
like 8k is here to stay now we saw 8k
here at the Samsung booth last year but
now we're actually seeing more of it
we're talking about 76 80 by 40 320
pixels in each of these screens now
obviously you need a much bigger screen
to really appreciate this kind of
resolution in fact even when I get up
close to this model
I still can't distinguish any of the
pixels and we're still a few years out
for seeing these out on the market in
fact we don't even have a lot of 4k
content yet but it's fun to see what's
to come
so that's what you can expect to see in
a few years for TV trends but what you
can see this year in the market are some
pretty amazing displays from Samsung
including some LED displays and HDR so
check out more on that at cnet.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
