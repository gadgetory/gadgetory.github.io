you post online is truly private I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your CNET
update we are living in a time where
anything you do on Facebook can be
shared with law enforcement and you
won't even know when your digital life
is being searched a recent statement by
Facebook is shining a light on how
government agencies can make broad
requests for user data and there's
little Facebook can do to fight those
requests it's no secret that law
enforcement agencies will collect user
data from tech companies with a court
order or a subpoena but Facebook fought
back against one request last year from
a New York Court it required the network
to hand over all the data of 381 people
that included their messages photos
everything now facebook saw this request
as unconstitutional for being so broad
arguing that it went against the Fourth
Amendment as an unreasonable search and
seizure the court said Facebook had no
legal standing to fight back and
Facebook eventually handed everything
over now facebook couldn't notify the
affected users or speak of this because
of a gag order that is until now
out of those 381 accounts only 62 people
were charged with disability fraud in
this case people who are collecting
disability benefits were posting photos
on Facebook of them doing various
activities that went against their
disability claims but here we have a
situation where more than 300 Facebook
accounts were not involved in fraud and
yet all their information was handed
over to law enforcement it raises some
concerns over data privacy and how the
rights differ from the physical world
for example why are there different
standards regarding searching email and
searching postal mail but laws over
digital data are slowly evolving this
week the Supreme Court ruled that a
warrant is required to search a cell
phone or any mobile device the court
opinion stated that just because it's
easy for a phone to store personal
information in your pocket doesn't make
it any less worthy of Fourth Amendment
protections now for those of you not so
worried about storing your personal data
on the internet you'll find this next
story to be good news
Microsoft is offering more free online
storage with onedrive it boosted the
free amount to 15 gigs which is what
Google Drive also offers for free before
Microsoft only gave away 7 gigs now
there's growing competition in the world
of online cloud storage Microsoft also
hopes to learn more paying customers by
dropping prices on additional storage so
a hundred gigs on onedrive now costs two
dollars a month before it was 750 that's
