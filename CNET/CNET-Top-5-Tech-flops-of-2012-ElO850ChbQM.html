who are driven by passionate ideas of
new products and services that can
change the world but even the smartest
guy in the room can fall flat on their
face in this episode of top 5 we're
collecting 2012's greatest misses in
tech the big duds from the biggest names
in the industry starting off at number 5
airtime Sean Parker's video chat startup
launch with the confidence and swagger
befitting a young internet billionaire
unfortunately the demo was a disaster
the mics cut out the internet died and
the thing just didn't work half the time
it should have been a slam dunk demo of
a future Facebook acquisition instead of
had me cringing more than a Dom DeLuise
movie at number four blackberry 10 all
year we've been waiting for rim to
strike back with their new BlackBerry 10
OS and a killer phone that would put
them back in the game text me to even
settle for a good enough phone as long
as they got it out ahead of the holidays
but no BlackBerry 10 has now been pushed
back to 2013 and I'm taking bets on
whether I'll even get out before rim
self-destructs at number three the
Google Nexus Q remember Google's $300
Darth Vader soft ball streaming music
thing
remember how it only worked with the
version of Android that no one really
had yet I think they just threw this out
there to make the Google TV look like a
hit thought a month after it was
announced Google quietly pulled the plug
on the Nexus Q at number two Facebook's
IPO oh here's a company that was valued
for more money than a small nation but
the honeymoon ended pretty quick turns
out that popularity and profitability
aren't the same thing
finally at number 1 Apple maps whoa
losing money on Facebook stock really
hurt but it was nowhere near the pain
felt by the deafening cry of millions of
iPhone owners screaming out in pain as
Apple replaced the Google Maps app with
their own special take on navigation it
was so bad that even Apple Apple
apologized and admitted that it wasn't
so great
needless to say
heads rolled on this one so there you go
those are my favourite flops from 2012
