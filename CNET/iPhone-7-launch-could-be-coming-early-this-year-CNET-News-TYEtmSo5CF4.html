iPhone earlier than expected according
to a recent tweet by leaker and
venturebeat reporter Evan blast the
iphone 7 will arrive the week of
September 12 specifically that friday if
his claim holds true this may mean Apple
is hosting its launch event as early as
the last week of August in previous
years the new iPhones have been
available for pre-order on the Friday
after the keynote and in stores roughly
two weeks after that that could mean
August 30th or 31st for this calendar
year the earlier release may give the
Cupertino company more time to boost
sales for the company's fiscal fourth
quarter which runs from july through
September and they may really need that
extra boost this year if the rumors are
true the iphone will not have a major
makeover like in previous years
according to reports the iphone 7 will
look very similar to the success but
with a larger camera and no headphone
jack but Apple may still have a few
surprises up its sleeve for the next
event there's talk that it may be
launching another product like the Apple
watch to maybe in the same event so
we'll have to wait and see and until
Apple hands out their formal invitation
even the date is still up for
interpretation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
