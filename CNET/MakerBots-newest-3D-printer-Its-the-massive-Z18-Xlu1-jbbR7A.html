something big like a crazy space helmet
you know you can't complain anymore this
is the MakerBot replicator z18 you can
make things that are 12 inches by 12
inches by 18 inches tall in this machine
so 2592 cubic inches in our
manufacturing facility we're going to
use this to make jigs and fixtures to
make make robots if you have a
manufacturing facility go crazy get a
lot of these game on if you have ideas
and these machines just aren't big
enough for you well you can make small
components and stack them up and put
them together the MakerBot replicator
z18 is just like wow it's big not only
can you make big things that you could
you've got with 12 by 12 inches on the
platform you can make a lot of things at
one time so instead of doing one off so
you can make nine 10 a lot of things all
at once it's a really big platform and
it's solid this is industrial-strength
3d printing this has been our dream for
a long time and now we get to show you
so just like the MakerBot replicator
you've got a 100 micron layer resolution
it's optimized for MakerBot PLA filament
this should sound familiar
you've got the 3.5 inch full color LCD
display looks luscious easy to browse
all your things on the machine it's
ultra connected so whether or not you
want to use your USB stick or connected
by a USB cable or Ethernet cable or
connect to it over Wi-Fi we've got you
covered it's got this same great camera
to make it easy to share your designs
and monitor your 3d prints just like the
other machines app and cloud enabled
it's got the same great MakerBot
replicator smart extruder again this is
snap-on and if you run out of film and
it'll it'll send you a message and tell
you to come feed it and this is
something special about this machine for
dimensional stability of big objects it
really helps to have an enclosed build
and so there's actually heater in here
and it takes a little bit longer to heat
up than the other machines but it means
that your giant objects will remain
dimensionally stable and solid so for
the technical in the audience this is a
big win shipping spring 2014 so stay
tuned you're going to have to wait to
purchase this but it's coming in spring
and we can't wait to put these in your
hands
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
