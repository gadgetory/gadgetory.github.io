where we've been testing out Sakura
Phi's almond 3 smart router specifically
how it can help corral your smart home
gadgets so this is it right here we've
got it plugged in back in our server
room and aside from letting us on the
Internet
it can also keep track of all the other
devices that are connected and that
includes smart home devices it also has
a built in rules engine so that you can
automate when they come on and come off
based on your location based on the time
of day even based on your Wi-Fi presence
so I've got my phone here and you can
see the Wi-Fi is off when I turn the
Wi-Fi on and my phone joins up with the
Allman Network you can see this lamp
just turns on automatically to text me
on the network and says hey it's time to
turn the lamp on almond also offers its
own proprietary hardware so you've got
motion sensors and smart switches and
these contact sensors you can stick
these on a door and they can detect
using magnets when things are open and
closed so you see when I close them like
this the lamp turns off when I open them
like that lamp comes back on so you can
set that to turn things on just when you
open and close the door now in my tests
all of that worked well the rules engine
the Wi-Fi detection the extra hardware
that you can get it was all very nice
and snappy and responsive and easy to
use it was just a shame that when we
tried to expand the Wi-Fi setup with
multiple routers in the home things kind
of fell apart it got glitchy and
unreliable be sure to check out our full
review of the allman 3 smart router for
more on its network reliability and
overall feature set here in the smart
apartment as a smart home controller
it's a pretty interesting device
