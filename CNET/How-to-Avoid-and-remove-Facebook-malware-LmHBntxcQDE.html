cnet.com and I'm here because we need to
have a serious talk about Facebook
criminals are getting really good at
tricking you into clicking links to fake
apps like ones that promise to show you
exactly who is viewing your profile
which will never happen by the way and
then what happens is you click that link
and depending on what kind of scam it is
you can get a computer virus or spyware
your passwords can get stolen
hackers can extort money from you or you
can turn into one of the annoying
friends who unknowingly post spam on
other people's walls don't be that
person usually people get Facebook
malware because they fell for a spammy
wall post message or group I always know
it's spam when I get sent a weird link
from someone who I never talk to so if
you're the least bit suspicious about a
link don't click it hover over that post
with your mouse and click the X in that
menu click report as spam and Facebook
will take it from there
you can also do this if someone post
spam as their status sometimes it will
look like a normal status that says
something like did you hear Facebook is
finally getting a dislike button and
then there will be a little link at the
end of it again don't click it
especially if it sounds too good to be
true
a lot of spammers will post shortened
links using services like bitly so that
you can't see the URL until you click it
so if you ever see a shortened URL go to
expand my url com paste it there and
you'll get a safe preview of the link
and then if you find out that it is spam
hover over the post click the X and mark
it as spam another way you can get in
trouble is if you install a malicious
app sometimes you don't find out until
it's too late and the app has used your
account to spam other people or add
weird things to your profile if you
think you've installed a bad app head to
Facebook and go to account then privacy
settings then go over to apps and
websites and click edit your settings
and then hit edit settings again next
apps you use now you're finally at the
page where you can delete apps just
click the X next to any app you want to
delete and while you're here delete apps
you don't use because they probably have
permission to access your personal
information now if it's too late and
your account has already been hacked or
you think you might have malware there
are a few things you can do first change
your password right away you can do this
by going to account then account
settings just hit change to change your
password make sure it's different than
all your other passwords because if a
hacker steals your Facebook password and
it works for your email account he can
use it to get into that to go to
password meter comm to see if the
passwords you're choosing or
strong-enough a good password will have
uppercase and lowercase letters at least
one number and a special character like
a question mark while you're in the
account settings go down to account
security and hit change enable secure
browsing so that third parties can't
hijack your Facebook session also get
notified if someone logs into your
account from a location that Facebook
doesn't recognize because someone could
be logging into your account without you
knowing changing your password only
fixes one type of hack other kinds will
install malware like spyware or viruses
on your computer whether or not you
think you have malware you need to make
sure you have an anti-virus program AVG
is free and highly recommended by CNET
also make sure you're updating your
operating system Microsoft and Apple
released security updates that fix
vulnerabilities in your software for
Windows go to start then head to
programs and Windows Update on a Mac go
to the Apple menu and select software
update now that your software is
up-to-date you've removed bad apps and
fixed your Facebook settings you're
already a lot safer do everybody a favor
and ask your friends to do the same
thing I seriously don't want to see
another spammy update on my wall thank
you and I'm glad we had this talk
for CNET I'm Sharon Vaknin and I'll see
you on the interwebs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
