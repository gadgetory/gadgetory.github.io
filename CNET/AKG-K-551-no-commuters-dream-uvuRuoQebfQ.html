the AKG K 551 headphones there are two
schools of thought when it comes to
buying headphones for use in public you
can either be discreet and blend in or
you can go all out and buy the biggest
headphones you can find the AKG K 551
fit firmly in the latter category these
headphones are based on the in-home k550
models but include a not very discreet
bright blue cable and a three button
remote as you'd expect for a three
hundred and thirty dollar pair of
headphones these are very well built
with swiveling cups for better transport
and comfortable leather its ear pads
these are closed headphones and so
offers some degree of noise isolation
though you may need to adjust them to
get a good seal despite being closed
these EKGs are designed to sound open
that is they designed to sound airy with
a wide soundstage this they do very well
and music doesn't have that inside your
head feel detail is very good with a
slightly exaggerated though not sibling
upper register the issue is that while
there is deep bass it is a little
drowned out by the treble and on a
rumbly subway car you won't hear any
bass at all as a result these headphones
are more suited to light music like jazz
classical or acoustic but I'd still say
get the k5 50s instead and save a bit of
money if you're looking for a pair of
headphones with a bit more discretion
and are actually suited to use on public
transport
I'd suggest you look at the Sennheiser
Momentum's or the BMW P fives
