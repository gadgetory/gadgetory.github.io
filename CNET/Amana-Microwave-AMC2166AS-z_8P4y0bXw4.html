here with the Amana AMC two one six six
AAS and this is a countertop microwave
that retails for two hundred and
nineteen dollars
it's got 1200 watts so it's pretty
powerful it'll cook a little faster and
a little more evenly than microwaves
with lower wattages it's also pretty big
if you look at it here in the table
beside me it's taking up quite a lot of
room it is a roomy beast of a microwave
it has 1.6 cubic feet inside of it and a
13 inch turntable plenty of room plenty
of space for whatever you want to stuff
inside of it now looking over the Amana
it's got a pretty basic design and
doesn't look like a modern microwave if
you ask me it's got the stainless steel
which is a nice touch but a lot of
microwaves have that right now it's a
very popular option but it's boxy you
know it's big and boring looking it's
got the green clock here that just
doesn't look like something out of 2013
so I prefer something with a few more
modern touches to make it look like a
$219 microwave in addition to the basic
design it's also a microwave with some
pretty basic features you're not gonna
find convection cooking or inverter
technology it's just kind of a standard
microwave it does the same thing as a
cheap $80 microwave would do albeit a
little bit better and with a little bit
more room inside if you take a look at
the buttons on the front it's got your
standard presets that you'd expect from
a microwave it has popcorn and potatoes
and pizza and frozen entrees and all of
those work pretty well
as a basic microwave but again for $219
you wish you had something more
something different so this is a weird
mix of high-end and basic it's got a
high end price but it's sort of basic in
terms of features that said it does
perform pretty well we thought the
popcorn preset in particular was great
you put a bag of popcorn in this thing
and hit the preset button it'll pop it
in 90 seconds flat to perfection we
tested this again and again with the
standard sized bag of popcorn and every
time it left less kernels unpopped it
didn't burn or scorch any of them and it
did it really fast did it faster than
other microwaves that we tested so all
in all a great preset if you love movie
night or popcorn in general this is the
microwave for you the other presets were
- but they have a few flaws the potato
preset for instance only cooks by potato
you can
took one potato you can pick two
potatoes but you can't cook by ounces so
if you have a big potato it might under
cook if you have a small potato it might
overcook keep in mind this is a high
wattage microwave and it's gonna cook
things just a little bit faster than you
would expect and some of the presets
don't seem to know this the frozen
entree preset for instance cook things
at the full length of time and that
leads to a slightly overcooked frozen
entree but their lasagna that we tried
this cheese was just a little bit
disintegrated and too well done and we
didn't like that oh this is a good
machine and it's certainly better than
the $40 Craigslist microwave that I have
in my kitchen but I wouldn't pay 219
dollars for it if you're looking to
upgrade and looking to spend that kind
of money I think you can do a lot better
for seeing it I'm right Chris
