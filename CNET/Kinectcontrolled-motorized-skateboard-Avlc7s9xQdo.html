i'm here with worley from chaotic moon
studios who is here with okay I'm just
gonna say it the coolest device I have
seen so far as esq can you tell us what
is about to be the death of me here well
sure what we're going to do is we're
going to put you on chaotic moon labs
board of awesomeness it's a electronic
skateboard it's at 36 volt motor it's
800 watt system it goes 32 miles an hour
top speed and it's all controlled with a
samsung windows 8 tablet using Microsoft
Kinect so you're going to use your
gestures we're gonna have you do today
is use a gesture like a throttle and
we're gonna have you drive right across
this little section of the showroom
floor and that's the part where I got
all right so what you're not gonna die
so but what I don't wanna die I'm a very
good skateboarder or at least I was 15
years ago what is the what's the what's
this product for what are you hoping to
come so we're with chaotic moon labs
which is a division of Catalan studios
and what we do is we do three types of
computing predictive pervasive and
perceptive and we do a why in a while so
this is our why project for some
technology we've been developing its
everybody's attention has them go like
why would you build that that's weird
and then in a few weeks we'll release
the WoW product which is where everybody
will be like oh that's why you build
that and you're clearly not gonna tell
us what the while product is not on
camera but after i'll be happy to tell
you alright so we'll keep an eye out for
that in the meantime we're gonna try
this out although you said you do have
plans to sort of open we're gonna open
sort we're gonna all up everything there
is no connect hacking involved
everything using the standard sdk
everything's just stock so we are going
to open source the software in the plan
so that anybody wants to build their own
can build their own and then they can
die I'm kidding they're not gonna die
this is gonna be alright let's give it a
try because let's do it let's go this
little plate here the dead womanÂ´s
which is the connector that's going to
power up the board the white box that
you can see on the screen there that's
actually the kinect sensor so if you've
played kinect before you can see your
hand goes into that space and that means
you're about to make it happen all right
you ready she'll give it a try
haven't helped me more okay so I'm
putting my hand here I put I here okay
