be on an SNES mini there are reports
that say Nintendo is working on a new
retro console based on the SNES similar
to the Nintendo classic so we asked you
which game you would want on such a
device here's what you had to say what
7% of the vote number 5 is Super Mario
Kart I'm kind of surprised it was so low
on this list it's one of my favorite
games on pretty much every Nintendo
system except the Wii U version without
a proper battle mode anyway the SNES
version is the original and deserves a
home on a potential SNES retro console
at number four it's at ty getting nine
percent of the vote each it's Super
Mario World and Final Fantasy three
Super Mario World bronze Yoshi Final
Fantasy three is just one of the most
fun RPGs ever made either way you want
both getting 10% of the vote is contra 3
the alien wars I used to play the
original contra for NES all the time
contra 3 up the ante with better
graphics and the ability to switch
between two weapons which was awesome at
number two is Legend of Zelda a link to
the past it picked up 16% of the vote a
Link to the Past put the emphasis back
on role-playing like the original it
also introduced items and mechanics that
are still used today the game is huge
and lets you explore tons of places and
the number one game you want on a retro
SNES is Donkey Kong Country the game is
flat-out amazing it's still fun to play
and it looks great even by today's
standards the model of Donkey Kong was
redone for this game and it's still the
model that's used to this day if you
want your voice heard in these polls I
always post links on Twitter I'm at
Aya's thanks for all your feedback and
I'll see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
