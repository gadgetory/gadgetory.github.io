company's best effort yet it's lighter
than the virtual reality headsets that
have come before it works with more
phones and it just 99 bucks it's a great
deal
provided of course that you're set on
being a virtual reality pioneer and
already owned or at least are willing to
buy a new Samsung phone the new gear VR
is compatible with four phones the
Samsung Galaxy s6 the s6 edge the note 5
and the s6 edge+
searching between them is easy there's a
switch on the corner here bigger phones
fit the tab a and you need to slide it
over the tab B to fit the smaller
Samsung devices the phone's pop in and
out really easily and the Occulus door
app is smart enough to start itself up
whenever you plug it into the headset
even if your phone is locked previous
versions the gear VR headset only work
with a single phone so this is a much
nicer option but I make it easier to
share VR with your Samsung owning
friends the headset is smaller and
lighter than the older gear VR innovator
Edition which is important for something
that's going to spend a lot of time
hanging out on your face it's
comfortable to the straps on the side
are easy to adjust but the strap up top
that goes over your head is optional I
like the secure snag fit but if you
don't want it up there messing up your
hair just get rid of it the padding
around the goggles is soft and feels
good after a long session but I do worry
about getting sweaty especially if
you're planning on sharing this with
your buddies there's a touch pad on the
right side and Samson is added grooves
and a little nub on the center so it's
easy to find the controls you need while
you're fussing around in the dark
there's also a back button just above
the touch pad that'll help you get
through menus while you're playing games
or watching movies I don't wear glasses
but the gear VR should be large enough
to accommodate your specs there's also a
focus reel if you or your friends need
to fine-tune the experience now the
focus here is still gaming but video is
becoming more interesting the oculus
store has grown steadily and they're now
over a hundred games in app to sifu
they'll swim the Sharks blast robots in
space or wander mysterious world solving
puzzles but you're still gonna have to
take my word for it this is a very
personal experience tough to describe
and impossible to really show you'll
soon be able to try for yourself in
places like Best Buy and you really need
to go hands-on to see if virtual reality
is right for you
virtual reality is still young and it's
still not for everyone
look I'm not gonna tell you to run out
and grab a Samsung phone just so you can
check this out but if you already own a
compatible phone or pretty much set on
getting one then 99 bucks is a great
price to pay for a taste of what could
be the future of gaming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
