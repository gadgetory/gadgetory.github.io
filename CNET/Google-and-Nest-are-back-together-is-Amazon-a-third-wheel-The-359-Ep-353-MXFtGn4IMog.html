353 of the 359 podcast on BVG and your
host today our alfred Inge and Joanie
Saltzman good morning everybody
what up we have a stack show that's not
about the Super Mario Brothers Super
Show as it would have been given about
30 seconds ago if you'd been in the room
with us because we can't stop talking
about it
well toad is definitely a mushroom toad
is not a mushroom toad is a pure throat
as a citizen of the Mushroom Kingdom
it doesn't make him a sentencer true but
like it's clearly not a hat
anyways real headlines today all right
yeah we've got some big stories today
one talking about our scoop from
yesterday on nest rejoining Google and
essentially what that's gonna mean for
Amazon coming up and Joan had taken a
look at Comcast you know new channels
for the Winter Olympics which they're
saying is gonna make it much easier for
you to watch you know curling or that's
the only Winter Olympics yeah so yeah
yeah we got a big show today anyways
everybody hang out we're gonna come back
and take questions and comments from you
about today's subjects as well as pretty
much anything else you feel like
throwing in after we record the
allegedly 3 min and 59 second long audio
podcast so hang out we'll see in the
chat in a 3 minutes of 59 seconds from 3
2 1 welcome to the 359 I'm Alfred Inge
I'm Joanie Salzmann and there's Roger
Cheng behind you
yesterday's seen at first reported a big
scoop that Google and nest the smart
home company known for their thermostats
were getting back together so ness used
to be a part of Google and then split
into its own company when Google became
alphabet but you know Google's been
trying to get into the smart home game
to with its home assistant an array of
smart home speakers it makes a lot of
sense for these two companies to get
back together but it kind of puts Amazon
in this awkward position so you know if
you haven't been keeping up Google and
Amazon are rivals with each other over
their smart speakers Amazon which isn't
really a mystery you know Amazon's Alexa
dominates more than 60% of the market
while Google's struggling to find its
place our Amazon reporter Ben Fox
took a look at what that means for their
weird relationship you know he basically
laid out the worst case scenario would
be that you know Amazon no longer sells
nest products while Google makes sure
that nest products don't work if Amazon
speaker Alexa anymore I mean do you see
that actually happening though between
the two you know you would think that
that's something that would be and it so
works against consumers you think that
could never happen but the fact is it
has you know not too long ago it was
just over I think the holiday season
leading up to the holiday season that
Google is like we're sick of Amazon not
selling chromecast because they're
threatened by us we're just gonna take
Amazon's video off of our streaming
media product yeah and then they also
had taken YouTube off of Amazon right
like streaming products ooh it's weird
it's every time this gets brought up you
know I always have to bring up the fact
that you know when these two giants like
go to battle with each other it's kind
of like us that losses that they're
using consumers as a pawn in their own
battles which you know isn't fair to
consumers yes definitely not consumer
friendly and the thing is is that like
these kind of tactics have worked for
that ma'am asan did put out a statement
around January I believe or so saying
that yes we're gonna start selling
chromecast again right which actually I
haven't seen yet I have not seen
chromecast but I haven't checked in yet
see it'll be interesting especially
because the Smart Home space and you
know the voice of system space is so
competitive between them right now it'll
be interesting to see how they compete
against each other so been noted in this
article that they kind of can't do this
like scorched earth approach to each
other and they kind of have to be like
frenemies in the sense of like they rely
on each other you know Google does sell
other products like a ton of Chromebooks
and their pixel phone on Amazon
meanwhile Amazon does rely on Google a
lot to get on search results when people
like look for product so kind of like we
hate you but we also need you kind of
yeah usually they operate as frenemies
but sometimes they just become enemies
yeah so next up Jonah you had the
opportunity to check out Comcast a new
set of virtual channels for the Olympics
right yeah so the Olympics is uh it
kicks off today there's gonna be 2400
hours of coverage so much that if you
wanted to watch it all it would take you
three months assuming you never slept so
how do you figure out how to watch all
of it and win what Comcast is doing is
they're testing out this new feature
virtual channels it strings together
video kind of like
playlist focused on one subject like
maybe gold medal moments or biggest
upsets or it can be dedicated to a
specific sport
so what Comcast does is they use the
Olympics when they have all this
coverage to test out new features so if
you're a Comcast subscriber you might
see something like this rolling out
other kinds of programming to yeah that
makes a lot more sense than what it
actually is because every Olympics that
I ever watched like oh that's on it this
time I had no idea or right when I put
on like the channel that it's on it's
like why's archery on I don't care about
I don't care about this or like shooting
like that's weird I want to watch like
the USA but do you think given that they
have all these kind of advanced features
is that enough for you to want to sign
up for assuming you didn't live in New
York where we don't get Comcast what you
sign up for Comcast for no I don't pay
for cable ever I also don't care about
the Winter Olympics
it's Summer Olympics all the way right
right
yeah so if you like these stories or
more check us out on SEANET I'm Alfred
hang I'm Joni sauceman thanks for
watching so let me just say is a very
very poor sports fan American citizen
world citizen I totally forgot to do a
live picture starting today but let me
just say this is an awesome idea and I
never thought I'd use these words
Comcast had an awesome idea that's the
funny thing is people hate Comcast I
mean and that's not like surveys show
cable companies is fantastic yeah they
are those is the worst company at least
like poorly most poorly rated companies
on in America otherwise because of their
serve no but this is the thing people
who have x1 their high tech cable
service they may hate Comcast but they
love excellent because it really is
whenever I get to MS from them like oh
my god this is amazing but it also does
cost a lot of money and you have to be
in an area where Comcast yeah and yeah I
know I don't care about the way I think
it's a good idea and it's a good
approach to TV I feel like they you know
other networks should be doing something
like that yeah in the sense of like if I
only wanted to watch like cartoons from
before 2005 like there should be like a
playlist yes so it starts with the
Olympics Comcast likes to use the
Olympics where they have like it's just
like a salt of different kinds of video
to play around with their technology and
figure out what they can do with it with
the idea that they could the guy that I
talk to you there Matt Strauss who's in
charge of the Xfinity services
he says they could potentially have an
infinite number of channels ones that
also work not only with editors curators
but with algorithms that can cater to
people like to your own that would be
really cool Adi I think of like the YES
Network which I think is only available
in New York because it they only play
Yankees and Knicks games yeah and when
there's not a game going on they'll play
like classic games from them which is
really sad because like they just keep
rerunning the same 90s like Nick stuff
but yeah I mean III think like you know
curated channels would be really cool in
the sense you know you don't have to get
like a whole new network for that it
because there's that one lining your
story where it says like you know TV
channels are basically just playlists
yeah and yeah it'd be cool if somebody
could you if you could arrange that
yourself I feel like that would be even
like cooler you know yeah I think the
idea that comcast is going for is kind
of like the Netflix mentality where you
could do it yourself you could be a
Spotify like user and make your own
playlists but if you know Spotify has
discover weekly they make it easy for
you that's kind of the idea making it
easy so you don't have to do the work of
finding the playlist that you love
mm-hmm you have any questions what we do
have one I'm not sure if this is really
something we can talk about but Scott
Maya this guy thank you Scott for being
in our chat because you constantly fish
out really really great stories to cover
for us sometimes very sensitive stuff
too
I tell you I've seen as ever hiring we
might want to recommend this guy
top-secret Apple source code for iOS
leaked and posted to github this morning
opening a new dangerous avenue for
hackers what are your thoughts do we
want to go down the sucess here about I
boot I've been following this this
morning we haven't done a story on it
yet but our sister publication ZDNet has
like pretty much everything that you
need to know about it so this is
originally from a report from
motherboard from the folks over at vice
so the iboot source code it was from iOS
9 and it leaked on github ores like
everything is kind of pretty much on
there and you know a part of it like
when you you can dig through the source
code and like CI the iOS is like boot
chain like the process of like what
happens when an iOS device is switched
on this is really valuable for
a lot of like hackers only because iOS
like source code is extremely rare like
it's really hard to tell like how to
crack like basically iPhones are really
secure and most iOS devices are really
secure because they keep their source
code so secretive and with this you know
hackers are able to look at the source
code and basically like dig through to
find what where the vulnerabilities are
I mean the good news is that you know
this is the source code for iOS 9 and
we're on like iOS 11 now but the idea is
you know just because you're on a
different iOS version doesn't mean that
it completely changes it you know they
probably use some of the like stuff from
the old source code into it like it's
not an entirely new thing so that's like
the biggest concern of it currently that
and you know it's it can definitely be
used to compromise a lot of iOS devices
currently you know with more research
I'm glad you had more details on that
yes that one sword right over my head
yeah I was following it this morning but
I'm trying to figure out like it what
ways to do a story on it other than you
know the news that had already broken
let's talk a little bit more about
television entertainment before we swing
back around and get back on the nest
Google can we call it the buckles it's
going back into another one and they
haven't done anything yet I sincerely
don't think they'll go like full like
worst case scenario like what Ben had
written about but and the benefits that
are there that are possible are that yes
if nest and Google aren't operating as
these separate entities if there's
closer collaboration between them it
could make nest have a better product
yeah have more AI chops - yeah they are
they're planning so right now because
like they're just joining together is
still gonna be like working a little bit
like separately throughout 2018 but they
do have like their roadmap like for like
the next two years now on how they're
gonna work together and like collaborate
with their products yeah but I mean like
you said earlier they all these let's
let's go ahead and call what it is
pissing matches it's the consumer that
pays for it in the long run we get
caught in the Riptide we had caught in
the crossfire from what you mentioned
with
Google's and an Amazon and now nest and
everything when is this going to
actually I'm getting way too heavy on
this very when are when are they gonna
stop being I'm dick bags only stop fiend
dick bags well that's so I don't know if
we can even answer if not in this in
this case because nothing's really
happened yet wasn't what I think I think
you have to get to a point where like
one is like clearly the dominant like
winner here in the sense of you know
it's like we're not even gonna try to
compete with you anymore and we're just
gonna like integrate our products and
with you it's kind of like but there are
some Isis out there that are just are
that there are no brainers where these
things should be cooperating yeah yes it
they're their license to print money I
think the idea is though is that like I
think every company right now it's gonna
be very competitive in the like smart
speaker space only because they know
that that's the gateway drug into like
smart homes and they know that like I
think I think about viral infections at
home yeah I think I think a lot of
people understand I'll I should by 2012
analysts have written by by 2020 like
we're gonna spend like something to the
tune of like 1.1 trillion dollars on
like IOT devices and the thing is like
you know I think companies like Google
Apple and Amazon are looking at that and
thinking that's a lot of money and we
should like be able to get like be the
ones in control of that it's the same
way and you know when Apple like Apple
is pretty much like got like a strong
control of like the smartphone market
and I think that's kind of the cash grab
or like you know attention people are
paying to like smart speakers right now
yeah so yeah I can understand why
they're being really aggressive about it
I think at one point one one of them is
going to emerge as like the dominant
like company and all the other companies
like yeah will will like make sure our
stuff work that works with yours but
they're so but also it goes it should be
said that generally more competition is
better for consumers it's only when we
have these sort of duopoly x' or
monopolies where one company or two
companies are really duking it out to
each other they have the power to be
able to put consumers in the middle
mm-hm usually you have to be putting the
consumer first to actually get consumers
to like you well I'll let you know if I
can't come in to work tomorrow because I
have an ecommerce infection let's talk a
little
about TV again Christopher Osborn this
is a great bit to think on this might
take a second do you think cable is
going towards an all on-demand kind of
service where shows no longer come on a
certain time but they're always just
kind of available to stream so instead
of tuning in to CBS to watch whatever
they want at any given time you choose
whatever CBS show you want wow that
depends on the media you're consuming
further away but it's definitely moving
in that direction it's actually
interesting that you ask that so Comcast
like I said they like to use the
Olympics as a way to test out new
features one of the things that they
tested during the Rio Olympics and the
Sochi Olympics was this idea of making a
live broadcast basically on-demand
almost as soon as it starts becoming
live so that if you drop in like 15
minutes into a program you could jump
back to the very beginning without
having to put it on your DVR without
having to think about it in advance and
so that's kind of getting closer and
closer to that everything is just
on-demand world what's holding it back
is the fact that the people that make TV
and the people that distribute TV are
usually different companies and the
people that make TV make money with
advertising and you can get the most
money from advertising if you can get
people to watch at an appointed time and
prove that they're actually there and so
that's what's holding back from the sort
of Netflix model becoming how everybody
operates is that people are still people
that make TV still need to find ways to
get you to watch at specific time so
they can get those advertising dollars
but that's it's it's becoming less and
less it's definitely moving in the
direction of watch it whenever you want
that's a really great by the way I just
want to say thank you for lining that up
that was a fantastic way to kind of put
it in common terms I think far as why
can't we just have TV when we want it
like there I just happen there's still
logic and reasoning behind it and yes
it's largely business based but there is
also programming structure and it
applies to societal norms so they can
sure I was gonna ask isn't that why you
know they're also heavily invested in
Hulu and like they're all just like
taking their stuff off of Netflix yeah
so well if we're talking about Comcast
we are seeing so what we're seeing you
asked a lot of different kind of things
so that's what I do
haha bloated Alfred by asking a very
vague question you've touched on many
very important specific questions so
yeah so calm so talking about Hulu
Comcast is one of the owners of Hulu so
is Disney so is Fox and to a lesser
extent Time Warner which is the owner of
HBO and and other and CNN other networks
so that who has always been a weird case
where it's like frenemies like we were
talking before where they're people that
they're working together on Hulu but
they're also competing against other
each other on normal TV it's nobody
really know who lose a weird case but
when you talk about pulling stuff off
Netflix that's an example of where
Disney how to deal with Netflix to put
like like Moana and all the Star Wars
movies they had been going to Netflix
Disney said you know what we're just
gonna have our own streaming service cuz
we don't want you to be getting the
benefit of Netflix we don't want you to
be getting the benefit of on-demand
watching which is how everybody's
starting to do things over the internet
so they're gonna be lunch Disney's gonna
launch their own streaming service and
instead of giving it all their goods to
Netflix anymore just to pivot back real
quick to the today Apple leak there's a
fantastic conversation that I'm watching
in the chat right now between imagine
sake and and pakodi a couple of a
regular shout out guys I just couldn't
resist I'm not gonna go into details
about it but they're talking about how
how wrong Apple is how failed Apple is
on a larger scale like wow they just
can't can't keep it together anymore and
MP Cody points out like well they're
still making money they're printing
money and then imagine saga goes once
upon a time Kmart was the king of
discounts Rome didn't fall in a day I
just thought it was a good lie oh don't
remind me I miss Blockbuster but that's
a conversation for another day let's go
and talk to serene joy for a second
something I asked yesterday we must have
missed it apologies Google will be
launching its own ad blocker for Chrome
currently in beta can this lead into
Amazon ads being stifled during the
tension between them so I think the
answer is technologically yes
politically it's a dangerous idea
especially because there's been my my
reaction would be that
especially since there's been so much
focus on the googles and the Facebook's
about all the like Russian influence in
the election the fact that Congress and
the public is kind of on high alert for
how these companies are being bad actors
or failing to be good actors it would be
reckless to make that kind of business
decision to make that it'd be a reckless
strategy to do that but I think that
they could I don't think there's
anything stopping them except for I mean
I think the risks of all of their ad
dollars like comes from Amazon you know
a lot of the times like if people want
to buy a product like this isn't even on
Amazon itself it's just like local
businesses or small businesses that like
want to sell like I don't know Tide Pods
or something and then yeah it like
always redirects back to Amazon so
either way like Amazon kind of wins out
on this like no matter like what they're
blocking alright if you say so we've got
just a couple minutes left
we'll pivot back into talking well this
is not absolutely related but it
definitely stems off of the conversation
between Google and nest realigning
Matthew dacher I know this is an old
trope but imagine if the auto industry
and let's go ahead and broaden that out
into any other industry is a separate
and segregated as the new technologies
we have like the home assistance
imagine if other industries and
companies behave the way this ecosystem
between the Google Apple Amazon pissing
matches were out there what would what
kind of world would we live in so the
idea is that what if like like a car
company had to source a code you know
like a phone needs a Snapdragon
processor and a Google and a Gorilla
Glass and they need to assemble this is
like this bizarre puzzle piece thing
yeah even that was so much overhead into
it imagine if cars had to exist that way
and of course I know cars are made out
of separate parts but they're largely
built on the assembly line kind of
approach where it's pre existing
partnerships kind of thing
yeah even like Apple and Samsung aren't
like that because Samsung does like make
a bunch of like iPhones and they're like
outside factories so what you're saying
is like Ford should make Tigers for
Chevy or something
I'm saying they don't have this like
weird relationship but like if it wasn't
obvious we don't all know a lot about
cars here but that was still a good
question
but that's why I said like apply it to
other places how could we come up with a
good analogy for I don't know food or
something like something that everybody
understands and knows as opposed to the
way that the tech companies are
currently behaving like what's the
behavior I mean that's kind of like what
it's like that's kind of like what it's
like going on between like Spotify and
title right now we're like jay-z's just
taken to all his music off of and then
Apple music has like the same thing
where's like we you can only listen like
Frank Ocean and like chance the rapper
for here for like the first three weeks
before it gets on Spotify or anything
like that right Christopher Osborn is
thrown in a good analogy that's that
kind of works is you can only gas up
your Chevy at a marathon gas station
that's that's kind of a good way to
approach oh I think I think relating to
USBC versus thunderbolt versus etc etc
etc is another good way to look at it is
how you're just you're so stuck into a
very specific process to try and get
your smart device or whatever go yeah I
think that maybe the reason we can't
think of analogies because that kind of
proprietary behavior generally doesn't
give you it works good in the short term
but not in the long term with notable
exceptions like Apple is like a classic
place where they love their walled
gardens and they keep it that way but in
other industries that maybe aren't quite
as new you know computing on the in in
the world of consumers buying things and
they're being industries it's computing
is relatively new it's possible I'm not
you know a competition expert but I see
I imagine that in the early days of
automotives maybe there was a lot more
exclusivity well here's another great
expansion on the concept from dacher the
old trope was that in cars the
accelerator pedal couldn't be in the
same place amongst different
manufacturers and we see that with
phones now where you got the touch idea
in the back you got the face idea in the
front you got the lift awake you got the
all this and that to just get the damn
thing working yeah I imagine the the
pedal analogy I imagine the I imagine I
don't know I'm not a history expert on
an old Trump to be honest but let's say
that was a little over my head too but
I'm glad he brought it up I imagine that
was it was that like a regulatory was
that a regulatory like precept or was it
something that no but I have to imagine
how to cooperate that a must otherwise
people would die like if you thought you
were putting slamming on the brakes and
you're really accelerating people that's
why I imagine it's something that like a
government came in and said hey it needs
to be here or else everyone's gonna be
running into each other killing up
honestly I don't know but now I actually
do want to research this so we'll look
it up for the conversation and a later
show but I mean you got to think there
are still exceptions to for people who
have disability you have different
accelerators available then yeah arm's
length and that's enough I mean a DA
that's also where government has to step
in so maybe it could be an instance
where government has to step in if
Amazon and Google start taking consumers
and making them pawns in their in their
competition maybe no I'm sad sad we have
to end the show on that I know let's go
ahead and look to the future what we got
still coming up well this is the it for
us for the week but next week is going
to be a regular series of regular shows
and then the week following that we've
got the episode 359 of the 359 show it's
a three hours and 59 minutes podcast
we're gonna be partnering up with Mouse
a nonprofit that that basically tries to
encourage more you know more of the
youths into stem research the youths and
yeah they'll be they'll be joining us
for a show and you know it's gonna be a
jam-packed episode we're gonna have a
lot of our reviewers on if you want to
ask about TV you want to ask about VR
you want to ask about you know speakers
cameras
I think cameras alright is um yeah it is
karna nut carnie yeah it's still formula
forming up but the short list right now
includes Dan Ackerman with laptops David
Katz Mayer TVs and Scott Stein with ER
arv our wearables and wearables and then
Bridget Carey with toys and gadgets and
kind of somewhere in between I as all
been joining us to hopefully for a
top-five episode of the 350 I is gonna
talk a la arts our top 5 359 episodes so
that'll be on Wednesday February 21
first we'll still start at the normal
time and you're still gonna get the
regular first you know four minute audio
headline followed by the standard 20 or
so minute of Q&amp;amp;A that we do every single
day
and then we're going to build on there
and have the director from mark lesser
to the director of Mouse he's gonna come
on the show for a while we're gonna try
to get everyone involved to try to help
encourage the youths the youths
to learn more to help Mouse out with
their organization and then just serve
up a ton of stuff to fill in the gaps
just so that we can have the excuse to
sit in here for four straight hours
that's pretty much why we came up with
there right yeah so it'll be a fun
marathon day we hope to see you there
and until then we hope you have a good
weekend who wants to take us home today
