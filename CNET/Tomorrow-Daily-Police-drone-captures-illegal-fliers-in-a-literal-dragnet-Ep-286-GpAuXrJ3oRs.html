welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe you are
watching one of our nano episodes which
is about three and a half minutes of two
great headlines and a phone tyre for the
day so let's not waste any more time
let's talk about what's in the news if
you've ever wanted to watch a police
drone capture another drone with a giant
net like a robot butterfly
today's your lucky day Japanese
officials wanted to figure out a way to
disable illegal drone flights especially
after a drone carrying radioactive
material landed on the prime minister's
roof earlier this year it looks like for
them more drones is their answer they
recently tested a system that involves a
large drone equipped with an even bigger
net to take off into the sky and capture
an illegal aerial vehicle it's starting
out with a single drone but they'll
expand the program to 10 drones next
year with each one guarding its very own
specific government building I think I
smell an updated TV reboot in other news
today is the day everyone NASA
officially opened up job applications
for astronauts the open call for space
explorers starts today and will accept
applications until mid February of next
year if you are interested you can head
over to astronauts nasa.gov and you'll
be able to take a look at some of the
job requirements you'll need a degree
either in math engineering or biological
physical or computer science and quite a
bit of time flying jet aircraft the
manned mission to Mars isn't scheduled
until the 2030s at the earliest but
there is a planned mission to an
asteroid in 2025 you might be able to
get in on if you manage to grab a
coveted spot on the crew so if you meet
all the qualifications and you do decide
to apply good luck
