are in post mode show from the massive
Samsung availing in sep assaut de tooth
out 202 2000-2002 tuned all right I
screwed up like now it's time for Roger
Cheng to screw up his yes good morning
everybody joining us is Ben Fox Rubin in
shower tip can thanks for coming all the
way from SF hear about them no she's a
little drained from the post everybody's
trained we are just a little bird you
know where we're burnt out but we're
still going strong we've got a lot more
samsung coverage the next couple of days
as well today as well as a full review
coming I don't know when soon yeah we
don't hesitate we don't have the unit
yet but you'll be coming soon so um yeah
as you can imagine this is gonna be all
samsung samsung all week oh wait i know
that's right and then sharp shards were
here to answer all of your questions of
the phone she went to Korea to check out
the the battery of process as well as a
phones getting made so if you have any
questions about that pig them in the
comments section usual Ryan will pick
out the best and we will answer them in
three minutes and 59 seconds all right
from approximately 32
welcome to the 359 when we talk about
the top tech news of the day on the crap
you want to throw in I'm Roger Cheng I'm
then fax ribbon and with us is Samsung
expert char tip Caen sharp so excited to
be here I could tell char you actually
went to create a few weeks ago to get a
sneak peek of the galaxy s eight and how
the batteries were tested what did you
see out there yeah the first day I was
in sooo on which is their headquarters
and we got to see the new galaxy s eight
they talked us through the features
basically more in-depth than what we saw
the event yesterday and then we took a
helicopter to gumi which is one of the
nine locations that they build devices
mobile devices and walk through their
new battery testing process their
typical manufacturing process just to
see what they're doing to make sure that
this phone is going to be safe was the
craziest thing you saw out there mm-hmm
well this was something that was not
supposed to happen that we saw we were
looking at a compression test where this
this like big bar pushes this battery
against like another metal like plate on
the ground and what's supposed to happen
is the bar comes up and the batteries
there and it's fine you know nothing
exploded and I guess what happened was
one of the technicians put a lot more
pressure than you normally would so
everybody just kind of stopped paying
attention to it and I looked at the case
you know after like 30 seconds couple
minutes or something and notice the
battery was smoking and then it turned
like red-hot burst into flames and
really yeah seriously and i'm just
sitting there like I cannot believe this
just happened like they're here to show
us that this is not going to happen as
like holy crap how did this happen okay
so I despite that one instance which
sounds horribly embarrassing for samsung
did you leave that feeling like it like
from a consumer perspective that you are
a little bit more confident to like tell
a family member or you yourself would be
confident in buying like a like the next
samsung phone well it's hard to say like
I mean I saw their manufacturing four
years ago almost four years ago so you
can't say like I'm not a battery expert
I don't you know so this stuff looks
impressive to me but I don't know that
you know so I talked to their battery
advisors another X
it's and you know what their battery
advisor visors but who are you know
professors at like Berkeley and Stanford
and different places what they said was
they basically samsung's gone above and
beyond what they need to do in terms of
testing these but it's expensive and so
how long are they gonna keep doing this
are they gonna keep doing this forever I
mean they can't have any problems with
this phone but who knows how much longer
all right so what looks good let's get
to the galaxy SI what are the biggest
change is the biggest features that
wowed you yeah i mean the biggest thing
anyone's gonna notice is the screen
right and also it's it's kind of a
taller skinnier phone than pretty much
any phone I've ever held there's
essentially no bezels like the whole
front is basically a screen there's no
physical home button the fingerprint
readers on the back right next to the
camera which is we're going to annoy a
lot of people I think they're special
reservation recognition so people may
never use the fingerprint except facial
recognition is not secure so you can't
use it for samsung pay you can't use it
for you know any like business sort of
things you need it for so then you'd
have to do like iris scanner or
fingerprints or pin code yeah what I
love different security options yeah I
think they had like six different
options i think is they said something
like that a lot i also wanted to bring a
bigsby which is there the other big
feature they're adding this phone I mean
you had a chance to kind of try it out
what are you what are your initial
impressions I think for people Bixby's
going to be an adjustment because it's
not doing what you expected a digital
assistant to do you're used to talking
to like Siri or Google assistant and
saying you know who was the 35th
President of the United States right you
know what's the weather tomorrow where
do I hide a dead body those kind of
things no really that you know that's a
popular one but um but Bixby can't
answer that Bixby is going to help you
do things on your phone it's a new sort
of interface for your phone which is
good because anybody who's used the
samsung phone knows there's like menus
upon menus of menus which they've done a
good job pairing those down but it still
is hard to figure out how to do things
so instead of having to go through all
that you can just say Bixby turn on my
mobile hotspot okay for more of these
stories check out our special report
it's mostly just char actually it's all
Shara got cute
big feature check it on CNN I'm Roger
Cheng I'm Ben Fox ribbon I'm sure I tip
caen thanks for listening all right
taking a look in the chat our first
question is coming from hang on our
losses name a deal he's asking about the
speakers on the essay did anybody get
any experience with the actual
loudspeakers and how do they stack up
against the s7 i tried playing a movie
there but hoes it's probably hard to
tell us would that audience and i don't
think that they were really emphasizing
the speakers the same way Apple did with
the iphone 7 yeah or even with Samsung
with the tab s3 because I think they
talked about you know they had the the
Harman AKG right technology so no
speaker or no speaker info but we do I
mean they do throw in those hundred
dollar yeah AG headphones that's a
pretty sweet rolling I mean and I would
assume in the future that they'll use
more of Herman's audio technology and
their devices like they own them now so
why not make the best possible mmm
speaker as possible Mike as well as a
few others have been intrigued by the VR
did anybody get to have any hands on
with that uh yeah did you yeah I used it
how was it uh well the game I used was I
think shooting like bunnies so it was a
little sad but is but it's the were they
like realistic bunnies or cartoon but no
I mean it was cartoon but that's a good
thing yeah i mean the VR headset itself
isn't really different from the previous
ones they have a different it's a
different color it's the you know the
orchid gray which is the main color of
the SATA controller but it's got the
controller and the controller is pretty
cool just you know for like shooting
games or anything you know it works
pretty smooth and you've have you tried
the daydream controller know so i
haven't it's it's nice it's nice and
that it's basically you know trash
promotion its got like a touchpad DM is
there is the samsung one any different
than like it's the same deal right I
mean I should attract it tracks motion
and yeah it's a touchpad basically they
tried to recreate so like if you use the
gear VR there's the touchpad that's on
the side yeah that has like you know
different like swype button presses they
basically recreated that in the touch
controller so it's not hard for you to
go from using this
to using the control and same for like
anything getting games or anything so
they don't have to like reprogram
everything completely it to like change
the like so now it's not like a double
click as something whereas on here you
just tap it it's the kind of like trying
to consistent experience yeah and I
never liked the control on the side of
now it's too hard to find yeah find like
what not a young boy yeah totally yeah
Owen is asking so I saw the samsung had
an iris scanner but also facial
recognition is that true facial
recognition are they just calling it
because it's scanning your eyes no it's
facial recognition like you can so with
with the iris scanner you kind of have
to line that up and you know look at it
facial recognition works so fast like
you can have your phone like sitting
down here you know like you know like
you'd normally hold the phone like if
you're sitting it you know you don't
have to line it up it really is facial
recognition with the iris scanner you do
have to line it up I think so I mean I
didn't sure that you had to with the
note 7 iris scanner okay they said they
improved this iris scanner but I don't
think it's you know it's still fast but
I think facial recognition is faster
it's just not as secure so now that
we're down a home button do you think
that this is all speculation of course
do you think that that's going to hustle
Apple down that alleyway and you think
it's going to start yanking some of the
iphone users back over to Samsung I mean
I don't that people are always like oh
Apple's dating Samsung users or
Samsung's gaining Apple users I don't
think so i think people have decided
what operating system they want to be in
purely iOS or your Android yeah so like
if you didn't if you didn't want if you
wanted the note 7 it had issues you went
to the pixel or you went to something
like that instead or you went to an
older Samsung device right it wasn't
that Apple suddenly gains you know is
gonna gain you know steal away customers
from Samsung like at least in developed
markets people have kind of chosen it's
not that easy to switch between Android
and iOS you're used to one it's not you
got your music you've got your yeah it's
all one II costo de lis well 13 said no
do you see Samsung getting an
opportunity with the essay because it is
a different design and they do have that
I don't know the infinity edges yeah
like that do you see this as a chance
for them to I don't know build on their
lead in some way or gain some sort of
opportunity with this phone
the thing for samsung is they usually
are first with the hardware like Apple
does not lead with hardware like their
their end up I mean there's no there's
no curved screens and Samsung devices
for two years now yep and OLED for I
mean it forever I don't even know how
long they've had OLED those are things
that people are talking about coming to
the iphone so it's just what you get
from Apple is a complete package because
they control all of it the hardware the
software the services that's all them
what you're getting from Samsung is
really good hardware that people really
love you're getting android with kind of
Samsung's flavor on top of it which a
lot of people don't like so I don't
think necessarily like I mean the
Samsung hardware people really love it
it is beautiful it's a really nice
design like the essay is a really sleek
looking phone whether it's going to tell
people away from the iphone I don't know
I mean that the this year's iPhone is
supposed to be you know a huge huge
advance is what people are saying so
we'll have to see what Apple actually
does but I mean I think Samsung is going
to be able to hold its own at least I
think you're right though in terms of
people getting locked in like once
you're an Android user like you are at
this point especially those developed
markets you've had android for many
years we've had iOS for many years
you're like you're not really gonna swim
so it's really difficult and it's just
too much of a pain for a lot of people
ya know as the gains are from Samsung
probably stealing from other Android I
mean for them I think the bigger risk is
not apple it's google and pixel right
but not even Google and pixel it's
huawei oh yes the chinese companies it's
the homegrown indian companies who are
making good phones that are really cheap
as far as the android operating system
goes how does that stack up to like
standard Android as far as the Samsung
experience of Android goes I mean so
Samsung's had this kind of skin on top
of it called TouchWiz and I don't know
if they I mean they kind of start
stopped playing that up as much um I
think Samsung's really shown a lot more
restraint than they did with maybe like
the s4 best far they had all this like
gimmicky software like I scrolling so
the
the screen would know based on your
didn't work at all I mean they had all
these features that nobody had a clue
they even had and I think that's one
thing that their new head of mobile DJ
Co has really emphasized and their new
head of software and services rd and
john r e like they're trying to make
services like samsung pay that people
will actually use versus kind of just
putting all this junk on the phone is
making millions of other services yeah
it was like boys yeah exactly it's like
Google has this service but here's the
Samsung flavor and it defaults to the
Samsung I didn't know for the for this
phone I saw Samsung browser there and I
know there are some reasons for it but
like like did we really need to have
some browser so we're getting low on
time but I love this question came up
from lick my frog so with facial
recognition if I cut my beard will it
still open my phone now I kid you not
just minutes ago I was outside the
studio talking with dan ackerman joking
about that point with the idea of
running a test on that see we share
appears do we know what any of those
stipulations are as far as we facialed
and we also were curious because some
facial recognition can unlock if you see
a photo of someone versus like the
actual person that's why it's secure
yeah I mean this is not secure this is
convenience this is like this is
convenience this is not a secure form of
security and like I'm sure they're gonna
keep advancing it and I'm sure you know
in five years three years whatever it is
it's gonna be secure and you'll be able
to you know cuz maybe it'll be like iris
plus facial whatever it'll be faster
whatever they do right now it's just
it's a convenience factor yeah but I
don't know a beard I have no idea like
that's something we'd have to test that
pretty much you have to deal with no I
let's start a girl here let's do let's
start a Kickstarter to get then a facial
tattoo and see if it holds up oh god why
I'm by myself i would i might have to
say yes to that if it's like a Mike
Tyson one then I could get into it
alright scrambling your wife would love
that scrambling to get through some a
couple more questions before I have to
call the day our buddy ah who doesn't
like the idea of a dedicated big speed
button if someone doesn't use that then
you've wasted hardware can we configure
that button for anything else besides
big speed unclear yeah I feel like for
samsung it would be
smart lighting them to letting people
configure it however they want people to
use digsby yeah so if they're going to
basically let you ignore Bixby and just
remove it what's the point of having
Bixby or a button in the first place so
I personally don't think they're going
to say like after maybe six months when
they realized that no one's used Bixby
or if no one if no one uses Bixby who
knows maybe they'll send an update that
allows you to reconfigure the button
this thing may come from like the back
of the race and be the true Dark Horse
winner and you know maybe can you serve
echo there i mean just remember they're
going to be updating this thing
constantly yeah so out of the gate it
doesn't do a lot but they're you know
they're planning to come up with an
update pretty early and then they'll
incorporate the viv technology right so
you know by the time we get to the note
8 this fall or whatever right um you
know they probably will have improved it
by the time we get to the galaxy s 9 you
know it might be something that's
actually really useful right knows yeah
we're gonna see it in all their other
products too did you when you were
testing it out was it just like a quick
press like you would do to the home
button or a long press like you would do
to you know yes sirree I don't think
that I got to the well ok so the way it
works with the button is like a
walkie-talkie you have to hold it down
well because otherwise you're gonna get
like false you know yeah hey what's up
Shara how's it going yeah yeah yeah no
it's a it's a yeah it's a it's a it's
like a walkie talkie and their point was
people like I think there was like some
study the only six percent of people who
use voice assistants will actually talk
to it in public like it's not just a
number like I don't like talking to
voices to Sarah and I don't like it
talking to me and so with this you're
holding it up to your face like you're
actually talking on a phone which I
don't know who you know smartphones
everybody has your buds it's like that's
yeah anyway so it's like you're talking
on the phone you're holding the button
it's like a walkie talkie so people
could think you're just talking to your
mom not talking to your digital is good
if you're a lonely guy can to contain a
telephone call it's baby can a big see
you tonight can a big speed be the
ripcord on a bad date I was like sure
I got a samsung advertising campaign
yeah mike mike is asking well he says he
I Mike likes the idea of big speed but
would like to see voice-activated rather
than that but I do know it is a weak
word okay yeah the face what they say
bill that would be awesome and they just
folks oh no is it he wouldn't like me
when I'm angry bixby ya know what they
said like a in San Francisco when I was
in Korea they still weren't sure what it
was gonna be in San Francisco they said
it was just gonna be Bixby not like hi
Bixby hey buck speak but knowing Samsung
they could still change that in between
now and when people actually have the
device so theoretically it's just gonna
be Bixby but we'll see clock is ticking
until we see the season when they start
naming like new parents are naming their
kids because it's already happening in
Brooklyn yeah oh yeah and just remind
them so this felt launches in I believe
us Korea and Canada in on April 21st and
it for 28th in Europe parts of Asia and
then like in may for a lot of the rest
of the market so they have some time to
work on Bixby let's try to squeeze in at
least one more here at the other half
hour mohammad mohammad asks dude why do
you think the s8 stuck with four gigs of
ram when they have the technology to
bump into six like to see nine pro i
think that Sam yeah cost samsung also
was they were conscious of the issues
with the note 7 and they didn't want to
go all out in this phone like there's a
lot they could have done they could have
added thinking about it a second lens
there's you know which they said they
didn't do that because they don't see a
value for it right now in other words
it's expensive yeah like if you're
adding another camera lens if you're
adding more memory I mean they are the
biggest memory maker in the world memory
costs basically nothing at the point but
but I have to imagine like at six gigs
of RAM like are you really getting that
much more speed than four gig like is it
gonna be that much better especially on
a phone exactly it's noticeable if
you're doing like Photoshop exactly but
for phone it's not that noticeable so
like the return on investment there is
fairly limited I mean beyond just being
able say like I've got six gigs of RAM
like for a real user that's not that
tangible
about it all right one last couple of
recaps what colors are going to be
available and what's the battery life so
they have not said the battery life yet
I think they're still doing tests on
that but what they did say was so the
capacity of this batteries a little bit
smaller than the s7 edge but they used
like software and some other tweaks so
it should have better battery life than
the s7 edge though they haven't told us
exactly what they also used a kind of
slightly different chemistry on the
battery battery after the note 7 issues
so that this is a longer lasting battery
not like daily but over time there's an
issue yes yeah so after like two years
it's supposed to have ninety five
percent of its charging capacity most
phones are like 80 yeah or worse so
that's a good thing your phone should
theoretically last longer because I
think most people upgrade because your
battery I mean realistic your battery
doesn't work sorry what was the other
question or colors colors not in the US
we're getting I believe black orchid
grey and silver some of the other
regions have like a pain yeah boom gold
um so we're not getting those their
region locked huh that's interesting
yeah i mean but is i mean come on like
it's expensive to manufacture five six
different colors of a phone oh totally
like two percent of people are buying
blue okay you know if they find out like
in the u.s. like people most you know
ninety percent of people are gonna buy
black silver right or you know gray why
have a blue color I want Harry wink
actually I was like her I was cast
studio periwinkle I was a little
surprised 18t didn't like snap up that
blue one as an exclusive like well any
natural that could happen in a couple
months right we don't know that always
happens when they come out with like an
active version maybe it's gonna be like
so jente who knows it won't be it won't
be well I'll be somebody started a CG
would not want to go with magenta for
some it started like they're pink start
a change.org petition to get new Samsung
colors in the US what you do is you buy
a case and that solves the problem
that's true that's a way cheaper
alternative on the chink in my armor yes
alright that's a great place to stop
yeah we got a torrent of questions till
flooding in sorry everybody we can't get
to everything we gotta roll we got to
get out of here I've had enough samsung
I'm tired of it I know this is all
samsung week so thanks for all the
questions we will ya thank you we will
try to come back next week with non
Samsung topic and I'm certain that we'll
revisit Samsung a shirt and again and
again if there really is the retainer
right Shara I can come back anytime
there you go and yeah if there really is
the man will will devote some time next
week to answer a couple overflow Samsung
questions alright if you liked anything
you saw her hurt here check us out on
cnet our podcast also available on
itunes tune in stitcher SoundCloud
feedburner and google play music we will
see you all next week have a great
weekend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
