not the only note that made an
appearance here also the note for edge
you've got your choice of basically the
exact same feature set that's in the
Samsung Note 4 on a 5.6 inch screen but
the big difference here is a curved edge
screen this crazy bar that comes over
here that acts as a secondary display
essentially you can lie it down when the
phone is off and you can use it as an
alarm clock you can get basic
notifications on the edge but when you
have the phone on you can use it as a
connected toolkit to go to shortcuts for
apps you can tap here and pick ones and
customize it like a toolbar saving you
space is the whole point on the bar here
but if you open up apps those have that
have supported this and there's an SDK
that will allow people to develop
widgets and tools if they want to you
can actually transform any of your apps
into something that's a little more edge
ified for instance your camera will
suddenly have all of its buttons on the
side here and if you turn on its side
suddenly those buttons are almost like
top edge buttons it's pretty cool and if
you use the pen mode and you bring up
any notes for instance well those
instantly become a toolbar that
activates on the side right now there
are a few apps that are supported
including a sports ticker from yahoo and
certain trend lists from twitter you can
tap on and find out what's trending and
link right to it this is a very funky
new technology that's obviously taking
advantage of curb screen tech that
Samsung has the note edge is going to be
a more premium line than the note 4 but
it's basically like a note 4 plus plus
I'm Scott Stein and that's a little look
at the Samsung Note edge here in New
York</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
