Powershot g1x before throwing the mark
to monitor on him
the improvements include great new 5x
zoom lens with a much better f-22 3.9
maximum aperture and a selfie friendly
tilting touchscreen but the not so
improvements include a drop in effective
resolution for its 1.5 inch sensor and
exchanging the built-in optical
viewfinder for a rather pricey
electronic one I'm Laurie Brennan and
this is the canon powershot g1 x mark -
the design of the mark ii sports a more
typical look than its predecessor and
overall i like it for casual shooting
the touchscreen is responsive big and
bright and pretty easy to use in
sunlight the highlight though is the
lens as much for its design as for specs
it has two rings one clicky one to which
you can assign a lot of different
functions including step zoom and one
smoothly turning one to which you can
assign a couple of functions both have
context-sensitive uses it includes a
built-in lens cover as well which I
really like it also has a higher popping
up tilting flash unfortunately I really
don't like the slender grip which
doesn't feel sufficient given the
camera's weight it weighs as much as a
DSLR body but the grip is a fraction of
the size Canon offers a bigger optional
grip but given the high price and size
of the camera well making it extra cost
feels a bit chintzy same goes for the
optional viewfinder which will run you
about $300 and doesn't even seem to be
available everywhere yet the performance
is a bit problematic as well the
autofocus system is slow possibly
because the lens doesn't move all that
fast I occasionally missed shots because
it simply took too long to fix on the
subject and in dim light I got the can't
focus icon more often than I liked and I
couldn't always figure out why the
continuous shooting is reasonable though
3.1 frames per second with autofocus the
image quality is very good though not
great as you'd expect for such an
expensive camera still depending upon
the scene content you can probably use
the full size images up to about ISO
200 videos unimpressive with lots of
edge artifacts and you have no manual
controls it's fine for sharing small
clips with friends though
the canon powershot g1 x mark 2 is a
fine camera with a very nice lens and
some great design points but the
performance lags and the image quality
doesn't quite earn excellent marks I'm
Lori Brennan and this is the canon
powershot g 1x market</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
