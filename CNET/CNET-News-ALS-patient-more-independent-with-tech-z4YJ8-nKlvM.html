live with ALS the short answer is
totally frankly without eye gaze
technology to control a computer and the
access it gives me to internet
communication I would have allowed
myself to simply succumb to ALS years
ago with a technology available now I am
able to keep myself occupied both
professionally albeit volunteer as well
as socially I am able to be of service
to others into the cause of finding an
effective treatment for my own disease
this keeps my perceived quality of light
quite high I can talk with visitors but
I can also schedule their visits I can
manage my own finances and healthcare
outside of the physical paralysis bit I
am still nearly as independent and
potent as before diagnosis what are some
of your biggest challenges right now
like turning off lights controlling
temperature and how do you currently
manage those challenges I have an
infrared transceiver with which coupled
with software on my computer I can
control my television and stereo I use
various network tools to control other
computers around my house and to help
other patients around the country with
their own computers I have attendants
who help with lights temperature windows
etc what was your experience wearing the
Emotiv insight brain where it is very
lightweight and comfortable in its
current second incarnation the training
of the device requires a little patience
but is surprisingly natural in feel the
user interface devised for the Philips
POC product is a work of art I am very
impressed with the work done to ensure
flow and feedback if a were to hit the
market how do you see it improving your
life there are critical limitations if
one wants to use eye gaze also eyes can
fail medication interferes with pupils
in Els the arms are relatively spared
but I have lost two friends whose eyes
had come to the disease and they could
no longer communicate with this product
they could have continued
living that alone demands a market for
this how do you hope technology can
improve to help other ALS patients we
have amazing technology in commodity
consumer goods that power must be
delivered to the average person in a way
they can use and at a price they can
afford
this product can achieve both while also
being the most noble form of Technology
restoring lost ability and personal
independence we as people are the
expression of our minds our physical
bodies are just a vessel for a
manifestation of the mind
therefore loss of physical ability does
not diminish our persons all it does is
limit the ability to manipulate the
physical world I am somewhat of a
transhumanist and believe that
technology can not only enhance
abilities but restore lost abilities due
to trauma or disease so until medical
science catches up technology is the
cure for ALS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
