Jim Clark was my my hero growing up and
f1 of course is the the epitome of
everything that's great about motorsport
the glamour the excitement the speed at
Williams of course what a legacy great
engineering legacy great engineering
foundation within this organization
that's allowed us to build an advanced
engineering group that we believe can
tackle some of the most interesting
issues and problems that the automotive
industry the energy sector the defense
sectors have to throw at us so it's a
fascinating place to work a lot of
challenges in the world today is
improving efficiency and so energy comes
with that so anything you're able to do
to improve energy consumption or reuse
of is where we sort of had a lot of
strengths we're very good at taking a
holistic view in coming up with you know
a different way of approaching it a
different way of solving the problem
the organizers have formulary were
looking for a group that would be
capable of supplying all of those power
systems the battery systems to this new
single seat series and it was a project
we were really interested in we had the
first battery running in tests in the
January 14 last year and then the right
the first race was in Beijing in in
August so we had a very aggressive less
than 12 month program to develop the
battery validate the battery produce 45
batteries and pass the UN 38.3
legislation which is so you can
transport these batteries around the
world by in flight and it was yeah it's
completely delivered in in about ten
months in total 675 which is one here at
moment was another very challenging
program very simple objectives it had to
have the performance of the Bugatti
Veyron the fuel economy of a Toyota
Prius and the range of a Chevrolet Volt
Williams
did a terrific job in creating the C X
75 it really is a very special piece of
automotive art a real challenge that we
tackled exceptionally quickly and that's
a hallmark really of advanced
engineering was the Nissan GTR Time
Attack car Nissan gave us a challenge
they wanted us to engineer the GTR to
take on the Nordschleife ER and we
achieved the majority of the performance
by advanced aerodynamics weight
reduction with lightweight components
strategically placed lightweight
components and actually only had a very
small engine performance upgrade and so
we were very proud of the fact that we
could we keep one at the time broke the
lap record which was just over seven
minutes for Nurburgring for which for a
car that was 1,700 kilograms quite
staggering but we're very proud of the
fact that it was a very efficient
solution for that
the internal combustion engines far from
dead and in fact there's nothing quite
like a big v8 block we love
high-performance cars but you know
performance can be extracted in many
ways and I think that the Eevee systems
that we've developed here at Williams
show that you can achieve great
performance you can achieve it with
great efficiency and you can still
produce also many of the characteristics
that engage motorists and keen
automotive enthusiasts
