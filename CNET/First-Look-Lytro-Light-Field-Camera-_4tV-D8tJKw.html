with seen it and this this is a giant
lipstick no of course not it's the
electrode light field camera and if you
don't already know what it is it's
really time you came out of your cave so
what's unusual about the Lytro aside
from the shape that is its sensor
captures not just the color and
intensity of light but the vector
direction of the light rays when you
press the shutter release this little
dimple on top light is collected from
all directions which the camera software
translates into what's basically a 3d
map of whatever was photographed giving
it the unique capability of shooting
fast without the need to focus first
then when you get back to your computer
you use light or software to convert
your shots into what they call living
pictures that can be refocused again and
again and then you can share them online
and let others refocus them again and
again and if that doesn't do it for you
you can convert them into small lifeless
JPEGs but you'd really be missing the
point of the camera as for using the
Lytro it's both simple and complicated
there's an almost non-existent
touch-sensitive strip that controls the
8x zoom lens power button and microUSB
port on the bottom and a very tiny
touchscreen with terrible viewing angles
making it difficult to frame shots
unless it's directly in front of your
eyes you get to shooting modes everyday
and creative the everyday mode lets the
camera set the refocusing range that's
the distance between objects in the
foreground and background that can be
refocused and creative mode can be used
for macro shots or portraits with soft
blurry backgrounds but there's less of a
refocusing effect now what I meant by
simple and complicated is that it can be
used like a simple point-and-shoot but
getting good interesting shots for
refocusing takes practice and creativity
if that sounds cool to you then
definitely consider getting one however
be warned the camera or should I say the
camera software is
for work in progress lecture has new
features planned but when you get to use
them is dependent on its development
schedule so it's up to you if you're
okay with that regardless it's a cool
camera with some cool technology and
we're looking forward to seeing what it
can do in the future I'm Josh Goldman
and that's the light red light field
