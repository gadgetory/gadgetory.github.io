its closest approach to the earth since
the year 2003 between July 27th and July

they've been in 60,000 years roughly 30
4.6 million miles or 50 5.7 million
kilometers NASA said this planet
proximity won't happen again until the
year 22 87 so go outside and check it
out and finally between August 11th and
