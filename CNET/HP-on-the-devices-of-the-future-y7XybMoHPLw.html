takana me conference in lake tahoe
california i'm here with perth banerjee
who is the director of HP's lab so the
guy responsible not for figuring out you
know what should this fall's pcs look
like but really how is the future of
computing shaping up and so I guess one
of the questions is what are the big
trends that are changing the way you see
the future of computing and then what
type what does that mean for the kinds
of devices that we're all going to be
carrying around several years from now
so I think that information is going to
be the most precious resource in the
21st century and as we all create so
much information the amount of
information is exploding sort of
doubling every 12 to 18 months I am
thinking about sort of a metaphor of a
future personal computing device as
being a window to the world of
information where this which will allow
people who are consumers of information
to access information from the producers
of information so people are producing
information from three books and
magazines and and music and videos and
blogs and news and there are consumers
would like to search through all these
different forms of information and
consume exactly the right information
that you're interested in so that is
kind of the metaphor that's where the
world is headed and I would like to talk
about that so we have today the iPad why
is that not to be all and end all you
know have we reached Nirvana what what
can we do this better so I think the
iPad and other related devices lace and
toddlers and so on just the beginning
the starting point of this grand vision
of a window
the world today you can so so when I
share with my colleagues at HP Labs
about this vision I talk about four or
five technologies that will make this an
incredibly exciting future first the
world of dis place is going to be
completely different from today's world
of emissivity space where you are like
you're shining light behind the screen
into a world of reflective in color add
video race this is going to be a sea
change in the whole area of this place
try that in with some work that we will
see in future devices on interactive
intuitive interfaces instead of using a
keyboard using Uli's touch gesture and
recognize your your facial place your
you whether you're happy or not in an
immersive environment and so that's kind
of a second thing third thing is we're
through very deep analytics it will be
very personal so it will do all kinds of
analysis as to what you're interested in
based on location preferences the
friends you have the social networks and
so on and when you search for some
information some video or whatever it
will essentially understand the context
of your search and provide the right in
from you team and finally there is some
lot of technologies that we want to
leverage of social computing social
networking that what your friends are
talking about will will provide you
information based on exactly what your
the social networks are are talking
about we are thinking about the world of
where when you search for information
instead of searching for keywords
the keywords are you wait for you to
solve some problems we are interested in
helping you so our energy future
consumers to actually solve real
problems when they are searching for
information and that's the kind of that
last point is the kind of thing that I'm
used to hearing from Microsoft or Google
but I'm not so used to hearing from HP
can you talk a little bit about how the
world of technology is shifting from a
sharp division between hardware and
software makers to a world where you
know all technology companies are
looking to fundamentally answer a
problem on their own that's exactly the
point i'd like to make that you should
not think about HP as the hardware
company other company for the software
companies i think we are trying to
provide solutions so this metaphor about
a window to the world of information
that the device is just think of it as a
hardware device but to make this window
the most compelling window that people
will use that window it requires a lot
of software some of the software will be
learning on their device other soft will
be learning on the cloud so the bunch is
second away a continuum from the hard
way the software is running on the on
the hardware and the software running on
the cloud and so these these differences
between hardware dumping the software of
these are disappearing it was my
interest in this one other point that I
want to pick up on quickly was you
talked at the beginning one of your
first point was the change in display
technology and you guys have shown in
the labs you have this flexible display
that's and also these prototype color
reflective displays as opposed to a
missive are these just pie in the sky
are these things that you know we should
start preparing for now these are not
finest that is actually we have
demonstrated these technologies and labs
and it's a question of sort of trying to
transfer these technologies to our sort
of display vendors and so that then they
become of suppliers to HP when we
actually see this you will see this kind
of reflective technology very soon in
future versions of
great thank you so much pip energy is
the director of HP's labs I mean afraid
for cnet thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
