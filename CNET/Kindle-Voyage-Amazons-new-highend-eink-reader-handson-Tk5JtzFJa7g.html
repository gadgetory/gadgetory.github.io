event where Amazon has a couple new
e-ink ear eaters including the higher
end Kindle voyage this is $199 model and
what amazon has done is made it a little
bit better performing it also has a
little better brightness but it's also
thinner it weighs only six point three
ounces compared to the paperwhite which
is at seven point eight ounces one of
the notable difference between this
model and the paperwhite is that it has
a flush front there is no bezel and the
glass on the front goes across the
entire screen the touch sensitivity is
supposedly a little bit better and
Amazon has added a couple
pressure-sensitive page turn buttons on
either side you simply hold those down
to turn the pages or you can touch the
screen to turn pages the voyage costs
$1.99 amazon also has a new entry-level
model that costs only $79 that model is
actually a touch screen model its IR
based touchscreen so it isn't quite as
sensitive as this models touch screen
it's also a little bit thicker but
Amazon was really trying to hit that
price point of $79 all the new ink
readers and the paperwhite does stay in
the line they do go up to four gigabytes
of memory instead of two gigabytes they
also have the same one gigahertz
processor this step of $199 voyage does
have 512 K of RAM while the other models
have 256 so it's a little bit zippier a
new three-tiered Kindle ink line with a
base model starting at $79 and the new
high-end model The Voyage starting at
$1.99 these will be available in
cellular versions as well this is a
Wi-Fi only for one
they're available for pre-order now and
they will be out in October</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
