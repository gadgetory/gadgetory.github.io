security flaws I'm Bridget Carey this is
your cnet update over the past several
days we've learned of many new ways to
get hacked Chrysler's car entertainment
systems can be tapped into wirelessly to
send commands to a Jeep Cherokee and as
wired showed us in this video report
hackers can take over the steering wheel
mess with the brakes even kill the
engine and it sent the reporter driving
the car into a ditch and thanks to
another security researcher we learned
hackers can break into an Android phone
just by sending one text message with a
video or photo file that's packed with a
hidden malicious code also there's a
husband and wife program or power couple
that discovered a way to wirelessly hack
into a high-tech internet connected
rifle to change its settings so the
bullet will miss the target when you
have a rifle that can be connected
wirelessly to a smartphone app you're
just asking to be hacked and there's yet
another car hack possible according to
security researcher Samy Kamkar he
posted this video to YouTube explain how
it's possible to hack GM cars with
OnStar using the remote link app he
created a device that can be placed
anywhere on the car even hidden behind
the back bumper and it can give a hacker
access to the same controls on the app
such as being able to locate the exact
location with GPS and then unlock the
doors and start the engine but the
hacker couldn't drive off without the
key if you're wondering why you're
hearing about so many devastating
security vulnerabilities this month
don't blame the blue moon it's because
the biggest cyber security conferences
of the year black hat and Def Con are
taking place in Las Vegas during the
first week of August and the researchers
are teasing their presentations to the
press the world's top security
researchers and hackers gather to
showcase their findings at these events
and you can expect car hacking to be a
big topic the good news is that all
these hacks i mentioned have been
reported to the company so patches are
being worked on but who can say how many
problems have been discovered that have
not been reported companies need to do
more to think about security when
they're connecting everything to the
internet and see
kind of having the internet everywhere
Facebook is ready to start testing a
massive solar powered drone that will
provide internet access to
underdeveloped countries named Aquila
this drone has the wingspan of a 737 but
it weighs hundreds of times less and it
can hover in the stratosphere 11 miles
above the earth for three months
straight Facebook has nearly 1.5 billion
users but there are 4 billion people in
the world without access to the Internet
so for facebook to grow it needs to get
those people connected and putting the
internet above the earth is seen as a
better alternative than building out the
towers and installing fiber-optic cable
on land that's it for this tech news
update and you can always get more news
