the apple byte for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple and the
big story this week is all iphone talk
from our friend KGI Securities analyst
ming-chi Kuo who recently broke down
what he expects the next iPhone to have
now he's had a pretty solid track record
up to this point and if he's right this
isn't just a minor upgrade this is a
full overhaul now quote predicts the
rumor to iphone 6s and 6s plus will
bring a force touchscreen with more
input methods and gesture control
support it will also be equipped with an
a 9 processor with two gigs of ram bring
an improved 12 megapixel camera and add
one microphone near the speaker for
enhanced audio quality the two screen
sizes will remain the same and there
will be no four-inch option it will also
have improved touch ID recognition and
if dropped test issues can be resolved
he says a limited number of the 6s plus
will have sapphire screens he also says
the bengay tissues will be improved with
different kc materials and improved
internals there will be a rose gold
color option to match the current apple
watch edition that everyone is buying i
mean come on it's just flying off the
shelves and it's expected for mass
production to start in mid-august now
there's no word on what Apple will call
the new phone but come on guys this
one's pretty easy for me call it the
iphone success uh-huh yeah you like that
you can thank me later Apple alright
another Apple gadget we're keeping our
eyes on is the ipad pro and we alluded
to a force touch screen on the product
last week now The Korea Times is
reporting that Apple just requested
silver nanowire material samples for
thinner touch panels from LG display
samsung display and japan display now
this specific type of panel is really
more flexible than current touch
technology it's created from a mesh of
silver wires that are about one
nanometer in diameter the material is
really clear and it doesn't require
additional sensors to determine your
touch location now really all of this
adds up to support chatter that Apple
will be bringing force touch to the next
iPad now the first wave of space black
leather
loop and modern buckle Apple watches are
on their way with the steel link getting
shipped out as well recently now my bad
boy is finally on its way but one of the
reasons orders might be taking so long
is because Apple is relying on single
suppliers for watch parts instead of
multiple sources according to UBS LG is
the sole supplier for the OLED display
tbk is the only company providing the
touch sensor and lamination and then you
have us I Shanghai responsible for the
systems and package including the
processor and memory now this could
point to Apple be very tight right now
because it's a brand new product launch
but it also affects how many units they
can pop out and if you have been
noticing apple has released a batch of
new Apple ads for television and you
really have to appreciate how accurate
they aren't depicting the Apple watch in
real world situations in fact they're so
accurate that we decided to identify all
the Apple watches featured and there are
us advertisement and you know it was
hard to identify a couple of them but
during the one-minute commercial we
found two Apple watch sports 16 Apple
watch stainless steel and two editions
just like in real life and you know what
that is bad apple on you Apple alright
the big a was recently granted a patent
they inherited from their primeSense
acquisition that covers a 3d sensing
device that works with distinct gestures
to control items on a display or TV the
pad covers working with music movies or
games which would be a natural fit for
iTunes and the App Store on a Mac or
Apple TV now the in air gestures would
allow you to select an item like a song
track or activate a channel like Netflix
to open a song or a movie without a
remote control now Apple was also
granted a patent for this mysterious
light fixture that has yet to come out
to market it no one really knows what
this is could it be something they'll
use that the new campus or at retail
stores it's truly a mystery and the
patent offers no information on the
nature of the design so it's pretty
light on details oh no he thin oh oh yes
I did
and I love covering the gadgets that are
connected to the apple ecosystem so I
had to show you this meet Lily the first
point and shoot camera of drones well
let's just call it a throw-in shoot boom
my blown now this is just amazing stuff
it's a self flying drone that pairs with
Abby can you wear on your wrist and it
follows you to capture footage with a 20
minute battery life you can set it to
capture different types of shots and it
will make the proper dramatic moves for
those shots with still images at 12
megapixels 1080p video at 60 frames per
second and 120 frames slo-mo at 720p now
I'm in love with this thing it comes out
in February of 2016 yes 2016 and there's
an early bird price of 499 before June
fifteenth but after that it jumps to
1,000 bucks not the cheapest but this is
really why we love tech alright that's
going to do for this we show you can
email me at the apple byte at cnet com
or tweet me at brian Tong thanks for
watching and we'll catch y'all next time
for another bite of the Apple oh hold on
one more thing let's go let's go
