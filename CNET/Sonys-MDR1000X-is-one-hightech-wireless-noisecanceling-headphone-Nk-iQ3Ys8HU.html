headphones Bose is generally considered
the gold standard but Sony's engineers
have been on a mission to be posed at
what it does best the result of their
efforts is the MDR 1000x
which Sony is calling its most
technologically advanced headphone and
features both wireless Bluetooth
connectivity an adaptive noise
cancellation in a swanky looking chassis
that retails for $400 and ships in
October sony says it developed new ear
pads for this headphone and the embedded
touch controls for volume adjustment and
skipping tracks forward and back are
more responsive than those found in the
mdr-1a bt i'm not going to get into all
the technical details but this headphone
has similar drivers to the highly rated
mdr-1a and as microphones not only on
the outside to measure ambient noise but
inside the headphone to take account for
the shape of your head and ears and
whether you wear glasses so he calls it
the sense engine and says it tailors the
noise canceling performance individually
to you you can also choose alternate
settings that allow more ambient noise
to seep in or even filter out everything
but voices so you can hear announcements
in airports while listening to music
another cool feature is the ability to
muffle your music and let the outside
rolled in by simply holding your hand
over the right ear cup where the touch
controls are located once you finish
talking to someone you remove your hand
and the music resumes playing at its
previous volume and the noise canceling
kicks back in battery life is rated at
20 hours and a cord is included if you
want to listen in Wired mode if you're a
frequent traveler the MDR 1000x should
definitely be on your shortlist sound
quality is top-notch for a bluetooth
headphone and the noise cancelling
appears to be as effective or even
slightly more so than that of the bose
qc25 but the bose is lighter and
arguably slightly more comfortable it
also costs $50 less both are impressive
Wireless noise cancelling headphones
that are easy to recommend for choosing
between the two is going to be hard I'm
