ever wonder what it feels like to fly
onboard a drone this may come pretty
close
Peretz new first-person view headset in
sky controller 2 for their disco and
bebop to give you a live drones eye view
of the sky the updated controller
connects two parrots free flight app on
any Android or iOS device via USB and
the new headset mode in the app turns
the phone into a br viewer which can
then be placed inside the goggles it's
easy to get dizzy with this perspective
right now yeah I think I see myself
there I am ah that was busy now the view
is clearer than trying to look at the
gallery' screen of a phone or controller
but the picture quality is grainy and I
never really felt like I was flying
neither drone has a 360-degree camera so
don't expect the fully immersive
experience of a traditional VR headset
instead you're locked into the 90 degree
cockpit view of whatever the drone is
seen during its flight FAA regulations
require drone pilots to be able to keep
the drone in line of sight which rules
out using the headset to steer so at
least in the US this tool is intended as
more of a shared live experience with a
spectator or copilot so I just landed on
the grass I can see some blades and I'm
back on earth it's a little bit jarring
to go from this to the real world but
I'm not as dizzy the second time around
the headset and sky controller are sold
as part of the disco bundle for around
1000 US dollars or in bundle with the
bebop 2 for 500 or if you already have a
bebop 2 they can also be purchased
individually through parrots website for
350 and for more specs on both these
drones check out our full review at sea
