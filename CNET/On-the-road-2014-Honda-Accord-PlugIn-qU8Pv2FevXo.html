$6,000 more than a four-cylinder Accord
you picked up one Highway mpg now
they're back with both a hybrid and what
we've got here today the plug-in hybrid
bottom line the numbers now make sense
in a big way now first of all Accord
plugins are all sedans this technology
doesn't come on the coop spotting one of
these isn't too hard it's got arguably
the best-looking body of any Accord in
terms of the body kit very aggressive
front chin this blue tinted headlight
lens isn't just for looks it also calls
your attention to standard LED
headlights and overall it's got a nice
massive almost accurate look it all goes
to hell up the wheels though those are
actually Marie Callender's pipe hands
well not really but they may as well be
because they rattle like them and their
actual wheel covers it look like hell
which isn't just cheap it's an insult
because behind there are actual alloy
wheels I assume these are there for
aerodynamics but really the trunk is
rather highly compromised this is where
the extra capacity battery lives it cuts
the trunk storage by 45% over even a
hybrid accord let alone a standard one
so that's a big intrusion kind of
unforgivable in a big car that is meant
to carry foreign comfort but obviously
not all for their luggage is gonna fit
here
now under the hood the plug-in hybrid
doesn't present that much differently
than a regular hybrid start off with a
lean-burn 2-liter four-cylinder inline 4
sitting here sidesaddle coupled to an
electric motor and going out to
front-wheel drive only via a CVT
transmission total gas engine powers 141
horse with another 55 coming from the
electric motor the vehicles kind of
chunky 3,800 pounds that's 200 more than
a standard Accord Hybrid and almost 600
more than a standard Accord
four-cylinder without any hybrids so
this is way up on the scales but it all
comes out in the wash 47 46 is your mpg
rating and most people are reporting
getting closer to 50 real-world 115 mpg
E which is the electric mode miles per
gallon equivalent so this guy is really
stellar in terms of efficiency that's
saying something for a car that is big
and weighs quite a bit
these gauges alongside the speedometer
are unique to this vehicle on the upper
right you've got your battery charge
level lower right your fuel level on the
left you've got your swing age if you
will shows if you're using power or
using momentum to recharge the battery
and then you've got a whole variety of
instruments in the middle of the
speedometer the one that I find the most
useful by far is this little momentum
gauge leave that one turn on it will
coach you to gradually accelerate and
brake which will do as much for any cars
economy as electrification sometimes
there's your rear cam and of course
you've got trajectory in distance if you
hit this button here you're also going
to change to a downward cam which is
nice for the last few inches and then
when you go into either a right turn or
hit the button on the stock over here
you get the camera on the right mirror
activated that looks back down the car
and gives you distance markings now
regardless of what you're using in this
car the interface is this - screen deal
you got the big non touch setback and
you've got a smaller touch screen up
here that doesn't necessarily make it a
success you can end up with disasters
like this when you pull up FM radio and
get not just two representations of your
presets but two representations that
don't even sync up that one's showing
presets 8 through 11 by default this
one's showing 7 through 12 I can scroll
this one to get a different slice of my
presets but it doesn't follow over here
it's a complete mess but on the
navigation side you can get to these
kind of moments where you're entering an
address and you get not one but two
keyboards and they are a different
interface and then even though you've
got this giant screen up here in the
dash
they sure don't use the real estate very
well notice how my tags coming off the
RDS portion of an FM broadcast aren't
horribly truncated I can't even tell
what that says and I've been staring at
it for minutes yet they did spend time
using a whole bunch of lower real estate
to give us what's basically an analogue
band tuner which is completely useless
now under the audio system just about
every source you want is in there you
have optical discs tildes cars and shed
that yet Pandora and AHA talked about
that diminished oddly for a high trim
car the Accord plug-in is missing HD
radio even though some siblings like The
Odyssey have it iPod hooks up and does a
very nice job of showing up you've also
got song by voice on this car so you can
literally call out the name of a track
or an artist that's on your iPod and
it'll go fetch it play moon buggy ride
using the hondalink app you can bring up
all of a hoss services which largely
form the backbone of this cars
interesting interactive features you'll
also then get telematics functions by
that same app including remote battery
state charge on demand and charts
programming range to dead shown on the
phone and locate charging stations now
the plug in the cord oddly shares a lot
of approach with the Chevy Volt though
not any parts let's break it down first
there's easy mode the electric motor
does all the driving the gas engines out
of the picture it's actually
freewheeling to kill friction this mode
will cover up to 13 miles worth of start
and stop driving and lower speed work
then there's hybrid mode here the
electric motor is still doing all the
work but the gas engine is kicked in to
run a generator to create more juice on
the fly so you are using a hybrid of
power plants but only a single traction
source and that is electric this mode
kicks in for at speed acceleration or
frequent speed change driving then
there's engine mode here the gas engine
does all the work and the electric motor
goes to sleep and the gas engine is
basically running in a very efficient
high gear mode typically for cruising
and then there's hybrid charge mode lean
on the hybrid button for a couple of
seconds and the vehicle is told to
operate as a hybrid but with the main
goal of recharging the battery ASAP so
you can get back to evey mode sooner now
a full plug-in charge takes one hour on
240 volts level two or three hours on a
typical household outlet
as you can see on the screen there you
got some great mpg numbers from some of
our recent tests and recent loops this
car really delivers serious mileage the
ride quality is very good
electric cars tend to because they've
got that nice planting weight of the
battery and although you can't really
tell right now because I've got the
window open it's very quiet inside one
problem with that quiet it's shattered
by this piercing whine that comes from
somewhere behind the speedometer when
you step on it it's some kind of an
electric transition going on there I
don't know exactly where it's coming
from maybe from the inverter but wow
it's annoying as all get-out
okay pricing a 2014 Accord plug-in
Hybrid is pretty simple everything I've
shown you is included forty thousand six
but that's before a federal tax credit
of thirty six hundred and twenty six
dollars well it's not the big seventy
five hundred credit you've heard about
because this car does not have as large
a battery as the feds want to see nor
does it run as pure electric as let's
say a Chevy Volt does so you don't get
the full credit so all in you're looking
at something around thirty seven
thousand dollars if you're in California
you can qualify for another fifteen
hundred dollars again not the full
twenty five hundred that that state
would often award more electrified
owners the EPA figures the average
fifteen thousand mile your driver will
save about 1250 a year in fuel costs
with the plug-in compared to an Accord
v6 which is the most comparable now
there's about a four thousand dollar
price Delta after federal tax credit
meaning it would take you a little over
three years for the plug-in tech to pay
for itself if you're an average driver
but that's before any state credits you
may get but also assuming you're going
to take regular advantage of full
plug-in charges
as with any car with advanced energy
tech it's a numbers game but regardless
how those pencil out Honda has absolved
itself here of the old Accord Hybrid
with a new car that goes a long way to
restore their reputation for doing Green
