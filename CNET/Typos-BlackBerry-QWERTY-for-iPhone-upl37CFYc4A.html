interested in the device I'm Jessica's
allsort first unit here at CES 2014 in
Las Vegas this is these typos keyboard
case now this is a $100 plastic device
that slides over your iPhone and it
connects in the back but open exposed
area so you can still get at your
charger your headset jack your camera
and all of your buttons on the slide it
does connect to the iPhone via bluetooth
and this device has its own charger the
Bluetooth connection is important
because it means that whatever you type
registers on the screen now the device
maker claims that the battery is strong
enough to last about seven to ten days
on a single charge that of course is
going to depend on how you looking at
the keyboard it is very clear that this
was taken from a BlackBerry device in
fact the company has already been sued
but they're going to go ahead and ship
this in about two weeks anyway
now I only used it for a few seconds a
couple minutes at most and I found that
the keys were pretty responsive it is a
little bit interesting of a design it
definitely feels a little different
because the case extends beyond the
bottom of the phone and even the keys on
the side extend a little bit beyond the
side of the phone although it was
responsive I found that I wasn't very
accurate typing but this is something
that I assume
you or me or anybody else would grow
used to overtime as they start using the
phone one thing you might be wondering
is how you actually navigate on the
phone if you've got this bulky keyboard
here on the bottom that's blocking the
HOME key it's actually key right here
that you can press gets you to sort of a
modified view you can get into the
folders this way and navigate as usual
or when you're done typing you can of
course take off the cave I'm not sure
how and I want to slide the case on and
off again but it is an option for people
who just really can't live without their
physical QWERTY keyboard we see that
I've helped cos all for taking and look
it's a typo case here at CES you find
out about everything else we've covered
here at the show at pinis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
