demuro with cnet TV in New York City and
this is the Q Week in Review we're
taking a look at what made tech news for
the fourth week of april two thousand
seven but first let's start you off with
a little eye candy 100 pictures taken on
a cell phone camera making their debut
at a gallery in Los Angeles Patrice elmi
took the pictures using only pure
glowing color from early morning
sunlight or Twilight's views from a Cell
runs through mid-may wow that is so much
better than I've ever been able to do
with my measly megapixel well you won't
even find a camera on the new blackberry
rim announced this week but business
travelers will be happy roaming overseas
has long been a problem for Verizon and
Sprint customers since their phones use
cdma technology which is primarily used
in north america while gsm is favored in
much of the world the new blackberry
8830 world edition combines the two so
customers no longer have to rent a phone
or go without service overseas
installing that killer home theater
system with speakers everywhere makes
the movie experience awesome cut wires
not so much now one company has a
solution just paint over them flat wire
substitute for your regular cables but
hiding them is easy stick them to the
wall cover with concealer sand the edges
and paint you can even cover them with
wallpaper the paper thin wires work with
lights audio video voice and data the
secret is in the paper thin copper
conductors major web portals this week
announcing big plans to help bring
democracy online yahoo the huffington
post and slate will host to online only
presidential debates during the 2008
campaign viewers will get to ask
questions in real time and even vote on
which candidate is giving the best
performance candidates can participate
in the webcast from wherever they want
meanwhile myspace and producer Mark
Burnett teaming up to produce a TV show
search for an independent presidential
candidate the winner will get a million
bucks they have to spend in a political
way well here's a guy who could be a
shoo-in he's already got the video and
now he has the fame all this for posting
his phone number on YouTube unemployed
20 year old ryan fitzgerald from
southbridge
decided to put his digits online not for
dating but for talking his video
inviting the world to call him rang up a
storm not only running up tons of
minutes but getting him face time on
major TV shows and in newspapers
everywhere sorry got thousands of views
on YouTube but I want to see a cell
phone bill that should be his next video
remember cnet TV is your source for tons
of tech videos and where you can catch
the queue all week long I'm rich demuro
New York City don't say I didn't tell
you so for more video like this go to
