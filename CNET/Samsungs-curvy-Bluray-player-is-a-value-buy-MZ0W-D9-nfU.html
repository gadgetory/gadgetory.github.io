Samsung bdj 5900 at about $100 is a bit
of a no-brainer out of an image quality
that is almost indistinguishable from a
high-end player excellent loading speed
and a friendly user interface but it has
a lot of competition and there's also
some things that could do better
for instance the design is just odd sure
it's got to have the Samsung curve but
why does it have to look like corduroy
pants there's also no display on the
unit and not even a light to tell you if
it's on or not connectivity is pretty
standard with HDMI coaxial digital
Ethernet and Wi-Fi as a 1080p blu-ray
player it will also play 3d discs and
load them really quickly in fact it's
one of the fastest I've seen from ofto
playing a movie in six seconds it also
offers a decent selection of apps
including YouTube Netflix Amazon and
Hulu and responsiveness is good for a
blu-ray player even though a Roku 3 will
perform better and have a better
selection the only thing that gives me
pause in wholeheartedly recommending
this player is that the Sony BDP S 5500
is better it's the same price and offers
better features such as PlayStation
games streaming well you could wait for
4k blu-ray to appear at the end of 2015
it's going to be really expensive and
its catalogue will probably never match
that of 1080p discs at $99 you really
can't go wrong with the Samsung J 5900
and you can always pick up a fork a
model when the number of discs starts to
pick up later in 2016 this has been ty
