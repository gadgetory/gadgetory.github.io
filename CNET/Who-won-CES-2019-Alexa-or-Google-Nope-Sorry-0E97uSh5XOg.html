CES edition of nope sorry the debate
show where I Jeff Bakalar argue with my
friends and colleagues over three rounds
of dead serious debate and discourse you
got that I'm ready
joining us today on the show is the one
and only Clair Reilly from CNN Australia
hello Claire hello thank you so much for
being here did you almost try an
Australian accent no you I told you
before I'm only good at English ones not
Australian ones thank you for
embarrassing I will test that out later
so here's how the show works Claire and
I will receive a topic and we're gonna
have 90 seconds to hash it out at the
end of the round will be awarded a total
of five points between us depending on
how well we made our case assigning
those points will be our judge for the
judge for today
Lexie CBDs Lexie thank you so much for
judging us very welcome I feel like I
need to say g'day to like round out the
Australian contingent here so I'm so I'm
the only one who doesn't have an accent
that's fine all right Claire and I
flipped a coin backstage remember that
it was great I'm gonna be going first
and rounds one and three
Lexie let's get to the first topic what
is it
all right for round one the CES has
become the battleground for Amazon Alexa
and Google assistant but only one can
reign supreme so who won CES Alexa or
the Google assistant you have 90 seconds
on the clock card okay I'm gonna say
that Alexa won CES it's it's the
underdog for sure but one they're giving
out bananas and that's a that's a point
my column I also think I'm very much
ingrained into the Amazon ecosystem I
buy everything I've ever owned on Amazon
I'm invested in it I like to know that
Alexa I can take some comfort in knowing
that that technology will sort of lean
to what I'm purchasing I don't have that
come with Google and
you know look up I think I like Alexis
voice better there I said it
it's controversial alright what do you
would Ethan alright okay you're wrong
okay
first of all I don't need bananas I
brought my own
oh no no shoes second of all have you
seen the it's a small world ride yeah
okay
I don't need three banana when I can go
on a simulation of a Disney ride that
probably knows all of my personal data
and history is tapped into my phone and
I I don't believe that Alexa vs. Google
Alexa is really gonna win also in
Australia Amazon has only just arrived
so we haven't had the Amazon Prime
two-day delivery hook it to my veins in
three hours we are only just starting to
get that so everyone everyone keeps
saying that Alexa and Google have it in
both of their products so that's good
for consumers Lexi what what do you
think that was a tough one I Jeff I
really loved the banana point because
you know who doesn't love a free banana
however at the Google stand they're
giving out like Google home minis and
you know fanny packs free things really
but a more valuable than a banana I
would say probably more than about 19
cents not as nourishing not as
nourishing no you don't feel as good
afterwards but free swag is free swag
Claire I really liked your point about
how obviously these assistants like
coming to Australia I know the pain
points that we don't get that technology
as fast as we do here in the US so I
think for this one I'm going to Claire
three points Jeff - well done she left
for Amazon that is what you say yeah
okay alright alright fine I know that
this is a confusing process for you that
I'm winning but it's we've got 66% of
the show left just watch it Claire all
right round two
Lexie take it away alright so round two
we know here at CES a lot of tech is so
over the top and luxury and luxurious
trash I want to say I mean it's just so
opulent it's crazy but which
self-indulgent product
is more badass bells helicopter drone
taxi or fury own designs luxuries smart
yacht
also called the Adonis 90 seconds on the
clock go the helicopter first of all
it's a bell helicopter why people
haven't been calling this the belly
copter blows my mind it's electric
vertical takeoff and landing so it can
fly up in the air turn its propellers
and move forward these things are the
way of the future you're gonna have
nodes all over the city that let you hop
skip and jump it's gonna be a moti
multimodal transport system also you're
in a boat man I can fly over you and use
my I don't know rich person missiles to
blow up your boat I assume that's where
how the futures gonna work right rich
person missiles I believe that evie tall
vertical takeoff and landing it's the
future we're not gonna you can't use
cars anymore it's not a militarized
drone oh okay fine if you are confident
in flying around in a self drawing drive
a flying taxi drone I absolutely am all
the best luck to you if my smart yacht
stops being a smart yeah it's still a
boat and I'm still gonna be okay in the
water I'm not gonna fall out of the sky
into a fiery death what happens when you
reach the shore though you're always
gonna need an inlet or fjord look all I
gotta say is this smart yachts you're
away from people you don't have to worry
about dealing with other sort of like
there's a lot of air traffic you're
gonna have to compete with a lot of
other drones in this future where we're
having delivery drones and self traffic
look you're on the high seas by yourself
there's something soothing about that
plus to live that life of what it's
definitely a more luxurious experience
smart yachts might drop Lexi nicely done
do you Clare I really love your point
about just being able to cruise over the
top of everything avoid all that traffic
but Jeff
I appreciate your points about the fact
that this is technology you can get now
you can get this yacht now I mean you
can't technically buy it but if you have
enough money I think you can where is
flying to cars and flying taxis like
that is still several years away and who
knows if that's ever going to become
reality anyway and also Jeff you forgot
to say I'm on a boat because
what you do when you're on a smile what
are these points you get points for that
three points to Jeff two points Wow okay
it's five five neck and neck this is the
final round I didn't know the scene at
stage would be so thrilling today Jeff
if well that's what this show brings yep
thank you for recognizing that Lexie
final round the tiebreaker what is the
topic please alright the final round
number three to break the tie each year
the CNET crew comes to las vegas to
cover CES and some of us are here for
more than a week and we are dried up
like old prints because of it this is
more of a question of which hotel is
your spirit animal maybe it's the
Flamingo because you're fabulous
but while this might be a night where
scenario what's hotel would you choose
to live in forever 90 seconds on the
clock guard okay I'm gonna choose Circus
Circus
okay I know I'll have you know Claire
that Circus Circus is an
underappreciated gem everyone knows it
what other hotel on the strip has
comically low ceilings like Circus
Circus and the best thing about Circus
is are like oh this one Circus is not
enough we got it we got a double up it's
so good we named it we got a dude circus
twice what other hotel has the has the
charisma to do that kind of thing oh
that's amazing and one more thing Claire
everyone in Las Vegas will tell you this
it's true all the locals will tell you
this Circus Circus
shada Li has the best steakhouse in yeah
we'll say Nevada okay hey yes people
clapping and I'll have you know it's
called the steak house oh wow okay well
if that's the sign of the creativity
that you can expect it's slums Ville
Circus Circus I'm gonna say the El
Cortez Hotel it has been open since 1941
it used to be owned by Bugsy Siegel they
have an Elvis impersonator there that is
so hard to beat you're not gonna find
anything better on Fremont Street why
are you down on the strip you got to be
on Fremont Street where everyone's old
you find dollar slots
I just want to live my best life with a
perm dark sunglasses a cigarette and
just yelling at people across the bar
like get me another drink that is my
you check why do you want that because
that is that's my spirit enemies so move
to Florida no I'm gonna be living in the
El Cortez all right I like that
Lexie who won the game oh this is a
tough one because I love both of your
points Jeff I emphasize those short
ceilings I'm tall but I kind of have a
soft spot for sort of distraught
ceilings I don't know why it makes me
feel claustrophobic and I hate it but I
love it at the same time so I appreciate
that Claire you need to do marketing for
the El Cortez because that was a hundred
percent I'm just like I learned some
history I learn exactly what I can do
there and now I just want to go out and
buy a gold gown and just you know rock
out all night that I got one you can
borrow don't worry oh this is a tough
one
I think Claire just takes it with three
Jeff - I'm sorry it's good it was
amazing amazing debate from both of you
all right
my private suite yeah I will smoke a
carton of cigarettes oh yeah we always
have a winner what did claire win it's
coming in hot whoa oh you wanna rap a
backstage this looks like a beautiful
medley of chicken Caesars there you go
you must eat it all in one bite this is
been great even though I lost it's been
a pleasure
