with the new products that launched at
i/o 2016 home versus echo the first
product caught in the crossfire will be
the echo google even referenced it
during the keynote giving Amazon due
credit for making home hubs popular air
freshener jokes aside Google's home is
shaping up to be a worthy rival of the
echo there's deeper search integration
and the ability to communicate with dumb
devices like an old TV or stereo via
chromecast a low vs. messenger next up
messaging Google wants you to ditch
Facebook's messenger in whatsapp in
favor of a low like whatsapp a low is
tied to your phone number and not your
Google account with some of the same
advanced features of messenger stickers
photo doodles app integration and a
digital assistant what's cool or creepy
about a low is its built-in assistant
will offer up canned responses based on
your conversation history or contextual
information right in your chat box duo
versus FaceTime duo is a video chat app
completely independent of a low for
Android and iOS like FaceTime it has a
clean interface showing you a full
screen video of the caller on the other
end but it's reportedly faster and will
cut out even on a spotty connection oh
yeah and it has knock-knock which may be
more of a drawback than a plus it lets
you see live video of the caller before
you even answer Google assistant versus
Siri Cortana and Alexa and then there's
the brains behind all these devices
Google's own gender-neutral assistant
will provide a more personalized
experience across all your devices the
more you use it the smarter it gets
starting right on your search bar while
other virtual assistants may only
display search results google's
assistant will be able to give you a
contextual response to a query and
engage in a full conversation daydream
vs oculus both our VR platforms that can
be integrated into third-party hardware
everything from Google daydreams home
interface to the headset and controller
is reminiscent of what we've already
seen from oculus like oculus on the gear
VR daydream is mobile based meaning
you'll need a VR ready phone to run the
platform the experience on a phone may
not live up to the full inversion of a
pc-based rift but we won't really know
until we strap
the headset his fall</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
