convertible 13-inch laptop that also
folds over into a tablet so what there
are a lot of those out there from the
Dell XPS 13 2 &amp;amp; 1/2 the HP spectre x360
2 Microsoft Surface pro but a couple of
things help the Zenbook flip standout
first it's very thin and just under 11
millimeters and this is one of the only
laptops that comes with a big 512
gigabyte solid state hard drive by
default it's also got a cool blue design
more important than that however a Seuss
throws a bunch of useful stuff in the
box that most other PC makers are going
to charge you extra for there's an
active stylus by a surface from
Microsoft and that's next 100 bucks it's
not the greatest pen the on screen
experience I've ever had but it's fine
for basic sketching or note-taking like
a lot of current super slim laptops the
Zen book only has USB C ports for data
power and accessories a good thing
there's a USB C hub included in the box
by a macbook and Apple will sell you
something very similar for about $80
finally while it's off the most exciting
packing ever there's a decent-looking
carry sleeve in the box as well
freebies aside this is a middle of the
pack 13-inch hybrid most notable for
being pretty thin and for packing in a
core i7 cpu and a big hard drive at a
decent price but in a world where the
little things we used to take for
granted from check airline baggage to a
tablet stylus are more often than not
sold separately as an extra cash grab
it's nice to see a laptop that includes
more than the bare minimum</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
