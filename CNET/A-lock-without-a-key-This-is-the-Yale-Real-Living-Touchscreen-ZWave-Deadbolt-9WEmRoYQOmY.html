here at the Yale real living touchscreen
z-wave deadbolt now this is a lock you
can put in your door and control from
your phone or from a computer if you
have the right home automation software
it also has this great touchscreen so if
you touch it with multiple fingers here
you can lock it and then put a code in
to unlock it you can program it to have
multiple codes you can do a lot of cool
things with it that you can't do with
the standard deadbolt now if you take a
look at this specific display model that
I've got here you'll see that there is
no place to put a key and you can
actually get this deadbolt like this
with no key cylinder you can't pick that
lock you can't bump that lock there's no
way to open it with a key you can also
get in a standard format that does have
a cylinder for a key and I think I
prefer that when the batteries die I
want to be able to get in still if you
really want to take advantage of the
full functionality of this lock you'll
need to hook it up with a home
automation network and this could be
anything from me casaverde to control 4
to the new revolve hub and it will work
with a lot of them make sure it's
compatible with what you've got before
you buy because it is an expensive lock
it costs two hundred forty-four bucks on
Amazon right now it also comes in a
ZigBee model that uses ZigBee instead of
z-wave so if you have a ZigBee system
this will still work if you get the
right kind
Gayle's touchscreen deadbolt compares
nicely to the chalet Camelot touchscreen
deadbolt as well as the Kwikset
SmartCode deadbolt those are both a
little less expensive however quick-set
doesn't have a touch screen and the
chalet model has to come with nexia
which is a separate bridge and a monthly
fee to unlock its best features so given
that you can use this with a lot of fee
free home automation networks I think
that it's a great lock one thing I
didn't like about this lock is that it
lacks the ability to create temporary
codes that expire at a certain time so
if you have a pet sitter or a work
utility person coming in and you just
want to give them a code that will work
on a Friday or work once you can't do
that with this lock you can make them a
code and then delete it yourself but if
you want that to automatically happen
it's not going to work that's something
that the Camelot touchscreen deadbolt
can do that I liked a lot that this lock
can't do overall this is a solid and
reliable lock that's easy to set up easy
to program
and I think that if you're interested in
home automation and you're interested in
a lock you can control remotely it's a
very appealing option so check it out
