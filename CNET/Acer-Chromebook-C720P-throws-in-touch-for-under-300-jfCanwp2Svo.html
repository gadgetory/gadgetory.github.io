acceptor this is a new thing for me what
you know Chromebooks have been out there
for a while and their value proposition
really depends on whether you believe
that computers are transforming into
more tablet e mobile devices you don't
have to power use quite the same way
it's more about web browsing and Chrome
OS is really just a very smart web
browser that has additional features
that work offline plus it runs apps but
those apps are basically also like web
pages they're not really downloaded and
and so it's really kind of like a very
smart browser it all comes down to the
price and the features well the acer
chromebook c720 p is probably my
favorite chromebook that i've seen why
well it has a touch screen right here do
you need a touch screen on a Chromebook
what would the point of that be well
there are only been a few Chromebooks
that I even have touchscreens the
Chromebook pixel which is over a
thousand dollars was the prime example
but usually a lot of these have been
like netbooks really low n processors
basic on-board storage doesn't really do
much and costs about two hundred dollars
ish in that range about what you would
pay for a netbook in the past and why
would you do that if the battery life
and the performance weren't up to par
well the c720p had about six hours of
battery life in our test which is good
and what you'd expect it also has 34
gigs of on-board storage which is double
what you previously got which is about
16 plus the Scott all the ports you're
looking for it's got USB to USB 3 it
also has hdmi and it has an SD card slot
the SD card slot is what it's all about
because you can pop in one and for not a
lot of money you can expand your storage
not that you'd necessarily need it much
because Google Drive is getting much
better at cloud storage management and
you get a hundred gigs for two years
with the purchase of this and it's
really easy to find cheap cloud storage
now in a lot of places so you can use
google drive and it feels like a natural
extension of your onboard storage but
that brings up the point that a
Chromebook still is best used when
connected on line it's got 802 11 n
Wi-Fi
you know there are times you may not be
online this cash is for offline use but
I wouldn't trust that in the same way
that I would with a tablet or with an
offline laptop but if you're looking for
something this is 299 with a touch
screen and you'll hear assigning that
price that can be a household laptop
like device that allows you to basically
do everything you'd want to do and have
touch for when you need it may be for
apps maybe just because you like the
feeling of browsing like that for future
evolving and chrome and you're not
paying up too much for it that's why I
like the 720p it's not a game changer
but it's probably the best full-featured
Chromebook that feels good to type on
that I've seen I'm Scott Stein and
that's the acer c720p chromebook pretty
good value pic in a relatively full
feature of Chromebook</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
