taking another one of your emails about
high-tech cars and modern driving this
one comes in from dr. Ron in Reno Nevada
who says some of us like to add
equipment to our cars that the
manufacturer only offered on a more
expensive model or not at all
case in point he says I put vmw zone
night-vision system into his 2016 328i
sports wagon that's a model that doesn't
offer BMW night vision pretty creative
he says he used an independent shop
after the dealer said they wouldn't do
it and told him it would void his
warranty he says I did it was sacrificed
my cupholders to make room for the LCD
screen you can see some of those photos
there where he put the screen and where
he put the front sensor he says could
you explain to your audience how the
1975 Moss Magnuson warranty act affects
consumers who choose to add options or
obtain service not approved or provided
by the manufacturer interesting topic
Ron this is so big and weighty I'm
actually gonna do a whole car tech 101
on it in our next episode episode 84 the
meantime let me give you a couple of
quick pointers here on the three
entities that have something to say
about this first of all as you mentioned
the Magnussen Moss Warranty Act of 1975
this one's enforced by the FTC the
Federal Trade Commission here in the US
what Magnussen law says is you don't
have to use factory parts and you don't
have to go to the dealer to get your
work done to keep your car in warranty
the caveat to that is if you go use
aftermarket parts that are crap or go to
a lousy independent shop and either of
those cause damage to the car that is
not under warranty the next one I want
to tell you about is what's called CPE
Insurance this is customer provided
equipment it's an insurance industry
term you are insured in your insurance
policy for the stuff that the factory
put on the car if you go and say add a
fancy tire and wheel package to your car
or put on a completely cool stainless
aftermarket exhaust and that gets
damaged in a collision it may not be
covered the insurance strictly covers
what was put there by the factory for
the most part anything substantial
beyond that may not be in your coverage
you got to look for the CPE language in
your policy and/or see if your insurer
requires you to take out a separate CPE
writer to cover the specific things
you've added it's kind of like adding
jewelry to your home insurance policy
you know that works you got
sometimes do declared a special coverage
above and beyond the basics and the
third and final one here is a more of an
outlier but becoming a big topic lately
and that is the DMCA the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act which has
lately been interpreted to say if you go
into a car and change its firmware its
software that lives on chips you are in
theory breaking the DMCA you're breaking
a copyright law that says you can't
reverse engineer or hack into that kind
of technology that intellectual property
which the car maker has burned into the
chips in your car the most recent
interpretations though are saying you
have the right to at least go into the
firmware to diagnose a car and work in
the code of the vehicle you don't have
to stay out of there and leave it to the
dealer but a lot of the stuff is being
tested and figured out right now we'll
talk more about it in car tech 101-80
