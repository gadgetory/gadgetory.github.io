and it's one of the new cards it's I
think it's a discovery you have a boob
wizard and listen to its secrets and
there's a girl he's there's a little
wizard popping out of her boobs like
whispering secrets into her ear play
hard you get to see the future and like
you look at the cards so currently new
Blizzard is my in my favorite actually
can I go back to what you're talking
about earlier the some of the disk kind
of discarded ideas just - yeah just
actually there was one last night I was
drawing and I haven't sent it to the
guys yet I don't think it's I don't know
it's we've an infinity boner which is
the most sacred of all boners and
there's a guy I just leave his penis
into a circle late and he's like flexing
and I'm kind of looking at it like as a
cartoonist going I don't know if the
world is ready for infinity boners so I
imagine that one will probably get shut
down what is in the not-safe-for-work
pack is there a few hints that you could
give us on that one it's just a lot more
like boners definitely there's lots of
breasts there's dragons with large
breasts lots of boob dragons flying
right it's mostly they're not actually
all not-safe-for-work they're just they
can't be played by little kids because
sometimes there's cussing or viscera or
yeah the jokes are a little bit rougher
like butts and hair and back hair and
stuff like that so it was our way of
kind of separating the really kind of
Rocchi humor from the stuff you could
play with your kids</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
