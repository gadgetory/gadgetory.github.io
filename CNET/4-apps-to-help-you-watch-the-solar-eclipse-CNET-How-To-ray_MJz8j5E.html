redshift provides a simulation of the
solar eclipse from four different
perspectives a view from the Sun the
best location your current location and
a map view the simulation can help give
you a better idea of what to look for
during the solar eclipse as well as
whether it might be worth it to make the
trek to the path of totality
you can also tinker with an eclipse
calendar that will play simulations of
past and future eclipses if you're not
near the path of totality you'll still
be able to view a partial solar eclipse
from your location but you can also view
NASA's livestream of the total eclipse
from your phone with the Smithsonian
Eclipse 2017 app this app will tell you
the percentage of obscuration of the
eclipse from your location the weather
forecast for the afternoon and it
provides an interactive map showing the
path of totality on this interactive map
you can tap around and drop a pin and
see the event calendar for the Eclipse
for that location as well as some
simulations Exploratorium total solar
eclipse will also provide live streams
of the Eclipse one with commentary from
Exploratorium educators and NASA
scientists one hosted by Exploratorium
educators in Spanish two non narrated

from the Kronos Quartet in the total
solar eclipse app you will also find
reading and informational videos on
eclipses and it gives you the option to
quickly add the eclipses as an event to
your calendar if you plan to be within
the path of totality one of the most
helpful apps will be the solar eclipse
timer app it's not pretty but it will
walk you through the different phases of
a total eclipse with audible cues and
countdown timers for the four different
contact points just open the app tap
check position then tap get my location
using your GPS coordinates it will load
the correct times for contact points
estimate the totality duration and walk
you through the Eclipse if you only plan
to view a partial solar eclipse solar
