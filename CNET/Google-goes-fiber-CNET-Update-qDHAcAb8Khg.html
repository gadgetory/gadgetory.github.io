on Apple I'm Jeff Bakalar filling in
once again for Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update google has launched a
fiber TV and internet service in Kansas
City as part of a beta test the service
provides customers with one gigabit per
second broadband speed and fiber
television that uses an interactive
interface now you might not get all of
your favorite channels with the service
but Google is trying to show the cable
providers of the world that this is how
content should be delivered google hopes
that the technology sparks the interest
of other companies who are using older
communication mediums those who sign up
for this service though will receive one
terabyte of google drive storage DVR
that can record up to eight shows at
once and hold 500 hours of programming
all this starts at one hundred and
twenty dollars and that is a lot less
than what I am paying right now it
doesn't end there with the google news
though the latest iOS version of Google
Earth is upon us and it features an
insane level of 3d maps detail for some
of the major cities around the world
though only newer iOS devices will be
able to handle the 3d features if you
are using Twitter you might have noticed
a brief outage on Thursday the service
went down inexplicably but early reports
are coming in and they are confirming
that the world did in fact continue to
spin Samsung has doubled up on Apple
selling more than twice the amount of
devices during q2 and of course it's no
secret that this can be attributed to
Samsung the very popular galaxy s3 phone
and of course the calm before the iphone
5 storm but it's worth noting that HTC
Motorola and rim combined only barely
exceeded iphone sales during the same
period of time web to TV streamer Roku
has successfully ended a round of fund
raising raising 45 million dollars
through News Corp and british sky
broadcasting of course it's logical to
assume the sources funding this will
influence the content available on roku
products but there's no word yet on how
that's going to play out ebays
president of global markets Devin wenig
said that the company plans on allowing
children under the age of 18 to create
ebay accounts and begin participating in
certain auctions weinig reassured us
that eBay wouldn't just be giving
teenagers unadulterated access to the
site thankfully and will require all
such accounts to be approved and
monitored by a parent this has been your
update for what's going on in the world
of tech today for more on the stories
