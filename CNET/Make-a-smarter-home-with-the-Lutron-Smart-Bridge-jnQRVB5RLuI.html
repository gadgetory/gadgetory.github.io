we are taking a look at Lutron's new
solution it's called the caseta wireless
system essentially what this does is
talk to different devices in your house
so you can have shades you can have
lights all of that controlled by an
application on your iPad or your smart
phone and you can have it scheduled when
lights come on when like shades go up
and down you can also control these
devices manually and the whole system
let's get started for under $300 now
using the app you can set up different
little schemes or themes or you know
different scenarios to quickly control
and set different devices around your
house so you can say set up your house
or your room to lower the shades for you
know dimming the lights or just closing
the light coming into the room so you
can watch a movie you can have that set
to movie mode you can also have things
set on a timer so that you know the
lights will come on when you get home
around that time or you know turn on as
well you can also schedule your shades
and lights and other devices to turn on
and off when you want them so you can
have your lights and your shades come up
or down in the morning or at night you
know depending on how you tend to use
your house so also included with the kit
you get these little miniature remote
controls are called Pico remotes and
these let you control your shades your
lights physically without having to use
the app that way you can always have
your devices work when you want them no
need to go through your smartphone or
iPad settings so also part of the Lutron
caseta wireless system is support for
LED light bulbs you can attach them to
dimmers so you don't worry about using
different bulbs that are not compatible
you can also have control over your
thermostat so you can control the heat
in your house and you also have lots of
security features built in you can have
say your house shut itself off when all
the phones in your house leave a certain
area so that you never worried that you
know well did I lock a door did I you
know just walk out and left heat on left
all this stuff going on at your house so
that's pretty you know useful feature
especially if you go on vacation or even
just run down the street and you know
out for dinner what makes a lot of the
wizardry possible behind the caseta
wireless system is the wireless bridge
this little box here communicates
wirelessly to your Wi-Fi router it then
communicates to your different devices
that are connected so that you can
control all of your shades or lights via
an application now this unit by itself
costs 149 but it also comes in the whole
kit that you can buy so they're having
folks we just took a first look at the
blue Tron caseta wireless system
