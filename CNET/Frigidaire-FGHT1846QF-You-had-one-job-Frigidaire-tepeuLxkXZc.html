refrigerator but before I do I want to
say a couple of nice things about it
because there are things I like about it
it's a pretty basic looking average size
top freezer fridge with eighteen point
three cubic feet of storage space
fourteen point two of which are in the
fridge that's not a huge number in and
of itself but Frigidaire did a nice job
of helping you get the most out of that
storage space with a thoughtfully
designed interior that's filled with
features you don't usually find in top
freezers there's a shelf that slides in
and folds out of the way there are
custom flex storage bins here in the
drawers that you can switch out with
things like canned dispensers and water
bottle holders you've got this pantry
drawer that runs the width of the fridge
there's also a smudge-proof stainless
steel finish here on the exterior of the
fridge it's one of my favorite features
that Frigidaire offers because it's very
good at repelling finger prints it's
finely contoured and doesn't leave
streaks quite so easily that problem
here is performance if you take a look
at this heat map you can see it's orange
orange orange orange orange all over the
fridge all over the door that means it's
hot it's over 40 degrees that's not what
you want that's a food safety benchmark
from the FDA if you like our fridges to
come in under that number this fridge
doesn't it's just a warmer fridge than
I'd be comfortable with in my kitchen so
I say skip it even though those features
are pretty interesting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
