completely new design with a touchscreen
control bar above the keyboard along
with a touch ID to scan your
fingerprints this report comes from a
trusted Apple analyst in a note to
investors and the blog 9to5 mac says it
also has unnamed sources backing up
these statements if true this is the
most significant upgrade ever by Apple
for its laptops this touch oled display
is said to replace the function keys on
top so maybe it'll show different
options to touch depending on what
program you're in and that touch ID
fingerprint scanner would not just be
security for unlocking the machine but
likely also used for online shopping it
seems a bit silly to make a big deal
that a macbook could be added a small
touchscreen panel when we have all sorts
of laptops now that use touch screens
but that's Apple for you usually late to
the game but this time trying to put a
new twist on touch the design is also
said to be thinner and lighter no
surprise there right but to make it
thinner it could use one of those new
USB seaports and the keyboard would have
the same type of butterfly mechanism
keys found in the 12-inch MacBook that
they viewed last year so when will it
arrive you could likely be waiting until
the end of the year instead of July as
previously rumored Apple is having a big
event next month it's the World Wide
Developers Conference beginning june
thirteenth that's usually a time to hear
about software so don't hold your breath
expecting to see these new laptops
that's it for these tech news update I'm
