Apple Apple Apple Apple Apple Apple
Apple Apple Apple Apple Apple Apple
Apple sorry about that
I'm not okay alright surprise surprise
we've been talking about Apple again and
the iPhone the reviews are out there I
know it that I know we're talking about
Apple a lot I'm sorry if you're sick of
Apple but we got to keep doing man or
just it they complain that where I seen
it anyway just lean into it
try to get away from the Apple you not
this week not this week we're Apple to
go no I'm sorry Brian I'm so sorry
don't be alright just let me have my fun
I don't so we'll be talking about the
iPhone reviews which are I phone eight
and A+ review obviously the iPhone 10 is
still a ways off so we can only talk
about the the current flagships for
elias inflections for the next two
months yeah which we did get our hands
on so yes I haven't had the extensive
time that Scott has but he's got his
full review also our photographer James
Martin got to spend 72 hours using the
iPhone 8 plus camera
so we'll do a run-through of how well
the camera has improved over the 7 plus
a good luck prying that phone from
Scott's cold dead fingers by the way
whatever I used it extensively anyway so
as always if you have any questions live
in the comment section
Brian will pick out the best and we will
try to answer them in 3 minutes and 59
seconds from Apple Apple
welcome to the 359 I'm Roger Chang I'm
Ben Fox ribbon the reviews are out and
the iPhone 8 is nice CNET calls the
iPhone 8 plus the best iPhone goodbye
for now so that is a big question right
like are you gonna be waiting to buy
iPhone 10 later or do you want the but
iPhone 8 and 8 plus now which are
cheaper which have extensive essentially
allow the same components really the
same cameras you know it doesn't have
the big design it got wireless charging
it's got the water resistant body it's
got and it's got a whole bunch and touch
ID why didn't they call it the iPhone 7s
I feel like the name the naming doesn't
really like fit exactly they didn't
really change it all that much no
there's a lot of internal components
that you just mentioned and also the
wireless charging that does actually
justify a newer phone but at the same
time this is more the 7s and Scott Stein
in his review said as much right look
it's I think Apple is definitely
changing the rules every time they
renamed one of these filler but every
time they name a new iPhone model right
with the iPhone 7 last year
technically should have been the big
redesign there wasn't redesign but it
still called 2 7 so they figured they
got away with it last year why not just
skip the whole s thing and at least
subtly suggest at the consumer that this
is a big change and that's thus warrants
a full number changes as opposed to
adding an S to the phone and going back
to what you asked about originally at
the very least Apple is trying to get as
many people as possible to go over to
the 8 and the 8 plus there really isn't
enough supply but there is a lot of
demand for the iPhone 10 but I don't
think everybody I the the Big Apple fans
are gonna get this yes
the hardcore Apple fans look at the
iPhone 10 so that folks who are really
into tech good to the latest of grace
will get the iPhone 10 I think there are
a lot of people who have upgrades and
are just looking for a new iPhone this
might actually be a better move for them
because it's got the familiar home
button it's got touch ID people are very
used to that that
all gone like facial recognition is a
whole new thing which is gonna be on the
time right and that's it's a little bit
untested you don't have you know your
muscle memory all set with touch ID like
or like you have a touch ID so you know
for a lot of people plus the price
difference is pretty significant so I
think for a lot of people this might be
the phone I mean the big question I
really curious to see what happens on
Friday during the launch at those
flagship Apple stores if it's gonna be
just this big well they're a sea lion
my guess is no and I don't think they're
gonna be that big minds I think it's
fairly easy to get an iPhone 8 you can
pre-order online mm-hmm I mean there's
some slight delay but I want I really
wonder how many people gonna show up to
an Apple store they might just the the
employees may still go through the
motions because this is a new I like the
one guy just buy all the show for those
lines of those events and buy all the
iPhone so I'm sure there'll be people
there I just I don't think it'll be the
lines like there used to be so one of
the other aspects of these phones that I
thought was interesting especially with
the plus was the the cameras yes James
Martin our senior photographer out in
San Francisco talked about he spent 72
hours with this camera I reading over
the story I was actually quite impressed
and it looked as if they really
significantly pushed forward the
software yeah made the most out of that
horse it's the same hardware 12
megapixel camera but it seemed like
there's a lot of computational power
went into making these pictures you know
pop a little bit more you see better
textures the colors a lot more vibrant
exactly the low-light photos which you
know everyone always makes claims about
it seems like they were pretty legit
they looked better I think they were
still kind of gimmicky and green screen
II but at the same time if you are gonna
get excited about the new phone I think
that is an area that people could brand
the iPhone 10 the only difference is
optical image stabilization on both
lenses the dual lens I thought any plus
has essentially the same phone the same
camera with optical image stabilization
on just the one main lens right so
alright that's all the time we have for
more on these stories check us out at
seen it I'm Roger Chang I'm Ben Fox
Ruben thanks for the singing
so before we jump back into the chat and
take our current questions I wanted to
revisit our topic from yesterday okay we
farmed out the question what would you
sacrifice for the iPhone 10 so I got I
got a list of some of my favorites here
yeah from our comments I'm not gonna I'm
not gonna put names to these but College
make sense yeah crunchyroll wait is that
a sushi you bet to the video streaming
service oh okay so right on I was with
Netflix but a little more niche and I
would not give that up
kidneys oh okay you said two kidneys
kidneys yeah you could live with them
hot but give it away to have time to
upgrade continuing on firstborn I would
have expected that yeah my ex well
that's not really a big sacrifice right
my Tesla but Wow you know a few phones
you could buy with a Tesla less now and
finally your souls yeah yeah yeah would
you agree to a signed contract to give
away your soul for an iPhone 10 give me
that soul to let's say like like a
friend of yours not Apple it was Apple
that would that would mess with your
objectivity buddy
yeah but he would own your soul
contractually speaking oh I'm not really
religious or into like the afterlife but
still kinda gives me the heebie-jeebies
I know I know I would not think I could
do it I wouldn't do it it's just that's
just me alright let's start taking some
questions from today Jesse gateman our
buddy yeah hey Jesse what what time can
we expect iOS 11 update today for those
of us who can't afford a new iphone
right now the free software is all we
can look forward to
we don't know for sure it's a couple
hours but it will be sometime soon see
never give a concrete answer right it
just kind of happens I would think
traditionally it's happening around our
time yeah yeah yeah noon eastern yeah
right
I wonder how many people are going to
actually jump the ship and get both
phones if there is there anybody out
there who would get an some version of
the eight and turn around and get a 10
very doubtful is it like after they get
the 10 they flip the iPhone 8 both
somebody that obsessed I'm looking for
that sure there are obsessed people who
buy everything but yeah you would keep
the iPhone aid back home to keep your
home by the way I know I know i OS love
it's coming out I would strongly advise
unless you've got like a spare phone as
Brian was saying but strongly advise
against downloading iOS 11 quickly it's
a little few bugs that pop up at least
the first two hours first day I never
ever get it I'd wait for it to clear up
a little bit yeah I think was two or
three years ago when one of the iOS
updates basically bricked your phone yep
let the diehards fall on their sword you
know yeah always trust them common asks
when will the iPhone 10 be available for
pre-order we've got to pull up our story
good question we just didn't have that
information fourth is the actual release
date I'm gonna find it just will get get
to the next question and I'll answer it
before then Elite Brian gaming says why
does the iPhone 8 exist that's a great
question I would say I thought it exists
because there needs to be a lower end
option or a mass-market option for a lot
of people
I thought 8 is the affordable option I
would argue iPhone 8 plus may have less
room because it's really kind of in the
middle there and it's sort of in my mind
I feel like Apple probably wants the
iPhone tend to be the iPhone the iPhone
E Plus but it's just which might be the
case in future you know that's a good
one gets the pull when they get in a
supply of certain components but I've
been a plus
because they needed a bigger phone and
they needed a bigger phone that could
sell lots of that's the eighth plus the
iPhone 10 is gonna be supply constraint
for a while so yeah largely because of
the OLED screen from from what I we've
read from the roads yeah from from the
rumors the Samsung is going to be
supplying most of the OLED screens which
is a big problem because they're also
apples tree chief rival in smartphones
and also it's just a matter of
production I think they just can't make
enough right and if your Samsung you're
gonna give Apple your your the other
OLED screens you're always gonna supply
your etic your own smart they always say
that though they they try to treat both
customers the same but you know you're
your own customers right like Samsung is
treating its own so going back to the
previous question this is my story from
like the actual launch the iPhone 10
starts at $9.99 don't forget that for
the sixth gig version 64 gig 64 gig
thank you very much pre-orders start
October 27th and the phone ships or is
at least scheduled to ship November 3rd
I know I might be completely wrong but
early November at the very least hope
you're not wrong is ringing it off story
[Laughter]
all right back into the question lashes
Jarrett topping asks how did the new
speakers on the iPhone 8 an A+ sound we
don't have a great answer for that right
now let's suggest you come back tomorrow
when we get Scott Stein in there anyway
let's not promise it that's true hoping
he gets he's the guy who's really spent
the most time and Scott should be able
to bring the phone if he comes he'll
have the phone with them Ricky Dicky
Show like the 359 it's fairly low yeah
well we'll try to get him over here will
will entice him with cheese doodles or
Doritos or sure here we go we got a
question from Carlos he says I am blind
and I can't since I can't see it I was
wondering how do you lock or power off
the phone the iPhone 8 or the iPhone 10
I'm assuming all of the above sense
there still
side button that you can lock the phone
with correct relating to the iPhone 10
well both yeah yeah yeah there's a side
button for both that you can lock for
folks with disabilities are probably not
going to notice a significant difference
between the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 8
because they're physically largely the
same phone and locking and unlocking it
are going to be the same with the iPhone
10 especially with the face ID yeah I
don't know like that that might create
some additional complication normal yeah
I guess I don't know I know like apples
really done a lot of work to make like
voice commands yeah accessible for the
accessibility how I guess accessibility
friendly it is I imagine it is because
they've made a big deal of it in the
past but we don't know yet because we
just haven't had enough time what the
thought yeah thanks for the question by
the way fantastic question it's Apple
didn't really give much information on
further tech enable type now probably
and they have talked about it on stage
not this year not with this phone they
had a lot to talk about with that phone
so I mean I could see why they didn't go
into all the gritty details of the
iPhone 10 will get more once we get time
with the phone which we don't have I
think we'll be able to better answer
your question but right now it's just we
just sort of had the bare minimum yeah
G - asks will the wireless charger come
with the iPhone 10 nope why would why
would Apple pass up on the opportunity
to sell you another accessory right
right
yeah look it does still have the
Lightning port and a lightning cable has
that so you still have your regular
chart but you do it to buy a wireless
charging pack but then they become
normal see though as they profess away
from wired charging do you think
somewhere down the line that'll be part
of the buy only do it if they ever
started invading headphones if they
remove the Lightning port I think they'd
have to obviously include a while that's
years from now yeah if they ever do it
you know but it's important to like the
other boot makers don't include wireless
chargers either and no much
expensive than just a cord that's that's
because it's a core pad and it's a newer
technology so I'm sure it's a Matthew -
your point sizes up the 359 is
rinky-dink not to your fans a I pimp
what differences is there a name a 11
Bionic chip set for the example
Samsung's newer phones chipset well the
a lovin Bionic is custom made by Apple
so I think it's a 10 nanometer along
with the snapdragon 35 basically it's
custom it's a custom tuned engine to run
your iPhone as it goes to Samsung which
uses a stock engine which admittedly is
a very powerful strong engine yeah but
like it runs other phones so it's it's
may not be as fully suited to Samsung as
say the a 11 Bionic is to the iPhone for
regular users regularly I would say
you're not going to notice the
difference like Qualcomm does know how
to make chips oh yeah totally and the
thing the thing with the and this is
another thing that regular users aren't
going to notice but Apple has like a
separate processor and broadband chip
whereas if you're gonna have the 835
from Qualcomm it's a system it's it's
it's a system on a chip so you have them
both together which could potentially
create improved computational power
right and theoretically more power
efficient see more power efficiency yeah
because because theoretically Qualcomm
has physically made like the broadband
chip and the processor work in sync
together right maybe better than you
know Apple having two separate chips
true yeah I mean that's why the Galaxy
Note 8 uses a smaller battery than the
earlier model but still has the same
punch same battery life lifespan yeah
yeah we've got a ton of great questions
coming and we're trying to get to as
many as we possibly can we do have a
limited time James favor has got a quick
and easy one does the iPhone 8 have
Bluetooth 5.0 that's you we know that
it's in the spec page I don't believe so
I don't know if I can find while while
we're looking that up James favor asks
do you think Apple will do what Samsung
did at the moment and create types of
flagships like an S eight versus no
eight now that we've seen an eight and a
ten ie X you think they're gonna like
kind of subdivide that out mmm question
I think because they tend to launch all
their phones at one go where is Samsung
has a kind of predictable strategy or
it's like first half of the year it's
the the GS line second half it's a note
line and so Apple I think unveils all
this phone so you kind of know right off
the bat like that's the flagship of the
ten is the flagship phone and then
everything else is kind of the the
bargain or the mid tier phone but the
labs are very similar now right you've
got the GS 8 and the GS a plus which are
akin to the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 plus
and then you've got the note 8 which is
akin to the iPhone 10 so similar lineup
but this Apple kind of unloads them all
once you kind of know what the flagship
phone is whereas Samsung is like this GS
a plus is the flagship phone for the
next four or five months it comes out
with the delayed launch for the iPhone
10 I do see at least the potential for
maybe them to change it up in future
years but I totally hear what you're
saying as far as them at least
announcing all the phones at the same
time Najeeb in the chair asks what will
Apple do next year just release iPhone
x2 and lower the price so the eight I'm
really curious if iPhone 10 sticks
around if they go back to a normal
naming scheme like iPhone I think they
disagree I don't know every an iPhone 9
somewhere why would they why would they
sell an iPhone 9 I think they break down
the clay churn
I think they break down McLeish's is it
the new iPhone is it jumped iPhone 13 or
something just go to 15 by the way
anniversary this is
the reboot I think it does look like
there's Bluetooth 5.0 and and he did I
pronounce that correctly Wireless G yeah
G thank you I knew I got that wrong I
get it wrong - I still correct myself
and I have to correct I grew up on
uncomfy movies
Jarett topping why do you think the
iPhone X did not come with a higher
resolution screen I Fontana I keep doing
it I read it literally I'm sorry I'm
here it sounds cooler it does have a
higher resolution screen though it does
have a higher resolution screen Scott
mentions why not still higher oh well
also a brighter and knit screen oh I
don't I can't answer as a why Apple
decided not to make a brighter screen
I'm gonna get somebody in here and
Scobie you can mess with the brightness
of it but I mean like if you were bidden
buying Samsung and I think by LG phones
you've been getting OLED screens for
years now yeah you have to spend a
thousand dollars for the iPhone tend to
get it but they did improve the screen
to a certain extent the iPhone has an
improved iPads file true tone screen so
there you're probably gonna get some
level of improvement there wait for the
8 for the 8 yeah but it's not high
resolution no and it's not it's
basically more accurate colors mm-hmm
alright let's fire through a few quick
rapid-fire joints as iOS 11 rolls out
today do we have any concerns over older
models specifically in the chat the 6 is
a slicks 6 going experience and you slow
down with the OS update gonna get sick
they've done a good job recently with
their updates to kind of make things a
little bit better than than historical
yeah he's my personal experience I'd be
a little wary if I've got one of the
older phones I would probably wait it
out just see what the review six is two
years old I know right six three years
old oh you're right you're right you're
yeah still three year old phone like it
should be able to run the latest version
of iOS you look one might argue that
Apple is doing that kind of thing on
purpose to slow down because older
phones by
who would ever think such a thing
horrendous it's unseemly another great
question from Jesse Gabe Minh do you
think Apple will drop another color
iPhone 10 next year like they did with
the red iPhone 7
earlier this year yeah I think charity
band black yeah or silver black great
great over I got all the completely
wrong okay face cream which i think is
black and then silver which I thought
was white so I mean you were kind of
right I hope they add another color like
magenta and like very light blue I'm
going back to the what is it the 5c
colors because that was a plastic bag oh
yeah yeah yeah yeah that was wearable
yeah there was actually a question that
surfaced up on our on our review video
that I thought was kind of interesting
and I want to bring it back up for Scott
tomorrow but somebody asked why none of
the review units are in fact like the
Space Gray or anything besides the
standard black or white colors that are
floating out there well the reviews we
go we're like the gold one yeah
or the blush whatever it is yeah I mean
usually they like the Apple likes to
hand out the latest colors that's why
they don't I think there's also a
sometimes ask I don't even know how it
really works but I think for photography
just to distinguish that this is a new
phone the preference is always they use
a new color right that makes a lot of
sense yeah okay a couple more Ryan
Linder asked do you think if they figure
out the fingerprint ID under the screen
they would ditch face ID on the next
iPhone who's a why push face ID is it
because they just had to put out a new
phone oh you know there's a lot of
conspiracy theories about that I say
side it'd be easier technically than
touch ID
I like touch ID I definitely like that
idea
I like his point why why push out this
radically different thing if they're
just gonna backpedal to it later so I
don't and again that's just the
it's a little limiting to think that
this camera that they put into their
phone is just her face ID as Scots bring
up brought this point I tend to agree
that the camera is sophisticated enough
to read depth and I think next year they
may double down and we may see something
like that in the rear camera because
that stuff is really good for augmented
reality with technology they really want
to push I don't think they probably were
able to kind of fit it all in the one
phone this time around but I have to
imagine that it's not just face ID it's
for augmented reality it's for all kinds
of uses that we haven't figured out yet
so I think that's gonna stick around I
really do hope that they figure out
touch ID underneath the screen I don't
know if they're gonna do it I think a
lot of it's gonna depend on the consumer
reaction of the face idea people I
really hate it there seems to be some
skepticism already the thing is is that
the way that this is being targeted as
more of an even more premium to your
model yeah the people that are buying it
are already very loyal to Apple so
they're not that concerned I would think
or they're not as concerned about these
privacy issues because otherwise they
wouldn't be buying that phone in the
first place Adam Adam says they aren't
going to get rid of face ID they need
your face a feature in a file for when
big brother needs you yeah no I mean
like really good at like fighting the
government in terms of like divulging
your identity in your information what
is true FBI I the fingerprints that
doesn't mean they're not going to clone
you I just think we can't clone you and
remember that iTunes thing you've been
ignoring for 10 things I just think like
the facial recognition stuff has been
floating in sci-fi for so long that's a
lot of why people are being so hesitant
about it whereas fingerprints are used
for a lot of things and they've been
used for a lot think it was when they
would touch ID was first introduced
there was a lot of skepticism and there
was a lot of concerns about whether or
not that was gonna be secure now it's
sort of commonplace let me just like
online shopping right there's there's
always an initial period of trepidation
I'm just for me maybe it just gets
smoother over time as touch ID did but
like the way I used it it seemed
clunkier than just pulling out of my
pocket with my thing
all the touch ID sensor already and then
having it ready to go like lace I
haven't shared my phone watching the
thing go unlock and then wiping on it
that's expired that maybe if they if
they remove that extra swipe move then
would be fine like it basically it would
be less secure that's the problem
yes you've unlocked the phone already
if you accidentally look at it if you
accidentally look at it look at it it's
unlocked someone else would just swipe
it you get there's there's a I think
that there's a very intentional reason
why they included the swipe because
you've already unlocked it with your
face why include the swipe then right
that's so I think that their social I
have I think they're still trying to
play with disables yeah and if they put
touch ID in the screen then you could
disable it and it wouldn't you wouldn't
be losing much right I mean the iPhone
the touch ID if you remember like the
the setting that most people disabled
was like you had to not only push your
finger that we had hit the home button
wants to actually get into the home
screen and most people disable that
right away because that was an extra
step and so maybe this maybe it's just a
tweak in the settings menu
breaking news Apple just announced next
year coming thought ID think about your
phone and it's going to open up I like
mr. Hills comment says will Apple also
be releasing tinfoil hats for those
people still afraid of face ID we're
almost out of time here
really do you think the next iPhone will
have a screen like the iPhone 10 I think
they've kind of set precedent in that
yeah I think so and then lastly synergy
media what do you think will be the
pre-order availability for the iPhone 10
compared to the eight and eight plus due
to the price discrepancy very limited
you know it's gonna be really hard to
get yeah
Karlis of the price supply is not out
there so the eight plus has got a B+
have gone really smoothly I mean I think
there's some minor delays but I think
the 10 is gonna be horrendous most
likely yeah yeah alright if you're like
dying to buy the ten you may have to get
it on a secondary market ooh a lot less
money for a lot more money
Apple black market yep no don't try and
Link you up with that if we can anyway I
mean Oh Rogers got the hook up let's
let's wrap things up do I think that you
saw our heard here took us on SEANET our
podcast is also available on
TuneIn stitcher SoundCloud Feedburner
and Google Play Music see you all
tomorrow back to y'all see look at late
oh yeah tomorrow we are going to be
later than usual find maybe what's got
