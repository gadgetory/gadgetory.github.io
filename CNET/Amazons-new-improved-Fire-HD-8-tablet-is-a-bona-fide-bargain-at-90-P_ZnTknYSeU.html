year's Fire HD 8 but there are a few key
differences the biggest of which is the
new lower price tag much lower in fact
$90 compared to the previous version
which started at 150 dollars that model
came with only 8 gigabytes of storage
while this new one includes 16 gigabytes
with an expansion slot for adding
microSD memory cards up to 200 gigabytes
in capacity while the quad-core
processor is a new chip Amazon says the
real performance boost comes from a bump
in ram from one gigabyte to 1.5
gigabytes and battery life now goes up
to 12 hours the other noteworthy feature
Edition isn't available yet but will be
in the next few months Alexa the
cloud-based voice service makes her
debut on fire tablets including last
year's hg8 the $50 entry-level Fire and
Fire HD 10 available in four color
options the new HD 8 does feel a little
zippier than the previous model and
thanks to the stereo speakers tuned with
Dolby audio it outputs a decent amount
of sound and works well for movie
watching the front and rear cameras are
nothing special but at least they're
there and available for such apps as
Skype while this is an 8 inch widescreen
HD display with 1280 by 800 resolution
it's not as sharp or vibrant as the iPad
Mini 2 screen the other downside is that
even though fire OS is built on an
android foundation you're locked into
amazon's operating system in its App
Store and can't access the Google Play
Store without tweaking your device in
ways that Amazon would rather you not do
however if you are an Amazon Prime
member that $100 Prime membership gives
you access to a lot of free content
including music movies games books and
apps I recommend getting a cover for it
none is included and Amazon hopes you'll
by it's cover shown here but others are
available from third-party resellers the
bottom line is that if you are a prime
user the ht8 2016 Edition is a great
value and an excellent option for kids
who really don't need an expensive iPad
despite its so-so display you just won't
find a tablet with these features and
performance at this price point I'm
David karna for cnet.com thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
