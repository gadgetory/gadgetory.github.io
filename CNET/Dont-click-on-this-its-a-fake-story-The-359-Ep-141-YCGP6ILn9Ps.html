always be all right up let me just go
ahead there we go there we go so we've
got a busy podcast for you what are we
talking about following along with
yesterday's podcast wouldn't be talking
about you know fake stories on the
internet not just facebook but Google
now also caught in this little
controversy and it makes you wonder like
can you believe anything on the internet
and I know that's kind of stupid
sentence to say because we're on the
internet right but no no but did general
like no you shouldn't believe anything
on the internet unless it's supposedly
honest it's new stories are presented
pagina as legitimate as legitimate
content you know there's there's there's
reason question even seemingly
legitimate stories right absolutely I
think that well we'll talk about that no
about that guys next up we'll talk about
Twitter um basically cracking down on
giving you tool to crack down on trying
to yeah very very limited on the troll
problem on Twitter and then lastly will
be we talking about counterfeit goods on
Amazon yeah really just all negative
yeah really it this is what we're
talking about a little bit about how
companies are pumping the sawls in his
problems but you know still negative
topics with your problems the cake is a
lie oh I don't even know if that means I
like it though all right really you
haven't played portal no not yet dear
will you ask sorry guys this is a very
long freezes be that like that's really
good let's get it go did a young thing
or is it just like a gamer thing or just
being lame thing I guess I don't have
wow that's what you wanted we're all I
you're always stated today all right why
don't why don't we get started as always
if you have any questions any of these
topics Brian will leave in the comment
section Brian will will pick out the
best and we will try we'll try answer
yeah try and welcome yeah charless all
you want because this particular this
particular podcast you control it
impersonate the other podcast it's Joe
Strout patrol away even in for even more
so troll away troll away and dispute our
reputations later yes where you cannot
click on the podcast of the load that
we're going to record in three two
welcome to the 359 when we talk about
the top Tecna of the day you know the
crap we want to throw in I'm Roger King
I'm Ben Fox ribbon facebook has been all
over the news for the promotion of hoax
stories but now Google is in the same
boat its new section highlighted story
about Donald Trump winning the popular
vote which you'd find if you googled
election results in whom news flash
Donald Trump did not win the popular
vote Hillary Clinton did by 200,000
votes right um but it still brings the
mind or brings a question like it can
you believe anything you see on the
internet and I know that's a dumb thing
to say but that's a valid question if
you are going to a new site or if you're
going to a site that's supposed to
present you with legitimate stories
right yeah um to me what's interesting
about this also is that Google has this
very secretive very secret secret sauce
that they provide their algorithm to say
this is we're providing the very best
stories out there and this is a pretty
clear example of that not working at all
according to rich and you have a story
that we published today they have about
something like 200 different metrics
that they utilize to try to surface the
best possible stories and it just goes
to show you that even with Google which
has been doing search for 20 years
hey they they can screw up just like
everybody else right and problem is
there's no really easy answer you know
giving these guys editorial control to
stamp out fake stories you know one
media critic Jeff Jarvis said that's
that's a mistake that's giving these
companies too much editorial power
that's just an to actually determine
what's real or what's not right neither
these companies really want to be in
that position no they don't but I think
that it's kind of a ridiculous position
for them to take that's my personal
opinion to suggest that they're not
media companies where they're making
advertising off of presenting people
content how is that not a media company
so yeah next up Twitter will now let its
users mute certain words phrases or
conversations as part of its effort to
curb hate speech and trolling on its
social site it also made it easier to
report hate speech do you think this is
going to change much though no I think I
I might agree when the troll power is
just too strong on Twitter I mean it for
me it just feel like a little too little
too late and a little too not an
affection a little yeah yeah and a
little late yeah the interesting thing
about this for me is that anonymity will
probably continue to exist on Twitter
for a very very long time and that is
really what feeds trolling more than
anything and I think that's the one of
the crux of Twitter's prom growth
problem is like regular users can go on
because they feel intimidated by this
this Twitter or this troll culture
that's developed on Twitter and it's
strong basically you say anything about
anything and someone will come back to
say either disagree with you or just say
something completely you know
inflammatory yeah I and Twitter
obviously knows that the situation is
rather toxic they tried to sell the
company this is rumors has tried to sell
the company and nobody wanted to buy
them partly because of all the Vittra on
the site so they know that they need to
clean this up however maybe this isn't
really enough we'll see if they keep
going yeah last amazon filed its
first-ever lawsuits against counterfeit
sellers on its site that's part of its
bigger push to cut down on bad actors on
the world's biggest e-commerce site it
also recently sued purveyors of fake
reviews this is this is a good thing oh
you're actually pursuing the mean of
stuff yes what I mean
perience on amazon is less than
desirable because of that the guys I've
complained to you a number of times like
going just buying something simple as a
stand for my iphone you'll find 50
different problems yeah most of them are
knock-offs you know the price is very
and then you go into the reviews and
like they all have five star reviews how
does that how does I'm work hows it
happen yeah this was also a long time
coming I would argue they've done a lot
with anti counterfeiting and they've
mostly avoided a lot of the negative
attention to counterfeiting that others
have gotten however I I would say that
they still have some work to do over
around this ya know this is definitely
good start I'd like to see the fact that
they're cracking down counterfeiters
because that's definitely you're not
entirely sure you're not confident
confident with your purchase on amazon
yeah fake news fake fake reviews fake
everything fake goods there you go fake
friends on we wear a fake we're fake
friends for sure we're not real I'm
gonna start crying after the show all
right for more of those stories chikis
on cnet I'm Roger Jang I've been fox
rubin thanks for listening it is very
hard these days to keep track of this
kind of stuff um but when really think
about my stuff I'm sorry you're saying
goods news Everything Everything
Everywhere sources sources so that's an
important part you know when when you're
in school and they teach you how to
write an essay you got to cite your
sources yeah and that's what major
agencies do um perhaps to Michael our
buddy he was pointing out that he
follows reputable places like cnet
Washington Post New York Times verge CNN
MSNBC so on I can live with that yeah
absolutely yeah and the verge is a
primary competitor far as however there
they are a reputable yes a little
reputable provider of the news and so
she's gonna get over vein of sources
absolutely that's not the problem right
not but for folks who like no to
actively go to certain sites that's less
of an issue it's it's if you're just
googling something and you know the
results pull up and it's you know no
name web site com that and you don't
even look at it but you know that's the
problem uses a sorcerer just in paying
attention you just click on the headline
the danger is is our people giving too
much credence to google and in that
particular case they did and bad on
google for for you
surfacing the wrong type of information
right well I mean I think the problem is
much bigger on facebook because it's
it's a bit more intimate because you're
getting story recommendations from your
friends from family and so there's
almost like almost like a built-in
credibility factor there even though it
could be wrong it's just slant yeah it's
as long well no it's just it's yeah it's
a story that's a hoax story but it's
trending because everyone sharing it if
you see your friends sharing the story
really oh well maybe it's legit right
don't as it's being shared the the level
of what is your other idiots well that's
a problem what's what's odd about it is
is that the amount of sharing or the
amount of likes or the amount of
retweets actually provides a certain
level of credibility yeah whereas that's
actually bogus oh yeah that's just BS
well how many times I'm guilty of it
myself like do you share something
without actually looking at the full
source or a look at the headline oh
that's an interesting one you can share
I think we're all guilty yeah and I
would that's a problem like but i only
share funny things thank you oh if it's
a funny story that happens to be fake
that's a problem that's fairly harmless
right well i guess no i mean you work in
the media you shouldn't the onus is on
you a little bit more I mean if I'm
conspiring about the new Sonic the
Hedgehog game is not the same as Oh
totally ain't no known as a little
different about that listen gotta go
fast yeah but it's hard ok so the part
is now yeah the UK you people are
looking to other sources to try to find
their information because their
confidence in primary sources has been
shaken you look at some of the main
offenders from MSNBC to Fox News to
Matthew CNN en and we know what the
chance where everybody is under fire now
there is no one hundred percent good
wholesome we can trust this whether you
want to agree with it or not and
everyone's entitled to their bias now
you're making very being human you're
making an interesting philosophical
argument and I would argue that nobody
should be trusted one hundred percent of
the time that's true dangerous but then
the problem is the only way to get the
real story is to read multiple sources
and who has time for that oh right
exactly that's the issue I'm
unfortunately we're offering to our
audience the fact that there are no easy
answers and that's true yeah you know
and like it's the same
by readers nothing for you we got
nothing for you we warned you not to
click on yeah it's the problem with the
oversaturation it you know we have so
much information aggregated towards us
now like how do you filter it should be
on shaggy on Twitter yeah but that
should be on the next n that's where
Google comes in right that's that's why
people have a use for google because it
is an aggregator right it's supposed to
a filtered aggregator and geeky but the
algorithm is based on with amazon desire
not legitimacy no I think Google
Google's is a little bit more based on
legitimacy than its ally suppose it's
not trending it's still not perfect it's
not perfect obviously as those evidence
with this story but it's you know i
would say i would argue it's probably
more effective than facebook which
relies more on just people sharing and
there's bets that's not really a great
determinant capability if something good
comes out of this that people then have
it expect more from google facebook
amazon that they should act as better
gatekeepers for some of these things i
think of it that's then that's a
positive i think of it is is like again
quoting a rich quoted jeff jarvis
talking about he made the argument that
you shouldn't let rationally nor rely on
facebook or google to get in that
position of flagging fake stories it
should be more on either the media or
individuals like white may be empowering
folks to have tags that they could tag
stories that yeah that also sounded
problematic to me like unpopular stories
i would say that girl or google
shouldn't be surfacing BS stories like
they shouldn't replace but that's the
thing it these are all algorithm based
bait sometimes this stuff happens right
and so I mean what they did dude they be
added a tag for fat check right recently
right during after the after the
elections so maybe surfacing stories
that are more fact-check type stories
but then there's a broader issue of
surfacing like fat check stories are
inaccurate but that's a whole nother
rabbit hole we're gonna go down yeah
I've been saying this forever that the
human species was a mistake we're gonna
ruin everything wow we really are go
negative today I'm Betty this is found
really cathartic I don't loving it a
downer that I'm enjoying thoroughly
I love this comment we wonder if it
should be more the computer more about
people involved with actually
aggregating this and filtering things
Brandon says I think judge judy should
be on Google's filtering team she should
be the only one on that Jesus is dry I
honestly too there's a piece of me that
says more commercially jerks should be
trying to filter the news sure speaking
of take you only get one story today so
what I like it's about puppies hey
thanks for i don't i don't disagree with
that so how do we think a call out to
the chat how do we actually try to
decipher what's the difference between
news and entertainment how do you were
like EG well we're like news and fakes
or like news and yeah well you're not
going to stop people from making up
stories that's i mean that's what our
entire society is built on is telling
stories but it's how do you say well
this is actually what happened this is
legitimately what happened which is
unfathomable in the time we have a
constant stream of media constant stream
of consciousness where everything is
coming at you and we're just like we we
trust what we want to trust we know what
we want to know there is no element of
like well this is the truth whether I
like it or not I people i think that
there's little bubbles there's a bright
and and in some ways that's a necessity
there's so much information that gets
thrown at people online these days that
it's virtually impossible as we've seen
from what we talked about to be able to
filter all the crap so if people want to
try to filter in their own way then then
they can and they will and they have to
and maybe I want to believe a hoax story
I'm not saying it's a particularly smart
thing or a good thing but it's it's well
I think that's what we saw the election
right there are tons of you know Hillary
Clinton FBI FBI agent who committed
suicide you're suicidal that was just
flat-out wrong I mean that's that's my
problem as a journalist like that
there's absolutely no connection to
reality but a bit sort of my point is it
doesn't matter if there's a connection
reality like there aren't enough folks
out there who want to believe that then
it becomes the truth for them that's my
job sure just that's an eclipse either
are not blowing my mind there are enough
people in the industry that that take
the
its responsibility with the seriousness
you know we have it kind of easy we're
in the media but we're in not so
divisive and damning that we can be held
accountable for what's violent protests
right now then you know the people that
are on these Thrones on high and dealing
out opinions not facts and trying to
curtail the mass populace into just
blowing angry to that follow me at em
that's not this story the story isn't
folks doling out of paint it's folks
reporting stories as if they were legit
right they're not that's there's a bit
of a distinction right it's not these
folks are is there anymore another
totally is there not editorializing
they're trying to present this as fat as
an objective story when it's completely
wrong that's I think that's the more
worsen thing like I think right
editorializing facebook google facebook
and google enabling it because there's
such huge platforms right they then you
know somebody can say that on their
stupid blog and it doesn't really go
anywhere but if you get traction on
Facebook or Twitter then it becomes you
know my for that no-name blow pops up on
a Google search more frequently than not
then yeah that's gonna that's gonna be
relevant you know when we get our news
from the comedians on comedy central and
we'd get our laughs from the I mean I
used to give us my headlines from Jon
Stewart that's what I mean that's
absolutely sure I mean pretty good i was
watching john oliver last night it's
like man this is a lot easier to watch
sometimes yeah well cuz it's
entertaining well it isn't he laughing
or you know well yes you get angry but
you laugh along with the rage mm-hmm and
then you come full circle and then the
minute you try to actually take a stand
on what you do believe in it's just a
debate for lack of a more maybe not FCC
friendly words yeah the Bates probably
way too generous a word but is that even
when you you can't we went to last time
we really saw a good civil argument
online maybe once in a while one of our
chats props to our listeners yeah I
would say so yeah do we have more
questions by the way yeah I would we
actually have a lot of great agreement
and conversation I don't know distinct
questions right now I think we're having
a good conversation anyone uh I don't
want to punch our faces yeah come on now
you're trolling a TV show is at all I
mean how do we control these sources
though how do we do that
I would my best more importantly how do
we educate ourselves collectively in
this room out of this room to tell
people to like maybe take it with a
grain of salt my best recommendation to
people is to pay attention of the
sources of news that you're actually
getting like Mike said at the beginning
of the show like actually look at what
the sources are and if you don't
recognize them it's the same thing as
going to like some ecommerce site that
you've never seen you maybe you're going
to end up with something that you don't
actually one or maybe you get something
that's not actually legit that being
said it's really fair to provide a
caveat that regular media gets things
wrong sometimes and that's why you
shouldn't trust them one hundred percent
of the time either and I'd be kind of a
jerk if I didn't say that because like
that's just not true but at the same
time we make it to measure much effort
yeah is that we make a huge effort to
try to get it right and there are
obviously bad actors out there that are
actually trying to like snow people and
deceive people so it is a lot to do with
intent i would say here's a really good
point verification badges on accounts
but what about also verification badges
on stories now that's a tricky part now
because a very that is that is like you
know CNN that's their verification badge
the oven around they're not fly by night
you might not agree with everything they
have to say but you know that they are
you know well there are those folks in
this country who look at the CNN Brandon
not see it as a verification n bad
example yeah now I'm like struggling to
try to figure out what actually used but
you're the new york times i think that
save folks who saved the CNN right the
same folks that told those Donald Trump
was never gonna win yeah but the kid
with you know the schmuck in his
basement who's got a million subscribers
on YouTube gets a verification badge
yeah that's true and what does he really
have to say well sometimes something
that's like totally legit I mean mkbhd
has nothing area this verification is
like a valid point literally like like
it's not YouTube stars but yeah there
are it's easier to it's easy to get a
validation dodge relatively easy I guess
and it doesn't like you can get one
through popularity or through clicks not
necessarily through your work right I
think that's the dilemma
validation badges like are they giving
away to freely right it's based on
numbers yeah bisque because it's based
on numbers and not by credibility or
accuracy yeah I know who has the
authority to dole out those
verifications do you trust YouTube as a
company do you trust Twitter as a
company yeah yeah I mean those are all
very good question we need to elect the
verifications are no that's a terrible
that's the problem are you out of your
mind that's like way too much power
first the worst possible idea the best
thing to do is to really just tell the
audience like just like buyer beware
like really where you know if it sounds
too good to be true if it's if it's
fishy you know you should probably trust
your instincts what about a scorecard
system your systems are a horrible idea
these are my numbers out of the chat oh
really um lot of viewers I'm
interpreting from the chat so instead of
I'm sorry I'm sorry to whoever mention
that I'm not trying to be mean about it
by know instead of verification badge
which I'm not trying to take that system
away that's not going anywhere but you
know you get a verification badge for
having numbers but what about a some
kind of centralized internet scorecard
based on sheer accuracy you can refer to
where they get a point system I don't
know that's that seems sounds
complicated sounds dad that sounds
really hard to implement like who would
be the arbitrator of what's true what's
accurate what's not there's an algorithm
there there's a problem there's a
problem with all systems all systems can
be gamed all systems have like
weaknesses and I like theoretically if I
was if I was a bad actor or site i can
write maybe a thousand really short
correct a cured stories and then every
once in a while looking like one or two
fake you know Trump is actually a god
story like I oh god yeah golden gai yeah
I don't think we're there let let us say
like they're like to your point about
gaming the system like there are ways to
get around that like okay your car's
probably why google keeps his thinking
secretive right I don't know that's an I
thought that was kind of an interesting
thought I think it is encoded it's just
really hard to implement it I would fear
that it would be very easy to game as
well I think this is gonna be a huge
issue over the next probably decade
oh yeah we try to swim the seems to be
gay and if anything it's important to I
wouldn't say a decade because I imagine
like we'd have moved past social media
as a new source and substance can get
injected into our brains spa because
from now I don't know it could be
something what razy different we're
emotional tense bad guys been on so far
we are somewhat peaking in overall
consumption like there is an endless
endless endless stream of information
coming in and now every we have no
choice but to figure out how to organize
this no that is I think that's the sort
of the one like the becks big next
innovations is like the ability to
smartly aggregate stuff so that you're
only getting what you want what you need
I don't even then that's its don't know
the personalization personalization yeah
yes that's a big absolutely I'm is
trying to do a lot um but we're not
there yet instead we've just got a ton
of crap to deal with and that is the
perfect note to go out yeah all right
they let everybody feel like putting up
with the sob fest if you like that'll
