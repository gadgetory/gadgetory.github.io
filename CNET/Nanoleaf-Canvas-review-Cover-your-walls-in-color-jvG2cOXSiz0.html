nana leaf is back with new LED light
panels for your wall dubbed nana leaf
canvass the new square shaped color
changers feature touch sensitivity a
built-in microphone to sync them up with
whatever music you're listening to and
voice controls with Siri Alexa and the
Google assistant you can add up to 500
panels to a single set up 25 / power
supply and a nine panel starter kit
costs two hundred and fifty dollars now
that is obviously not cheap but it's
also not much more than you'd spend on
say four bulb starter kit from philips
hue for the money you're getting a very
distinctive set of smart lights for
out-and-proud smart home setups they're
not for everyone but they are undeniably
unique the approach is similar to the
first set of triangular shaped LED light
panels they'll stick them to your walls
with double-sided tape and link each one
together using little connector chips
one of the panels in the starter kit
features built-in buttons for quick
control of the lights but you can also
sync them up with your home's Wi-Fi
network to automate them or control them
on your phone or with voice commands now
let's start with what I like about these
lights I honestly wasn't sure how I was
gonna feel about the new design that
splits each panel into four quadrants to
help evenly disperse the light but
seeing it close-up I really like it
actually it's kind of a nice marbled
effect and the square shaped panels also
look a lot less alien than the
triangular ones did I also like that
rhythm mode one of nano Leafs best
features is now built in by default no
extra mic accessory needed on the
downside the new touch controls which
let you push a panel to create a ripple
effect seem a bit like an underwhelming
gimmick here at launch and I hate the
sticky tabs that nano leaf gives you to
help put these things up on your wall
the way the panels are designed it makes
it so there's really no good way to get
them off of your all without damaging
paint velcro tabs like the ones that
come with life x tiles would have been a
whole lot better if I were buying nano
leaf canvas from my home I'd be sure to
pick some of those up along with them
something else you should know the
connections on the back of each panel
aren't in the center of each side that
they are with the triangles that lets
you stagger the connections for better
design flexibility which is nice but
note that they aren't the same on each
side that means that you'll need to put
some extra thought into how you're going
to arrange them before you start
sticking them to your walls
fortunately Natalie's app has a really
cool layout assistant that helps you
figure things out on your phone
there's even an augmented reality
feature that lets you preview how your
configuration will look on your walls
before you put anything up all in all if
you're a fan of Nana leaf or of color
changing lights like these then there's
a lot to like here
Natalie's canvas can jazz up a party
wake you up with an artificial sunset in
the morning sync up with your razor
chroma compatible PC games or just add a
fun funky aesthetic to your home whether
or not that's worth 250 is up to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
