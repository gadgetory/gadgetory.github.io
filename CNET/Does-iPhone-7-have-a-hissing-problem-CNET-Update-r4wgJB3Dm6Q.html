some owners are complaining the new
iPhone makes a hissing noise from the
logic board when it's busy completing a
heavy task the issue was brought into
the media spotlight when journalist
Steven Hackett of the blog 512 pixels
shared a recording of his iPhone making
a hissy fit other iPhone 7 owners have
been speaking up on Twitter that they
too were experiencing the same sound but
not everyone has this issue here at Cena
we didn't hear any sound with our iPhone
7 maybe it's just a manufacturing snag
for a few units but Hackett who recorded
the hiss he said that Apple is offering
to replace his iPhone if you hear a hiss
get in touch with us at the email
address update at cnet.com it's not
clear how many people are hearing the
static so why is it getting so much
media attention well because we can't
have any why phone without something
reported going wrong whether it's been
gate or antenna gates but hey at least
it's not catching fire and exploding
like the galaxy note 7 apparently
Samsung's exploding phones are actually
Apple's fault according to a Bloomberg
report samsung executives pushed
suppliers to rush production to meet
shorter deadlines in order for the note
7 to beat the iPhone 7 launch but it
seems that rushing backfired and now
with a massive battery crisis Samsung
had to recall 2.5 million Note 7 phones
the Korean company began exchanging
devices on Monday for customers in the
UK and Ireland customers in the US have
to wait until Wednesday to get new
phones that's it for this tech news
update I'm Bridget Carey you can stay on
