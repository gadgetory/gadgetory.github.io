welcome to Google issues for all the
Google you could think of let's get to
it and is there enough room for another
Android phone in the market well if you
ask Andy Rubin the creator of Android
which happens to just run on over 2
billion devices he left Google to build
that phone and his answer is the
essential phone like just try saying
that out loud it sounds classy the
essential phone now essential products
is the name of the company and at the
code conference Rubin unveiled what they
simply call the phone for the first time
it's an ear bezel free design running
stock Android made from a blend of
titanium and ceramic materials so it can
survive a drop test without a major dent
or blemish directly calling out Samsung
and Apple now it's running the
snapdragon 835 with 4 gigs of RAM and
128 gigs of storage with a rear
fingerprint sensor and USB C connection
and it's also compatible with all
carriers now it's unique design wraps
the screen around the front-facing
camera you can see that and if you're
looking at the future this phone also
does not have a headphone jack
now Ruben also said there is a yet to be
announced or demonstrated assistant that
will run on the phone and it will also
be compatible with the world's smallest
360-degree camera that's an accessory
option now this might be the most
intriguing phone of the year because of
the creators especially coming from
Ruben
look he's Androids daddy who also was
the CEO at danger when they created one
of my favorite phones of all time the
sidekick like that was a smart phone
before they were actually called
smart phones Ruben just gets it and
we'll see how consumers respond the
phone is available now for pre-order for
$6.99 now essential products also
announced their own Amazon echo and
Google home competitor called the
essential home it's their entry into the
home assistant with a streamlined design
that visually out does the echo or the
Google home with a circular screen that
can be activated by touch voice or even
glance it does what you expect you can
control music ask general questions set
timers and control lights but essential
claims they will do it better now at the
code conference Ruben said essentials
home will be able to run Alexa the
Google assistant and Siri now that's
surprising they want it to be a device
that
one on any platform can use but again
we'll have to see if they actually get
those deals made it runs what they call
the ambient OS and most of the
processing will happen locally on the
device and not on the cloud prioritizing
your privacy compared to other smart
speakers on the market now all they have
right now is these renders with cool
animations
there's no specs no pricing or delivery
date wired says it will ship sometime in
the summer now essential is a company
worth watching it will see how and if
they can really break people out of
their ecosystem shackles so we'll keep
locked in on that all right
alphabet the artist formerly known as
Google announced their new nest IQ
security camera think of it as an
upgrade to the current $200 nest cam
indoor thanks to entire video quality
built-in speakers but really it's the
brains inside of it it's just better now
on the outside it may not look like
anything significant when it's 8
megapixel sensor records 4k video with
HDR to capture significantly better
looking videos and with its facial
recognition zooming in to enhanced will
actually look good there's a feature
called person's alert it sends a
notification to you when a person is in
the field of view and not a pet unless
your dog walks on two feet oh come on
that's just cute and super sight is a
picture and picture view tracking shot
of a person in view plus 8 yes you want
to get creepy or be that parent you can
talk to your kids clearly with its
improved speakers see that's no fun Ness
also offers more features if you
subscribe to their nest aware service
other smart cameras offer facial
recognition that are even around 60
bucks the new nest cam IQ is $2.99 but
it looks like the smartest home camera
to date we'll just have to see if it's
really worth that price all right that's
going to do it for this week with three
big products dropping you can email me
at Google issues at cnet.com or tweet me
at brian tong they so much for watching
we'll catch y'all next time for some
more of that google it
