this is a look at the drift HD ghost
action camera which sets itself apart
for much of the competition by including
things other brands sell as add-ons for
starters it has a 2 inch Gorilla Glass
protected LCD and the body is waterproof
down to 9 feet without requiring an
extra casing its battery is good for up
to three hours but it's also removable
so you can just throw another one in and
keep shooting it also has built-in Wi-Fi
for connecting to an iOS or eventually
an Android device giving you a live
preview and control over camera settings
that's good because while it's nice that
you have these big buttons on top to
control the menus the system itself is a
bit tedious to navigate the included
accessories are nice too such as the
wireless remote for switching shooting
modes between video photos burst
shooting and time-lapse and starting and
stopping recordings the lens rotates as
well so you can adjust for different
mounts that you're using and lastly it
has a lot of recording options though
I'd stick with the 1080p video I noticed
some aliasing artifacts and there's some
low light noise but it's otherwise very
good and considering all this camera
offers I doubt many will be disappointed
I'm Josh Goldman and that's the drift HD
