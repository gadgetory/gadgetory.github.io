charge you're doing it all wrong
laptops are designed to work without
having to rely on a charger so if you
find yourself looking for an outlet
every couple of hours while you work
something is definitely going on the
biggest reason for a battery that dies
quickly is usually the battery itself
laptop batteries can only last up to a
certain number of charge cycles so if
yours is hitting the limit it might be
time to replace it here's how to find
out on a Mac check valves if your
battery by holding down the option key
and then clicking the battery icon
you'll see what the condition is here on
windows it takes a few extra steps
you'll need to create a battery report
using the command prompt the easiest way
to do that is to follow my tutorial on
CNET now if you've done all these things
in your battery is okay then there are a
few other things you can do to make sure
it lasts a bit longer the biggest
battery hog is the LCD screen so make
sure it's dimmed as low as possible
whenever possible same goes for backlit
keyboard keys another thing to do is to
make sure you unplug any USB devices
disable bluetooth when you can and close
any programs you're not actually using
and now you're doing it right
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
