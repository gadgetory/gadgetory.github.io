that might be worth picking up a couple
extra jobs to pay for priced at just
over eleven thousand dollars with one of
the new lenses the Hasselblad x1d a 50
megapixel camera based off the company's
medium format HTC 50c series is the
first Maryland medium format and it may
fall into that category for me I won't
really know that until I've had a chance
to test it but the few minutes I had
with it did leave me with a warm fuzzy
feeling it's seriously compact for a
camera with such a large sensor it's
certainly smaller than like this
full-frame model with a comfortable grip
excellent touchscreen large electronic
viewfinder and a pretty well designed
dust and weather sealed aluminum body
the grip is surprisingly comfortable and
the mode dial is cleverly designed to be
rotatable when up and lock when pushed
down there's a quiet manual mode that
suppresses the aperture noise by
stopping it down while most of the
manual controls operate via the
touchscreen there are a few direct
access buttons for sensitivity white
balance and focus plus front and back
adjustment dials the biggest question
mark for me is the auto focus which
isn't as sprightly as I'm used to the
lens hunts a bit before locking it's
also pretty slow to start up which is
typical for medium format cameras that
usually doesn't matter as much in a
studio where most medium format is used
as it does for the more knock around
shooting the x1d is designed for it
slated to ship at the end of August
