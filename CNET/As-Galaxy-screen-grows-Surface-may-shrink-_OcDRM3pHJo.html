collective I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update how big is too big for
a smartphone well Samsung is pushing
pocket limits with a new line of phones
called the galaxy mega and the high-end
model measures in at six point three
inches for the screen to compare that's
a bigger screen than the Amazon Kindle
paperwhite e-reader it's larger than the
awkwardly large galaxy notes which are
called phablets for being part phone in
part tablet but for now America is safe
from this monster of a phone it's only
scheduled to come out in Europe and
Russia next month if you watch the show
you shouldn't be too surprised there
were clues in an update last month about
a new Samsung gamepad controller that
works with a mysterious 6.3 inch device
it seems getting near 7 inches is the
trendy sweet spot Samsung continues to
grow its phones but Microsoft is
shrinking the surface we've seen the
signs that Microsoft might want to make
a mini version of the surface and the
wall street journal is adding to that
with a report that it's working on a 7
inch model to compete with the ipad mini
and Google's Nexus 7 and while we get
giddy about new smartphones and tablets
the market for desktop and laptop
computers is in the pits this is nearing
the worst it's ever been for the PC
market as research firms report that
shipments are at a sharp decline some
are putting blame on Windows 8 because
the new touchscreen devices are
expensive and are facing shortages
customers may now be thinking it's more
worth it to just get a snazzy new tablet
and throw on a keyboard accessory as for
the category of computers that go on
your face Google is sending out the
first Google glass units to developers
within the next month developers paid
fifteen hundred dollars for each glass
unit just so they could be among the
first to tinker with it along with this
news a group of investment firms have
joined forces to fund companies that
want to invent products that work with
Google glass the group is called the
glass collective isn't the board
referred to as the Borg collective well
it's not like Google wants to put tech
on our faces and know our location
I mean oh right so when that time comes
when you no longer need your google
account like when you die you can now
tell google exactly what you wanted to
do with your data there's a new option
in settings for inactivity and if you
want you can pass on an account to
another person if it's been an active
for too long or Google can just delete
the account on your behalf before it
times out and thinks you're dead it will
send you an email or text message just
to check in and make sure you're still
alive that's your tech news update you
can find more details on these stories
