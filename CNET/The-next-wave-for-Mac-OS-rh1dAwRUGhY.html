Mavericks over the past couple of days
and with new apps new features and other
improvements there's plenty to show off
start off the new finder tabs work much
in the same way the tabs doing Safari a
plus sign button on the right lets you
open a new tab and you can drag and drop
tabs just like in a web browser you can
have one tab for airdrop and another for
documents then drag and drop files to
airdrop to send to a co-worker Finder
windows can be expanded to full screen
mode as well to make it easier to
organize and find documents there's also
a new tagging system in Mavericks now
you can add multiple tags to documents
so you can search on one or more tags to
get to the exact files you want when
saving a file you can pick a color pic
from standard tags like work or home or
assign your own tag now to get all the
documents that share a tag you can
select it in the left navigation of the
finder or search for it via spotlight
next the calendar I've got a facelift in
a bit more functionality this key
morphic leather-bound look is gone
replaced by clean lines and interface
elements to draw your attention to
what's important a streamlined event
inspector will autocomplete location
addresses give you driving time to your
destination and present you with a map
click it to see the destination in the
Maps app and yes if you haven't heard
Apple maps will soon be on your Mac and
even though it's been somewhat maligned
it has improved quite a lot over time
and I think it's a useful addition to
Mavericks Apple maps is integrated with
your calendar like I showed a second ago
but you also can get quick directions
from contacts and you can quickly view
an address in the mail app when
exploring the map on your Mac it's a
great experience letting you switch
views like you do in iOS and using 3d
flyover on the trackpad as well as
smooth and looks great so far I got some
interface upgrades as well a personal
favorite of mine is the new sidebar
where you can click bookmarks on the
left and quickly sift through websites
on the right you also have easy access
to your reading list top sites gets a
new flatter look in Mavericks and it's
easier to customize just drag and drop
tiles where you want them
or you can pull out a bookmark and place
it on top sites for easy access that's
all we have time for today but there's a
lot more to Mavericks than what we've
shown here you can get more info about
the new iCloud keychain better multiple
display support notifications with
updates from your favorite sites and
more am I written review for cnet apple
says Mavericks will become available
later this fall but we still haven't
heard about pricing information or an
exact release date thanks for watching
everybody i'm jason parker for cnet and
this has been a first look at mac OS 10
Mavericks see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
