with a C net top-5 the top 5 reasons to
buy a Verizon iPhone see recently Ryan
Cooley brought you top 5 reasons not to
buy the Verizon iPhone limited global
roaming no simultaneous voice and data
no 4G whatever hater
if the presale numbers are any
indication at all the Verizon iPhone is
going to be a monster hit but if you're
still on the fence here are five reasons
you might want to take the leap coming
in at number five no death-grip because
of a slight redesign with the iPhone 4
those issues about holding the phone
wrong and losing reception are now
solved and you won't need an ugly rubber
bumper to use with this model bonus at
number four the Verizon iPhone can act
as a mobile hotspot providing wireless
Internet access to up to five devices
yes it cost an additional 20 bucks a
month but that's a lot less than a
Verizon MiFi costs AT&amp;amp;T is rumored to be
working on offering the mobile hotspot
capability but right now they cannot
match that feature
and it is super handy especially if it's
paired with number three Verizon's
unlimited data plan for 30 bucks a month
now granted verizon says the plan will
only be available for a limited time but
if you're a serious pandora streamer a
podcast downloader or a Netflix watcher
on your phone and you want to do the
mobile tethering the unlimited data is a
huge plus for as long as it lasts moving
on to number two duh better voice
calling in his top five reasons not to
buy coolly noted that with CDMA
technology you can't do voice and data
at the same time that's true but on the
flipside when the phone only does voice
you're a lot less likely to get dropped
calls because the voice isn't being
crowded out by the data that's right I'm
saying they can hear you now and finally
the number one reason to buy a Verizon
iPhone for God's sake people you've been
waiting for years already
it's like Santa came and it's Christmas
morning finally finally you can open the
present and have your very own iPhone on
Verizon who cares if there's gonna be
another version in six months go ahead
scratch that itch
alright that's it for this week everyone
for more top 5 videos head on over it's
a top 5 cnet.com I'm Molly wood and
