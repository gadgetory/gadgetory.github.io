how to contributor and today we're going
to take a look at getting started with
the Facebook camera app when you first
installed on your device and launch it
you'll notice that it's already detected
which facebook account you're using on
your device so I'll ask you do you want
to continue sending in as that accounts
name if you don't want to tap on not you
down below and you'll have a chance to
sign into a different facebook account
i'm going to go ahead and tap on
continue as then as you can see it
starts to load my facebook photos fee
from all my friends so here's a post
from sharon testing out the app and
you're able to like as well as comment
strictly on the photo if you tap it go
blow it up and then you can even take it
as well tap again it takes you back so
the initial feed is your friends feed
you could also view your own personal
feet of photos that you have uploaded
and if you've uploaded more than one you
can actually scroll through them now if
you pull down on this feed you'll
actually reveal any photo that is in
your camera roll now you can't to access
any photos in your photostream only
photos that are in your camera roll
alright so we have our photos from our
camera roll here and we're actually able
to go in and edit the photos pretty
easily and it's a lot similar to that
how instagram works so you're able to
crop and you could rotate and then you
can also apply filters
once you're happy with it if you want to
take someone in the photo all you do is
tap on it and you're able to bring up
the tag dialog start typing the friends
name and you'll see a list start to pop
down so once you're happy with the photo
you can either upload it individually or
you could upload photos in a group to
upload photos in a group you'll tap on
this check mark up here and then you
could scroll through or look at your
gallery and select as many photos as you
want to upload once you're ready tap the
compose button and you're able to upload
multiple photos which up until now the
native facebook app the default facebook
app you weren't allowed to upload more
than one photo you were restricted to
one photo at a time and now it's kind of
taken that away and it makes it actually
really easy so once you're ready to pull
something you just tap on post and it'll
take you back to your feed and as you'll
notice the uploading icon is there and
you'll get a dialog here kind of showing
you the progress and all right so now
that the upload is finished you're able
to see that the photos are placed just
like they are and the rest of your feet
you're able to view the likes and the
comments or even like or comment on the
photo yourself as you would any of the
other photos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
