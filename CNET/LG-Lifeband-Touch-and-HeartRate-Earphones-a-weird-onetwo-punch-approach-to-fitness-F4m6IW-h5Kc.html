heart race can you tell how they're
tracking my heart rate well it's not on
my wrist it's actually in my ears
these are LG's new heart rate earphones
and they work in tandem with another
thing that I'm wearing the LG life band
touch these are two separate devices
that LG is now selling we sell these
back at CES and they're both attempting
to do different things in the wearable
health market I just got in my ear the
information all the calories and I'm
being burned and the fact that I've got
a heart rate that's astonishingly high
at over 90 beats per minute because I'm
talking to you now how those work is
that they've got contact patches here
and so you avoid any sort of LED on your
wrist which we found is kind of a mixed
bag in terms of accuracy anyhow these
are always connected once you start the
workout unless you take them off and
you've got this little bluetooth dongle
right here that allows you to press a
button to get your heart rate reading
and it glows to tell you your relative
heart rate zone you gotta remember what
color though by checking the manual it's
not easy to remember now the life band
touch is its own separate activity
tracker this is a watch but it's also a
Fitness band a lot like the Nike Fuel
band or your Fitbit force that type of
territory and also is a little bit smart
like the Samsung gear fit but don't get
too excited about how smart you might
think it's gonna be if you're an iPhone
user it only shows you that someone is
calling nothing else on Android you get
the caller ID you also get the ability
to check messages or that couldn't read
the content of the messages it just told
me that something was being sent and you
can silence a call by putting your hand
over it you can also just reach in your
pocket and turn off your phone it's not
too complicated this also has the
ability to control your music volume and
skipping tracks but a lot of wearables
do that now and it tracks your steps or
the pedometer but also connects with
heart rate monitors ones bipolar and
Zephyr in addition to the LG heartrate
earphone so it's not a vast expanse but
you do have other options you don't have
to pay up for these and these are $180
these are expensive little earphones the
sound quality is okay it's not that
great and you have to wear these all the
time in order to use them as heart rate
monitors do you want to use these as
opposed to your own earphone
I don't plus they don't plug in like
regular earphones you got to use this
dongle and it's all you got about four
hours of battery life so you've got to
keep recharging this with micro USB now
this has its own little slide to charge
dongle that connects on the back here
but uses micro USB after that this gets
about two to five days of battery life
that's really not that great in this
world there are a lot of bands that last
a week and others that last even more if
they're using a built-in coin battery it
slides onto your wrist is rigid but
flexible at the other end pops on there
are three different sizes it's a little
thick kind of like a bangle feels even
bit thicker than the Nike FuelBand
and its water-resistant very nestl√©'s
to wear it in the shower the good news
is at the LG fitness app is surprisingly
deep and it works with third-party app
connectivity as well things like My
Fitness Pal RunKeeper MapMyFitness those
are supported in there so that's much
better than Samsung s health which
doesn't tap into that and I use that
with gear also terms of Android and iOS
the support is limited you can't use any
Android phone you really can use certain
phones from LG and Samsung including the
Google Nexus 5 and on iphone it's iPhone
4s and better you got to use iOS 6 or 7
on Android you have to use jelly bean
4.3 or later navigating with the life
band touch also means you have to press
this button to cycle through modes you
also can swipe and you can tap for
certain areas so you know if to remember
the right pattern and make sure you're
not pressing and tapping instead of
swiping as otherwise you'll hit the
wrong sub menu button and if you want to
enter your daily goals you can only do
in terms of calories not steps taken
that doesn't make any sense for me you
can get better options out there in
fitness bands this does some basic stuff
nice to pair with heart rate but there
are other ones like the Garmin vivofit
that do that too so $150 for this seems
a little pricey and doesn't really go
anywhere that futuristic life band touch
is like one small step in a direction
where doesn't go far enough and I'm not
sure about those earphones
I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at the
LG life band touch and these separately
sold heartrate earphones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
