for a cyber weekend I'm Bridget Carey
this is your scene that update so you
want to find the bus tuck deals this
holiday weekend well I'm gonna coach you
on everything you need to know to be a
savvy shopper in under three minutes
deal hunting is serious business I was
raised in a time where you had to arm
yourself with a roll of wrapping paper
to bat away mobs of people if you wanted
one of the three we fits in the store
and you know what there was no
Thanksgiving shopping Black Friday I
meant Friday but technology has made us
soft it's not like that anymore
retailers are taking a sport out of the
hunt you can find sales already starting
now Amazon and Walmart are talking about
cyber monday deals before the turkey is
even thought out actually Walmart's
gonna start cyber monday deals on Sunday
so it's just one big cyber weekend now
and smartphones they're your most
important weapon in the war for your
wallet if you're going to a store use an
app to scan the barcodes of products
while you're in line to make sure you're
getting the lowest price if you find it
listed for a lower price at another
store the big retailers are gonna honor
that price even if it's at Amazon it
just needs to be from Amazon itself and
not a third party seller you can barcode
scan using the camera on your phone with
apps like shop savvy red laser and also
Amazon's app has a barcode scanner and
speaking of Amazon you may see deals
exclusively on the app this year like a
50 inch HDTV for a hundred and fifty
dollars target is also pushing people to
its kids wishlist app by offering 10%
off on toys on the list this is the best
time to buy big-ticket tech items like
game systems and televisions actually
you'll probably see a few 4k Ultra HD
TVs on sale and it's sort of a good time
to go into 4k but out of all those on
sale Friday we're only recommending the
Vizio M 60 c3 it's $800 at delcom and
maybe Amazon is gonna have it too also
it's worth looking into Smart TVs with
Roku streaming Texan side TCL makes a 32
inch Roku TV that only costs 125 bucks
at Amazon and Walmart now is also when
you're gonna find deals on Apple
products target has Apple TV streaming
boxes
sale and as for the Apple watch Target
and Best Buy cut $100 off the price over
at seen it we have a list of the 31 best
Black Friday deals to help you plan
goggle is also offering tips on the best
time to go into stores by collecting
data on people with their location
turned on on their phones Google found
that there's a spike right when stores
open on Thanksgiving at around 6 p.m.
but the heaviest shopping time in stores
was between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. so if you
want to avoid the crowds it's best to
shop early in the morning
I remember don't stress out there's
going to be plenty of other deals and
sales filling your email inbox over the
next few weeks you can count on it
that's it for this tech news update and
there's more at cnet.com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
