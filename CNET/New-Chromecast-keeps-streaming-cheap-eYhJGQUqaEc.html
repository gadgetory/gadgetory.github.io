just 35 bucks in the u.s. the exact same
price is the old version this little
device is the cheapest way to stream
thousands of TV shows movies and songs
from hundreds of apps to your TV screen
it consists of a little circular puck
available in three colors stashed neatly
behind the TV however you'll probably
never see it this is short HDMI cable
attached and the device can either stick
to the HDMI plug via a magnet or tangle
free in the breeze you'll need to plug
in another cable for power either a
standard wall adapter or the USB plug on
your TV to use it you'll need an
internet connection with decent Wi-Fi
and a phone or tablet running a
chromecast app I'll use an Android phone
for this video but chromecast also
worked with iPads and iPhones one reason
it's so inexpensive is because it
doesn't include a remote control instead
your phone is the remote to use
chromecast you fire up an app on your
phone tap the cast button and the video
or song starts playing on your TV the
experience is a lot like using a normal
streaming device like a Roku or Apple TV
but using it I often missed having a
physical remote I'd like be able to
pause and rewind a show without having
to look at my phone and it was annoying
to have to keep unlocking my phone to
control the video the process of getting
something playing on the TV was usually
quite a bit slower too on the other hand
the new chromecast is faster load
content than the old one Google also
added support for five gigahertz Wi-Fi
connections which should improve
performance in crowded or interference
heavy locations my favorite addition
however is an all new chromecast app
which works equally well with both the
old and the new chromecast it shows a
bunch of videos across a range of apps
you have installed in your phone you can
search for Pacific shows or movies
across different apps and results
include pricing the app also has new
apps that are compatible with chromecast
as of today most major apps will work
with the device including Netflix Hulu
and Pandora as well as new editions
Spotify Showtime and coming soon sling
TV the biggest omission is Amazon whose
app doesn't support chromecast and
that's where tab casting comes in using
the Chrome browser on your computer you
can cast it the TV showing whatever
content is on there a web page Facebook
or even a video site like Amazon video
quality of i/o tab casting isn't better
than a dedicated app but it is better
than nothing
if you already own the original
chromecast there's a little reason to
get the new one unless you're
experiencing Wi-Fi connectivity issues
and I definitely don't consider it the
best streamer for every
use on the other hand the price is so
low you probably won't regret buying it
even if it's not your main streamer and
chances are you'll find some innovative
way to use the new chromecast I'm Debbie
