jason Heiner with bill Dettwiler and
today we're cracking open the Amazon
fire cube so bill tell us about what
Amazon's done with this device and why
we're cracking and open what we're gonna
do today yeah this is really cool
because what amazon has done is they've
taken their really popular alexa service
and their echo devices and basically
merged it together with their fire TV
devices and this device not only lets
you control the television via voice
commands but some of your other
components and so we thought it would be
a really cool idea to take this apart to
see what technology is inside it and to
see how it does that also as a bonus I
have a Amazon of fire TV stick and an
Amazon fire TV of third generation one
here I thought we could take those apart
as well and compare the technology
inside them to what's inside the fire
tbq fair again yeah so let's take this
thing apart here the first thing we're
gonna do is we're gonna remove the
rubber base you can just this there's
some double-sided tape on the rubber
base so if we slip a tool in here and
work our way around it we can pop this
off fairly easily like so and so we get
our first look at speaker inside the box
and there are four Torx screws down in
there we're gonna go ahead and remove
those all right with the screws loose we
are going to turn this over Wow the
screws to come out so you can see we
have one two three four screws and four
washers it's always a good idea whatever
we're taking things apart to try and
keep track of your screws and keep track
of what goes in what position with the
with the screws out we can now lift out
the guts the internal components of the
device away from the plastic shell and
so there we go we have our first look
inside the fire TV cube also down in
here we see the speaker assembly there
are no wires connecting to
speakers we flip this over we can take
the speaker out and the speaker here is
for Alexis feedback that you get
obviously the audio that comes from the
your signal your streaming signal would
come out of your TV or your AV receiver
whatever you have and there are no wires
I found this really interesting there is
just a contact there that connects the
speaker to the internal components and
now we turn our attention to the main
components here we have a pair of
circuit boards one on the bottom which
has the inputs here the power inputs the
HDMI outputs the IR blaster output and
then we have a USB output here that goes
with a it has Wi-Fi but you can use it
with an Ethernet network adapter we see
these small little cables here that
connected to the connected to boards or
these are likely 10 of cables and
there's a flat cable here that connects
the connection board so we're going to
go ahead and remove those so Jason now
that we have the amazon firetv cube out
of its case yeah we can kind of see one
of the ways that the device can control
your other components right so it can
control your AV receiver it can control
your TV through the HDMI port if your
devices support that but for devices
that are not connected through an HDMI
cable it can use infrared so it has a
series of these IR blasters all around
the device look at all of them yeah so
it can sort of create it sort of bathed
the area around it in an IR signal and
that allows it to control things like
your cable TV box other devices maybe
that don't necessarily that aren't
connected directly to it with an HDMI
cable so billon would you couldn't just
put this on top of your device right you
would have to put it next to it or
slightly in front of it or do that
doesn't range it positions important
with this device for a devices that may
be in a cabinet yeah for devices that
aren't close to it if you want to set it
behind the device and it can't the
signal can't reach the front of the
device or wherever their receiver is
they actually do have
a little extender here that is at the
bottom of it I actually had to use this
I've been using the device for about a
week and I had to use this cumi
for my cable box all right let's go
ahead and we're gonna take the I'm gonna
keep this assuming this device we're
going to take the circuit board off
we're gonna separate the control board
at the top and we'll see what's inside
this metal body part of it here too
whenever we're taking these devices
apart we try to be really careful and
not break any of the cables or the
connectors with this around like this I
don't like the yank cable nope so now we
can see inside here there's nothing
inside the space and we can see the
cable is attached here with some
adhesive so we have to be that's why
we're real careful not to separate not
to force those remote them we don't see
any screws holding on the circuit board
here at the bottom so what we're gonna
do is I'm gonna try and see if we can't
it probably just some adhesive it and it
just pops loose there was some thermal a
little bit of thermal fishing here more
screws
and so here what we can see here the
contacts for the control buttons on the
top usually and I can remove a little
rubber buttons themselves and we can see
the contacts a and we could for the
control buttons we can see the LEDs the
button over here we can see the row of
LEDs there's a blue light that appears
you know multicolor light that can
appear on the first of this or the front
of the device and here the LEDs here now
we'll turn our attention back over to
the circuit board here and we'll see if
we can't remove the metal shields
these are RF electromagnetic metal
shields up and they fly off you're not
careful yeah and now we get our first
look at the chips underneath all right
bill so we've got everything apart the
amazon firetv cube and a couple of the
other Amazon devices tell us what we're
looking at and what we learn yeah so
it's really cool to see the technology
that makes a fire TV an Alexa enabled
device and kind of like an echo so what
you're holding is the fire TV stick and
the fire TV a third generation fire TV
and you can really see the similarities
in the chips if they're basically almost
identical on the third generation fire
TV and the fire TV cube it's got an AM
logic processor it's an S 905 Z and the
one difference is the fire TV cube has a
twice as much storage as the fire TV
this one has a SanDisk chip in it for
the storage what's really interesting is
you can see the progression of the
technology from the fire TV stick to the
fire TV to the fire TV cube and we can
see the technology that is required to
sort of make this on like an echo and an
Alexa enabled device without using the
remote so it's really cool to see that
all right so you have seen it the Amazon
fire TV Cube cracked open find all of
our cracking opens on CNET all of our
cracking open photos
on sister site TechRepublic and if you
have a device that you'd like to see us
crack open next leave us a note in the
comments we're always looking for new
stuff to break apart to learn about and
to share our insights with you so thanks
for watching and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
