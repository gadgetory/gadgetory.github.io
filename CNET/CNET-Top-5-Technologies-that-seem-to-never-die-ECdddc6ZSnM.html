never seem to die at number five gesture
controllers we've been controlling
computers with keyboards and pointing
devices for a very long time but every
now and then we look to use something
else like gestures we saw the power
glove you force the wii and the kinect
in the video game world these days
things like the leap motion exists to
control your pc with a wave of your hand
but no gesture control system anywhere
has truly taken over the world yet at
number four smartwatches for some reason
a watch just can't be a watch remember
the Casio databank what about the Timex
data link spot watches and today's
generation of watches including the
Samsung gear s2 and the Apple watch for
some reason we can't let go of the
concept of a SmartWatch at number three
the stylist bill gates touted pen
computing in 2002 over a decade ago
Steve Jobs declared the stylist to be
unnecessary with the introduction of the
iphone so what happened the stylus is
still not dead check out the galaxy note
the surface pro and the iPad pro with
pencil accessory at number 2 virtual
reality being somewhere you're not is a
dream of many of us socially awkward
people many movies have shown off the
glory of VR but so far nothing in
reality has ever matched the fiction
we've seen on screen but PR refuses to
die even after the Nintendo Virtual Boy
gave it a go and at number one the
technology that refuses to die 3d in the
1950s 3d movies were introduced it was a
big gimmick to get people into theaters
wearing red and blue glasses didn't
become the future of the medium for a
while 3d lay dormant except for the few
movies and wanted to get more moviegoers
in seats however in the early 2000s 3d
movies using polarized lenses change
things and that's how we see a lot of 3d
content now one day we might truly enjoy
3d without glasses and that's why 3d
won't die after over 60 years I'm at is
