sighted on seen it i am your host Eric
Mack in Taos New Mexico and also joining
us today there in POV in San Francisco
we've got Terry Collins from cnet and
we've also got Bonnie Burton and kelsey
Adams and Stephen Beecham behind the
board and as well from Hillary Clinton's
headquarters here on this election day
in new york city tech republics dan
patterson is going to be joining us in
just a minute but to to start things off
I should let you all know we're going to
be talking about the election what what
got us here exactly what got us to this
day in history what role did technology
play in getting us to this historic
election and what role is technology
going to play in our democracy going
forward if you want to join the
conversation as it unfolds we're on
twitter at cnet and i'm at erics emac
will be monitoring those tweets there's
also a couple of chat rooms going on if
you want to get in on the conversation
at livestream.com / cnet / far-sighted
and also at youtube.com slash cnet
there's a chat room there as well but to
get things started I'm going to take a
little bit of a point of privilege as
the host and do a little introductory
rant here to set up our discussion as
the future of our democracy hangs in the
balance so I'm going to start with a
prediction and then a couple of
anecdotes and no i'm not going to pick a
winner instead what I'm going to say is
that this election is historic for a
reason that isn't yet being acknowledged
uh yes the candidates are historic but
when we look back on the insanity of
2016 we will realize I think that this
was the first truly online election I
mean past campaigns were defined by
online fundraising sure social media
started to play a major role in 2012 but
this has been a pivotal election in
which I submit what happened online
matter just as much or more than what
happened
wine whether it was the conversation and
organizing around social media viral
videos featuring the likes of ken Bohn
and billy bush or even the really weird
role played by WikiLeaks and apparently
Russian hackers whatever it is this Lex
this election has been driven by the
internet I mean a really weird thing
happened in 2016 in my personal life as
a result a lot of my favorite shows
maybe you guys experienced this suddenly
became less enjoyable like house of
cards and black mirror were a little
less entertaining because the truth of
this election has been even stranger
than those fictions I mean 20 years ago
it seemed like the internet was destined
to be a unifying force that would bring
humanity together instead it seems like
it's allowed us to build alternate
universes and be more divided than ever
so today we're going to talk about 2016
whether or not you guys agree with me
that it's the first election to really
take place online and then later we'll
look forward to future campaigns you
guys see where I'm going here so um
let's say hi to everybody everyone a
chance to say hi how we doing there in
the studio we're doing good cool yeah
awesome why I brought my Hillary Clinton
prayer candle I made it I mean I figure
at this point I will do any kind of
crafting that will generate positive
vibes towards towards you know one
candidate in particular I tried to be
objective but I'm sorry I can't well one
of you guys at the poker table has to
show your card exactly to get things
started let's uh let's kick it out to
dan patterson really quick you can do
that for me Stephen cuz he's at the
Hillary Clinton headquarters there in
New York City we want to find out what's
going on there on the ground as we're
about to probably start getting the
first results back in an hour so all
right so i am at the jacob javits center
here in Manhattan and it's a crisp night
we can from the west side here we have
this view through the glass building of
the Empire State Building and the new
yorker hotel and if I pivot a little bit
here you can see me doing kind of an
empty stand up here I'll show you
everything except me we are on the
second mezzanine level and you can see
there the media
is my credential stop at that door the
media is preparing to do full-on
broadcast that starts in about an hour
behind me here you can see stand-ups
from most major news organization we are
the press reporters are down there in
the press file but for right now we're
up awaiting it sounds like it sounds
like we're awaiting some early ballot
closures here in about 15 minutes hey
Dan what's the vibe like right there
people excited are they tired what's
going on yeah so the vibe is as you can
hear in the background it's noisy and I
wouldn't say it's it's excited it's a
different vibe from the DNC there is a
sense of relief there is a sense of
jubilation here there's a sense of
tension but also kind of professional
you know the whole campaign the Clinton
campaign has been very machine-like
they've been very efficient they've done
everything from geo TV that's that's the
get out of the boat ground game stuff
all the way to the big data stuff that
we've been covering over at techrepublic
they've done all of those things really
efficiently and I would say this is no
different it's vastly different than the
scene at Trump Tower I was over there
earlier today and forget about accessing
that building it is literally barricaded
off by massive dump trucks full of sand
it really feels I'm not taking a
partisan position to say this it feels
like em today isn't there a drill our
huh down here it kind of feels like well
the city is sparkling over what may be
an early night here and thank everybody
kind of hope so it's so weird to see the
Javits Center without like cosplayers
because I only go there for near
comic-con so when you like show that
view I'm expecting to see like at least
one Batman does anyone dressed like
Hillary that's exactly right it's you
know the last time I was here I checked
in on facebook to a DC Comics panel and
I think to a Green Lantern event and man
I kind of wish I was checking into that
same
event a different kind of nerd here
tonight but it's it's like there's
different costs players to everyone's
dressed up just a different type of cost
can't see nation yeah I hope there's at
least one pant suit I'm seeing lots of
pant suits dan let's see you we haven't
seen you yet our audience opposed to see
who you are there's yeah the the stand
up I need a shooter you know you still
you can take the tech reporter at attack
i'm still gonna wear a hoodie I'm not
gonna may have a blazer and a collared
shirt on still gonna write on Stephen
asked AHA Stan to give you know kind of
his final thoughts of the role that you
know the online world played in this
election okay what are people thinking
and feeling in Silicon Valley hey Dan so
uh Eric just had a question what do you
think the final role of the internet
played in this election this time around
I think that in 2008 we kind of had this
emergence this glimmer of a thing that
we call social media today in 2012 there
was this merging of big data and in
social media you know in Ohio famously
the Obama campaign in southern Ohio in
2012 the Kennedys did they they almost
knew that they would win those those
last few counties there this campaign
the role of the Internet is paramount
not just from messaging and
communication distribution which we see
the social media but with what's called
micro targeting and gotv get out the
vote that is into the people if you live
in a swing state or a battleground state
you know the Canvassers that knock on
your door you know the the mail that
comes to hear the direct mail isms your
inbox the email the phone calls all of
that micro targeting it's very old media
kind of stuff all of that is driven now
by big data companies like l2 analytics
l2 lets me not just look at a model of
people like me it lets me look up me and
see my income level my security number
my voting history and with that kind of
data campaigns can
target messaging for individuals not
just excuse me not just models of
individuals so the role of the Internet
is that technology drives everything now
and especially big data cool anyone else
have any questions it's funny because I
was hoping with the Internet age I would
get less mailers and it seemed like
every single day my mailbox was crammed
with a ton of fliers for every single
candidate every single ballot issue and
we've in California we pretty much
covered the entire alphabet that we had
to double up letters to like get
everything on the ballot so everything
it was just I was like and I was kind of
hoping okay maybe in the Internet age
I'll just get emails and texts but we
won't have this but nope still as many
mailers and it was kind of crazy how
that old school door to door policy with
you know Canvassers still happen so yeah
and in fact it's amplified by big data
in social media so when I say they can
see a profile of you I mean they can
literally like I can login to l2 or
another one Cambridge analytica that had
Ted Cruz's data they also did the Donald
Trump state operation I can log into a
dashboard and and look up you so the
mailing that comes to they they think
three seconds of exposure means enough
so that a candidate or an issue becomes
top of mine they're all about this thing
called Toma top of mind awareness and
just putting something in your hand it's
kind of the same thing is you know you
can type a note never knowed and it's a
little different than when you jot down
notes by hand that like physical action
kind of lodges stuff in your memory and
the same thing with direct mail so the
stuff that jams your inbox all of that
stuff they hope they get three seconds
of exposure so that they can be top of
mind awareness so that when you go to
the ballot box you may not actually know
what you're voting about but you know
that you're voting for something that
you saw
and Terry you know it seemed like more
than ever with this election you know
you've been covering the role that you
Twitter and so other social media
platforms have played it seems like
whenever you know the campaigns or
anyone wants to take the temperature of
the electorate these days the easiest
way to do it is that is on Twitter does
that seem right to you oh yeah definite
I mean cuz how many of us you know we
watch the debates we we had our
smartphones or we had a screen we were
we were on Twitter you know we were you
know looking to see what others were
saying and trying to get the pulse and
it just became yeah I just became second
nature we were group watching the
debates yeah yeah we go me yeah because
we weren't alone we all had similar
sentiments and some of us whether we
didn't have to really treat if we watch
because someone else and thousands of
others were doing it for us yeah at this
point I feel like we're group watching
everything on Twitter and Facebook live
and whatever so it's like I don't even
have to watch award shows because I know
who won based on like what's happening
on Twitter and same with watching season
finales of shows like Game of Thrones
are walking dead or whatever and I think
the big thing with this election and
Twitter are the hashtags that have come
out of it like the nasty woman and the
bad ombres and like all of these like
tags that come out you know just
everything that Trump said earlier
before that everything that Trump says
or Hillary says in the debates has
turned into some sort of hashtag t-shirt
slogan so it's almost like social media
is driving not necessarily the
propaganda but the bite-sized like you
know sound sound points of everything
that the candidates have said and I mean
I mean obviously what Trump did I mean
basically Trump won the GOP nomination
using Twitter I mean yeah Twitter was
his setup and then by the time he got to
debates he was knocking the other
candidates down you know and then it and
then when he was done with that he would
act the Twitter and knocked him down
some more yeah ironically Trump is
already like basically broken Twitter's
terms of service when it comes to
bullying and he still has a Twitter
account so I pretty much right and then
Twitter was a big news story this week
where his campaign made him get off
Twitter for the last week of the
election he was banned from Twitter
withdrawal right then Obama's using
Twitter as like if he can't tweet if his
own campaign can't trust him tweet how
can we trust him to have nuclear codes
so twitter is like
such a big argument in this in this
whole election the abutments have
actually been talking about Twitter and
quite a negative way I've watched
several of their speeches and they keep
saying like you know don't just tweet oh
do you trust a man who just tweets as if
that in itself were bad you know they
spun it around on on on Trump and I
couldn't i can imagine his campaign
taking the you know taking them off
twitter because we would have we kind of
missed out because he would have been
tweeting all night about anything and
everything you know leading up he'd
probably been you know round-the-clock
campaigning if he he could just what it
would have allowed to do that unless he
was tweeting a three in the morning or
something yeah and also you have to keep
in mind i feel so bad for both sides us
like campaign people because especially
the social media person I've been a
social media person for different
companies I know how sometimes companies
think of that as an afterthought or a
joke or just an extension of marketing
they don't really see it as its own
thing and in this campaign I always feel
bad for the campaign managers who are
that part of the social media team they
have to deal with this and they have to
figure out like what's going on with
Trump and whether or not and thing to it
like you have to keep in mind a lot of
celebrities and politicians have an
actual writers room that's in charge of
their social media or his Trump I think
it's a lot of just him tweeting and
maybe a couple other people night you
know what night yeah bad yeah so instead
of him you know thing of his next
business deal or whatever he turned the
Twitter for his campaign oh one thing I
just want to bring I think what the most
striking things that I came across this
year when we're all were not in
Cleveland for the RNC you know and I and
I ran a new game Burton in which is
flat-out said you know Trump basically
you know won the nomination of social
media that was I was you know it was
something i would expect to have heard
from somebody younger or even even I was
younger made with millennial or smile
attack but to hear from Newt Gingrich it
was it was striking I and had one of the
things that just stands out to me how
Trump used the platform use social media
to his advantage well in also tearing up
I think what you just said tori is is
such it illuminates how the two
candidates really
use technology in the web Trump would
just tweet by himself in just really raw
emotion away whereas the Clinton team
had what they called snack size or bite
size bed teams that were creating
vertical social media for specific
platforms just like in put in a moment
ago you know there was a team that was
creating snapchat videos and Instagram
pictures and tweets were real tightly
composed as though they were from
professional writers because they were
by professional writers whereas what
Trump was it was just crude and raw and
visceral yeah exactly yeah exactly
exactly but that's also like part of
trumps charm though for a lot of his
supporters is that they think he tells
it like it is that he talked off the
cuff like he doesn't have things
pre-written and even though some of us
like some other like his non supporters
are probably like well yeah that makes
him sound crazy you know there is
something to be said of not having a
writers room like having a politician
say what they actually think is kind of
a novel idea because most politicians
have spin doctors most politicians have
writers most politicians don't write
their own speeches so I think for a lot
of Trump supporters it's this is part of
his appeal is that you what you see is
what you get and that could be good or
bad but there's not a lot of like
spinning going on his Twitter account
exactly he forced he ports Hillary
Clinton to respond back on Twitter I
mean she had to Bob where's you know
some of the Republican candidates were
hesitant and by the time they thought
about doing it it was too little too
late but he also gave her one of her big
social media successes by calling her
nasty woman in the debate suddenly
everybody's like yeah we're fired up
we've got a hashtag yeah it worked a lot
better than things they had tried to
create how quick did that turn into to
instantly is it like Dan remember you
remember that night when you know you
just like DD just say that and we had to
like go back you're doing stories good
to go back and make sure you know that
was said we looked into a started
trending things like I me to go back and
capture that and put it into our story
to make sure we reflect at the moment
cuz if you have a good setup because you
just want says you ask you won't lie
cool what you know I was watching
and I was just laying I was retweeting
that in seconds you know I bought the
t-shirt like in 10 minutes like it's so
funny like how much merchandise has been
made just based on Twitter hashtags of
this campaign right o Shanter can't make
any money off you did it's funny because
he also gotten a lot of trouble for
tweeting stuff like in the past thick
years ago right cuz he said something
like the Chinese or what was it a global
warming as a is a specially by the
Chinese and then in the debate he's like
I never said that I never said that and
then everyone's like yes you did use
your tweet yes I'm happen to a lot of
Internet is forever I think that's why a
lot of politicians are not that
interested in posting things on Twitter
because they know it might come back and
bite him like later in a campaign or
something but it was almost like I felt
like I was sometimes with Trump it's
like watching live action Nixon tapes or
something like he's saying stuff that
most of us wouldn't think politicians
would say but again like I said with
twitter I think he's just writing things
off the cuff and he doesn't really
necessarily think but then again people
want honesty and maybe that's what they
perceive as honesty yeah and Terry you
covered the Hillary for prison a hashtag
you remember that one that wasn't it
yeah yeah that you know I yeah you know
and and uh not now look back make sure
that wasn't a misspelling too but then
you start seeing just it was just
exploding throughout throughout the day
and just inescapable because they were
just trying to find another way see if
they could you know take aim take shots
at a Clinton so look at create
creativity that I guess you know Trump
supporters or anti-clinton backers uh
the limbs that they went through you
know this is what social media brought
upon because I really don't remember
seeing this for years ago with the Obama
and Romney to this level now you know
for all you know just just just like
really just like a better work just
brought out me yeah yeah I remember from
the 2012 I remember binders full of
women and I was under the one thing that
took off but this time around it's it's
like every single day and and the what
the one who's talking about the story
what if i'm correct was they were trying
to get the hashtag Hillary for is
to trend but Twitter had flagged it and
so then they deliberately misspelled it
and got that to trend aneta yeah oh yeah
that's what happy any hatred had a good
good run right um right you know I don't
know if you guys have experienced this
but it feels to me like this election
cycle you know we're in the media so
we're you know cut we're probably on
social media and different media outlets
more than anyone but if you go and you
talk to a kind of a normal person who's
not in tech or not in media I I have
noticed that for this election the
gatekeeper for you know their
information about the election it's not
really the networks or the editors of
any particular media outlet this time
around the gatekeeper for their
information on this election is the
Facebook algorithm and that seems to be
determining what information people are
taking about this election do you see
that too yeah can't say this it on up
dance till date around you can hear you
yeah so so I started and I did when I um
in Cleveland what would you what we saw
was the transitioning of um I guess what
was what was dead like press row at the
convention to like meteor row and we saw
how much big presence that that facebook
twitter youtube you know google how they
all had so right now they're like
working with the traditional networks on
this for years from now I swear you at
Danny group facebook is going to be its
own network alphabet is going to be its
own and I probably have come sells out
there call themselves something but
they're going to be networks in their
own right whether it's a foil orbits
give me the likes of how when Fox first
started I just built for you sir no
they're gonna have more of an impact on
election and a bit bigger saying that
outside the four years ago is called an
eight years ago and actually you know 30
years ago it's called a radio row right
you never it's like like this like a
conveyor belt of radio station hosts who
are all there to deliver the news
you have guests come in they go down
like like you can bear about now it's
called meteor row and I think Terry
everything that you just said is kind of
summed up by by that shift that we will
continue to see it is not just that the
old guard might go away they're they're
going away and the new guard is here the
they are at the door yeah we're going to
be glued to stymie we're going to be
watching this on our toes remember we're
gonna be odd it's giving our laptops or
tablets smartphones we're going to it's
going to be so so mobile and so portable
to where if we thought I was inescapable
now it's going to be more than knowing
the other like last night I watched
Hillary Hillary's a big event in
Philadelphia with like thousands i watch
that on Facebook live I didn't watch it
on television was like staring at iphone
watching it so I mean it's just it seems
natural now like that's just how we get
all our information so well also like
you're saying the gatekeepers are going
away so like with the you know what's
happening with the pipeline and the
Native American tribes and all that I
learned on Facebook live there wasn't
any hardly any media coverage I saw
about that like the media jumped on at
after yes you also have to
remember media is a company like all
these news outlets newspapers you seen
it obviously I mean we're all beholdin
to what we'll do well traffic wise also
you have to remember advertising is
still always going to be important to
all these people so you it's interesting
to see how there's more citizen
journalism going on and because of that
after it gets a certain amount of
trending or buzz then the major news
outlets jump on it but then again I mean
that's kind of the world we live in now
we're news is now driven by YouTube
captures and you know keeping checks and
balances with police and politicians and
government all of this is happening
because people are getting out their
phones and recording video and they're
capturing evidence of wrongdoing or
evidence of what's actually happening in
real time it's not doctored video it's
live so so yeah we're going to we're
going to view evolutionist up where you
know can't be debating you're gonna have
unscheduled
unsupervised abase but they're like
pop-up pop-up to be pretty much every
square i'll get each other whether it's
could be through social media or another
another medium yeah you know it's you
know it's going to happen so if you
follow like these candidates it's going
to be a 24-7 job if you thought it
wasn't who you thought was already
enough you know it's gonna be more it's
gonna take multiple people looking at
them around o'clock I mean I mean it was
11 stretch with with Trump just a few
weeks ago where I didn't I didn't sleep
almost on the guy nah-uh debate night
you know I just stayed up because you
know when Trump I thought he lost you
gonna run the Twitter and start saying
something ya know to add on I know
there's a lot of tired journalists out
there I mean here's the thing i think as
a journalist and I think anyone that's
watching this that's reporting for a
media outlet or something even if
blogger you just know that it's kind of
up to journalists to find the facts and
the mess because we're totally
overwhelmed with information with tweets
with interviews with video and it's kind
of up to us to go through it all and
find out what the meaning is you know
what the why as opposed to the who what
where when so I am excited to see how
this election turns out but i think the
reporting after the election is going to
be just as crazy to see okay well what
happens because whoever wins there's
going to be a protest maybe a riot it
doesn't matter at this point people are
so amped up on both sides that'll be
very interesting to see the outcome you
know six hours from now of hopefully
we're not in an apocalyptic state but
you never know so I'm hoping it goes
well for whoever wins I hope there's
peace that's that's all I care yeah I'm
not worried about the any riots any
major riots always but let's go a little
further down that road that you were you
were going there Terry in terms of you
know where things are heading because I
mean if we're looking at future
elections now for eight years down the
road you know obviously the mobile
revolution and the social media
revolution the data revolution will
continue to progress but on top of that
for eight years from now we could have
some pretty interesting things in terms
of machine learning and artificial
intelligence and
you know even weird robotics and you
know genetic engineering I mean these
are actually technologies that are
nascent right now how does that how does
head of things like that begin to play a
role on our democracy and how we vote
even even just for eight years from now
maybe damn I maybe one a little gay like
this cannons are gonna start having
their own channel I mean trouble
troubles right Trump is experimenting
right so he's gonna things up being a
pioneer cans are going to have their own
channel they're gonna be there and go on
whenever they want to they're not gonna
not going to have that sit down with us
or or any other media they're gonna
they're going to spout and pontificate
whenever they whenever they want to and
it's going to be like either Your Honor
you miss it you know you'll have to
replay it I just you know not so much
we're gonna be the middleman they're
just gonna have another platform to say
their messages whenever whenever they
want to and you still there because I
know you did a lot in regards to to what
Eric was referring to in terms of the
bottom in the AI and how that's going to
play a row ah you know regarding
candidates following the message I think
maybe this is the first game paper we've
seen that happen in force or in mass and
I think that like as much as we joke out
at Trump may start as a team member you
know they are kind of what I was talking
about earlier with the Clinton campaign
creating vertical social media for
different specific platforms just like
we saw a convergence with devices we
will see more and more convergence with
immediate types on platforms by that i
mean like live streaming and more
immediate types of consumption and i
think that like not only can that unify
base it can atomizer base and i think
that we're seeing that right now with
the republican party where there are
just and we saw that during the
primaries with the democratic party you
know they're there are underserved
portions of the basis of both parties
that were able to
and I I don't know rise up isn't the
right word it's 2 hyperbolic but they we
were we heard we've looked under a
different part of the rock if you use
the the Rossi mother Rock metaphor and I
think that we're going to hear and see
things that we may not always like and
once you've atomized something can you
congeal it can you bring it back
together is there any way we can unify
people or are you just going to get
especially with algorithms and AI and
stuff like you know the UN is working
with Google to to work on more positive
search results in marginalized places
facebook is doing similar stuff are we
going to see AI and algorithms have a
kind of dark impact in the future I
don't know I think maybe it may not be
as ugly as as this this election season
all right but I think a tone has been
set to know how far you know cannons can
possibly go and they'll dope they'll
they'll do heat checks to see you know
when to Ratchet it up and when it when
it tone it down yeah I think I think
that's where I think that's where it's
going to go from here on I think the bow
is gonna be pushed in there won't be
sibilities going to have a new term so
here's here's a little insight into side
or exciting oh good sorry sorry Terry
Eric Eric stalking right I'm sorry good
Eric so here's a little tip it into the
some insight into the the dark side of
AI that Dan was mentioning there so this
is a study that just came out this week
from some engineers at the University of
Southern California and they used a
state-of-the-art bought detection
algorithms apparently to analyze
election related tweets from about a
month period in September and october
and they found that BOTS produced 3.8
million of the election related tweets
on Twitter or nineteen percent mmm
that's that's like black pure in real
life
man haha yeah that's guys just think
just think what's gonna be from here huh
hey so I mean should we uh should we cut
damn loose since he's walking around
with the phone like this for Dan yeah
what what our dance final thoughts you
have any final thoughts Dan don't hate
this is your belly better brutal
campaign but like must speak with each
other you know the only final thoughts I
have is that you know seen it and in
collaboration with tech Republican ZDNet
it was just a true pleasure to work with
you guys hosting the show with Terry
Andrew mag get the conventions Oh Laura
on cybersecurity stories I mean the team
seen it is most well known for
technology reporting and I think it was
very courageous of everybody to jump on
something that was kind of outside of
the vehicle house and do just badass
reporting all year so thank you guys for
having me and Terry man go cats go thank
you all rights pleasure for the pleasure
when I done yet dude so all right I'll
jump vodka all right let's take care
fine you in a bit hey thank you
guys yeah umm so so kelsey i'm curious
to hear your thoughts on where you think
the future of elections might be headed
well one thing I've definitely noticed
is that getting my news from the
internet which is what I primarily do
these days is really eroding my sense of
what's real yeah because everything is
I'm just looking everything on Twitter I
don't have time to research it all and i
watch fake news programs you know so I'm
used to evaluating something is probably
probably true probably not true dicey
look at that later eighty percent true
but I don't care because I agree with
them so that's good enough for me you
know and so the effect of that is I'll
see something i'll be watching a news
program and they'll be like well Trump
says he said this here's video if I'm
saying this other thing and your first
reaction is kind of like oh so it's a
toss up no no you actually saw video
proof of that happening but but we're
becoming kind of fun word from reality
now with this kind of national gas
lighting I mean but even not just him
but just the whole abstract nature of it
but on the other hand we did
used to photoshop we did all kind of
learn that a photo just because you see
it doesn't mean it's real and we learned
how to deal with that and still make
intelligent decisions right so I think
we can adapt to this hopefully it is
very you pointed out to me Kelsey that
apparently Adobe's working on an app
that could make it easier to to fake
spoken words like so it's like Photoshop
for audio like inserting that fast yeah
yeah inserting words that people didn't
say in da like video clips audio clip
sins which is anarchy on the way right i
mean again we're gonna have to find
other ways of judging what's real or
white as they saw the news source yeah
at this point it's like the only thing i
consider real now is live so either I'm
seeing it with my own eyeballs and I'm a
first-person witness or it's live on the
internet because I don't know if they've
figured out a way to dr. live video well
you can see something that had been live
earlier alright then it is a live thing
but then somebody could add spoken words
to that I feel like they're making it
harder for us to determine what's real
what's not and that's a scary thought
not just for us but for the courts you
know when video evidence is no longer
going to be considered real evidence you
know cuz obviously doctored photos are
always an issue in court trial so who
knows what's going to happen with that
but I I don't have a heavy heavy pre pre
trial screwed I know it's it that's the
problem too with something as that is as
important as an election you know I
talked to my parents you aren't very
tech savvy at all and I think they get
the majority of their facts from talk
radio which is a whole other problem um
and I don't even know if I should be
saying that because we're kind of talk
radio right now so I'm being a hypocrite
but you know everyone gets their facts
from what they think is a trusted source
which may not be a trusted source it may
be just a very opinionated slant and but
that's humans that's how we are so it's
an interesting election to see how its
folding out on social media the problem
two is that Hillary wasn't a social
media star like Donald Trump was at the
get-go I mean Donald was already a
reality TV star wars hillary was a
politician and so it's basically seeing
a politician
up against a Kardashian that's what it
felt like for me at least where it was
you know public public opinion and
popularity were the mainstay of social
media not necessarily facts public
opinion colas is so fast on social media
exactly exactly so we'll see I mean
we've been stories on cnet though I
think it was this week about a goat that
can predict the winner that's right
Scottish goat yeah so I'm kind of going
with the goat like on this like I feel
like at this point I don't even want to
trust a human I'm gonna destroy scouts
from the game just from the goat sure
get go sharks pick Trump though you see
that I don't trust arks I seen circuit
I've seen all the sharknado movies I
know what can happen do you mean yeah
there it is Eric sir that's ironic it's
Trump in the goat take Clinton so yeah
this is what we've come down to now is
just talk about sharks and goats because
we're just overwhelmed with information
and suffering election fatigue that's
fine um Bonnie I assume you would
support a robot um yeah I said that many
times I'm getting to the point now where
I've just fed up with humanity like this
is a whole other podcast we could be
shocking but I you know again we you
know mentioning AI and whether or not
maybe we should just give up and just
let a I take over uh I don't know like I
honestly I at this point i'm so tired of
the election I'd vote for a self-driving
car I'm just i I think robots they were
very logical they just don't have
compassion but there's something to be
said about us being so desensitized to
daily violence and daily everything that
we're kind of robotic in a sense and we
are either overly passionate or we've
just given up so I I don't know I I
don't want to I don't want my last
thoughts about the election to sound
like such a downer but honestly I'm just
I want it to be over one way or another
and I think though seriously though in
the near maybe not the near future maybe
black mirror future we could see maybe
you know a lil possible elected that's
not human that's an robot we just give
up we just give it up to an algorithm I
know that sounds really futuristic and
stupid but at this point I have no idea
what the future holds and I
humanity better you now shape up and
we're going to replace each other with
robots that can do a better job well it
better start campaigning in the next
year that's how that's how it's going
out candidates campaign for like two
years so midway through someone's term
they're already campaigning so is there
something we should look out for to see
like who's being set up for future yeah
can you predict any don't say Kardashian
but can you maybe GOP maybe maybe maybe
Ryan I think Bryan's gonna be pushed to
to uh do something you know he's the
only gonna be like the last man standing
I mean look at from I guess the start of
Obama's second term like when the GOP
can you think of you know what I'm
thinking in order to do for another
actor cuz we you know Ronald Reagan was
an actor and he was an Arnold Arnold an
actor and I feel like you know you're
spoiling my card sure like well I mean a
real actor not reality star uh you know
like I've been binge-watching west wing
on netflix and I'm like God I would have
liked voted for him in real life if
Martin Sheen Ryan like I would totally
be and here's the thing like we
definitely joke about this but Ronald
Reagan I mean he acted with the chimp
and he still got to be President like I
feel like a lot of people want to
believe in kill the debates people that
can make us believe their president and
in a way that takes a lot of acting and
good acting and you have to be
personable and you have to be able to
have some charisma on camera and I mean
we've always I mean even all all the way
back to Kennedy it was all about
charisma on camera so I think maybe
tougher a robot to win because they
might not well yeah it's my now they
might have get to me I go I know
unfortunately that's wasn't that the
reason a lot of people hated Al Gore as
they thought he was too robotic so our
22 has charisma and like a personality
cuz no one knows what he's saying yeah
he's just beeping an attitude that
everyone just projects what they think
he's saying I know a lot of people
wanted to hang out with a lot of those
Cylons for quite a while battlestar like
hang out yeah faster ways to like did
you think like today to there's
possibility that maybe you know some
hacking could oh yeah oh yeah like oh
yeah
I'm brushing off my high school Russian
language books just in case like I don't
know what's going to happen but I was
honestly I thought because you remember
the attack that we had a couple weeks
ago where the internet went down I
honestly thought that was a test run for
today I thought for sure we were going
to get hacked and maybe I'm jinxing it
and we're about to get hacked right now
but I I honestly thought that we were
going to get some sort of hacking action
happening during election day but then
again there was a lot of hype you know
and and scare tactics going around about
that on the internet of whether or not
hackers were going to decide the
election and a mr. robot kind of way but
I I don't know i I don't I haven't heard
anything about it yet but there was a
headline earlier that a lot of the
voting machines in Utah were offline all
at the same time so I haven't heard a
follow up on that voting machines a lot
of the moderate swing these days yeah
well cheers a weird thing where they
could vote for Evan McMullen the Mormon
guy who's a third party all right we'll
see I mean at the end of the selection
whoever wins the other person is
probably gonna say it's rigged so we'll
find it bi if the internet and like all
streaming TV show down for half an hour
picture the panic I know or maybe the
calm cuz we have one hour of no one
yelling at each other but I don't know
like I during the debates I kept posting
animated gifts of cats being friendly
because I just couldn't stand all the
constant bile that was happening on
social media back and forth so I don't
know it speaking of which um I could
like bring it real quick I like a story
I'm still working on today about whether
if social media can call the election so
we're going to see on that we've been
working with a spread patent spread past
insights to get a sense of based on
social sentiment from voters can we get
a better sense of which came a win and
one of the things that they pointed out
that you know since this has been kind
of like the anti election and it been
kind of like all this negative sentiment
your name so you can we've all written
kind of storage of that negative
negative tone suddenly the tightest turn
where it was kind of like positive
sentiment today because people were
voting for person that they they want in
the bashing it kind of like society
because
ty gets a rosier candidate maybe
somebody he'll catch on and their
underside maybe though they'll vote for
them too I think it's also has to do
with relief everyone yeah yeah yeahs
think i will say there was a positive
article going around last night and
noticed that was trending on on facebook
and twitter that susan b anthony is
grave the cemetery kept the cemetery
opened late because people were putting
i voted stickers on her tombstone which
i thought was so poignant and lovely and
cool that a cemetery was like well yeah
let's let's keep it late open late and
let people do this to show their
appreciation because obviously having a
female candidate for president really
resonates with especially us of the
female gender because a hundred years
ago we weren't allowed to vote so there
were live streaming it yeah there are
live streaming the grave so it's
actually i don't know if we I I don't
know if we covered and seen at by
definitely do we okay good thank God we
covered in on cnet um but yeah things
like that like i like seeing positivity
of just being appreciative of democracy
in general instead of just having it be
bashing from both sides so hopefully
we'll see more articles like that of
people celebrating the fact that we can
even have an election where there's
still countries out there that are
through so much tour monal and
corruption that can't the live stream i
found how cool so Terry 538 or Princeton
wait in terms of have you been looking
at it like to have a favorite model for
a prediction or do you think you know
what um you know the goat isn't it no
you know honestly I was um I glanced I
glanced at both the sunday cuz I the
sending news shows and saw you know nate
silver but I've been inundated no I'm
gonna come down off of me so far I've
been inundated from all the other
platforms sending me stuff and using
them in the stories and things like that
that I've kind of relied on them because
they've been been accurate you know
they've been accurate since like even
with the debates you know with this
thing with with with Trump and and then
on the Democratic side you know with the
Bernie Sanders may never kind of like
spot-on on the sentence in some of that
stuff was resonating in with voters you
no neighbors they were doing what they
were saying you know with with Trump uh
he was waiting he was wasn't winning
like by he was it was landslide mid
stuff was playing out in the debates and
he's playing on social media and I'm you
thought conversely was gonna happen
maybe to a degree with with with burning
it did for a little bit but you know
Hillary you know what we can pull pull
it out but I'm social he was winning you
know leptin right but you know the
debates in a lot of people's eyes didn't
translate to two votes you know but but
he he also woke up voters to you know
and i think you know to that in the
Democratic Party and realizing what I
guess they they need to do you know if
they want to try to stay in office oh so
these prediction models are taking an
account both the online world we're all
participating in and more moral ground
based phone poll based other other
factors in other I mean there's other
stuff yeah I think yeah I think they're
better than the phone poles I think this
is just pure Ramos because they're
they're telling you directly no no
middleman I mean they're they're going
to social media to it's the gift and a
curse maybe with twitter is that you
have this at your disposal where you
just let out how you feel right there
and sometimes you may think oh I just do
that no but well people were doing it
was contain eous it was it was a
impactful and you know one of the
reasons I guess why while we were here
but that said I'm when covering like the
first debate like in you know all of
last year and seeing where it's gone now
just like God I did this all kind of
kind of have we saw it happen but didn't
think it would just go as far as what
Eric's had to lead off the show how you
know campaigns are never gonna be the
same again because we're going boating
is like the very last step to several
steps into campaigning now it feels like
the worst episode of American Idol ever
like the worst evening because I mean a
lot of people are saying to like
wouldn't it be great if we could just
vote via text why do we have to stand in
the
long lines even male voting sometimes
people forget that they're you know they
can mail in ballots they don't do it the
right time whenever and we've become a
country that we vote via phone so
quickly that we want everything
streamlined like that so if for me it
feels like I know election is a crazy
year depending on how funny Saturday
Night Live has become because right
because it feels like everyone i was
watching the debate I was like okay I
know exactly what you know Alec Baldwin
as Trump is going to do especially we
know the hovering behind her during the
debate and getting close and then you
know people adding the jaws theme song
you know and it just became I feel like
people were starting to watch the
debates not to glean some sort of
political evidence of what the
candidates stand for but for pure
entertainment value and it was people
were watching the debates just to see
what hashtags would come out of it so
it's almost become more of an
entertainment reality show which Trump
already has mastered with the apprentice
than an actual serious election like it
felt very much like am i watching SNL or
am i watching real life and we had that
problem with palin for sure where Tina
Fey was actually doing Palin better than
Palin I don't know it's Alec Baldwin has
done Trump as best as trying i think
trump still better as himself but it's
just interesting to me like how we deal
with stress through comedy and sometimes
comedy gives us more information than
the actual candidates i mean you
mentioned that you watch fake news shows
kind of like with Stephen Colbert and I
miss Stephen Colbert I wish he was a lot
I wish he hadn't gone straight and he
was still like doing comedy because now
I just you know go to why should we say
CBS I missed that political angle
because he was kind of like the
conservative folly you know and then we
do have like other shows clearly but the
last month he would've yeah I just I I'm
it i guess i miss when you sometimes
humor and comedy can bring out the facts
you know they can bring out things that
we didn't think of or a different point
of view so thank God we have comedy
going strong full force during the
election because not only does it take
off some of this dress but also gives us
insight into our own he
behavior but yeah it's it's been a crazy
election to the point where I'm glad
it's going to be over soon but like
scared people are scared I know I
mentioned iron apocalypse like in a in a
fun way but I mean I don't know what's
going to happen after the election I
just hope that people know that this is
a democracy and what happens happens
because of people voting
merriam-webster's website know what
happened right there Twitter header I
guess Stephen did you see the
merriam-webster Twitter header their
word of the day was Gotterdammerung what
is that that's like basically what
apocalypse oh you know fairy destruction
what do they know we don't write that's
that's an algorithm that picks that word
of the day right so everyone is kind of
like thanks for the help chilling out
yeah I am Webster well I i I've kind of
got see some words oh yeah Eric but what
it what I've got some words of
reassurance okay get some some final
thoughts but does stephen kelsey you
guys have anything else any final words
dad before we go or before democracy
ends I just can't wait for it to be over
hey it's over yeah a lot of people keep
saying that to where you Kelsey final
thoughts mandan I'm am okay well um I
guess so so my final words for for
farsighted today I guess are you know it
does sometimes seem that the Internet
has not turned out to be the unifying
force for global understanding
enlightenment and prosperity that many
Gen Xers or senior Millennials like
myself thought it was going to be back
in the 1990s I mean you know so the
Internet has always had its sketchy and
more disturbing corners but in 2016 I
feel like those corners really kind of
went mainstream like we've been talking
about it's it's like that really
terrifying scene in the ring and all the
internet crazy has crawled right out of
our screens and become flesh and blood
and a couple of quick stories I saw this
on both sides of the spectrum when I was
in Cleveland along with Terry for the
republican national convention over the
summer while i was there i spoke with a
man who was selling truckers for Trump
t-shirts outside the convention he told
me about a cabal of secret Muslims
DC provisions for imprisonment in
Obamacare all kinds of easily
demonstrably false assertions but you
know you can look this up this stuff up
online he would tell me it's all right
there on google and right it is but the
very next day i was speaking with some
activists associated with black lives
matter these were definitely not Trump
voters and one of them quickly steered
the conversation toward another vein of
easily falsifiable assertions including
the conspiracy theory that the world is
flat and again it is all right there on
Google so these are two of the people
who are in Cleveland at the convention
playing an active role in our democratic
process today and they're being
misinformed reaffirmed of their
misinformed opinions and organizing
real-world actions around those opinions
and it's all happening online and this
is to say nothing of the other
multitudes of people on the internet
that are just simply trolling harassing
and threatening one side or the other
all day long and after those two
encounters in Cleveland I actually lost
a lot of sleep I mean I was really
worried that the internet might be
destroying democracy but so but then on
the final day of the RNC I just was kind
of milling around downtown where the
protesters were on both sides there had
actually been worries at in Cleveland
that there was a contingent of bikers
for Trump who were showing up to do
security and there were worries that
they might clash violently with some of
the anti-trump protesters but there was
a massive police presence and there were
a lot of no shows by the protesters so
to be honest it actually produced a kind
of chill atmosphere in the protest zone
and so on that last day as the Sun set
behind Cleveland the minor skirmishes
and shouting matches that had gone down
had all subsided and I was actually
drinking a beer at a sidewalk cafe and
watching one of those bikers for Trump
play a friendly game of ping pong with
an anti-trump protester so ironically
after two decades of being a booster of
everything online like I've been I
realized that as the online world might
be threatening democracy the truly
decent
people that most of us are offline maybe
what saves us I so last thing I want say
we're going to get through this day
we're going to get through this election
whatever the result is because it's a
lot harder to troll someone offline face
to face our offline super-ego will save
us from our online it this time around
but we've got to figure out how to clean
up our online behavior otherwise the
2020 race and here's the candidates
bunny the 2020 race is coming between
Kanye West and Clint Eastwood is going
to be even more ugly than this was yeah
I'm writing I'm already writing in r2 d2
rjd2 is my Bernie alright so that's
farsighted everyone um if you didn't
vote and you're on the west coast you
might still have a chance so so get out
and vote it's probably too late on those
three hours three hours um so that's
farsighted hope you enjoyed it we'll be
back next month for Terry Collins dan
patterson Bonnie Burton Steven Beecham
and Kelsey Adams there in the studio and
we also missed you Jeff Sparkman we'll
see you next time on merrick back
Chris
