auto industry no one gets their kicks by
buying one and yet an awful lot of
people live with one every day Kia says
they do one really well let's see in the
latest version of the Sedona definitely
outside the realm of the big three but
maybe that's a mistake we're driving a
2015 Sedona SXL as we check the tech
when you put a minivan in your line you
don't exactly expect it to be a Halo
vehicle do you you leave that to your
sport coupes and your sexy crossovers
this guy just has to sell well
bottom line what Kia's done to make
their argument to that direction is to
take their in arguably slick-looking
very urbanized style they have these
days put in some good cabin tech we've
seen on their cars before and try to
make the second row a special place all
of that at a special price let's see how
well they do now of course in a hide Ram
minivan you almost care more about the
second row than the first row so here we
are in what they call first-class lounge
seats in the second row you do give up
one but in the second row so now you're
down to seven total passengers however
you get adjustable footrest you've got
one of these butterfly headrests like
you have on those nice airline seats of
course you can recline this thing way
back almost flatter this is a weird
control here look at this I can slide
left and right same one with that guy so
if you have two folks back here hate
each other like when you're going to a
family reunion this is perfect now
familiar kia cabin design and here this
has got the sporty fresh kind of really
handsome look that a lot of other kids
have you're not given that up because
you're driving a minivan that's the good
news here's the star of the show 8 inch
touch LCD and a typical kia fashioned
the touch response is quick crisp and
responsive you've also got voice command
on this guy but there is no other type
of controller so we're in a high trim
Sedona that means we have navigation
that I've always found pretty good from
these guys we've also got Infiniti
surround sound just about every source
you want we're not missing anything here
from Satellite Radio to Pandora to
Spotify aha a lot of the stuff comes in
through what they call their UVO
services platforms you've also got the
ability to go to what they call their
App Store that's where you go to add in
things like Pandora iHeartRadio or Yelp
there's also built in support for Siri
eyes free and you may have noticed on
that voice command screen there's a tab
there for Google local search the
frustrating part is this works through
the Wi-Fi connection not through a
pairing to your phone so your phone
either needs to be a hotspot or you got
to be parked in the driveway or
somewhere connecting to a fixed hotspot
that's goofy now our vehicles also got
several driver assists on it from
cameras rear
cameras available pretty low on these
guys we've also got a surround view
camera on here that works particularly
well it's good sharp imagery one choice
only on the transmission 6-speed
automatic so this shifter is going to be
common to all of them no paddles or
anything on the wheel they don't do that
on Sedonas and while I like the touch
response on the screen I think these
home run buttons here are all nicely
done some of the switch gears crap in
this car when you put this shifter over
in the sport gate the shiftable gate on
the left and kick it back and forth you
can't even tell if you've made a gear
change or not by its feel it's just
gummy and weird ditto for the headlight
dimming stalk I had to fiddle with it
twice every time I wanted to take the
headlights up or down there's like no
feedback to it weird
sloppy machinist now up front the Sedona
has gone down an engine size not too
unusual these days but still notable 3.3
liter v6 now down from a three and a
half liter v6 there was in here last
year the power numbers went up though
276 horsepower 248 pound-feet of torque
mpg is okay it's 1824 which is
disappointing for a smaller engine to go
look at Nissan Honda Chrysler they're
all doing better on average mpg than
this guy one last note where we go for a
drive this is front wheel drive like
most minivans however some folks really
like to have all-wheel drive in their
minivan imagine that you want to get
around all year long and that's where
you got to go shop at iota Sienna so
what I'm going to tell you about a Kia
Sedona that is different than other
minivans not a whole lot to be honest
it's an isolated quiet riding vehicle
modern minivans all do that do that
really well it's got very good road
manners but not if you press it there's
no performance in this vehicle the
engine I gotta say seems a little bit on
the underpowered side but not criminally
so the bottom line is I think that
normally I never think of kia as making
a minivan when folks ask me for a
recommendation for one I don't think I
have remembered to mention them so that
might be the main takeaway it should be
one you consider with the big boys
we've got a very high-end Sedona here so
don't Blanche won't tell you it starts a
little bit over 40,000 dollars but this
is an SX L now on top of that I am gonna
add nearly 3 grand 2700 to be specific
for the tech package that gets us better
headlights the lane departure warning
forward collision warning a very nice
surround view camera and adaptive cruise
control now we're a little bit over
43,000 dollars this vehicle is not
thrilling to drive although it's also
competent on the road the second row is
definitely one of the more luxurious
places you can sit in a car today at
just about any price and Kia's cabin
tech has been strong with the exception
of a couple of weird quirks we showed
you there it's definitely a worthy
challenger to what is a much better
selling set of competition
