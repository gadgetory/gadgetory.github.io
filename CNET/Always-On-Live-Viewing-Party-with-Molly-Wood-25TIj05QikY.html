always on live viewing party I'm Molly
would if you don't know why you're here
yet if you just had live stream on and
it popped right up I'm Hollywood I do
show called I was on this is the last
episode uh it's kind of a big deal so
thanks for joining us the chat room is
full the room is full we managed to pull
together Alice and Tom are wonderful
supervising producer the best crist√£o
our lead editor on always on oh I got a
bad camera was hiding behind the
microphone because he does not want to
talk does not want to oh I think he's
got a lot to say and Steven Beecham back
there behind you and you guys it's so
funny we were like oh we'll get
everybody into the studio will have like
a big party and then it turns out that
the the great news for everybody worked
on I was on is that we've successfully
gotten all of them other things to do
yeah so it is already running around
doing different things right everybody
was just busy every was like oh we
actually can't come to the cuz i don't
know if you guys know but i gave my
notice at seen it like a month ago so
I'm like relatives and fish around here
like could not be stinkier yeah we run a
big site here we got cars to shoot and
its really all in a car text you right
now there are things to do I know
they're all yeah car tech is just like
you're not driving like a Ferrari or
something right we will take your
production assistant your other editors
and your spare shooters and everybody
Chris Chris how you feel about your new
job on car tech I don't have a job yet
I'm just I'm just trying to hide in my
room I'm not I'm not worried I'm not
worried I don't know yet what is going
to replace always on but I know that
that Cena is committed to doing high
quality video and that there will there
will be something so keep your eyes
peeled for some new cute girl I don't
know so then this is in fact my very
last week at Cena not even the whole
week that wednesday is my last day and
it kind of you know I timed it to
coincide with the last always on show
and then it turned out that it's also
coinciding with the big apple
announcement the top
tomorrow yes which bumped our show a day
early but it means to live shows back to
back but tomorrow will be like like a
buzz out loud real reunion sort of kind
of hey well so what ask me maybe you
tonk hey not old yeah oh and Donald to
that's true yeah it's true it's very
good stuff I know but by the way the
chatroom says that the over-under on my
tears is 18 minutes is the Vegas odds
for this I don't know if that's actually
the line I think that's just the chat
room on hmm I mean you can bet on
everything in Vegas but I don't think
I'm that big of a deal I don't think
there's a line on that um I don't really
I don't know the tears happened early
the tears happened on the way to work
not just because of the bart strike ya
know because well kind of because of our
trek but not for that reason but not for
that reason yeah it just led to the hole
with a whole it was the whole thing it
wasn't any layers for a while yeah it's
I mean pretty obviously hard to leave
this show behind like mainly because of
the team like you guys are awesome guys
are awesome I couldn't be luckier to
have had to have gotten to work with
such good people too we just like Eileen
Rivera was the supervising producer
before Alison pretty much sort of like
laid the groundwork and then Alison came
in and i'm telling you we all were like
she's pretty hardcore like Eileen and I
were just like make a show and Alison
was like oh let's make this show a ship
okay and they were like okay just a
total professional just took it up so
many notches it was just amazing well it
was super fun yeah we've had an awesome
run they've had a great run and truly
the best team and I think that's the
thing about it is everyone just work
together so great and we all had so many
fun ideas and it was just easy to
implement what was cool was your
favorite thing that we did together
because we went on a lot of good we
ended up on a lot of good like road
trips many road trips there are a lot I
mean of course they'll was like the most
awesome one because first of all we'd
never been there and we had no idea what
to expect and it was gorgeous and it was
just such a perfect prime location for
doing all of our testing so that was
really fun and it was a beautiful little
place yeah and but I loved also taking
the Xperia Z and the Chocolate Factory
just because it was like which was
laying carpet
just like one of cnet's most highly
viewed videos of all time on our YouTube
channel yeah crazy it is really awesome
thing is you think just got chocolate
combined with an ally with tech gadget
talking about Harper yeah yeah that was
by the way that was your idea and that
was probably the first that was the
first hint i had that she was gonna take
a production value up and I because it
was just so creative and cool and then
she was like and I have a location and
I've already checked it out and it's
good to go and they're willing willing
to let us drop it in this to blah blah
blah blah it was like oh snap like I
love chocolate so yeah that worked out
really that was a good one yeah well
your highlight or I know well I also i
have to out Chris a little bit because
chris's are hermit tell because he's
hiding behind as microphone and all this
time like all the time that I've known
him on our team has been like in this
one little room all by himself and
everyone was like ooh Chris isn't what
but we brought in a lot of new people
for the show and so we had to give Chris
a roommate and everyone was terrified
they were afraid they'd think you're so
cranky everyone was like we don't want n
tell him what happened came out of your
shell like a family back there huh why
good roommate Vanessa who helps cut the
show as well she does some segments and
also Miriam's the other one of the other
editors I'm in beginning we had Kelly
who actually works a lot on car tech but
editors always are in their own little
room there all alone most of the time in
the dark note windows although I have
windows in my room but we're kind of I
have to give a shout out to the editors
were the unsung hero we make everybody
look good I create a lot of time in the
room they come in with no tapes and
tapes and they say just make a show
that's a car exactly five you know
GoPros everything what it takes a lot of
footage you guys had to go through yeah
and some footage not always synced up
which can be like your mm-hmm so we're
fixing all the problems we're doing
everything we r the surgeons behind this
that's right that's right yeah they're
the only reason that wet but it was it
was so as a wonderful it was a wonderful
thing to see the friendship between
Chris and Vanessa
and to like see that like it's actually
kind of great for never me also you are
absolutely right i mean we cannot thank
that it is enough because we have not
always created the easiest well and you
should have seen Krista space to when we
were starting the show and I was like
yeah we're gonna do a 22-minute show
weekly and like some of its gonna be pre
shot but I don't know how much how much
we're gonna be able to shoot in banska
some of its gonna be News oriented in
the rat and we were shooting you know
raps like sort of either two weeks
before or two days before the pending
poor man was like are you sure you don't
want to do every other week and I'm
totally like I'm not sure to be fine we
give you a TV show II great yeah yeah
yeahs with we put him through the ringer
no it's great you got us you got me
helped so that that's was really
appreciated yeah Vanessa and Miriam are
fantastic i'm sorry the camp miriam just
had a baby which is why she can't be
here today so that's wonderful news and
then i'm pretty sure that vanessa is
just trapped on the other side of the
bridge because the for those of you
don't know a couple people have asked in
the chat room like who's on strike and
what's going on it's cup it's like a
nightmare it's like Europe like the
government shuts down and then the
transit strikes and then anyway Bart
which is our subway system the bart
workers are on strike so um it's just
carmageddon around here like everybody
it's then it's non stop news on how
people are getting to work how people
are getting San Francisco how they
getting from some parts the east bay to
the other it's pretty intense and it's
in it it bugs me too because we never
find out till like midnight if they're
gonna go on strike the next day you know
it's like we're always on pins and
needles do we're gonna have to make new
plans to get into work tomorrow yeah
it's another nightmare at least now we
know and i'm pretty sure it's gonna go
on for a while so no it looks like it's
gonna go on for a while yeah everyone's
bracing themselves right it's like
finding your a B and C plans for the
morning which is oh yeah you're making
your coffee when you first get up and
then you're like gosh okay whatever yeah
it's insane yeah it's all it's all we
can talk about right now and then I
totally because I'm such a like big baby
I was like really like my last three
days I know not be more of a traffic
nightmare or inconvenience sir yeah
right before I'm about to have this
cushy work from home freelance existence
it's like you just gotta like twist the
knife twist the knife it's so amazing it
was actually a couple weeks ago granted
it was like a late night afterwards so
it's like around midnight when there's
hardly anyone out it took me exactly 15
minutes to get from point A to point B
yeah and usually like without a new
traffic this place is fabulous just to
travel around but then when you actually
have congestion all this other stuff it
can take us like 45 minutes to an hour
right now and that's just such a
nightmare somebody said that they I
somebody tweeted that they took one of
the shuttles from Walnut Creek which is
sort of the Far East Bay not party
spoilers but uh you know with no traffic
it's probably what 35 minutes 40 minutes
oh you walnut creek to San Francisco two
hours from like seven to nine yeah
anything that's why I ride a bike I was
wishing to add a bike this morning I was
like I just want to ride my bike down to
the ferry gonna be like that guy he rode
his bike across the bay did you see that
guy yeah it's so awesome to custom a he
wrote he had a bike that had like floats
on the wheels run across a pedal-powered
yeah acing the bart strike or I'll find
it off oh my god that's gotta be an
amazing visual because I gotta say
that's brilliant because we thought
we're surrounded by water so there's so
many opportunities for you to get around
and it's like yeah that would be the
best that's what I want to do we don't
have that many actual options yeah way
yeah we my friends gonna buy a jet ski
and start at Jesse I was thinking that
Cena charter a boat I seen it to charter
a very a great idea yeah yeah for sure
like bear I mean you know Barry a
business could kind of band together and
charter fairies that'd be a good idea I
know we're a little off topic oh alright
always on well we're just setting up for
a really good show that's coming up
exactly tomorrow don't worry guy the guy
I got the guy right here you do all
right we got to see this guy oh my gosh
I need that that looks like pine ridge
oh yeah as long as you don't fall down
if I took my time he's not wearing a
pink you always blow ya Jen Strickland
the Chairman was like welcome to always
bloat that's awesome they're bet I have
gotten several tweets today to the to
the if
like that does that mean always on is
never on or always offer no it's always
on it's gonna live forever on that
YouTube it's always on exactly like I
may be leaving the scene that family but
we have kids together you guys so this
is they're gonna live on yep you can get
the whole Stephen pointed out actually
that the single best way to consume all
of always on is on YouTube here I'll
show you right here is on YouTube which
he has very uh very mattila jealously um
curated for your viewing pleasure there
you go meticulously curated see here
here's every episode right here nice
look at that here you can break it in
two episodes wait let me see take a
little walk through memory lane you
should play play a little bit of like
episode one okay I don't get one you
can't respond away seasons or clips I'm
gonna get a season and here's season one
episodes and here's the very first
episode where you guys it's the stair
coat it's gonna play an ad that's okay I
Mollywood mmm I just want I got to tell
you now I'm I don't there's part of me
that doesn't wanna play this cuz I hated
my makeup so much and this one okay so
some of the things so some of the things
that we were trying to do as we
developed always on right like I really
wanted to make a show that looked
broadcast quality and so you know among
all of the advice that I got it was like
you got to get great graphics you got
him a makeup person and you gotta have a
great lighting you know so we would we
like when looking for studio space to
shoot our wraps in so that we could
really get this sort of professional
look and then ended up realizing that
that was weird right because everything
else was out in the field and really
natural-looking that we'd have these
like super made up fancy studio thanks
but like so for the first episode to the
makeup artist that I loved and couldn't
and we always worked with was not
available in so we had this new woman
and it was and we were late and like I
think there was a bridge disaster anyway
the makeup is hysterical like I look
like a like a muppet check it out why
would I do see your mother welcome buddy
life with bad
everyday life eyebrows good God we unbox
the macbook pro retina MacBook Pro on
that episode we did the solar power race
car yes cool those are Kevin that's
right I bought myself a orange leather
jacket two years ago it is it's a long
time ago back when I used to look like a
muppet I was thinking that song on a
well-lit Muppet you're right cat suits
but look at meijer look at the
production quality of a fireplace in the
bed i know i mean you could ya know it
did that was beautiful and then I was
all into like getting these fancy
manicures it's so it's weird you know
it's like weird to sort of put together
this thing from scratch and try to
figure out how you wanted to look and
what you wanted to how you wanted to
come to fruition I really do think that
seasons four and five are where the show
became like the show that it should be
where we really started to hone in on
how to incorporate the outside world and
then I'll sit bless her heart she's
sprung nest from the studio I was like
outside wraps how hard is that other
than the way it's which you'll see some
more later winds always for a good time
yeah totally what do you think Chris as
as the editor you saw I mean you were
the one who was here from day one well I
think it's fun to watch the progression
and always like when you watch TV shows
these days they're a little bit more
professional in terms of how to get it
done so you see like a breaking bad it's
going to look the same from Season one
to season five but if you watch older
shows like Star Trek it's hilarious to
watch like the first season and they
have like the Lighting's different the
sound effects even their uniforms and
then they'll start moving moving through
the season they'll hit a groove and all
of a sudden their outfits are different
the sound is different than musics
difference so I think we kind of have
the same yet the same feeling in our
shadow we were trying to figure out our
way out through the through the seasons
and so I think we definitely hit our
stride in four and five we kind of
figure out what we wanted to do
it was also unusual to do seasons at all
and our seasons were always you know I
mean it's been about 18 months I think
of doing the show around season 5
because we figure that the only way to
do it as a concession to Chris so that
he didn't just walk screaming up like
the bart people um was that we would try
to do seasons and shoot at least some in
advance like try to shoot because we
really wanted to I wanted to travel for
the show one of their to be like a sense
of breadth and and experience to it and
so so but basically our seasons were 8
episode so then we'd be like it's the
end of the season every be like what he
just started like yesterday I don't
understand the start i gave the chat
rooms pointing out that the first
episode of Star Trek was such a low
budget might have been similar oh yeah
again cuz for cnet we've you know we did
we pumped some production value into the
show that's code for money money I loved
our graphics I was so proud of the
graphics I was like my big coup was to
go outside and get like professionally
made graphics Steven did all the sound
design yes and I actually did some sound
design for that graphics company
afterwards did oh you did like a cisco
commercial or something Oh awesome it
always happens yeah yeah do one thing
and they're like me who's this guy
they're like yeah some great stuff so I
was kind of coulomb yeah but they're in
New York so it's kind of hard to care
are they in New York really I think so
yeah I was little we are guys yeah okay
alchemy another here Beverly in LA
they're here yeah they were at our lunch
party oh well maybe the producer I was
working on we finally oh that could be
that's very possible we finally managed
to have a lunch party for in season two
oh yeah marketing yeah we get there
eventually but it was really fun and we
had like a little white cups that had
always on blow up like a light-up thing
yeah was it wasn't always on his been a
very ambitious project within Cena and
as and it's been I mean I think I put it
in the last in the last blog post but
it's sort of like you think about your
job as a tech reporter or a nerd or
whatever and then you do a show like
this and you get to ride on an America's
Cup catamaran and jump out of a
helicopter and put
2-foot tube down your nose and go fell
into a mud run and like you know we rock
climb and SpaceX launch SpaceX launch
yeah like I've always wanted to see a
shuttle launch I got to go to NASA and
see a friggin a rocket blast into space
like what an experience all right so I
think the time has come this is the last
episode of always on and it's a blooper
show hopefully it'll make you laugh it
will also but we do have do have some
some behind-the-scenes stuff in here
Alison's been going around diligently
gathering footage of people at work and
their thoughts and and I think you'll
get to see a little bit more of the
people who made the show possible so

Tuesday hi i'm molly wood and welcome to
always on the show and instantly run
everybody ended Nelson's like we get it
all over also I'm telling wearing the
same shirt like and necklace and
everything it was a complete coincidence
/ I don't have them any clothes I don't
know oh you guys mind burn the charms
like I'll miss that oh no no that and my
thing was to always pretend like a
became oh yeah Oh be is a be less than
language but it did get less and less
you know the last couple seasons I know
because Nick started mention I'd be was
that really one of your things now's
little bit worried I'd scare her and
have her that like for something up
right anytime yeah Jess product cuz it
happened well I so I have this whole
thing about you right that's right take
their terrorist these are amazing
whatever Abby comes and you can't do
anything cuz the B is all of a sudden in
charge and you just have to like you
can't like freaked out cuz you make the
P mad and will sting you but then if you
can't if you're not freaking out you
just kind of have to like sit there and
hope that be decides not to sting you
it's like all up to the bee you gotta
not make the be bad but whenever the
becomes everybody always freaks out and
in fact that did happen to me I was like
out of my backpack talking to my mom one
time and I became and flu-like into my
eyeball and I like ba and I freaked out
and I threw the phone over my deck which
was weighed out like like down a hill
right i live on with those crazy asses
i'm still summer so like and so went
down the hillside and i think enough my
mom was like convinced i've just been
murdered because she hears like ah and
then nothing yup they are you for that
i'm yelling down like
I'd like I've done it actually my
neighbor side happened who lives like a
you know underneath basically I'm like
we met on the street anyway that was my
thing and then a became yeah and then
John Strickland says you can't kill to
be because then the almonds won't get
pollinated bees these are good I I do
hear people but everyone gets freaked
out by bees but I know you know don't
remember when we were younger yeah ooh
and would freak out and they just said
stay still use go whole deal go what
comes I'll just look at it be crawling
am I just hope that the bee doesn't
sting you yeah he's in charge you are
hostages he doesn't want to sting you
cuz if it stings util yeah only some not
all what ever been stung by wasps I'm
not cool with what yeah yeah um I've
only had one bad sting on the butt why
what is that would be oh that would hurt
yes and then in my neck of the woods I
don't know if you guys grew up with us
but you put mud on a bee stings that
pulls the Stinger out I just have this
memory of I was at like a family party
like at a party at neighbors house or
something and I sat on a B and then I
just have this terrible memory is
standing like a stool in this lady's
kitchen with my pants down there like
putting mud on my budget hella bee and
now you go to the spa you pay big money
for that times have changed see this is
like naturally glacier aati has a good
point which is that Montana bugs are the
size of smart cars oh my god yeah I know
there's some big bugs oh no John I also
want you guys to know that it looks like
I'm like the crankiest diva ever in some
of those outtakes but it's really just
that I hate wind it's like Allison did
an awesome thing by making us shoot all
our wraps outside because it they look
better we weren't spending so much money
and it wasn't this weird like big studio
thing but it did introduce a high a much
higher rage factor because we then hired
a hairstylist I'm just kidding I don't
even have that I just needed a lot more
spray I guess but that's why I like
you've got a couple episodes there where
the hair
back or uh but that way even by that was
a fun experiment to us like oh I've
never wore my hair back camera all new
experiences wind wind you guys are
getting all my like weird bull like bees
and I can't stand wait and I don't think
pandas are real um and for those of you
who asked why people honk when they
drive by and you're filming I don't know
I truly don't know it is like a human
tick that I don't understand but they
always do like there's nothing that like
juvenile turds find more appealing than
a really big camera yeah and it's that
exactly the time that you have a camera
out or if you're driving through a
tunnel honking there's is going on out
here the echo in the tunnel okay so that
might make a look are you a honker I
hold my brow gonna be like more I run a
die you know my sister did that the
other day she was holding her breath
through tunnels like you're still doing
that you're like throw to you something
and you're gonna pass out don't do that
while you're driving and I it is John
Strickland it's exactly the it's the
like the person who walked into the
frame of a shot and wave and jump up and
down and stuff it's the exact same
person somebody who just wants like mess
with whatever it is you're doing yep cuz
they need a lot of attention in life I
don't really know just don't be that
person kids if you're watching this now
consider this your always on PSA don't
be the person there's they're gonna get
the shot done and you're not gonna be in
the video like yeah that's the key point
you're not gonna make it so unless it's
live yeah Oh unless it's live I never
don't encourage them cuz that's even
more annoying and then you're like
completely move away because then you
can't you can really can't concentrate
on what's happening cuz you're just
looking at that perfect you know the
person in the back making the funny face
yes total discounter productive jerks
jerks just don't do it Josh Freeman
else's that's why I followed that person
to their job and then stand at their
desk before you press around while I try
to work exactly that's what I'm gonna do
