family I'm gonna talk to you about the
phone but before we jump in too far I
want to talk about the hardware just a
little bit just just give you a little
glimpse of what's happening in the
technology and with this team what this
Lumia team is put together which i think
is pretty powerful and for me has been
super powerful let's start with the
antennas and always being connected it's
a principle of mine I want to share it
with you kind of want you to feel it and
we're just getting started here but
these these antennas these are
generations in the making okay there are
two antennas in this product but why why
why to who puts two and they are vast
and they are some of the best on the
planet it's like literally it's like
it's this whole thing of pushing more
than one phone in a phone because when
you hold it when you're holding your
phone up like you're doing right now no
matter where you're holding it we will
choose for you to give you the best
connection you could possibly have
what's a phone all about what does a
phone start with what a phone is staying
connected and that's what that does it's
a great tech we also have the octa-core
and a hexa core processors I have two
phones to introduce you to today we have
the 950 which uses a hexa core processor
and the 950 XL which uses the octa-core
we use the latest Qualcomm technology
and we pushed that technology to every
limit possible we push it by using
tablet class liquid cooling we literally
coming from our surface team into our
phones because what we wanted was to
push these machines as hard as we
possibly could because we want to make
them as productive as possible because
we want to bring Windows 10 to life in
your pocket that's the whole goal and
that's what the Lumia team has done it
is just phenomenal technology the phones
come with a 5.2 inch and a 5.7 inch
screen they're absolutely beautiful
organic LEDs yep they're gorgeous
PCs are 500 dpi you put your eyes on
this screen it's super soft you'll never
see a pixel this is all simple you know
this you know it cuz I saw you write
about it already so I'm just blowing
through what I love about LED I'm gonna
just share with you look I'm always
moving I'm moving too fast and my
children are at home watching but I will
tell you of one of my big things in life
is to be more present when I'm at home
be more present with my team when we're
sitting around making a phone or a
surface like this is a big deal for me
we here's something that Windows 10 has
done and has lit me up and has helped me
so much when you pull your phone out
your pocket you can't see this because
it's so dim but you pull your phone out
of the pocket you don't have to push a
button you don't have to do anything I
get so much information in the glance
screen technology let me relate this to
the O LED screen we can light up the
pixels we want to light up and now I
have a picture of my kids I know what my
next meeting is says I'm supposed to be
here that's good I also know how many
mails I have how many texts I have what
time is it what date is it I didn't
touch anything
and by the way I'm using zero battery
life while I stand here and get all that
information zero</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
