doesn't it seem as if we're still
charging things as often and for as long
as we did a few years ago those
researchers come up with a new
technology that looks promising
that's not going to make an impact until
it can be manufactured very
inexpensively with great quantity
researchers continue to advance not
necessarily at the rate that you see
with processors we've all become very
used to just about every core component
of the technology we use getting much
better much faster every year this has
led to all kinds of bastardization zuv
Moore's law which stated that the amount
of transistors on a piece of silicon
would double roughly every two years
we've turned that into a meme that
everything gets even better than the
year before
even faster and then there are batteries
they clearly have not followed a Moore's
law exponential curve battery startup
envyus systems surveyed the markets
history and found the amount of charge
in a given battery back in 1995 took 13
years to double so much for Moore's law
and it won't double again they predict
until 2020 and because batteries are so
widespread from small devices to very
large ones the benchmarks at which we
measure them are pretty broad as well
first of all you've got charge time how
long does it take to get it back to a
charge from when it's depleted this is a
big one in everyday use related to that
is energy density how much energy can
you put into a battery of a given size
and weight then there is specifically
the size and weight
leaving density out can you make the
battery smaller more malleable weigh
less so that it can make the phone
lighter make it package better into the
electric car
then there's cycle life this is
generally seen as how many times you can
recharge a battery from mostly empty to
mostly full before it drops below 80% of
its ability to hold a charge that's kind
of a ballpark at where most people say a
battery is getting depleted and of
course there's cost if any of the above
have breakthroughs but they make the
battery unaffordable in its application
doesn't matter
there are also some ancillary benchmarks
around how easily a battery can be kept
within its temperature range especially
electric cars keep
battery from being too hot or too cold
adds a lot of complexity and cost to the
vehicle you've also got concerns about
toxicity in chemical formula and
recyclability
now we can't begin in a few minutes to
catalog all the breakthroughs that are
being pursued in labs around the world
but here are a couple of buckets of
where they tend to group first there's
chemistry the exact chemicals and
materials that are being used are always
being fiddled with beyond the current
very common lithium ion the dual carbon
battery being developed in Japan is said
to have no heat generation when being
charged or discharged IBM's lithium air
battery is said to have much greater
energy density than current lithium ion
lithium silicon is said to be expandable
at the molecular level to allow for
faster charging and the recent buzz from
Stanford is around a pure lithium
battery that researchers hope will
triple the energy density while
quartering the cost of today's
lithium-ion battery applications MIT and
University of Texas are taking one more
pass through the periodic table trying
new brews of silicon sulfur and sodium
but even if they strike gold these are
many years to market then that brings us
to nanotechnology you could go on for
days about the number of projects that
are exploring using graphene in future
batteries it's a new nano material that
could address both charge cycle and
energy density it's believed and you may
have heard about the so-called 30 second
charge phone battery a prediction based
on some research released lately by
store dot a company that is working with
nano crystalline structures and related
to all this watch the non batteries
trying to make incursions on batteries
territory one of the biggest categories
and an older one is capacitors these
charge and discharge much more quickly
than most batteries but they also hold
less energy have a lower energy density
but they're already being used by Mazda
and Lamborghini an automotive for
example to power a brake energy
regeneration system and a start/stop
system respectively and then of course
there are hydrogen fuel cells that
basically take hydrogen and create
current and water vapor from it it's a
very elegant solution but of course
facing a lot of hurdles right now one of
the most interesting and telling
developments is how Tesla and Toyota
have sort of quietly gotten divorced on
what was a very big effort between them
make battery electric vehicles but now
Toyota is pushing hard on fuel cell
electric vehicles perhaps the most
exciting part to watch about battery
technology is that these core
breakthroughs when and if they happen
will affect devices from the smallest to
the largest very likely anything from
your phone to your laptop to your
electric car even to storing excess
power coming off the solar panels on the
roof of your home when there's a
breakthrough in the battery area a real
breakthrough it's going to touch a lot
of people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
