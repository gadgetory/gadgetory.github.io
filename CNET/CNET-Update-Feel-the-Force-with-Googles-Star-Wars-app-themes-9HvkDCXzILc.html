google apps I'm Bridget Carey this is
your scene that update if you did
already have enough star wars movie hype
in your life google is giving its apps a
Star Wars design makeover if you visit
google.com / Star Wars you can choose to
have little geeky Star Wars things pop
up across your devices when you're using
google what you see depends on if you
choose the light side or the dark side
the theme is woven into the Chrome
browser with an add-on and you'll also
find the force hidden within the
chromecast gmail google search google
translate and youtube among others on
maps the little peg man to take you to
street view changes to a stormtrooper or
rebel Starfighter pilot the ways traffic
app owned by google also transforms to
show characters and icons from the force
awakens on your route and you can also
give voice directions from c-3po if you
have a change of heart you can switch to
the other side at any time or disable it
but it will vanish for everyone in
February expect more Star Wars Easter
eggs to pop up from google as we get
closer to the movie's release on
December eighteenth now the folks over
at Yahoo may not have created a star
wars-themed to its male but many people
that use yahoo are crying out that the
company has joined the dark side because
it looks anyone that uses an ad block or
tool people are taking a twitter and
message boards to complain that yahoo
asks you to disable ad blocker if you
want to continue using yahoo mail yahoo
has said that this is a test running for
a small number of yahoo mail users in
the US if you're unfamiliar with how ad
blocking works the software will prevent
a page from loading advertisements
sometimes an ad blocker causes a website
to load incorrectly but that's the price
some don't mind paying to avoid popups
and adds that track you Yahoo's not the
first to fight back against the software
The Washington Post also refuses to load
for those that block ads you can't blame
them for fighting to save their main
source of revenue but speaking of
fighting on there's one tech company
that seems to have given up on its
product completely after an epic failure
LG has stopped taking orders for its
latest SmartWatch and canceled the
rollout of the device just six days
after it was on the market the LG watch
urbane second edition has been pulled
due to a complicated hardware issue LG
is not going into much detail other than
saying that there's no safety danger to
anyone that does own one LG has not
decided if the device will ever go back
on sale again this stylish SmartWatch
has received positive early reviews and
it was the first android wear watch to
have its own cellular connection with a
sim card you can make calls and get
alerts without needing your phone but
that also meant you needed a data plan
for your watch that's it for this tech
news update and there's more at cnet com
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
