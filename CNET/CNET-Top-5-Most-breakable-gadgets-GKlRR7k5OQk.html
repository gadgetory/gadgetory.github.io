you a lot of things about any given
piece of technology how well it works
how long the battery lasts how well it
stacks up against the competition and
then we carefully box that product back
up and send it back to the manufacturer
leaving one critical question unanswered
will this product survive a drop from a
moving car
and that's where Mollywood comes in in
her show always on Molly has subjected
countless gadgets to her torture testing
some take a licking and keep on ticking
while others from balloon to an
expensive pile of glass and microchips
Donnell bail and this top five were
counting down the five pieces of
high-profile technology that flopped the
hardest during the always-on torture
test starting things off at number five
iPhone 4s just because there was less
screen back then didn't make the design
any less fragile we had an ugly black
bar running down the display of the 4s
after just one drop granted the glass
never actually broke even after he
tossed us down the stairs but the fact
that we crippled the screen right out of
the gate is enough to put this bygone
iPhone on the list but at least the
iPhone never really advertised itself as
rugged the same cannot be said for
number four thanks pad x1 carbon now
this is a great all-around machine and a
four star review from us but if you're
looking for a truly rugged laptop that
can withstand scorching heat or the
occasional cup of coffee on the keyboard
then the x1 is not for you Molly didn't
even get around to a drop test since the
heat test pretty much toasted this thing
it's a fine computer but not the tough
guy you'd expect
number three is another one that
surprised us the Samsung Galaxy s4 this
has seen its highest rated cell phone
currently and the heir to one of the
toughest cell phones around the galaxy
s3 now the s4 was undone by a hurl upper
rock wall and then put to rest after
being run over by a mountain bike now
personally my active lifestyle is
non-existent so I went discount the s4
right away but it's a shame that it
doesn't seem as resilient as the s3 at
number two the Microsoft Surface it was
already looking pretty bad when
always-on is Jeff kanata spilled a glass
of wine on the thing but it was
drop test that really made me wince to
be fair Jeff went over the top when you
used the kickstand as a footrest maybe
took things a little too far we turn the
whole thing into a functioning
skateboard well what's the torture test
without a little humiliation now before
we get to the number one most breakable
gadget as evidenced by the always on
torture test go take a look at the top
five toughest gadgets moly on the game
have a great roundup that you can find
over at CENTCOM slash always on all
right
and now the wimpiest gadget ever to
appear on always on in 2012 Google Nexus
7 the original the $199 Android tablet
that brought the industry to his knees
also turned out to be a total creampuff
I think Christmas ornaments tougher than
this thing during the drop test the back
cover went flying and the glass shatter
like a creme brulee I can always tell
I'm hungry when my metaphors are all
desserts still it was a great tablet and
for $199 it could have been made out of
Legos and I still would have bought one
so there you go five highly rated
gadgets that you really shouldn't use
without a case and an extended warranty
to witness more gadget abuse be sure to
tune in to always on with Mollywood each
and every week and for more top fives

hold them close
