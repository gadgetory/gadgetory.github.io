we're taking a first look at the samsung
galaxy player 4.2 this is Samsung's
latest attempt to take on the apple ipod
touch with a portable media player that
looks a lot like a smartphone but really
is in a smartphone it's got all those
capabilities of Android this running
android 2.3 point 6 it's got a camera on
the back this is a 2 megapixel camera
can also take standard definition video
on the front you've got a nice 4.2 inch
screen we've seen a lot of these
galaxies players I've reviewed a lot of
them over the past year the common
complaint across all of them is that
they don't have great screen quality the
resolution is pretty low this one
finally gets a resolution right they
finally upgraded this thing to an IPS
display so you get great viewing angles
great brightness good color saturation
and yell so this is one of the thinnest
ones we've seen yet you could really
fool people into thinking this was a
smart phone it's very thin design has a
removable back cover where you've got a
removable battery you can access the
microSD expansion board here if you want
to add more memory to this instead of
the eight gigabytes that come included
they've included an FM radio something
the ipod touch doesn't have so you get
FM radio on here there's some included
games like fifa 12 so if you really like
your your virtual soccer you can get
that going right out of the box overall
it's one of the best experiences I've
seen with these samsung galaxy player
products it's not a lot that you
couldn't already find on a decently
spect android smartphone but for those
who don't want a smartphone or maybe
your teenager parents are going to let
you have a smartphone this is really
giving you all those benefits of a
smartphone without the actual annual
contract and the pricing of a smartphone
199 dollars is good price it makes me
think the same money I can spend that
and get like a amazon kindle fire tablet
with a great screen as well but if you
really are going after that smartphone
pocketable design this is really the
best one we've seen yet and one of the
first times i think i can actually
recommend one of these products they've
done this one pretty well cnet com I'm
Donald Bell and this was a first look at
