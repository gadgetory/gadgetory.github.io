and some people express their deep
appreciation in in different ways but
one of the ways that I believe people
express their appreciation to to the
rest of humanity is to make something
wonderful and put it out there and you
never you never meet the people you
never shake their hands
you never hear their story or tell yours
but somehow in the act of making
something with a great deal of care and
love
something's transmitted there and it's a
way of expressing to the rest of our
species our deep appreciation so we need
to be true to who we are and remember
what's really important to us that's
what's gonna keep Apple Apple is if we
keep us us
thank you
I love hearing his voice and his
inspiring message and it was only
fitting that Steve should open his
theater it is the honor of a lifetime to
be the first to welcome you to the Steve
Jobs theater Steve meant so much to me
and so much to all of us there's not a
day that goes by that we don't think
about him memories have expecially come
rushing back as we prepared for today
and this event it's taken some time but
we can now reflect on him with joy
instead of sadness
Steve's spirit and timeless philosophy
on life will always be the DNA of Apple
and because he loved days like this
where he could share our latest new
products and new ideas of the world and
we do so not only to pay tribute to
Steve but to inspire the next generation
of creators and innovators Steve was a
genius and one of the many ways that he
showed that was in the his uncanny
ability to unlock the talent of
everybody that he worked with he thought
deeply about our workplace and its
surroundings and he believed that they
should inspire talented people to do
their best work so
over a decade ago he began to work on a
new campus for Apple his vision for
Apple part was to create an incredible
workplace of the future where engineers
and designers could all be together
collaborating on the next generations of
Apple product to change the world
Steve's vision and passion live on here
at Apple Park and everywhere an apple
today and always we honor him</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
