for kids
I'm Scott Stein and hey the Nintendo Wii
U console is two years old it's hard to
believe it's never been the success
though that the original Wii was times
have changed the Wii U is however a game
system with some really great Nintendo
games is it worth $300 which is the
going price for your typical bundle in
stores well that depends if you've got
kids or if you're a Nintendo fan do we
use newest games Super Smash Brothers
and Mario Kart 8 are excellent two
playing groups and there are many other
Triple A games Super Mario 3d World
Bayonetta 2 and Pikmin 3 and they're
more these are system exclusives too
they look great in HD but many games
that you can get on the Xbox and
Playstation don't necessarily make it to
the Wii U the included gamepad with its
own screen lets you play games away from
the TV and it works wonderfully but its
battery life is short it does have
built-in NFC which works with new amiibo
figures Nintendo statuettes that work
with many games to unlock extras they're
more novelty than necessity but they're
cute and feel a lot like Skylander or
Disney infinity figures the Wii U plays
old Wii games streams Netflix Hulu Plus
Amazon video and YouTube but it can't
play DVDs or blu-rays it's a great kid
system but doesn't play well with a
Nintendo 3ds just keep that in mind some
holiday bundles offer as many as four
games for as low as 360 dollars get one
of those if you can make sure you get a
version with 32 gigabytes of storage not
8 gigabytes trust me you'll fill up on
download space fast but at least you can
plug in a hard drive if needed the Wii U
is a really good system is it a
must-have no but it's got games that are
well worth playing especially for kids
