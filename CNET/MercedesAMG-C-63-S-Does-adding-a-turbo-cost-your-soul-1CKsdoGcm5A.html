absolutely can't stop doing if we want
to stay alive the air around us is vital
to every fiber of our being the same is
true with cars you can put as much fuel
in as you want but deny a car air and
you're going nowhere this is the
mercedes AMG c63s
and like everything out of our falter
bar it comes with a buttload of stats to
put a smile on your face 510 horsepower
516 foot-pounds of torque
62 miles an hour in four seconds dead
and a top speed electronically limited
to a hundred and fifty five miles an
hour but as impressive as those numbers
are what I'm most interested in is the
engine that delivers them the previous
generation of this car featured the
much-loved 6.2 liter naturally aspirated
v8 an engine praised not just for its
phenomenal power but for its amazing
sound but AMG like everyone else has had
to move with the times they've had to
teach the car how to breathe better
they've had to go turbo
that 6.2 liters has been reduced to a
still sizable four liters with two
turbos nestled inside the V of the
cylinders it is in fact the same engine
you find on the gorgeous AMG GT
having turbochargers to engines is just
the done thing at the moment the m3
which is the c63 s opposite number at
BMW added a turbocharger in this latest
generation in fact it's a twin-turbo
straight-6 the v8 has been dropped
completely from the lineup natural
aspiration it would seem is being phased
out going the way of its automotive
cousin the carburetor and the pop-up
headlamp for years and years it was the
way things got done but as progress is
marched on and trends have changed
carburetors have made way for fuel
injection headlamps pop up no more and
turbos they're so hot right now
combustion inside a car engine needs
what every flame needs fuel and oxygen
fuel in the form of petrol and oxygen in
the air around us now the normal action
of an engine draws that air in just fine
but in the 19th century gottlieb daimler
the same Dame law as in danger bends now
de leur AG the parent company of
mercedes benz discovered that by
compressing the air and forcing it into
the engine you could get more air some
more oxygen or oxygen means a bigger
explosion which means more power
later a Swiss engineer by the name of
Alfred bushi patented the idea of using
the exhaust gases from the engine to
blow a turbine that in turn compressed
and forced air into the engine and the
turbocharger was born the technology was
patented in 1905 but it took until 1962
for it to find his way into a production
car
the Chevrolet Corvair and the Oldsmobile
Jetfire both had its in that year and
slowly but surely the idea started to
catch on by the seventies Porsche was
fitting them to 911s and making Widow's
the world over BMW had put one in a 2002
and Renault had slaughtered one into a
Formula One car mostly though these were
for increased power adding a turbo to an
existing engine to get greater
performance adding turbos however wasn't
all gain early turbo cars featured a lot
of turbo lag and by that we mean the
amount of time it takes for the exhaust
fumes to spool up the turbine to
compress the air to give you that boost
it wasn't uncommon for you to put your
foot down for an overtake maneuver and
to have almost finished it when the
power would kick in at the worst
possible time spinning you off the road
in a fiery ball of death if you're
interested in the characteristics of
driving those early Porsche turbos you
should check out our film turbo fever
with Magnus Walker
now however turbos largely feel a
different role instead of increasing the
power of an existing engine turbos are
added to smaller engines to match the
power of their larger naturally
aspirated brothers whilst being more
economical due to their smaller
displacement losing less energy through
heat and friction in a world of
depleting natural resources it makes
sense to try and get the most out of
every drop of petrol and increasingly
manufacturers are turning to turbos to
make that happen in a performance car
like an AMG fuel economy an efficiency
isn't really the main selling point
though in order for this generation of
c63 to satisfy fans of the previous car
is going to have to satisfy them in the
gut and in the ear
now normally taking the exhaust and
using it to power a turbine can have
detrimental effects on the exhaust note
of a carb but the engineers aims you
have worked incredibly hard to preserve
that v8 character that they're so well
known for without having to resort to
such cheating methods as pumping an
artificial sound through the stereo like
some other people may have done now I'm
not naming names but you know who you
are
so does this car sound as good as its
naturally aspirated predecessor has the
turbo affected the throttle response and
the overall handling of the car well
there's only one way to find out I'm
going to have to go out and thrash
around a bit all right well if I must so
the sound that's what everyone wants to
know does this buy turbo four-litre v8
sound anywhere near as good as its
predecessors naturally aspirated 6.2
liter engine well
I defy anyone anyone to say that that
isn't an amazing sounding engine the
boost feels so progressive the way it
comes on the problem of turbo like has
been all but eliminated through various
methods chiefly amongst our multiple
turbos that spool up sequentially to
bring on the boost more immediately and
progressively there is no obvious turbo
sound there's not much in the way of
waste gates that you can hear although
it does make a fantastic burble when you
lift off listen to that
that is phenomenal
oMG have done an incredible job not only
retaining the characteristics of that v8
noise but really proving that without
any fakery it's possible in an age of
emissions regulations and increasing
fuel prices that you can still more
keeping in mind that this car claims to
have the most economical performance of
the eight on the market that's nothing
short of impressive so that's the noise
box well and truly ticked but how about
the rest of the experience I've got to
spend all of yesterday with this car and
immediately it felt like a nice place to
be these really sporty looking seats are
more comfortable than they look and the
interior is really well laid out I've
never been too much of a fan of Mercedes
as interiors but they've done a great
job on this with the mean exception
being the budget tablet computer looking
screen that seems to have been super
glued to the dash as an afterthought
although it looks great I'm not a
massive fan of having a cluster of
buttons down here when you've got 500
horses at your disposal
even when they are this well-behaved you
don't really want to be looking down
there to adjust certain things and
that's another point it wasn't that long
ago that 500 horsepower was the domain
of top-end supercars and the kind of
thing that would spit you off the road
at the nearest convenience and frankly
be absolutely terrifying to drive
nowadays though that is a completely
different case because these are 510
extremely well behaved horses the power
is available for you when you ask for it
and only then they don't sneak up on you
jump out at you from darkened corners
it's an insane amount of power on a
tight leash but like with any leash if
you feel inclined you can give it some
slack and see where it takes you
this car with all of its phenomenal
power and the potential to have
incredible performance doesn't feel any
harder to drive than any other car you
can buy you jump in and go as horse
powers have increased in saloon cars
like this the safety measures that have
come along with it have been incredibly
well developed and impressive frankly at
keeping numpties like me from spinning
themselves off the side of a mountain
for which I must say I am eternally
grateful you're given a raft of options
to customize so you can turn this car
into exactly what you want it to be I
settled on everything in Sport+ but the
suspension which shapes the c63 into a
screaming beast that is still a few
notches short of breaking your back each
time you hit a pothole for your money
you're getting an AMG GT engine wrapped
in a practical and comfortable shell
which in my book isn't a bad deal at all
so here's the key question has turbo
charging a small displacement v8 damaged
in any way what the c63 was has it
changed how we feel about AMG is it
welcoming in a dangerous new progression
in a fault box finest
no this car is everything AMG wants it
to be and more they know what they're
doing they're gonna put that smile on
your face they're gonna give you that
kick in the gut and they're gonna make
your balls tingle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
