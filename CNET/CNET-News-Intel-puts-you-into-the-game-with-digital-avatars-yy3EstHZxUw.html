Broncos vanish game so let's go ahead
and cue this up but and it's really easy
to do so all I need is a real sense in
able to in one like this HP Spectre x2
and I'm just going to go ahead and using
this 3d capture software to take a
little take a little 3d model of my boss
here and this is going to allow us to
take the 3d capture and put it right
into our game so as you can see right
now i'm covering up all of ryan's skin
here and capturing that digitally so i
can go ahead and right into the game

avatar okay intel blue jumpsuit to all
of that I mean looking good right I
think it looks great but now we want to
take this to the next level and with

supported games that we have across
including ones of the most popular type
like we have this beautiful six
generation modded pc and according to
the theme we're going to be playing
