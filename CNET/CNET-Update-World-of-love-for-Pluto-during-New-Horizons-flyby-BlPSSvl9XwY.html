Carey this is your cnet update after
nine years of soaring through three
billion miles of our solar system NASA's
new Horizons spacecraft zipped by Pluto
Tuesday morning snapping photos and
scanning the atmosphere becoming the
first spacecraft to visit the distant
dwarf planet and it's moon Charon
history was made at 749 a.m. eastern
time when New Horizons was closest to
Pluto just about 8,000 miles from the
surface celebrations were had at Mission
Control at the Johns Hopkins Applied
Physics lab in Maryland engineers
cheered but really no one would know if
the craft made it until it reestablishes
contact later Tuesday night it flew by
Pluto at a super-fast 31,000 miles per
hour which is about 8 miles a second but
getting data back to earth is a slow
process with information traveling
slower than dial up internet speeds and
it will keep sending back data for the
next 16 months we may not see more
close-up images until another day or so
this color photo is from Monday right
before the flyby the images are a
thousand times better than what was
captured with the Hubble telescope and
we're all feeling the love of Pluto with
this latest image that reveals a
heart-shaped feature on the planet some
scientists believe it could be fresh
deposits of frost others have referred
to it as an eagle and some have visions
of a different sort of Pluto over in New
York City the American Museum of Natural
History hosted a real-time visualization
of what New Horizons was doing with
commentary from Mission Control
astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson
director of the museum's Hayden
Planetarium was one of the hosts of the
event and as he explained in an
interview after the event this mission
was no easy task and compared it to
threading a needle from New York to Los
Angeles yeah this this is a triumph of
engineering and the laws of physics
Tyson was among those leading the change
to downgrade Pluto from a planet to
dwarf status in 2006 because it didn't
behave the same as other planetary
bodies but what's discovered on this
won't change its status no matter what
it finds it's still an icy body orbiting
in the Kuiper belt and so our exhibit
recut into metal need not change at all
we'd like to put some updated images for
sure but in terms of what how we are
treating it the the nomenclature is not
what led our efforts here this isn't the
end of its 700 million dollar mission
New Horizons continues to travel further
into space into a region known as the
Kuiper belt and along with the Pluto
data it can provide us with clues to how
the solar system was formed and so far
we've already learned that Pluto is a
little bit bigger than we expected
that's it for this tech news update
there's always more to explore at cnet
com from our studios in New York I'm
