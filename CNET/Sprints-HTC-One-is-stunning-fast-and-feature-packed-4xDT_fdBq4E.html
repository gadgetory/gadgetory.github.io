and right now we're taking a first look
at the HTC One smartphone for sprint
this 32 gigabyte version will be sold by
Sprint beginning april 19th for 1 99 99
now a lot of people have been waiting
for the HTC one to start hitting US
carriers honestly I can understand why
this handset is downright gorgeous its
chassis is carved from a single piece of
aluminum using what HTC calls a zero gap
construction method the phone is
available in hues of both black and a
silver model that you see here measuring
just 0.3 7 inch thick the one is
extremely thin tipping the scales at 5.1
ounces the device is light too
considering its metal build materials a
big bright 4.7 inch LCD screen offers a
sharp 1080p resolution and a pixel
density of 468 PPI that's more than both
the droid DNA and samsung galaxy s4
above the display sits a 2.1 megapixel
front-facing camera and notification
light below are just two capacitive
android buttons to massive speakers sit
on either side of the screen which
enable what HTC calls boom sound really
a flamboyant phrase describing the ones
stereo sound plus that it produces a lot
more volume than typical phone speakers
what's really interesting is how the
power button also doubles as an IR
blaster to control home theater
equipment a volume rocker is placed on
the right side while I sim card slot
holds court on the left on the bottom
edge sits the phones microUSB port
around back is the 4 megapixel main
camera and LED flash which also uses
HTC's ultra pixel sensor positively
packed with advanced software components
and features the HTC One runs Android
jelly bean with the company's latest
iteration of sense UI on top of it
what's really new here though is the
blinkfeed feature which acts similarly
to flip board and other news aggregators
to pull in updates from a curated group
of sources you can push blinkfeed to the
side and use another more traditional
home screen as your main default view
you can't however get rid of glint feed
completely blinkfeed also
the weather and time plus slick
animations to indicate current weather
conditions all this is powered by a 1.7
gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon 600
processor backed up by two gigabytes of
RAM and 32 gigabytes of internal storage
one bummers at the phone lacks an SD
card slot for memory expansion and its
battery is embedded at first glance this
is the most beautiful smartphone I've
held in my hands hopefully it will also
deliver on performance features and
usability I'm Brian Bennett for cnet.com
and this has been a first look at the
sprint HTC One be sure to check back
soon for a full review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
