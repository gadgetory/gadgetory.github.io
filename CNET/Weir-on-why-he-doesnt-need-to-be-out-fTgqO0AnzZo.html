wanting there are fifty years ago these
same kinds of discussions and mourning
the new generations to grow up with a
different set of images and role models
do you think do you see any kind of
fitting being more explicit about where
you fit in in that continuum and then I
guess the second part of my question
this year for the first time there's a
Wright house edition of the hockey house
and all the different Canada pavilions
there's a pride house specifically for
athletes and continue is that something
you were aware of is that a place it
interested in mystery you know I didn't
actually know that existed but I feel
like that would be the best place to go
I feel like it'd be the most fun I mean
I think there's no contest that everyone
says that gay and lesbian clubs have the
best music so if I need to get my swerve
on
but no but for the next generation I
don't feel you know the reason that I am
not explicit about who or what I sleep
with it it's because I don't think it
should matter I don't think anything
matters that makes me I don't think the
fact that I'm a figure skater matters I
don't think who I sleep with matters I
don't think where I come from matters I
want people to see me for who I not what
I am
and I think that should go for for many
many people I would never judge somebody
by their cover I would never judge
somebody without knowing them without
really seeing who they were as a person
what somebody doesn't know
in my life I feel that that's it's my
personal tradition
I don't feel that that there's anything
that anybody has to be completely out
and about about I think you should be
out about being yourself you should be
out about being Johnny reader errababu
shinka you need to be out and really own
who you are to be taken seriously for me
that's the one important thing I look
for when I'm auditioning people to be my
friend to be in my circle I mean I want
I want honesty I want love I want to
support that I want you to be yourself
so everything that makes me up for her
doesn't matter to me it's just I love
him as him that's that's what that's for
my idea of being a good person</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
