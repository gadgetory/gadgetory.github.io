ThinkPads they make x1 ThinkPads that's
the super high-end version high design
high style a little slimmer a little
lighter now they've got an excellent
version of the yoga so this is the
Lenovo ThinkPad x1 yoga and of course
like other yoga's you could pick it up
tilt the screen all the way like this
banded all the way backwards that's kind
of a kiosk mode like this then you can
fold the screen all the way back and you
have a tablet with the keyboard the
keyboard trade sort of rises up so they
have a flat surface here and of course
the keys are and touchpad are
deactivated but then you could fold it
back like this
now we've seen all this before what's so
different about this guy it is the first
hybrid with an OLED screen oh LED that
is the super high-end television
technology that you're gonna want in
your next TV it's still too expensive
right now we've only seen it in a
handful of other computer products but
when you see it in person the blacks are
deeper the colors are richer the display
can be very very thin it's really
extraordinary looking and even seeing it
on something relatively small like this
14-inch hybrid it really it really makes
a difference it pops right out
right next to it this is a x1 carbon
which is a very nice high-end clamshell
laptop with a regular non OLED screen
looks fine too but you can definitely
see the difference between these two and
of course because this is a tablet like
hybrid you get a stylus with the x1 yoke
it actually hides right over here and it
recharges just by plugging into this
slot you can get this guy with the
current generation Intel Core i7
processors it's going to start at 14 49
for a regular screen and what the olan
that's $200 more at CES 2016 that's the
Lenovo ThinkPad x1 yoga</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
