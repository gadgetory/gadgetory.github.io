digital with the real world and iOS is
the largest AR platform in the world and
we believe a R is going to bring an
entirely new dimension to the classroom
enabling new ways to learn well the
eight that this iPad has the power of
the 810 fusion combined with the big
beautiful Retina display advanced
cameras and sensors that enable
incredible AR experience is simply not
possible on other devices imagine you're
in a history class and you want to view
a prized piece of art you basically have
two choices you can either look at a
book or you go to a museum and that
museum may be nowhere near you
well imagine instead if you could
instantly view that piece of art hanging
on the walls of your classroom well
bolivars working on an app which allows
students to do just that
they can walk right up the place this
works of art for museums around the
world get up close enough to see the
individual brushstrokes check out every
detail you can place a beautifully
detailed landscape right on the table in
front of you and you can explore and
interact with it
students can fly in through the clouds
easily move around the free-flowing
River Valley students can see what it's
like if they decide to build a
hydropower dam in a bad location and the
impact of their decision on the
environment
this is just so cool the last app I'm
going to show you is one of my favorites
it's called Fraga pedia by design mate
it allows you to experience biology in a
way you never could before but the magic
they are students can place a virtual
frog right on their desk and they can
explore the inner workings of that frog
in a way they never could with a real
frog they can even take a built-in quiz
to identify the individual organs we
just love this stuff
and since we've made both the hardware
and the software nothing comes even
close to offering the powerfully simple
or magical experience that iPad can and
even if all these enhancements were
pleased that were able to offer this new
iPad for the same $329 starting price
for you for consumers and we're super
pleased to offer this for schools for
just $2.99</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
