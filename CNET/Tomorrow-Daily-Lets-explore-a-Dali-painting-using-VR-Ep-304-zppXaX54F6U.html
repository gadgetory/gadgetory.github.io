welcome to tomorrow daily the best ski
talk show in the known universe i'm jeff
cannata I'm Ashley ask Evan you are
watching one of our miniature episodes
hit you real fast with three and a half
minutes 25 minutes of quick headlines
and a phone target for the day and then
on Thursday you can check back in
because we're gonna deep dive on some of
the stories that we've covered this week
as well as have a guest it's gonna be
awesome and fun yes an extravaganza if
you will a future tech and excitement
all right time to hit the headlines
exploring a surrealist painting is now
possible at least if you're into
Salvador Dali this past weekend the dali
museum opened its most recent exhibition
Disney and Dolly architects of the
imagination there's a special feature
exhibit within the show a virtual
reality tour of one of dollies paintings
developers spent four months perfecting
the five minute long experience called
dreams of Dali visitors use an oculus
rift to be transported inside a 360
degree render of the painting bringing
Dolly's art to life in a high-tech way
even better now that the exhibit is open
if you have google cardboard or Samsung
gear VR you can experience it yourself
right your very own home pretty cool
which I will be doing post haste isn't a
great how like there's these super
expensive high-end VR things but also
like twenty dollar google cardboard
pretty much works with all of them too
yeah I totally love it I mean you can
check it out whenever you want wherever
you want it's the best okay well we're
gonna go from virtual reality to drones
which seem to be theme this week
specifically drones that might help
search and rescue efforts startup
company fly ability took its gimbal
drone over to the zermatt glacier in the
Swiss Alps to put it to a serious
durability test they flew the drone
through a huge crevasse shooting video
as they flew and running into the
glaciers jagged walls as they went
there's a cage surrounding the gibble
drone that translates impacts into
rotational energy so when it slams into
a wall it just keeps
on flyin the gimbals intended use is
industrial inspection but after watching
this I think there's definitely a case
for search and rescue even better less
experienced pilots can use the gimbal
because of its durability so finding
people amidst rubble or in treacherous
spots would be possible I love the idea
that this thing to just crash into stuff
and it just rotates right through it I
know it just keeps on going we get one
of those for like my car and everything
else yeah a suit with a cage amazing hey
