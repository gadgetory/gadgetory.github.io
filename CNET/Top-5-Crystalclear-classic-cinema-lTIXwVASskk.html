and somewhat aroused about titles like
avatar and Dark Knight but you might be
surprised to learn that some of the best
looking movies on blu-ray are also some
of the oldest I'm Brian Cooley with the
top five classic films that look
incredible on a blu-ray disc these are
pre-1970 movies selected from cnet
editors latest list of the 40 must have
blu-ray titles then we rank them by the
picture quality tears found over at AVS
forum's let's go put your hands up your
lopsided beggar number Five's The Wizard
of Oz god I hate this movie but this
release looks so good I might even sit
through it again with the sound downs I
don't have to listen to those damn
munchkin Warner's kicked out the stops
on this one they remastered it from a
new film scam that has four times the
resolution of the best HD TV still this
movie is in for three narrow screen but
it's perhaps the only narrow screen blu
ray title we can say we love number four
is Hitchcock's North by Northwest
actually I've always thought this movie
has some of the best scenes out there
for a 3d version but until that happens
you can enjoy the crop duster and the
Mount Rushmore scenes and outstanding
high def thanks to the fact that this
film was shot in VistaVision which was
kind of a high-def film technique of its
day number three the Bridge on the River
Kwai it seems we'll all be dead in the
desert before they release Lawrence of
Arabia on blu-ray so this other David
Lean classic will have to hold you over
another disc that was mastered from a 4k
digital scan of a great print and I dare
you not to be whistling by the end of it
number two is 2001 a Space Odyssey so
many sensations here you'll feel like a
thief when you get it for just ten bucks
on amazon you'll feel guilty for making
your TV even try to render this discs
amazingly deep black levels and you'll
feel stupid at the end because you'll
have no idea what that ending means
that's quite a night out on your sofa
before I get you to our number one
classic film that looks incredible on
blu-ray maybe you just aren't into that
whole paying for content thing in which
case you'll be intrigued by this list
the top five pirated movies according to
TorrentFreak they crunch numbers going
back to like 2006 we of course encourage
legal acquisition of media but
apparently a couple of you don't ok the
number one classic film that's gonna
blow you away on blu-ray disc is Ben Hur
11 oscars the most ever for one film the
most expensive film ever when it was
made on the biggest set ever constructed
that it was made featuring the longest
film score ever composed and a nine
minute chariot ricks Warner's spent a
million dollars just restoring this film
and if you get the ultimate collector's
edition you'll also get four hours of
special content that's more chuck testa
matunuck than I really need for a look
at cnet's full list of 40 must have
blu-ray discs and more top fives like
this go to top 5 cnet com I'm Brian
Cooley thanks for watching
