GSM phone then you probably want to know
about the Alcatel OneTouch Idol
I'm Jessica Dahl court for CNET I'm
gonna tell you about this phone now this
phone sells on Alcatel website for $299
and it runs Android 4.1 jelly bean it's
positioned as an entry-level smartphone
not because of all of the specs
necessarily but mostly because it
completely lacks 4G it is a 3G only
phone it does have a nice 4.7 inch LCD
display it isn't the highest HD quality
but it is still pretty comfortable the
very slim phone has a brushed metallic
finish an 8 megapixel camera on the back
with flash will capture 720p HD video
and playback 1080p HD video there's also
a 2 megapixel camera on the front I was
fairly impressed with the camera quality
but part of that could also be because I
really wasn't expecting much so it
surpassed my expectations to keep costs
lower there's only 4 gigabytes of
internal storage on here and the
processing speed is a little bit slow
the phone isn't running the pure Google
Android experience it does have a small
and light
Alcatel interface on top but with that
comes a few little extras including one
gesture that I really like where you can
lock the screen by placing your hand in
front of it this isn't a bad little
unlocked phone however I think you're
gonna get more for your money with the
LG Nexus 4 so I would really look into
that before looking into this one
however it's not a bad start for Alcatel
in the US
I'm Jessica Dahl short for CNET this has
been the Alcatel OneTouch Idol you can
catch my full review at cnet.com
