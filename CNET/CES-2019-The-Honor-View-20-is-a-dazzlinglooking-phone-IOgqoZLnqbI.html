honor view 20 from the front it looks
like an ordinary phone but trust me it's
not all you have to do is turn it over
to the back look at this beautiful
phantom red color and you can see it's
anything but a typical device we're
gonna take a look and see what's inside
all right I lied we're gonna keep
talking about this amazing finish
because it's mesmerizing and I haven't
seen it on any other phone Huawei calls
it nano textured technology but the
effect is a series of Chevron's that
emerges in the light the phone comes in
blue besides red and both colors look
great it's just a shame that the second
you put on a case you're going to ruin
the look but this phone has a lot more
going for it besides color alone let's
start with the massive six point four
inch display which is truly edge to edge
do you see how the front-facing camera
is just a round hole cut out of the
screen do you see how the sensors have
moved to the top of the phone these are
small but significant changes because in
the end you're getting more screen space
in a sexier design the front-facing
camera here can also take photos up to
25 megapixels although you're probably
not going to use that setting most of
the time there's also an AR filter so
you can make huawei's version of apples
and emoji and there's portrait lighting
for photos all of this is peanuts
compared to the rear camera which can
take photos up to 48 megapixels using
ail ultra clarity mode this takes a
series of shots over 5 seconds and then
compiles them all into one super photo
again these files are enormous which
means that you're not going to take most
of your pictures this way but when you
do you will be able to crop in tight two
shots without losing detail the rear
camera is billed as having 3d
capabilities that can separate the
subject the person or thing that you're
shooting from the background and that
means that the subject and the
background can be treated differently so
there's one mode on here that will let
you slim somebody down when taking a
photo there's another 3d feature and
it's a little bit confusing but bear
with me if the camera is pointed your
way you can actually use your body to
control a compatible game in this case a
skiing game the phone also has to be
connected to a monitor through a dock
HDMI cable or miracast connection for
this to be able to work
now for the rest of the specs the honor
view 20 has a USB C port but also a
standalone headphone jack it's really
nice that you don't lose that on this
phone there's a four thousand milliamp
battery fast charging and dual SIM
capability as well a limited edition pro
version will have two new colors
including black plus more RAM and more
storage so with the pro version you
would get a gigabytes of RAM versus six
with this regular version and 25
gigabytes of storage instead of 128
gigabytes either way it's still pretty
good with the standard version the pro
version will also cost more but we don't
know how much yet we don't have the
pricing or availability we're gonna find
that out on this phone officially
launches in Paris January 22nd</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
