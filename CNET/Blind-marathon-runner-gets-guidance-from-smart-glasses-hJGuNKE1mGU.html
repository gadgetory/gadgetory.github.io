you're approaching a larger pack in the
middle here and about ten more steps
they look like they're moving slower
than you Eric Mansur isn't the first
legally blind runner to finish the
Boston Marathon but he is the first to
do so with a remote guide and a pair of
smart glasses okay you have your GPS
my path to blindness has been kind of
gradual over many years I could drive a
car until about 15 years ago you know
what I have remaining at this point I
describe if you were to look through a
drinking straw and cover the end of that
drinking straw with wax paper Erik
Mansur has a degenerative eye disease
called retinitis pigmentosa Mansur
trained for the marathon by running
around his neighborhood with this Google
glass connected to Jessica an agent from
a San Diego startup called IRA yes that
Google glass the same ones people
dismissed as being creepy and useless
now smart glasses are getting a second
look partly thanks of those who can't
see this dashboard shows Jessica's point
of view yeah sounds good oh my gosh yes
but the Boston Marathon would push the
smart glasses system the visually
impaired usually prefer to take two
sighted guides for the 26.2 mile race in
matters case one of those guides happen
to be two states away in Boston when the
gun goes off you know there's the
initial congestion at the very beginning
of a race you're packed in like sardines
there are situations in that kind of
packed in congestion where it literally
feels like people are appearing out of
nowhere a few people have you narrow
Katya
because of limited battery and
continuity problems the Google glass
system couldn't fully replace a human
guide but Jessica was there for 16 of
the 26 miles including the last one hi
Jess its Roger
how you doing I was curious to see how
effective a remote guy could be so IRA
supplied me with Google glass and
connected me with the same agent while I
walked around Central Park with an eye
mask on it's either a brilliant idea or
a terrible idea the goal was to go about
450 feet from a bridge to a model boat
pond
I generally took my first few steps
fearful tripping or crashing into
someone or something all right this is
actually a bit scarier than I realize
but after a while I got you suggest
occur describe the scene okay I felt
much more comfortable picked up the pace
perhaps a little too comfortable I res
one of the more colorful examples that
there's life yet for smart glasses oh
wow
and it's not alone
the officer hub design group is working
to make its own glasses to historically
geared towards doctors and factory
workers snap spectacles have brought a
hip vibe to embedded cameras and glasses
and Microsoft Apple and Facebook are all
pouring billions into augmented reality
and ideal technology for smart glasses
mansur for one clearly sees the
opportunity the importance of having
technology that can be used by everyone
regardless of age or ability is
something that I feel very personally
strong about so while there are hangups
that we all need to get over it's clear
that there's a lot of good that can come
from smart eyewear the technology could
potentially change how we view the world
as long as we keep finding smart ways to
use it
