year of unlimited data service wait what
yes it sounds crazy and that's because
wireless carriers are willing to do
crazy things these days to get your
business there's no major catch but
there are a few limitations for starters
you need to be switching from Verizon
AT&amp;amp;T or t-mobile also this is online
only Sprint does not plan on advertising
this deal which is only offered until
the end of June and you'll need to bring
your own unlocked phone you can keep
your phone number so if your phone is
already paid off and you're not
currently in a contract this could be a
sweet deal although it won't work with
every phone only some models are
eligible which include the iPhone Google
Nexus and pixel some Motorola phones and
the Samsung Galaxy s7 and SAT your phone
may not even work on Sprint's Network
for example if you have an iPhone 7 on
ATT or t-mobile it's not gonna work on
Sprint because it doesn't have the right
CDMA chip to use the Sprint network but
the iPhone 7 on Verizon would work fine
so how free is free you still have to
pay three dollars for a SIM card and
monthly taxes and fees the $30
activation fee is going to be credited
back to you and if you don't use
electronic billing or auto pay Sprint's
gonna charge you more fees now if you
want to leave Sprint you can anytime
there's no penalty because you're not in
a contract you may be wondering how can
sprint afford to give away free service
well one executive told us that Sprint
normally doesn't make any money off a
customer in the first year anyway with
with all those promotional deals and
whatnot it's a good time to be a
wireless customer Sprint's deal is the
most extreme freebie we've seen yet two
months ago the best offer was from AT&amp;amp;T
offering free HBO I'm Bridget Carey you
can find a comparison of the different
carriers unlimited plans at cnet.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
