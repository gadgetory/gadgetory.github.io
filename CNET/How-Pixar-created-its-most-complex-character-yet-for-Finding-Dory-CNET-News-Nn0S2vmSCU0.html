hi I'm Dorian hey yeah so I'm a
character supervisor we have to engineer
the puppet basically that the animators
used to create the performance actually
an engineer worked on Hank for about six
months I think just figuring out how to
do a new create a new type of curve that
the tentacles could use to make an
octopus move around and squish and
squash yet make it specific enough that
animators can grab any part of him and
move correctly was a problem of
simplifying breaking it apart into
individual pieces and putting it back
together again this is an octopus
walking on land it's horrifying but
there's a complexity of motion here and
a specificity in terms of how it
interacts with the ground how it can
connect at any point and move his name's
Hank I have to find my family
that's a hard one this is kind of what
the art department gives us it's kind of
like a bit of a blueprint right so this
is a really early version of Hank and
the cool thing here what you can't see
is that all of these tentacles were set
up slightly differently we kind of look
at it like we're building animation this
race car and we're giving it then to
drive so we gave them different
configurations in each of these
tentacles this is a simple test of can
we get that like rolling elbow or that
elbow that travels down the length that
you see so much in octopus movement
where the curl is actually unfurling
it's not bending like a human elbow and
this was a real breakthrough test for us
you can see it's starting to have that
weight and slop that a tentacle you want
it to have its contacting and sticking
and then releasing it's doing all that
stuff that we were challenged to build
and this was about a year after we'd
started Wow working on it so that was a
long it was a long time before we got to
this Mary our friend is in there lost
alone baby you've got to use your
application I feel stupid for babies let
me get that for you
it just kind of shows the flexibility
interface it can squash it can stretch
it can move around if you move a
tentacle the whole body reacts to that
motion this is a final animation and I
hit the front two tentacles and show the
controls underneath so you can kind of
see what it looks like underneath this
is what kind of animators are
manipulating all the time
here's that shot final and with that in
mind like you can you can kind of see
all the sweetening that lighting is put
into the shading and the shading on top
of the animation and how none of us
really knew and then the sim like how
how they're controlling the way the
suckers are interacting and the extra
jiggle it's just really cool and the
camouflage is really cool too so our
shading artist he actually applied
animated textural effect all over Hanks
skin at this very kind of cellular level
I don't know if you know how how
camouflage an octopus can get but they
can change their color to anything how
the light interacts with it the texture
here's the final shot you can see the
beginning the sort of whole gamut
they've got like a projected texture
through that camouflage that'll reveal
him and then you'll see all that drippy
squishy motioned that we were so hard on
and then you know the animators spent a
long time on the shot I think this shot
from when we started - when this shot
was final I think it was two years this
specific scene yeah because this was one
of the first shots that they put into
production so I think the first shot was
final two years after we started the
project a lot of blood sweat tears yeah
from a lot of people during you were
about to find your parents and when you
do that you pee</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
