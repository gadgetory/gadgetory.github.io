in 2014 I probably opt for a samsung
tablet the reason being is that Samsung
continues to make these really heavy
refinements to its tablet interface and
with each new Samsung tablet I know
there's something cool and new and above
all useful waiting for me which brings
us to the latest Samsung tablet in the
note line the Samsung Galaxy Note pro
this is a 12.2 inch behemoth but it
looks and feels like a modern samsung
tablet in all the best ways it has a
2560 by 1600 resolution screen a microSD
expansion slot and IR blaster so you can
use it as a remote control micro USB for
charging and file transfers as well
there's the faux stitching design from
some recent Samsung products and given
that it has a 12 point 2 inch screen
size it's surprisingly thin and light
that said if you have small hands you
may find it difficult to hold with just
one of them I always found it difficult
to write comfortably on these smaller
note tablets but with this new larger
one I feel like I have almost enough
space to work and my hands don't get so
cramped when writing there's an 8
megapixel camera with LED flash on the
back and a 2 megapixel camera on the
front they're decent but neither takes
especially impressive pics overall
performance is about on par with most
premium tablets currently in the market
however I was disappointed in what feels
like a more narrow viewing angle than
Sadie ipad air or a kindle fire HDX 8.9
the screens colors just don't remain
consistent when looking from different
angles and it reflects quite a bit of
its own environment as well Samsung's
TouchWiz interface has changed a lot
over the last few years and it's only
gotten better with each iteration and
this version is the best one yet all the
shortcuts and customization options are
here the amount of settings available is
staggering but Samsung keeps them all
well organized the new magazine UX
interface is best described as having a
widget base front with Flipboard
underneath and that it actually uses
Flipboard for its inner
you can customize the magazine you Lex
to your liking and minimize its
footprint if you prefer the traditional
Android interface there's also a ton of
productivity software from WebEx meeting
to s note 2 ii meeting as well as free
subscriptions to Business Week and the
New York Times the note pro starts at
seven hundred and fifty dollars for 32
gigabytes of storage and the 64 gigabyte
version is one hundred dollars more
expensive check out my four of you at
cnet com more information and my final
recommendation i'm eric franklin and
this has been a first look at the
samsung galaxy note pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
