want something with right around a 10
inch screen how do I know that well you
go smaller basically you've got a
phablet go bigger you might as well get
a laptop the most famous of the 10-inch
ish tablets is of course the classic
nine point seven inch iPad but night
guys still more three hundred dollars
amazon has a solution that's a lot less
expensive and might do everything you
want or by not but there's no arguing
with the Amazon Fire HD tens prize it
starts at one hundred and fifty dollars
and that gets you a high-res screen and
32 gigs of storage just like an iPad now
for 150 bucks you get a mostly plastic
body that's a little on the thick side
but inside this body is everyone's
favorite digital assistant Alexa sure
she's practically everywhere now but
this version is voice-activated on other
fire tablets you have to hit a button to
activate Alexa and some of the things
you ask come with on-screen graphics now
just like you'd get from an echo show
the key thing to remember about an
Amazon tablet is that it wants you to
use Amazon stuff so the video tab is for
Amazon videos including prime music is
for Amazon music services books are for
Kindle books and so on you can download
other services from the Amazon App Store
from Netflix of Hulu to Spotify and
Pandora the bilder under the apps tab so
remember to look for them there most of
what you're looking for is in that app
store including a lot of the top Android
games but a few things like Google
Chrome or Microsoft Office are missing
if you're writing a novel doing homework
or using the built-in camera to start
your own YouTube channel well go get a
laptop or at least a Chromebook but for
an excellent media consumption
experience on a device that definitely
feels like it should cost more than $150
it's hard to imagine anyone beating this
