the middle of holiday shopping season it
seems so what are you gonna buy when it
comes to the good old fashioned laptop
laptops are around of course there are
Windows ones there are Mac ones in the
windows world what do you have that's
not a tablet transformable thingamajig
what do you have that's something that
is an everyday type of computer if it's
not gonna cost a lot
well we've seen touch windows ultrabooks
floating around for a while at that $800
price pretty good but a lot of those
models have been discontinued Samsung
had the series 9 which was a great sleek
MacBook Air like in the windows world
that got renamed
the book 9 and then got split into two
different products the book 9 plus and
the book 9 light which is what we're
looking at here a more affordable spin
on the Samsung Book 9 / series 9 a long
time ago but you're giving up quite a
bit I think to get down to this price
it's $800 maybe 749 depending on where
you shopped for it and it's got a
touchscreen which of course a lot of
Windows 8 laptops have now and it's got
a sleek ish design but it's plastic and
it has a different processor than a lot
of ultrabooks instead of an Intel Core
i5 or i7 this is an AMD quad core
processor and it's not specified
particularly which one it is it's a
custom AMD processor that Samsung has
inside this laptop plus your 4 gigs of
ram 128 gig SSD but a pretty plasticky
feel no backlit keyboard and you know
the ports are a little bit shrunken down
micro HDMI which a lot of people may not
be a fan of let's get down to the
processing here the quad-core AMD
processor is fine but it's not as fast
as others in our benchmark tests so
you're giving up there and the battery
life is about 5 hours which is not that
great now you can get battery life up in
the 8 hour plus range which a lot of
laptops are throwing out there with 4th
gen Intel processors based on what we've
seen so is it worth it man I would get
it if it was on sale something like $600
but 749 seems too expensive
if you were a Samsung design fan or
you're using the Samsung app ecosystem
Samsung does have
I think on here which allows you to
connect and use a Samsung phone certain
ones in the Galaxy line and show the
phone on here as a second screen but I
would hold out try to find an Intel
powered one or something that's maybe
pay up a little bit more in a $900
$1,000 if you really want something
better or you can see what's
discontinued out there honestly we've
seen $800 ultrabooks that match this
performance and ones that are even more
affordable so look around out there on
Amazon and see what else you could find
the book 9 light noble effort a little
too expensive and not a fan of the
processing power
I'm Scott Stein and that's a quick look
at the Samsung ativ book 9 light also
available in white</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
