here at CES 2013 and I'm showing you
busy O's glasses-free 3d TV this is a 55
inch TV
it's a proof-of-concept right now
there's no ship date there's no pricing
there's no proof that this thing will
ever actually see the light of day for
consumers but it is the coolest version
of glasses-free 3d TV I've seen yet
instead of the technique of using a
camera to track your head to determine
who's who's going to get the 3d signal
sent to their eyeballs they've actually
made this so that it is static and
there's multiple zones set up for
different users so anyone can sit on
their couch you can get multiple keep
people on the couch sitting in front of
the glasses-free 3d TV and they're all
gonna get that glasses free experience
and instead of the headaches involved in
the head tracking version that we've
seen before
from Toshiba if you fall out of range if
you fall in one of the little dead zones
for the glasses-free 3d effect it just
turns 2d it just makes the 3d effect a
lot more subtle so that you're still
getting a great viewing experience and
you're avoiding any of the nausea
associated with a computer trying to
process your head tracking movements in
real time so it looks great another
benefit of glasses-free 3d TV that I'm
noticing here for the first time is that
it's a pretty bright 3d experience
you're not getting any of the dimness
that's going to come along with having a
pair of passive 3d glasses over your
face you're getting a bright 3d
experience and hopefully Vizio will
bring this to consumers if they do it's
going to be under the xvt series
designation so there you go that is
Vizio 's glasses-free 3d HDTV here at
CES 2013</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
