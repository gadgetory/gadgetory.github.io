interesting thing about this new Audi a3
is happening right here in the dashboard
that's what it looks like a tablet
toaster popping up out of the center
dash and one of the headlines on this
car is the fact that's got a 4G
connection how do you sing the first
production vehicle to get a 4G
connection that's coming out this year
and so it's using that 4G connection to
get all this map data from Google and
also these Street view images and
everything they load really fast you can
search the paloma from here vos died in
the button on the steering wheel and
going online search and then sang a
restaurant name for example that'll
likely send off that request to the
internet so that you can search for a
much more updated list of destinations
than what you'll actually have built an
into what i believe is 64 gigabytes of
data they also were telling us about the
picture book navigation this is sort of
a novel feature where your friends can
send you a photo of where they are and
as long as that photo has GPS data
embedded in it you can actually receive
that photo loaded to your car and then
that will become your destination that
outie made their system very modular
they're trying to get away from the five
to eight year product cycles that nvidia
chip it's the whole system on a chip and
it's on a board that just pops right out
the radio is on a board that just pops
right out for the LTE connect
so a two year that they decide they want
to jump up to Tegra 3 or ter Heide or
whatever we're using at that point it's
very easy for them to upgrade the system
in this vehicle without re-engineering
the entire car so we're going to be
seeing out a moving a lot faster than
they've already been doing to make as
far as like we're pushing the technology
or that's got a stray excited</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
