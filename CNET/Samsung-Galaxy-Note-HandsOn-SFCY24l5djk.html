news with a first look at the samsung
galaxy note this is a 5.3 inch android
phone very large screen and what's more
unusual is that it has a stylus called
the s-pen tucked away in the back here
the stylus that you do things you can't
do with an ordinary phone it's based on
Wacom drawing technology they're a
pretty big company when it comes to
tablets most interesting thing is the S
Memo application which you can see here
lets you take notes hello world then
like you're taking notes you can undo
back up something i really like also is
you can change the pen size can you say
for example a paintbrush and you can
draw its pressure-sensitive although i
find it's easier to add pressure than it
is to back it off but if you have a kid
who likes to draw pictures on your phone
or your tablet this is going to be a
great application for them
one nice option with the pen is taking
screenshots and annotating them so for
example we could load up a map and then
to take a screenshot there's a little
button on the side of the pen you'll
hold the button hold it against the
screen and let go of the button and
we'll take a screenshot then you can
annotate you are here
say button after you've taken a
screenshot you can open it up here for
example in the my files folder and send
it by email to your friend
the sense of galaxies no it's pretty
responsive it's got a 1.4 gigahertz
dual-core Samsung processor runs android
2.3 on the front it has an 8-megapixel
excuse me on the back it has an 8
megapixel camera and LED flash and on
the front it's got a 2 megapixel camera
good for video conferencing can shoot
1080p video it's got an accelerometer
barometer and a digital compass
optionally it's got NFC it's a fairly
responsive device for example you scroll
around the maps on pinch-to-zoom you can
see it's generally responds pretty
quickly so it's a pretty good device
it's got a 1280 by 800 pixel Super
AMOLED screen from etho this is stephen
