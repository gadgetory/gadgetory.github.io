the new category of speakers which
offers both better TV sound and multi
room music this is a sleek unit which
comes with a wireless subwoofer and
slips in just under the $800 mark the
home cinema offers excellent music
reproduction and support for a decent
number of streaming services however
it's not as good at home cinema the
first reason is that the sub is kind of
small and not as capable of producing
deep bass as its rivals the second is
that there is no remote control well you
can program in your TV remote control of
all the functions can only be done with
your smartphone the system offers a
number of different connection options
including HDMI and optical or coaxial be
aware that it doesn't offer bluetooth
out of the box only Wi-Fi playback this
is done via the he√µs app which can be a
little roundabout sometimes for example
if you want to change the TV while
you're listening to music you may find
yourself swiping back numerous screens
instead of just being able to press a TV
button at its price level there's no
real standouts as there are under $500
but the Denon is equally as capable as
the pulk omni sp1 or Sony s t5 so if
you'll pay less than a grand on the
sound bar that's why it's at least
checking out if you can live without a
remote control this is ty Pendlebury for
