Amazon devices is the second generation
echo plus it costs one hundred and fifty
dollars the same price as the original
but comes with a totally redesigned look
like other echo devices announced this
year the Echo Plus has a new fabric
shell and is available in charcoal
heather gray and sandstone it's also
much shorter than the original echo plus
and has upgraded Dolby speaker hardware
a 3-inch neodymium woofer and increased
volume gives the smart speaker fuller
sound and a better bass response in its
predecessor and when you compare the two
side-by-side you can definitely tell a
difference
some things stay the same though like
the echo plusses built-in ZigBee radio
that serves as a smart home hub so you
won't need a hub plugged into your
router to control ZigBee devices
amazon's new Wi-Fi simple setup makes
this super easy to simply plug in your
device and ask the plus to discover it
there's also a new built-in temperature
sensor so you can set routines to
trigger based on the temperature sensed
by the echo plus and a new capability
called local voice controlled compresses
commands locally on your device so if
the Wi-Fi goes down you can still turn
your lights on and off with the echo dot
at $50 and the echo at 100 dollars is
the Amazon echo plus worth the extra
cash if you're starting your smart home
want Amazon's voice assistant to control
it and you need a smart home hub then
yes the echo plus is the speaker for you
the sound of graves in the newest echo
dot and the redesign of the echo show
means there's no shortage of Amazon
speakers to choose from the echo plus
makes some decent strides forward in
this generation but if you already have
a smart home hub I'd recommend another
smart speaker that either saves you
money or adds a screen to your
experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
