and we have a first look at Apple's iOS
4.3 beta that's been released to
developers but not the general public
yet so we'll show you what's inside for
both the iPad and the iPhone now the
most exciting changes are on the iPad
Apple is now giving users the option to
decide if they want the switch on the
side to be a mute switch or a screen
rotation lock you'll find the option in
the settings and after all the
complaining Apple is finally giving us a
choice now the sweetest feature is
support for four finger and five finger
multi-touch gestures you can now switch
between all of your open apps with a
swipe to the side with four fingers and
you can go back and forth between your
apps
some of them might take a little time to
load while you switch but this is still
the developers build now if you want to
close an app and return to the home
screen pinch your four or five fingers
together and it will return to the home
screen pretty nifty and if you want
access to the multitasking bar swipe up
from the bottom to the top with four or
five fingers and voila you've got that
too now you do have the option to turn
these gestures on or off in the settings
on the iPhone we all know that Verizon
is offering the mobile hotspot feature
which allows you to take your connection
and share it with up to five other
devices on the current build of iOS 4.3
you'll also have that option for GSM
carriers like AT&amp;amp;T so if you go to the
settings and then network we'll see the
personal hotspot option but it isn't an
active feature that AT&amp;amp;T has made
available yet now the iPhone version of
iOS 4.3 also gives you the option to
play your message alert tone up to 10
times every two minutes just to make
sure you get your messages and the
screen shot sound effect is slightly
different and I'm not making this up but
you might like it and on both the iPhone
and iPad there's a new font available
called noteworthy in the Notes app and
let's be honest that's one of the
feature you're most excited about now
these features aren't final so don't get
too attached to them and Apple may
choose to remove them or keep them at
any time but there you have it i'm brian
tong from cnet.com and there's your
first look at Apple's iOS 4.3 beta
