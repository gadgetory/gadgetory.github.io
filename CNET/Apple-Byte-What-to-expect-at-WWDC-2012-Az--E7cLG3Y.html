the apple byte we're bringing you all
the good and bad stuff inside the world
Apple in I just got back from e3 after
some real intense gaming sessions WWDC
is just around the corner and we're
expecting a preview of iOS 6 and more
amount line but what you want what I
want more than anything else is brand
new hardware and we could potentially
see the rebirth of the mac pro after
retail park numbers were tracked down
for what's believed to be the next gen
macro after almost a two-year wait now
putting that m.i.c gadget the mac pros
will feature intel xeon e5 processors
with either six or eight cores native
USB 3.1 durable support 1600 megahertz
memory support and SATA 3 native
connectivity which will be a boost for
solid-state drives which means is
finally time to upgrade way Jeff please
stop that's so embarrassing it's not no
okay guys well that discovery was then
blown open wide by AppleInsider after a
list of 27 new apple part numbers with
14 of them appearing to be mac hardware
was sent to them by an australian dealer
with access to apple's reseller system
it includes MacBook Airs MacBook Pros
imax and the previously mentioned Mac
Pro's but it would really be a shocker
to me and really uncharacteristic of
Apple to announce all of these products
at one time at WWDC but how about this
if apple announces every single one at
WWDC i will give Jim the shirt off my
back next week Brian I wanna dance yeah
that's uncomfortable but guys I'm
sticking on what I said a few weeks ago
we'll see an iOS 6 preview no iPhone
more mountain lion and MacBook Pros and
airs at WWDC 2012 now let's jump to iOS
and we've heard
news about how Apple's play their own
maps in iOS 6 but at a recent Google
event they announced they're bringing
their own enhanced 3d maps to both
Android and iOS now it's coming soon but
this video shows that it looks pretty
impressive but it will probably be
limited to google earth app that I never
use so what else can we expect to see a
report by TechCrunch says that Facebook
integration will finally be coming to
iOS 6 Tim Cook hinted by saying stay
tuned when asked about Facebook and
Apple during his d-10 interview but it's
reported that it will be integrated in
the same way twitter is with iOS 5 now
you also know I've been pounding on
Cirie we know we have to see a
significant improvement but 9to5 mac
reports that siri plans to make its
debut on the ipad with iOS 6 their
sources and mock-ups say it won't be a
full screen experience but it's unclear
if it will be announced with the other
iOS features now last week we also
showed you pictures of what's claimed to
be the next iPhone but now a hands-on
video with the part from etrade supply
shows us a little better comparison now
there's nothing you revealed but you
can't see the two-tone design which
actually looks more attractive in video
and a side-by-side with the iphone 4s
Apple biters I'm asking you is this
still a hoax what do you think is this
the real deal let us know and also in
more iphone use a KGI Securities analyst
claims the next-gen iphone will have a
thinner and improved front and rear
cameras according to their supply chain
sources it will have the first ever slim
down rear camera while still retaining
its 8 megapixel resolution and it
improved f 2.2 aperture and then the
front-facing camera will be HD to
support its new 16 by 9 resolution so
we'll see how that all shakes out all
right guys Apple biters get ready for
WWDC I know you're giddy apple won't be
streaming it for you but you'll be able
to watch the live play-by-play right
here at cnet with myself me your friend

coverage that's going to do it for this
week's show i'm brian Tong email us at
