show like CES is that we get an
opportunity to preview some of the
phones that we're gonna see coming our
way in 2018 here we've got the Alcatel
five series which will retail somewhere
in the three hundred dollar range set
$300 the three series which will be in
the sub $200 range and then the one
series which is going to be about $100
or less so pretty affordable phones what
they all have in common is they're going
to have a 19 by 8 screen ratio so quite
a lot of screen real estate taller and
more narrow
there are also all gonna have face
unlock that comes with Android and
fingerprint scanners on the back and not
only can you unlock the phone with your
fingerprint but you can also register a
different fingerprint to open a
different app so for example I can use a
different fingerprint say in the middle
finger or my pinky finger to open up
Facebook or the camera or Gmail the
phones have slightly different designs
for example the five series version that
I have here has sort of a brushed finish
on the back we've got a single camera
sort of sharper corners and much more of
a bright metallic finish so it's
definitely trying to be a little bit
sleek and then we've got the three
series here which definitely has sort of
a metallic sheen all along the back but
it isn't brushed this phone definitely
looks a little bit larger as well so
it's something if you like to have a big
phone then phones in this series might
work well for you the 1-series phone
that I have here is a mock-up the screen
isn't working but it's more to give you
an idea of what the device might look
like and this doesn't have any plastic
or metallic style coating on the back
it's definitely a little bit gritty or
what we're seeing here isn't necessarily
what we're going to get but it'll give
you an idea of what's to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
