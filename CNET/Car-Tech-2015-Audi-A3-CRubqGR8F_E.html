angeles auto show but while you might
think the car itself is going to be
fairly basic where it sits in their
model line these guys are turning that
model on its head let me show you the
technology inside this is interesting
now 3g is fairly common in automobiles
but even today it's not typically
embedded and 4g almost unheard of until
now here's audi putting it into their a3
you'd expect me to say eight there
wouldn't you high-end car and
introducing it here in a lower end car
and that's kind of interesting strategy
what you'll do is you'll pop a sim in
the dash like you do with any embedded
connectivity system and you might say
why don't need 4G in a car because 3g is
not a big enough pipe to run what
they're doing in the dash 7000 streaming
radio stations Google Earth which
they've had before in these cars but now
really with some good throttle response
if you will it'll really load with some
snappiness to it here they've got
something called the phone box what
that's going to do is give you a
wireless connection to the external
antenna apparatus in the car here's
another one when this car hits
production it's going to offer an app
that you can optionally install that's
going to let you receive a photo via
messaging to this whole connected
ecosystem which if you want you can tell
the system to navigate to as long as
that photo has GPS coordinates baked
into it which you know most people share
photos with that stuff already turned on
let's look at the audi and of my
interface down here here they've done
something with rockers that kind of
perform double duty radio and media on
one nav and telephone on the other the
knobs gotten bigger because now on the
a3 it's got the right on technology the
finger recognition so you can spell out
a destination as well as do it by voice
as well as do it by click as well as do
it by photo as I just mentioned and the
last thing is useful about a 4G
connection is that it's a big enough
pipe to create a meaningful Wi-Fi
hotspot in the car you can actually
share it without bogging it down to
death I can't say that about 3G that we
have today now how many people can
actually be sharing a hot spot in the
car I'm a little dubious on that because
most of our devices have their cellular
data built in but there are times when
you need it
this is part of a 4g race by the way
without he bringing this in at one of
their lower end cars and with General
Motors saying they're going to have 4g
in most of their 25th teens that arrived
in late 2014 you can see automakers are
doing two things at once embedding and
going to a fatter pipe that's a good
trend overall</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
