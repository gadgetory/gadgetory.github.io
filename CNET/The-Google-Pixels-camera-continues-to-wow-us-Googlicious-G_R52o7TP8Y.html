google issues for everything google
we're talking about now the google pixel
might not be the easiest phone to get
ahold of right now but you have a chance
to get the google home early at a
walmart of all places now according to
reddit users and android police the
google home is on shells at a few
walmart locations around the u.s. with
the 129 dollar price point but the
reports say walmart employees are not
allowed to sell it until it's official
release date on november the fort now i
can't wait to get my hands on it and
compare this to amazon's echo and it's a
real exciting time for AI in the home
until you know it becomes smarter than
us alright the google home has already
been criticized for its slim pickings
for support with third-party devices and
gadgets we know it will get better and
it's a legit complaint but right before
launch the google assistant is getting
if this then that support or IFTTT for
short now what makes this great is that
by connecting it to different services
you can do things like call your phone
if you've lost it or send a tweet by
voice or set your lights to party mode
but someone else has already made these
pre-made recipes or actions for you now
either way if you have a pixel or a home
get on it and it's worth it and speaking
of that google pixel phone as time has
gone on this phone's profile continues
to rise weeks later reviews are still
positive and demand is surpassing the
supply available some users pixels
phones are arriving past the delivery
time that was promised so to make up for
the delay Google is sending a fifty
dollar credit after the phone arrives
like seriously who does that these days
that's a good Google or a good goal
carry out I'll go with that and yes the
camera is still the best ever in a
smartphone so why not showcase some more
great footage from the pixel this one
comes from YouTube channel cars and tech
by JDM City sometimes it's on a slider
other times its handheld there's no
color correction here but it shows how
it manages to still capture great detail
with difficult lighting shots that are
pointed directly at the Sun at dusk now
this other clip comes from Rob Briscoe
and it shows us how tight it's
electronic image stabilization is
compared to the tractors movement in
front of him you'll still get times
where it's correcting the footage but
the stability overall is really
impressive basically these two videos
were just to show off and illustrate how
good this camera is and an update for
nexus 6p owners you might want to stay
away from the Android nougat update if
you haven't done it already one example
shows the ready teddy taking a few
pictures with his battery at more than
halfway charged but the phone then shuts
off and won't turn back on unless you
plug it into its charger other 6p users
are reporting similar issues it's still
early on but it initially appears to be
a software issue with nougat and not a
hardware problem alright that's going to
do it for this week you can always email
me at Google licious at cnet com or to
me at brian Tong thanks so much for
watching we'll catch y'all next time for
some more of that Google ishes Google
