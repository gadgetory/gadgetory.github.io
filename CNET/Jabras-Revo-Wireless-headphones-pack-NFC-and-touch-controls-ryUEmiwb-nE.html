cnet.com and I'm here with the Jabra
Revo wireless headphones this is a
Bluetooth model and I liked it a lot it
has a great design I mean it's a great
everyday headphone it does have a few
drawbacks however what I liked about it
is that it's very comfortable for an
on-air model the ear pads have memory
foam in them that conform nicely to your
ears and it's not too bulky on your head
these are sort of like the beats
wireless headphones but they are a
little bit better I did like them better
you swipe in a circular motion on the
earpiece jabber calls it a turntable
because it has little grooves on it to
make it look like a turntable so you
swipe forward and back to raise and
lower the volume and then you can tap
twice on the front of the turntable to
advance a track forward and then a tap
twice on the back to make it go back a
track they also offer NFC pairing for
phones that support NFC Jabra also makes
a corded version of this headphone
simply called the Revo that cost close
to $100 less you can use this as a
headset and as you might expect from a
company like Jabra that does make
headsets the sound quality is very good
a couple of things I wasn't so thrilled
about first of all the carrying case
that comes with this product is very
basic it's very thin it's really just
kind of a cover for the headphones at
this price right around $250 for these
headphones you'd expect something a
little bit more luxurious also the
Bluetooth sound quality is decent for
Bluetooth but it's not great it's not up
to level some of the top bluetooth
headphones up there but if you aren't a
total stickler for sound quality these
are a very good wireless bluetooth
headphone they're very nicely designed
very comfortable wear and they make for
a very nice day-to-day headphone I'm
David Carr noise and those are the Jabra
