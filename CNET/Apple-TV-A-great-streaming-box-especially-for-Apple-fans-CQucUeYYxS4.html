and we are taking another look at the
Apple TV the latest version of Apple's
100 dollar streaming box actually came
out back in March of 2012 but since then
it's had quite a few updates that have
added some functionality the physical
hardware is still the same it's a very
minimalist black box which is good since
it doesn't call attention to itself in
your TV cabinet around back you'll get
HDMI optical audio output and Ethernet
plus there's a micro USB port but that's
for service only inside there's also
dual band Wi-Fi so you don't need an
Ethernet cable in the living room to get
it online the included remote is as
simple as it gets
there's a navigation circle a place /
pause button and a menu button which
doubles as a back button it's an easy
remote to use although it doesn't quite
compare to the Roku threes clicker which
operates using Wi-Fi direct and has a
built-in headphone jack the user
interface was overhauled a while back
and now it has a more app centric design
that kind of makes your TV look like a
giant iPad you can rearrange the apps
however you'd like and the layout for
Apple's iTunes services is particularly
nice offering up lots of useful info
including Rotten Tomatoes ratings the
traditional knock against the Apple TV
is that it's short on apps but that's
not really fair anymore Apple has added
a lot of services to its box and most of
the major ones are covered like Netflix
HBO Go Hulu Plus YouTube MLB TV and
watch ESPN there are still some notable
exceptions particularly Amazon Instant
what I think most buyers will be
perfectly satisfied with Apple TV's
current Sleater services the Apple TV is
noticeably light when it comes to
streaming music apps as there's no
dedicated support for popular services
like Spotify RDO Amazon Cloud Player and
Pandora however you can access those
services using airplay which is really
the Apple TV's killer feature the basic
idea with airplay is it lets you stream
any music video or photo from your
iPhone or iPad straight to your TV
it works with nearly every third party
so you can load up Spotify on your
iPhone hit the airplay button and it
will stream straight to your Apple TV
the Apple TV can also be used with
airplay mirroring which works with newer
Macs and it lets you broadcast exactly
what's on your screen including flash
video and free Hulu content right to
your TV however in my testing while
airplay mirroring does tend to be a lot
more reliable than Google chromecast
mirroring you should note that it still
doesn't look nearly as good as HD video
straight from Netflix or HBO GO the big
question is how the Apple TV stacks up
to other streaming boxes and even with
the recent upgrades the Roku 3 is still
my favorite streaming box as it has more
channels excellent cross-platform search
and that neat remote with the headphone
jack
there's also Google's $35 chromecast to
consider which is irresistible price
where at the moment it only supports
Netflix and Hulu and it's screen
mirroring feature doesn't work all that
great with standard hardware so overall
the Apple TV is an undeniably polished
and excellent streaming box and if
you're heavily invested in the Apple
ecosystem with a lot of iTunes content
and iOS devices it's well worth the $100
price but if you're not heavy into Apple
gadgets the Roku 3 is still the better
buy although the two boxes are awfully
close to these days I'm Matthew Muscovy
ACK and this is the Apple TV</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
