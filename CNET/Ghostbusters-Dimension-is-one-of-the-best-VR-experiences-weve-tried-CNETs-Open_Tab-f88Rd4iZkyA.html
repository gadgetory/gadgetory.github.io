really awesome this week we won't call
who are you going to call who are you
going to call is what Janine says in the
first Ghostbusters film yeah we got to
do this amazing be our ghost busters
experience the other things God does
what VR yeah we it was a joke Joe like
we know he doesn't like I totally forgot
yeah okay um every one of the wrong then
you can retire interrupting me geez
anyway uh Madame Tussauds you know
Madame Tussauds is if you don't know it
is it's this wax museum place there's a
couple of them around the world there's
one in Times Square and ghostbusters the
new film out later this month teamed up
with this VR company called the void and
the void puts together this these very
elaborate interactive over-the-top VR
experiences and you and I got to sample
it out a few days before it goes public
i believe it starts today not today guys
um so this was amazing because to me
this was the best VR I'd ever done and I
was telling you that and you kind of
like I was like real yeah because I'm
never optimistic about anything no it's
true uh and and and Sarah or
photographer trying it out and she's
like really cynical about things like
the yarn she said that was pretty cool
she's like it's cool which is like the
highest praise you could give um I liked
it a lot now I'm like I'm really I found
myself getting a little bit like six
super no super critical okay here cuz I
you just use a line you have a refined
VR palette yeah and I because the the
bloom is worn off as far as like the
novelty of it but it is really cool as
far as how you feel like you're in
another space walk around its it I mean
anywhere regardless of that the VR they
had of me interviewing Ivan Reitman it
was amazing I felt like I was actually
sitting next to him he was so real so
realistic he even said hey Jeff good to
meet you I couldn't believe it anyway
rendering so check it out this is what
we did they put you in this amazing
apparatus dude the vest we had was force
feedback and it was it was locationally
aware so while you're walking through
this Oh
space this set that they build for the
VR experience you felt feedback like if
a ghost threw a book at your left
shoulder guess what your left shoulder
vibrated it's a crazy VR laser tag yeah
it was a wandering with this gear can't
say enough amazing stuff about this
thing I think when you like really break
it down it was super impressive so again
like imagine they build an entire sort
of fun house for you to walk through
yeah the the floor shakes they and they
emulated of elevator the floor shakes
you could feel the walls in the VR and
in real life like would you we don't
even know what it looked like right next
thing we had no idea like horrible it
probably just looked like a bunch of set
pieces because no one's actually going
to see that because they basically
overlay the VR over the physical world
that they've created inside so like
there's a part where you think you're on
a scaffolding there's a railing you put
your arm out to grab the rail and you
grab a rail like you actually feel it of
course they shake the crap out of it you
think like you're gonna fall off a
40-story building but then it lines up
really well they lined up real well you
open doors and you're even able to do
that and you feel that one-to-one
connection you go in with three people
total so you see the other people in
that experience which is something I've
never done in VR before now you talk to
each other and you you know you served a
little bit of communication about your
plan i I just I thought it was so damn
cool so I go back I would do it again I
mean it's only like seven minutes you're
not yeah it's probably along along the
Madisonian and the extra price like it's
not cheap but it's like again as a
one-time experience versus buying this
VR gear right in putting in your home
it's probably like the right level for
people and it is doing stuff you can't
do at home which is wander through this
huge maze of rooms and and with a
backpack computer yeah totally wired
Wireless like let's not forget out with
that what's the age rain like what's the
age range of Requirement age 14 inches
oh yeah I asked them about this yeah
that's smart so 48 inches I know age
range but it's because of the weight of
the backpack right so it's and and
probably for safety too just to make
sure you're not going to fall over or
anything but I think it's actually they
do kind of let you feel
you just do whatever you want
technically you could like fall over
yeah I guess like if you wanted to you
could climb over that scaffolding I bet
that and just fall into like where
someone is probably they're like dude
get back right get back into the thing I
don't if you removed your helmet I'm so
mad I didn't do that I should I figured
it would've been like eyes wide shut
there's like a circle of people watching
you yeah maybe all silent watch like
they're probably already there probably
a lot of assistance ready to help
because of safety concerns if you know I
would imagine it's just very bright
because all of those like little
ping-pong balls have to be a point in
regards oh yeah we're gonna we're Marcus
in the chatting okay is it immersive VR
and not augmented no it's completely
immersive you are putting on a headset
looking through lenses right you can't
see any of the real world but what they
do is they built a set in reality that
has the same spatial dimensions of what
you're seeing in VR so like there was
one part where like there was a graded
sort of gate I put my hand on it and it
felt like a gate felt like a fence they
really did a great job there's one scene
where slimer passes through you like the
ghost and they they like missed you
right Nick you got like a little lamb
yeah oh well sometimes a little bit of
40 40 meters look just 48 cinnamon
experiences and exactly they call it
hyper reality or mystery all marketing
and marketing it is VR and if if you
know about the HTC vive basically yet
it's it's kind of like what HD vibe does
with boundaries of a room yeah well you
say it's much more advanced in the sense
that they map I mean they're building
this to a specific set right so they
build out all the physical details that
they want so you can feel like you're
touching more plus they've like you said
all the other sensory stuff but then it
is full it's full VR bright its full VR
and that's the thing and that's not
looking outside right and that's what I
think like VR kind of works great right
now like yes you this like build these
things at theme parks wherever they are
build it make it this this because you
know the VR the experience relies just
as much on the physical space as it does
the VR like if there wasn't a vibrating
floor if there wasn't wind to make you
think you're on top of the building it
would fall flat
they're add this adds something that you
just aren't going to get it home right
like them they realize the more senses
you can throw at you to create that
illusion it's not about the graphics
even the graphics I feel like in a way
or step down yeah they weren't the best
right they weren't like if you've tried
HTC vive you might have actually seen
sign with a little bit better graphics
but it's really there still good but
it's not like yeah you feel like you're
more in a game but it's everything else
arts to create that sense of reality
where you go oh wow I'm going to take it
off and I can tabs like all the sins to
touch smell feel yeah i feel like the
smell was probably unintentional but
that worked it was a marshmallow smell
good it was it really wasn't joking when
I said it smell like toast a marshmallow
you did that on purpose yes UL night and
asked them but I so maybe you know but
you want to smell and yeah just is
you're hungry you sure you're very spin
on things yeah bride to feel when i was
fighting the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man
had to give it away but um you know that
don't weird were and like wasn't it
great how like you shot him in the head
and his hand got burnt like it wasn't
like all canned stuff we're like no no
he's just loading cuz its supposed to
like in the first senior in this little
room in an apartment and you just tear
the whole place to crack like you just
use your protein it's reverie and like
all the stuffs on the floor and I'm like
oh that was supposed to just do that and
then i shot the stuff on the floor and
it popped again I was like okay this is
a game this is like the Phoenix upload a
video game yeah it's a real like little
mini game yeah and oh man the elevator
just scared me there was it wasn't too
scared of that one moment the elevator
that's like girl passed girl goes she
comes in what's he sick I'm there
something like this like I was I
literally went to cover my eyes even
though there were no like you I just
like I would close my eyes like it's
gonna be bad there's no good thing that
happens with girl ghost getting on
elevator it's never good never is going
to scare you it reminded me of terror of
terror for sure had a little bit of a
tariff talabot when I went off on that
balcony might sound like yeah I felt
scared and I turned around and saw that
my other Ghostbusters buddies stayed
behind they were all way back in line
I'm not going in the room of the hotel
watching me to see what would happen is
if I would like die it's nice yeah they
did a great job so you know you got to
get props to the void they did a really
good job I may have sounded like a
little bit
critical when I wrote it because i felt
like i was expecting i heard so much
about the void and I thought is is
redefining what I think about VR not
entirely but it is really well done yeah
for sure all right let's move things
along a little bit vr question they want
to know from Scott which of you already
think is better I believe this is the
vibrance the ocular oh it's a good
question okay settle this right now I
think the vibe is the best hardware
going right now for a number of reasons
i think that the visual quality and the
headset looks a little bit better the
the controllers the room element and
there are more games right now that you
can get on steam i think oculus touch is
going to catch up to that quite a bit I
like oculus is a compact feeling though
in the design of just the package i
think is a little more consumer-friendly
i still feel like though for the average
person you're probably better off just
getting something super cheap like a
gear VR totally and waiting you know
PlayStation VR is pretty cool I want to
see more about that I feel like that's a
good price for the system that's
definitely the most accessible yes
especially if you have a ps4 that's kind
of the one I'd want to like your diver
so you have to worry about buying a new
system all right right exactly is I'm
not like a pc gamer and so like it mean
investing yet to invest in the PC and um
you know the stuff is going to get
better in like a year totally and and
the games are gonna keep you better so
this won't suck as much wearing that's
the thing is that yes i'm lee like how
many times you're going to buy a new
heads yeah we're not there yet but we're
on the road for pair of glasses and
earphones that's it right i like the
best vibe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
