fridge without carefully choosing where
they go you're doing it all wrong what
if I told you there's a way to have
fresher better tasting food and save
money at the same time it's all about
temperature you should set your fridge
to 40 degrees but since temperature
fluctuates you can set it a few degrees
lower to about 37 degrees still the
temperature won't stay the same
throughout the fridge and that's why
placement is so important so let's start
with the drawers you should dedicate one
drawer to fruits and vegetables that rot
quickly like apples and pears set that
to low humidity then use another drawer
for herbs that wilt quickly and set that
to high humidity moving on up the most
important thing to consider is that
crowding a bunch of food items can
create hot spots so be sure to leave
enough room for air circulation and
finally the doors since they're the
warmest use doors to store condiments
and other high salt or high preservative
foods in other words if you're putting
things like milk and eggs in the door
it's time to switch it up by following
these simple steps you're keeping your
food fresh and delicious and your fridge
it stays organized and now you're doing
it right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
