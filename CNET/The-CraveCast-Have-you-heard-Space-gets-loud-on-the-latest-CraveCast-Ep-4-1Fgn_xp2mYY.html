in Taos New Mexico which is in the Milky
Way galaxy somewhere in a solar system
around a big ball of fire and i'm joined
by kelsey adams Bonnie Burton Jeff
Sparkman Stephen Beecham at the scene at
studio in san francisco and michelle
starr all the way from Australia was
very appropriate surname and she's up
very early tonight or this morning I
don't even know what it it's fun 5am
there yeah yay well and looking perky
and bright-eyed I'm very impressed and
in case you have noticed today's crave
test is all about space this summer's
been great for space for watching here
from Earth we've had dazzling meteor
showers and super moons and Hollywood of
course has been raking in big bucks with
a movie about a tree a raccoon and a fat
boy who guard the galaxy and their tech
today lon must oh that's an Elan mother
love rosters in actual space exploration
but to kick things off there's a
deep-space mission that's were being run
out of Europe right now that's the most
fascinating to me at the moment that's
the Rosetta mission which launched I
think almost like 10 years ago and it's
basically a spacecraft that's got a
little probe on it and it has rendezvous
with a comet somewhere on the edges of
the solar system and it's preparing to
send its little probe which is called
feel a down to the surface so into drill
itself in to the comment you can see
some pictures of it there and it has the
comet has a crazy Russian name that I
can't pronounce or remember but the
lander will actually drill itself they
and then hitch a ride on that comet with
Rosetta kinda you know riding alongside
and they're going to go around the Sun
this is like a crazy awesome space
mission that we haven't heard that much
about I guess perhaps because it's out
of Europe and and not NASA this time
around and my American Geographic
edumacation tells me that Australia is
part of Europe i believe so so
what is that we don't wanna go you guys
I thought that video was Australian I'm
like it looks just like a satellite oh
I've actually heard that it is United
States education at work out her safe
have a desert place hey Michelle tell us
is there's a there's gotta be a space
station occupied by Australian
astronauts to right we don't actually
have a space program Oh crowdfund that
okay yeah um no I don't know why I've
never had one actually but um we've just
had a lot of budget cuts announced to
science funding over here anyway so not
likely anytime soon you know I'm the
Rosetta there yeah it looks like it oh
you mean in Australia I thought you met
those guys right there that's in Europe
all right well I'll throw it out to
anyone why haven't you guys been
tracking this what do you think ah I
have not been tracking I'm just now
learning about it but I I will track it
now cuz I love stuff like this and I
love that when we learned about other
countries that actually are doing stuff
because I mean I think when you live in
the United States you're just you think
NASA's it you don't realize there's all
these other countries with space
programs and and that there are doing
some pretty crazy and exciting stuff so
I'm excited to learn more about this so
what's the goal of attaching it to the
comet what's that gonna accomplish I
think the news i did a comment yeah yeah
i mean what to study the actual
composition of it and to see on how it
breaks down because you basically like a
big rock of a chunk of rock and ice that
was going to go around the the sun and
you know slowly melt away part of it and
so i think to actually see that process
up close and all these things you know
kind of help figure out you know how the
universe was formed how the solar system
our galaxy was formed that's kind of
always the one of the goals of this kind
of research and then I know and I
suppose it will inform future
apocalyptic apocalyptic movies where
yeah they don't do research that's silly
though when I bring up my story I will
bring up a plot that I think Michael Bay
if you're watching this is your movie so
I'll wait there you go stay tuned I
can't wait to learn I don't wait till
the real science stories done before i
talk about my science stuff cuz mines
never really that scientific so yay
we'll get we'll get through all this
this real sighs yeah yeah so Rosetta you
know it's currently the craft is
currently they're scanning and studying
the entire exterior of this comet trying
to figure out the best place to land the
lander which should be happening later
this fall and we'll definitely be
covering the on CNN and crave so keep an
eye out for that but I want to get to
the really fascinating stuff that we've
been covering on crave about space
recently and michelle has this awesome
piece that's up right now on crave and
you know if there's one truism that we
know about space it's that in that void
no one can hear you scream and that's
because it's an airless vacuum of course
with nothing for the vibrations the
cause sound to travel through so
therefore there's no sound in space but
that doesn't mean that there's no way
for us to actually hear space at least
that's what I've learned from Michelle's
fascinating piece it's about sound data
from space and and how we've been
gathering it and what we've gathered up
in recent decades I'm Michelle you want
to kind of take over and explain your
story for us okay so we have a bunch of
probes out there and they have
instruments like plasma wave detectors
that they use to just sort of measure
different sort of areas of space the
plasma the gases that you know the
particles that are out there and they
send back a waveform information which
they can then sort of convert into sound
so it's not actually a sound but it
sounds pretty cool anyway it's it's a
molecules reacting to different things
in the you know in out in space right
its molecules reacting and bouncing off
each other that we're hearing right yeah
well we have some pretty much dumb
there's also solar winds and solar
flares and there's this really cool one
called the dawn chorus which is like
particles hitting the magnetosphere
above it so it sounds like birds
chirping I have a hammer actually yeah
it sounds like frogs yeah frogs and a
face and knew it that's actually
soothing it is really put it look it's
like whales I think yeah kind of like
really high-pitched wails better hi
strong moon I can't wait till a fixed
win remixes at give the Saturn one there
that one's a lot less oh yeah the second
one is amazing Saturn I have Voyager let
me see what I have here I have Voyager
and wait what is this no this is the
plasma which one is a Saturn one yeah
wow that's great and you don't have to
pay ASCAP fees Yeah right and that's
great that that's real that's not like
you know some crazy Moog or something
yeah that's totally like 60 synthesizers
yeah well there was like a whole genre
of music that does space T sound music
based on this stuff I know in the 90s
and during college radio there were
quite a few oh yeah because I played it
all but I remember this and then if you
if you go online you can listen to a lot
of space themed type stuff like think
drone zone has that on some FM and stuff
like that so there's a lot of people
that like want to take all these sounds
and then put them on online radio and
then remix him I really was joking about
a fixed win but he doesn't LM
squarepusher did a whole album it's not
just like this you never no never no
that's where musicians get their
inspiration this from space I wanted to
clarify for someone who left a comment
on this article that yes we understand
that there isn't actually sound in space
but Michelle explains I quite clearly
this is sort of a translation of that
information so that we can experience it
as sound it's kind of like plotting
something as a graph but much prettier
yeah did yeah it's in the same way in
the same way we don't hear radio waves
you know flying through the air at all
times but then when you you know
digitally or analog we take them in and
translate it into sound right so yeah
that's exactly what it's like yeah mr. I
love the movie Forbidden Planet you want
to talk about that you mentioned that in
your article oh yes i was listening to
these noises and thinking like it really
reminded me of that film because you
know I've loved that film who use and
using years so um I did a bit of reading
about it and you know obviously they had
never heard any recordings from space
what they used to do was um it was a
Louie and BB Baron and they would make
the music together he would make the the
circuits and she would do the actual
composition so she'd go through the tape
that they would make from Louise
instruments and then she cut them up and
put the sounds together and yeah the
idea was just to find the sounds that
sounded like nothing else on earth and
apparently that ends up sounding rather
much like space
so cool I love that hey yes we're here
block yeah that's what I would imagine a
plan that's like a dishwasher dishwasher
in space where's the ocean are the ocean
yeah now somebody's gonna appear
standing in the middle of that ah better
be a robot wave ain't gonna be Chris
Cornell with his guitar help his guitar
I listened to several bands in the 90s
that sounded exactly like that i'm
pretty sure happy to I'm having a
nostalgia moment that's like I need to
pick up all my vinyl from this from the
90s of space down so well that's one I
think it was I remember when mondo 2000
the magazine had just come out and they
did a whole profile on space music me
composers and it was that's when I first
learned about it so yeah elder the
internet speaking now 90s fun Bonnie
tell us what Abraham Lincoln was really
like oh he was such a hipster that beard
was totally fake by the way anyway we're
getting off tangent this is why we need
to okay Stan throwback serious news cuz
i've got some non AC seriously news
later what well so definitely check out
Michelle's piece it's up on the one
crave right now uh what is it called the
spooky sounds of space yeah the
headliner spooky sounds of space look
forward on cnet com / crave there's more
videos to listen to and watch there it's
super awesome and also I would suggest
to people want to comment in that
article of their favorite maybe favorite
composers that you space music that
might be kind of a cool discussion to
start on that article because I know
there's a lot of musicians out there
that like these space music so I don't
know just putting it out there
Squarepusher my favorite yay alright so
moving on to space games why not um so I
Chelsea a little bit about this game
extrasolar that you've been looking into
and that you're working on a post about
for crave as well yeah I'm obsessed with
extra solar and the only reason they
haven't posted about it yet is that I
really
do it justice but first i want to give a
quick shout out to superhero a workout
if that's okay beatcha oh yeah hit it Oh
superhero workout trying to make us
exercise heart is in suit and ready for
calibration yeah once the a pilot time
to power up get that generator singing
ok to return the volume down so this
supposedly comes out today for iOS and
later and fall for android these are the
people who make zombies run oh ok I'm
getting some weird feedback my voice I
don't know if you I think it's some
skype thing ok good um so these people
are really good at making games that
hook in your imagination and that
feeling of smugness I mean pride you get
when you work out convincing you that
you're you're really helping people
you're not just getting fit you're a
hero and so Zombies Run is really good
for that and it looks like superhero a
workout is gonna be like that too but
I'm on Android so I'm gonna have to wait
four months to find out myself but if
you're on iOS go find out so wait does
it come with radioactive powers cuz
that's really how those superheroes good
shape the superhero they're thinking of
is Iron Man it's not oh so you to die
first mmmn about that so your heart has
to explode cuz that happens to me at the
gym I would personally love the Wonder
Woman work out with that you know that
bullets and bracelets and they're
running but but this is a more of an
Ironman type on ok this is obviously a
perfect way to Train astronauts amid
budget cuts or is it Australia
non-existent space program yeah Michelle
this is how you start all your astronaut
training is through this and by the way
I never liked the zombies or anything
because if you watch Walking Dead you
know the how most of the time they
survive is they just push fatter more
out of shape people in the way of the
zombies so they can get away well I have
found the people who are big zombie
fishing autos I don't love the game the
way I do for me as a non-zombie person
it's the best thing ever in a big fan
cuz I me to survive anything is just
hang out with people in worse shape than
you yeah you don't have my faster yeah I
don't know how it was fine job I don't
know anybody in worse shape than me ha
what clearly Walking Dead zombies did
not have superhero work out but the
zombies in World War Z did yeah
they can run up walls touche oh I could
do that Tuesday obviously you've done
the work out no no I'm on Android I
don't have any choice supposed to come
out today um can we tell my extrasolar
now because o it and weird i running out
of time okay um me too all right do a
lot XO planetary Research Institute
today's leader in propulsion technology
communication I like it's kind of like
Disneyland like Star Tours so this is
just giving you some background for the
concept of the game it's the idea is
your you get to pilot like a Mars rover
but it's not on Mars it's on some
recently discovered faraway planet and a
private organization is sending Rovers
there and citizen scientists like you
get to pilot a rover around it and take
photos um could you yeah I was checking
out the photos and really cool yeah i
linked you to some could you put this
out now I forget the trailer in or the
trailer let's move on no time I'm really
we're not gonna die it's okay if you
slow down kinda freaking me out a little
bit i just i love this game more than a
game is there a plot twist like you know
it turns out the private organization is
secretly trying to you know blow off the
planet or exploit its resources or
something well that would be cool as
soon as you start in the program you get
contacted by a hacker who tells you that
they think that there's some kind of
conspiracy with aliens and spoiler I'm
just gonna tell you there's some kind of
conspiracy with aliens the whole game
takes place in a browser window um so
you're not actually getting phone calls
to your home phone you don't have to
pick that stuff out of your own email it
is contained which some people object to
but i think is nice and so you watch
this story unfolding by listening to
voice messages by quote-unquote
decrypting documents um things like that
but the the main the main thing you do
in the game is you schedule moves to
your over by just dragging some
crosshairs it's very simple and then
every time you're over stops on this
planet it takes another photo the map
that you use is actually satellite
footage of the planet so you can see
real it's really cool anyway um and and
then you tag things that look
interesting which is something you do in
real stuff like NASA
that's the projects like solar zoo you
tag something that looks interesting the
data goes back to the lab there's this
is all happening in real time so there's
a break in between when you take photos
and after you send info to the lab
there's a break while they analyze it
and then they tell you what you found
and so you're kind of helping scientists
figure out how life works on this planet
that's your goal you didn't know there
was a conspiracy the conspiracy is kind
of a side note to me but um it all comes
together and it's what I love about it
that I really want to get across is you
actually it asks very little of you you
actually do very little um but you know
you can only do a few moves a day and
they're very simple but somehow that
creates this huge sense of investment I
mean I remember this one night when I
couldn't sleep I was lying in bed in the
dark knowing that my Rover at that
moment was also in the dark climbing
climbing a slope you know on the alien
planet to take photos bioluminescent
plants and that Rover is so far away and
it's never coming home but those
pictures are going to the next day when
I sign in the picture is going to be
there for me you know and it's it really
gives you this illusion that is really
wonderful so extrasolar is what it's
called it's by lazy eight studios and
they're kind of struggling right now I
think to to get attention and and get
more more users so they can come out
with seasons two and three season oh I
should explain it's free it's a
completely free game that you can play
in your browser but you can pay to speed
a few things up and if you're impatient
by nature you're gonna do that um I've
got some family and hooked on it now at
this point too so we're all just like
how you're starting a space cult on this
yeah this is great you're like our way
to your l ron hubbard and they have a
great thing about it is it's basically
the glamour of science without the work
you know i love that i love it if you're
like me and you miss you miss studying
science in school but you just you
didn't devote your life to that you know
now you're out you're not doing science
anymore but you kind of miss it you
think it's really cool you like to read
about science in a shallow cut away
right so playing this game is like you
get to participate in the most amazing
scientific discovery of our time it love
it while doing hardly anything actually
that's awesome you know yeah so I wrote
up a little blurb here I'm just gonna
read it to you I won't pretend
makita I'd recommend it to anyone who
likes space maps remote control toys
pretty pictures conspiracy theory is a
pistol ettore narrative speculative
biology and anything that lets you feel
smart hostile allowing you to be
extremely lazy with a short attention
span just like small that you don't
describe the 1990s right there
extrasolar look it up that's cool yeah
extrasolar duck and it's all in the
browser is there aren't any other
platforms um no it's cool you can look
at it on your phone they've actually
done some special rendering to make sure
the photos look really great on your
phone but it's hard to UM actually
tagged things so you can't rover when
you're in line at DMV you can look at
you can like check it out and look at it
particularly few have a tablet you're
definitely a business but um it's yeah
it's mostly meant to be played on
desktop and oh and you can download all
the photos as high res wallpapers it's
oh yeah those are awesome oh my god you
seen a couple of guys are such an
evangelist I love this I'm a fan excited
Kelsey you is great I'm gonna talk about
stuff I don't like so um unlike me so
yeah browser-based um you can ask to be
notified whenever something new happens
in the game you can have that sent to
your real life email or you can tell it
not to do that so it's completely up to
you whether you want it to impinge on
your life like that cool Yeah right okay
cool I've been trying to figure out what
this reminds me of it seems like there's
several games from the past but yes I
can't miss yeah there's a dock that came
up yeah yeah but so I don't know Vidya
it's particularly the pho crowdsourcing
thing that yeah I don't know I like this
it's like I feel like if we ever reboot
last starfighter this is what the plot
is gonna be mmm just saying I'm always
thinking movie plots sorry people yeah
all right can we talk about my
superfluous space news please please
this weekend three right outside news oh
so I should you want to you hello kitty
your first year NASA dad yeah okay so
hello kitty uh this is one of those
stories that came across my hey I love
hello kitty I love space and it's a
story about how they want to celebrate
hello kitty's anniversary in Japan and I
think it's the 40th as well as getting
kids excited about satellites I have a
weird feedback so if you hear me like
with feedback that's
just extra space II just pretended to be
in space yeah anyway so you can send a
message i think now till I think
September I'm not sure it says in the
article that I wrote that you can send
us all these messages for Hello Kitty to
who's trapped in space by the way this
is the saddest video i've ever seen and
i don't know i think those are messages
sending to her to transmit in space and
all I keep thinking is an alien race is
going to see this they're gonna think
earth is nothing but cute cartoon cats
and they're going to invade and kill us
all that's what I think when I see this
video this musical we play this music is
sad it looks like she's trapped in like
she's the last thing on earth and she
can't get home like this is like a sad
little movie that should be made an
indie movie about hello kitty dying in
space alone with her teddy bear good
kitty yeah but you can i oh so long cat
yeah goodbye kitty i love it Oh Jeff we
don't room that's my job it also reminds
me miss right but you can send messages
and they'll pick up one message a day to
transmit through the satellite in Japan
and it can be an English or can be in
Japanese but I just keep thinking up
this is how we all die as aliens find
this message and think we're defenseless
cats and they just come get us and then
the other story I wrote was the dad who
built the NASA simulator for his two
sons he had already built a mission
control desk which I reported earlier in
the year but this is to tie in to the
mission control desk because he has two
sons so of course they each need
something so one of the sons can play in
the simulator as an astronaut and has
all the buttons and bells and whistles
and video and all this great stuff and
it explains in the video how he built
everything it's um it's one of those
things to where it's gonna make you hate
your dad because your dad didn't build
this for you so my job is a great cook
okay yeah so if you get a dad that
didn't build this don't blame him just
if you have kids now it's up to you to
make this fo x no pressure so no picture
but now it's up to you like to make this
and Jeff Highsmith is ruining dad's for
everybody else because he's the best dad
in the world cuz he'd built this amazing
simulator yeah he's making did he do a
how to on this because yeah there's a
how-to yep there's a link by link to in
the article it's from Make Magazine
that's a full how to and there's a video
that kind of
speeds through it and he shows you all
the little things that he did by me he's
got like video from NASA of the Apollo
space mission so his kids can reenact
Apollo space mission with all the
problems that they had and there's like
even in fact he used to have more kids
yeah I feel like we should ship this dad
to Australia to start the NASA of
Australia because I think we could just
hand to build all of it cuz he's already
made this all these simulators I feel
like he's he's gonna be the guy that
saves us when the aliens attack has the
Hello Kitty messages does he have a job
because this looks like a tickle yeah I
feel I feel like he's one of those dads
that never sleeps stay home yeah like
he's making all bad look bad anyway if
you want to check it out or if you want
to make it yourself or if you live by
yourself like me and you just kind of
want to have this in your living room to
hang out in then I hollyrock it's so
cool yeah he's got all the sound file
that look all the bells and whistles oh
my god don't rock it sound like I'm
waiting for his next video for make to
be that he actually built a spaceship
that's going to space with him and his
kids now Bonnie this has a motorcycle
helmet audio system robot arm and yeah I
go pieces there's the robot arms so they
can actually do payload deliveries all
that stuff look at that look at video
the great irony of this is that it took
him so much time to build it that he had
to sacrifice three months worth of time
no I think he's the kind of dad that has
his kids help him build things like they
probably all know how to make all this
look his kids like you're freaking out
you can hear the squealing of joy cuz
waste dump physically will it sound
happy to see their dad again well no
wait don't elation Ryan please dump is a
toilet sound so every time they flick it
they call it mr. thirsty because that's
what the astronauts all the toilets mr.
thirsty I know it's great that's also
what they called it in space the videos
and the controller for the arm yeah look
at that I know we should probably stop
playing this video so we all stop
feeling insecure about our crafts look
at that hey I drew pictures with my
daughter yeah something right something
i really recommend the welcoming yeah oh
yeah yeah come on Jeff oh uh so there's
this welcome mat it
this is a real long discussion here I
saw a welcome mat online that I wanted
to get and it happened to be space
related so I figured I'd mention it
there's a link in the doctor is I
actually want this thing yeah only 15
bucks I know right what's I'm think
again ones messed up ya thinkin uh I
just I hadn't told my mom just get me
gift cards cuz that's pretty much all i
love it see that's so much more cheerful
than the psycho shower curtain right
yeah i just feel like that's that's the
learned something from that as opposed
to baby training everyone to be serial
killers maybe space is more and then I
can feel inadequate when I realize that
my feet are smaller Oh Polly is wearing
a big moon yeah well who wears moon
boots in the shower anymore oh this is a
welcome mat not a shower man oh I mean I
dinner technically it could be a shower
man the second no I'm sorry I thought it
was like that kind of a towel that you
put right underneath by your bath when
you come out of shower think you get on
that I own all space stuff yeah well
have you seen their shower set that's a
Star Trek transporter oh yeah guys only
it's got the curtain and the Roger look
at me shower Star Trek yeah joe within
the home something google it google
shower and Star Trek see what images we
get careless Lee I wouldn't mind that
board games all thinking stuff yeah I'm
not seeing a shower so yeah I think not
has to send us everything cuz we
mentioned I think we I think we have
somebody to hit up as a possible
sponsoring oh yeah I know did you see it
even as we also call you yeah that's
rare day yeah yeah oh my gods brilliant
not awesome that's great curtain and if
you're late for work he can just say
it's Scotty's fault yep that's brilliant
I love that yeh think eek so yeah I'm
glad we did specie stuff that was
factual and also shower related I really
feel like I'm some astronaut ice cream
ready but I know well you actually have
some right did you bring it no may have
I do want to ask astronauts if they
actually eat that stuff in space or if
we've been lied to this whole time just
because someone made that by accident
and they just called it astronaut ice
cream
cuz I usually eat it they totally do
because the other astronaut stuff is
terrible yeah that's road ice cream I
don't know next time I mean a nap next
time I see Buzz Aldrin I'm gonna ask him
about that cuz I'm not gonna ask him
about the moon landing cuz he always
gets asked about that I'm gonna ask
about hey does that ice cream thing for
real hey with a favorite tank flavor
trainrider Amanda Kooser comments that
she has that doormat oh okay so great
great minds thinking alike there yeah
excellent did we rave did we adore do we
cover all the way do we cover all the
space news we were supposed to do today
I think we have we did we did we working
on any other spacey stuff on our way out
the door here i am actually gonna see if
I can do an interview with someone from
NASA about questions they never get
asked like yeah and I I think that
that's something that we need to cover
and I only have a couple contacts at
NASA so I just want to bug them so I'm
gonna see if they'll do crave interview
of bizarre questions that aren't
necessarily factually stimulating for
anyone studying space but just curiosity
type stuff no commentary yeah oh and
remember for those of you use I have tea
tea tea if I love stick this then that
it's an automation um sort of service
for free that you can use um they just
recently got a space channel that
combines info from NASA and some other
sources that I haven't heard of and
it'll tell you things like you know you
can can have it pushing notification
when the season changes on Mars or every
time the ISS post an update it's um it's
eating up a lot of data on my phone
right now because it's so fascinating oh
you might want to check that out oh and
I did want to mention i think steady was
down for a while cuz all the wildfires
so again hello kitty messages may be the
way we contacted well said he's slacking
off go ahead and go over the hello kitty
page but i would appreciate if people
comment on the article of what messages
they would like to send keep it clean
but yeah i would like to not make it
being about me but you know troll
messages hello kitty doesn't like trolls
more yeah i'd like to see mission again
before we go cuz she's just really
exciting and it's 5am there so everyone
should I'm so touched we tend to join us
yeah
and you forgot to show your cat when we
were talking about hello kitty I feel
like that was the perfect moment to show
your cat but your cat probably knew that
he left yeah cats she got that's for you
really quickly before we go I want to
give a quick shout out for folks to look
for my tote wet sprocket interview also
it's pretty probably the only toad the
wet sprocket content on cnet if you
search for that and the actual interview
the lead singer he talks quite a bit
about space stuff he actually did a solo
album called secrets of the new
explorers it's a privatized space
exploration themed concept album and i
highly recommend that you check it out
and if you join the space elevator
consortium you will get a free copy of
it and they're having their conference
next week in Seattle so that's all the
space elevator news you needed to know
but that happens really crazy their
songs about like space elevators and
solar flares and privatized space travel
so anyway just be nice this really is a
90s podcast Eric also did a post about
what it was like interviewing this guy
from which I learned that Eric actually
loves the lead singer of Toad the Wet
Sprocket almost as much as I love
extrasolar oh I love totally know what I
saw them live in the 90s and I loved him
it was never a fan that I saw him live
and I was like I'm a fan yeah I think I
saw them with bare naked ladies or
something I love that band yeah to which
broca's great good for them i'm glad
that they're doing Spacey stuff to their
back yes um so yeah that's the crave
cast for today thanks everyone for
joining us we'll do it again next month
thanks to michelle starr again for
