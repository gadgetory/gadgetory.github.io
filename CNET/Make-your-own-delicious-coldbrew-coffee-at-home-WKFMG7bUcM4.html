of ice-cold brew is a delicious way to
enjoy coffee if you go to your cafe or
your local grocery store though you will
definitely pay through the nose that's
why it makes sense to brew your cold
brew at home here are some tips and
tricks to make sure you do it right
first off you want to start by grinding
your own beans and you want to make sure
you grind them coarsely you also want to
make sure you brew it nice and strong
you're looking for a ratio of about 4 to
1 water to coffee grounds you can brew
in a variety of containers you can use a
French press a dedicated appliance a
plastic bucket or a pitcher it really
depends on where you'd like to brew and
what temperature of water you'd like to
use you're gonna have to budget some
time for this it takes anywhere from 12
to 24 hours for cold brew to process
properly one of the hardest parts of
making cold brew at home is straining
your grounds from the brewing liquid you
have to use a filter of some kind like a
coffee filter or a mesh strainer and
it's a pain you can make a mess that's
one of the major benefits of using a
dedicated cold brew appliance it'll
strain everything for you and you don't
have to worry about anything it's a lot
less hassle
keep in mind that your cold brew is
gonna be very concentrated so you're
gonna want to cut it with some water
some iced milk maybe even a little
simple syrup to lighten things up a bit
now you know how to make homebrew at
home for a fraction of the price it cost
at the store</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
