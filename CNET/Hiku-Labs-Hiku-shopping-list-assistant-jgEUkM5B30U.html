we're gonna take a look at the haiku
lab's haiku so this little guy is
actually a grocery list making assistant
designed to use with your iPhone
currently all the company says it will
be expanding to Android soon the idea is
that it can make list items on your
iPhone app by speaking to the device or
if you use the barcode reader now you
might ask why you want a standalone
device to build a grocery list and the
reason haiku lab says is because this
device makes it much easier you don't
have to pull out your smartphone to
swipe find the app open the app etc with
this you simply push the button and
either speak into it or swipe a product
it builds a list you didn't take that
list to the store so for example I can
speak in the device and say chocolate
and what kind a list and chocolate will
appear pretty simple I can also use the
barcode reader in the same way so if we
push the button you get the light and
you swipe down the code it pops up on
the list automatically now in testing I
found that both the voice recognition
and the barcode scanning worked pretty
well but there's actually a few features
in here that make this a little bit more
interesting if I swipe a barcode the
Haiku doesn't recognize I'll get a tiny
little beep that'll let me know it
hasn't shown up then the next time I can
push the button say the product and it
will associate my spoken instruction
with that barcode it then loads that
information up into the cloud and the
Haiku can then reference that so
theoretically then for a company like
Trader Joe's it doesn't make its UPC
codes available you could crowdsource
that information and actually it works
pretty well now how cool Labs says that
anybody can use this from an adult to a
five-year-old but you probably wouldn't
want a little kid getting his or her
hands on this because the company says
it's gonna be assigning a shopping
service to the app soon which means that
you'd be able to make a list purchase
from the app directly it hasn't rolled
that out yet it's still working on it
but heads up because of that forthcoming
shopping service as well as some
software and firmware updates down the
road the company is still calling as
beta hardware that's a little bit
strange considering that they want you
to pay for it so it's gonna cost $79 for
you to essentially get pre-release
hardware we're used to seeing that kind
of model from crowdfunded hardware but
not from hardware that's directly
available for sale from the vendor
overall this definitely seems a little
bit gimmicky and I can't see it being
that much more convenient
pen and paper for basic list making but
in terms of the in-app shopping service
there's definitely some potential here
and I'm really interested to see how
that develops I'm rich Brown this is
