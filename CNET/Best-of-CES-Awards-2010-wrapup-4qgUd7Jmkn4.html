Charlie cuz you're here hi i'm molly
wood from cnet com here at CES 2010
where every year we give out the
official best of CES awards and in fact
this year I think there was some
controversy about who ended up winning
so let's have a look at some of the top
products the big winners and of course
our big party here at the stage let's
get right to it now began the 2010 best
of CES award and the winner in the
category of mp3 and video players for
the best of CES 2010 is bailiffs pivots
mobile DTV is rolling out across the
country right now and with this little
bitty device you can pick up mobile DTV
and then send it via Wi-Fi to your
iPhone your blackberry or your laptop
that's it in a nutshell this is super
exciting and I was so humble to win such
a prestigious award we think that this
category is really exploding the whole
netbook category and we think you know
netbook is great but it's not for
everybody and there are some users that
want to sort of have the benefits of a
fully functional notebook but also have
different operating modes when I want to
switch into just their online experience
and their and their personal media
experience and then they can go into
sleep mode so we thought hey why not put
these two products together and get two
brains in one now the winner in the cell
phone a smart phone category for the
best of CES award is ha Motorola's
backflip
have fun we're really excited about it
this is a great product and we're
excited to have won the war 2 10 rage
technologies their pika wat Wi-Fi smart
plug we just sort of wanted to create a
way for people to control their
appliances and have some way to be
interactive with the smart grid while
we're waiting for advanced meter
infrastructure and electric cars to come
out there needs to be something for
tickets consumers excited to whet their
appetite about green technology and what
better way than allowing them to control
what's in their house what's in their
grasp already we're a really small shop
five people just started the company in
January develop the prototype this
summer and we're launching in April so
it's been a whirlwind huge for us huge
huge very big where we were not
expecting to win at all CES 2010 the
winner in the category of best of show
is Panasonic they've got the meaty 25
series
can't ask for anything better it's an
amazing show amazing technology full HD
3d yesterday was the first time I
actually got a chance to view it and it
blew me away so panasonic is the leader
technology of 3d HDTV it was a close
vote so we got down and we did the vote
and we came up 928 in favor of the
panasonic TV and I will say that I did
not vote for the panasonic I was on the
8th side so like any good editor would
because my product did not win I called
him for a revote so we did a revote and
ended up coming up 10 28 for panasonic
so it came out clean but yeah there was
a missing boat there for a while a
little bit of drama and there you have
it everyone the absolute best products
of CES 2010 not too surprising there was
a 3d TV in there you can find all those
products and all of our coverage at the
show at CES cnet com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
