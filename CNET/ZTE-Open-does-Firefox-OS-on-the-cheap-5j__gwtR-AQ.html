the new ZTE open which is one of the
first phones running Firefox's operating
system I'm Jessica doll court and I'm
going to show you a quick look let's
talk about the design first which i
think is the nicest part of the phone
it's really comfortable this one is an
orange we've also seen it in Blue has a
sort of luminescent shimmery finish it's
soft to the touch and doesn't pick up
fingerprint marks so that's always nice
it's a compact phone it's still pretty
thick a little bit thicker than most
still it slides into pockets really
easily feels good on the ear and it's
very easy to use one-handed I also like
some of the smaller accents like the
volume rocker and the power button ZTE
deliberately scaled down the specs we've
got a 3.5 inch screen here pretty low
resolution I think it's a little bit dim
on automatic mode and the colors look a
little bit off as well even with full
brightness on the back there's a 3.2
megapixel camera no flash no
front-facing camera on here all of
that's fine but I wasn't very impressed
with photo quality at all images were
really dull and I found it incredibly
hard to focus the one gigahertz
processor is also very laggy this is a
3g phone you won't get 4G speeds with it
but since it is unlocked you will be
able to use AT&amp;amp;T and t mobile's networks
I use the AT&amp;amp;T sim card here keep in
mind that this is a standard size sim so
it's a lot larger than the micro and
nano SIM that you've seen a lot of
phones today the operating system is
also purposely simple it runs on the web
based Firefox OS the intended audience
is therefore mostly developers who will
develop for Firefox OS apps and things
like that it is also suitable for people
who are transitioning to their first
smartphone the ZTE open cells globally
here in the US you'll be able to buy it
for eighty dollars on eBay as far as the
phone goes the price is right the
operating system covers all the basics
but I do think there are more exciting
phones out there in this price range for
general consumers this phone is really
meant for developers and those are the
people who should really look into it
