of the s4 I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update we have more details on
when the samsung galaxy s4 smartphone is
hitting stores right after ATT began
taking pre-orders for an April thirtieth
delivery date t-mobile announced it's
going to be first selling it on april
twenty fourth and Sprint is following
three days later we still have yet to
hear from verizon but apparently it'll
be on sale sometime this month Sprint is
doing something pretty odd though it's
charging more for the s4 than other
carriers two hundred and fifty dollars
with a two-year contract but if you're
new to sprint and you switch over it
charges only one hundred fifty dollars
for it I'm sure that feels unfair if
you're a loyal sprint customer ATT and
US cellular are selling it for the
typical starting price of two hundred
dollars with the usual two-year contract
and US cellular is even throwing in a
free s view flip cover with advanced
orders but it won't even say when
customers are going to get their hands
on the s4 this is expected to be a very
popular phone and the biggest challenger
to the iPhone the iPhone puts on this
global launch where every carrier sells
it the same day but carriers just don't
do that with other big phones they put
it on sale whenever they feel ready the
other big phone of the year is the HTC
One and that's who has a scattered
launch team of was selling the HTC One
on the same day it's selling the galaxy
s4 but AT&amp;amp;T will sell it friday but when
it comes to the next big phones don't
expect Microsoft to build its own phone
anytime soon Apple does it with the
iphone google does it with the nexus
phone but a Microsoft executive has said
there's no need for Microsoft to build
its own smartphone like it has with the
surface tablet since the teaser website
went live last week we still haven't
heard when this Twitter music service is
going to launch all that we know is that
Twitter gave early access to some
well-known artists like Jason Derulo
Moby neyo and Blake Shelton and they've
been tweeting good things about it we'll
keep you posted leap motion has made a
deal with hewlett-packard to bundle its
motion control sensors in some future HP
computers leap measures hand and thing
your movements to let users control a
computer with hand gestures similar to
how the Xbox Kinect works but it's way
more exact with measuring movements the
leap will also be hitting stores next
month for eighty dollars an upcoming
version of Photoshop may be able to take
the blur out of your photos Adobe posted
a video that demonstrates a nudey
blurring filter we're just supposed to
help fix those wobbly hand camera
moments but we'll have to wait and see
how well it works Adobe will likely give
more details when this will be available
during its conference in may that's your
tech news update you can find more
details at cnet com / update from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
