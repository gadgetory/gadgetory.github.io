lay there like a dumbass and let Fiat
get all the headlines with the 500 you
answer it with this the Volkswagen up
this is a car it's in roughly the same
class size wise it's below a golf by a
significant margin in terms of overall
footprint as well as in price we'll get
to that in a minute now right now it's
only slotted for European introduction
but you can just about bank on it come
into the u.s. sooner than later now
under the hood here you've got a pretty
scrawny 3 cylinder 1 liter engine not
sure that would come to the US one and
if this car ever does they might up rate
that for the American market get it
closer to 100 horsepower right now it's
a 64 a 75 horsepower mill give or take
with really good efficiency really clean
low emissions this car will come stock
with a city collision technology one
that will look forward with ultrasonic
or radar whatever they use to keep the
car from rear-ending someone at low
speeds that's usually the kind of
technology that was only reserved for
much more expensive cars wherever they
came from but now we're seeing a lot of
the small cars offer that as a
differentiator okay so here I am 62 plus
in this little guy and as is always the
paradox with little cars there's some of
the roomiest inside because they have
very thin door panels not a lot of
filigree and built up consoles and make
a car seem tight this car is entirely
spacious for everyday driving it's not
something going to take on a 3,000 mile
trip and lay back in very simple
instrument panel you've got what do we
got here a little tiny tack on the left
that's interesting fuel gauge on the
right big speedometer finally that makes
some sense too many cars are giving too
much real estate to tachometers I love
gauges as much as anybody but you know
what the tach it's time for it to go it
doesn't make a lot of sense anymore
often you'll find color-keyed dash
panels here that go with the car body
that's very fiat 500 not saying they
copied them but that's kind of the style
right now here's the most interesting
thing navigon makes a snap-off portable
infotainment units I'm pretty sure it
won't snap off here oh look at will what
trusting people are Volkswagen friends
are and here are your choices
information about the car again because
connected to the cars data bus when you
dock it you can't do that with a
standalone pnd here's your media player
pictures CD player control because this
again connects to your optical disc and
car radio control against something your
stand alone won't do your bluetooth
phone controls and technology are in
here and of course your navigation and
map all that in a nice slim unit that is
actually a portable electronic sort of a
Bene you get when you buy this car we're
starting to see a lot of car makers go
this way now the pre-orders begin
shortly in europe for this car in
Germany in particular and by top of 2012
these are going to be out but again in
the European market where their pricing
it at below 10000 euros I've been in
this business too long to say oh just
convert that to dollars it never works
that way currency conversion aside but
it's a cheap little car it's bringing up
the bottom of the VW line and it's going
to answer one big question why don't
they bring the Polo to the US which
slots down below the Gulf they're going
to do this one instead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
