buy the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 now before
you say I as this is totally one-sided
what about reasons to buy the note 9
don't worry we'll also put up another
top 5 with the reasons to get the note 9
these lists are based on what Samsung
unveiled during its unpacked event so
this could change after we do a full
review let's get to it at number 5 it's
really similar to the note 8 there are a
few cosmetic differences between the
note 8 and 9 the note 9 moved a
fingerprint sensor to a more central
location the screen is a tiny bit bigger
on the note 9 six point four inches
compared to six point three inches both
have the same style of screen both have
the same ip68 dust and water resistance
both have expandable storage if you have
a note 8 it's a really hard sell to move
to a note 9 if you don't have either the
note 8 will likely be available at a
discounted price so you could get one of
those coming in at number four big speed
you have to love Nick's feet or that's
what Samsung wants the dedicated bixby
button is on the note 9 and it cannot be
reassigned to another voice assistant
the button can be turned off though
Samsung would rather you have a button
that does nothing instead of letting you
reassign it that's kind of irritating
however you can still download google
assistant and launch it like any other
app number three it's expensive
look at that pricing I mean
theoretically it's kind of awesome that
you can have a phone with 512 gigabytes
of on-board storage and eight gigabytes
of RAM but will you ever need all of
that the note is the top of the line
phone by Samsung and boy is it priced
like it
yikes we are now at number two and that
is slow Android updates if you want the
latest and greatest version of Android
you'll likely be waiting historically
Samsung phones have been slow to get
updates it's not entirely the company's
fault wireless carrier approval plays a
part that's being said Samsung has added
features to its Android phones that
Google eventually integrated like
picture and picture video and the number
one reason to pass on the note 9 is the
Galaxy S 10 is coming
the 10th version of the s-series is
reportedly coming as early as January
2019
it's rumored to have an in screen
ultrasonic fingerprint sensor and since
it's the 10th version expect Samsung to
try a design change then there are
reports of Samsung working to release a
foldable phone with a 7.3 inch screen
this flexi phone could also launch in
2019 the note 9 while a beast may not
have been Samsung's top priority for
cutting-edge features did these reasons
sour you on the note 9 are you still
gunning to get one let us know am i as
actor no see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
