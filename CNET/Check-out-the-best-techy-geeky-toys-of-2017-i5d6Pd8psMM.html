the kids sure but many of us never
really grow out of them look out for
these cool gadgets and geeky must-haves
for 2017 model car maker Welli has
created a triple treat for Back to the
Future fans
containing all three intricately
detailed movie versions of the DeLorean
time machine
this set is simply beautiful three
doodlers new kids version is a great way
of turning your free hand illustrations
into 3d models the child-friendly start
works without heat and it's completely
wireless each set comes with a variety
of colors to help you create anything
from small figures to huge buildings
blades toys remote-controlled inflatable
Star Wars characters roll in at two feet
tall and bb-8 is easily the cutest using
the cool branded remote you can whisk
your droid down the hallway while making
it chirp adorably just don't let it near
Darth Maul's spiky head a skateboard
that moves itself the razor X Cruiser is
fitted with an electric motor to help
you glide along simply stand on the
board push the stick on the wireless
handheld controller and you're away
performing tricks might be an expensive
risk so I wouldn't recommend taking this
one to the skate park this third
generation micro drone 3 is equipped
with a gimbal stabilized HD camera it
can be flown using the included headset
which gives you a first-person view of
what the drone is seeing there's a
lightweight racing version too if speed
is more your thing and lastly these
storybooks from models spring to life
using augmented reality built into the
free app wow your kids at bedtime by
scanning the pages of the books or masks
with your tablet and watch the
animations unfold you can even interact
with the characters themselves bedtime
stories will never be the same again
sweet dreams kiddy winks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
