buy wine on facebook I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your cnet update facebook
will stop pushing you to buy physical
gifts for your friends the social
networks gift store no longer will carry
things like teddy bears flowers wine
clothing cupcakes and cookies rather now
it'll only sell digital gift cards
facebook says that since it launched
gifts in december of last year eighty
percent of the purchases have been gift
cards and this new gift store is rolling
out to users this week remember that
when you give someone a gift card on
facebook it goes on this plastic
facebook card that is mailed to the
person yahoo is releasing its abandoned
usernames to new owners since yahoo has
been around for so long many good names
have been taken but many old names were
not being used so for anyone that didn't
touch their accounts in over a year
yahoo released the count names many
people already rushed to see if they
could claim their first and last names
and superman and batman were also
popular requests but if you are hunting
for a name that's currently taken you
can pay yahoo two dollars to get
notified when a desired user name
becomes available in the next three
years and when it opens up yahoo will
give you two weeks to claim it samsung
and sony are dropping the price of their
4k televisions to about 4k that is to
say four thousand dollars according to
new reports the 55 inch models of
Samsung and Sony's 4k ultra high-def
resolution televisions both start at
four grand and the 65 inch models are
both 5500 dollars if you don't know what
I'm talking about 4k resolution is the
equivalent of four 1080p screens in
height and length if you're planning on
selling your old iPhone to grab the new
model next month now is the time to grab
a buyback price quote from gazelle the
site will give you a quote on a used
iphone but you don't have to ship it
back until october 15th so you can hang
on to the phone until you get your new
one which is expected to launch later in
September this 50 day guarantee is only
good if you request a quote by September
10th
that's when Apple will likely announce
the new model it's good to get a price
quote early because sites like gazelle
and next worth will offer less money
when we get closer to a new iphone
launch as of Monday the two-year-old 4s
model with 16 gigs of storage in good
condition could be sold for 215 dollars
typically waiting until the new phone
arrives get you half that sites like
gazelle make it easy to get cash for
your phone but if you're willing to sell
it on eBay you could make much more
money there's also rumors that apple
will begin buying back old iPhones when
you buy a new one that your tech news
