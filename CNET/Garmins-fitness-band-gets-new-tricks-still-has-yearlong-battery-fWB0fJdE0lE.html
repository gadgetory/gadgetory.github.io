fitness tracker that will last an entire
year before its batteries die let's
investigate so this is a very small and
simple fitness tracker but it has some
new features for example it will now
automatically detect when you start
exercising and periods of particularly
intense activity will be automatically
detected as well so you can check them
out later using the app it'll also do a
lot of the things that most fitness
trackers do so for example it'll count
how many steps you've taken it will give
a rough guess that's how many calories
you may have burned it'll also tell you
how much distance you've traveled and
it'll monitor your sleep as well now
that's all well and good but frankly I
think the coolest thing about this is
the battery life it'll last a full year
and if you're wondering why it's because
it uses a fairly standard a removable
battery just like a lot of watches do
it's gonna cost $100 and it should be on
sale in the next few months and that's
all for now but for much more on this
and for loads more tech checkout see
