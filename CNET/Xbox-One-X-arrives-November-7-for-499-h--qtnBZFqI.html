ever made sets a new quality standard
for gamers and game creators starting on
November 7th Xbox 1x joins the Xbox one
and the Xbox 1's when it launches
worldwide
let's talk power which starts with the
specs 6 teraflop GPU clocked at one
point one seven two gigahertz twelve
gigabytes of gddr5 memory and 326
gigabytes per second of memory bandwidth
these are impressive numbers that are
more powerful than any other console on
every dimension because that's what it
takes to give game creators the power
they need so you can experience true 4k
resolution 4k textures and 4k assets in
your living room and when we say true 4k
we mean 8 million pixels high dynamic
range wide color gamut premium sound
like Dolby Atmos and 4k UHD blu-ray
playback next compatibility we knew
compatibility was critically important
for Xbox one X and your reaction to 360
backward compatibility has energized the
team even more so right from the start
all of your Xbox one accessories and
games will work with Xbox one X
but for the team in me that wasn't good
enough we wanted more the game library
you have today will look and play even
better on Xbox one X with enhanced
visual fidelity anisotropic filtering
and faster load times it starts with the
Scorpio engine we use 16 nanometer
technology to build a 360 square
millimeter chip with seven billion
transistors and a 384 bit wide memory
bus this is the fastest most advanced
processor to ever power a console our
premium design means that every
millimetre and every component within
the console has been architected for
maximum power and efficiency
the Scorpio engine is so intense that
for the first time ever on a console
we're using a liquid cooled vapor
chamber normally reserved for servers
and high-end PC cards an engineer on the
Xbox Hardware team invented a new power
management system so innovative we named
it after him not only have we built the
most powerful console ever Xbox 1x is
the smallest Xbox ever
this is the system you asked us to build
and it has been a great honor to design
and build it for you
I couldn't be more proud of our team and
I hope you love it as much as we do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
