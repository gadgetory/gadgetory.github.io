a producer of the Apple byte extra
crunchy podcast with your host mr.
Bryant hog
what's up hostess with the mostess Beach
and tonk in the house guess what it's
episode 112 of the Apple byte extra
crunchy this is our complimentary piece
to our weekly show the Apple byte it's
only like around five six seven minutes
this is we get down and dirty and also
news stories drop by the time you watch
the show and it's always constantly
evolving this app world we have fun
talking about it we are fans of tech
we're fans of Apple when they do the
right thing so everyone that's listening
you know the drill to be a part of the
show all you have to do is call us at
1-866-376-8255 bought the iPhone 10 were
like there's no 128 gig option you're
making me get a 256 they said more than
half of the purchases were actually 256
gig models for the iPhone 10 that's kind
of an
so the 256 is what it's like it's a
little more than if that's 100 bucks - I
think it's like $1,200 so 1200 times six
million that's like five trillion
dollars that's incredible I think I
think that math is actually really
accurate
thank you for computing that so quickly
I flunked math in college a couple times
I'm not allowed to flunk math it's in my
DNA we're supposed to be good at math
I'm like a hockey I'm a walking abacus
yeah because I know what an abacus is
all right also just another quick story
about the Black Friday Cyber Monday
Before we jump into kind of all these
new hardware news air pods and iPads
were listed according to Adobe Adobe
takes analytics of the activity going on
during that weekend so thanks to you all
air pods and iPads
we're listed as the top-selling
electronics during this year's
record-setting Cyber Monday now on Cyber
Monday it is believed sales hit an
all-time record of six point five nine
billion dollars in sales
that's almost 17 percent higher than
last year's sales also the number one
product out of all these sales they
broke down kind of like some of the
gadgets we have the Xbox one X the ps4
Pro is there a lot of things that were
discounted the air pods were the most
desirable cyber monday product and I
found that interesting because when you
looked out there there weren't that many
discounts on them
so I think really people were just
buying air pods straight up straight up
and I saw I seen a lot of people around
the office wearing them now so they
might they might have picked up that
deal right you're telling you on a
pepper pods don't yeah I do I know I
know you do I know you do so bad yeah I
like I like the way they fit my you know
the regular air buds or what do they
call your buds your ear buds your ear
pods yeah I mean they fit me fine and I
have no problem with them so I would
like a pair I do I do want a pair okay
we'll put on we'll put on a Santa
Beechum's a little little Stephen B
Tim's Christmas list and we'll see if
he's naughty or nice I know he's not
even oh I don't know know that no no
24/7 I'm always naughty naughty naughty
all right let's talk Apple hardware lots
of cool stories this week coming out I
think though
lead story that has accumulated over
time is the fact that Apple pushed
through a patent application for a
future foldable iPhone yeah are you all
ready for this I'm ready for it man the
patent US Patent and Trademark Office
published this patent application that
Apple has put through here's some of the
things that it's using an elements
that's described even last week we
talked about how Apple is looking to get
into developing and manufacturing their
own micro LED displays this is a thinner
version of the current OLED technology
this pen specifically calls out micro
LED technology as the display type or
one of the display types that could be
used with this it talks about a foldable
type phone smartphone that could be
folded into like a book also they talk
about kind of some of the hinges that
would be involved in making this happen
using liquid metal parts it doesn't mean
that it's liquid metal like the
Terminator it's it's a more flexible
hinge let's put it out that way and I do
house I'll also bring this up because
Samsung has already showcased kind of
like this foe concept video back in 2014
of a foldable samsung galaxy they
actually went on the record this year to
say Samsung will be coming out with a
foldable phone in 2018 that we will
actually see it in 2018 maybe we'll see
it at CES in a couple months so guess
what Samsung is doing it Apple's gonna
do it - yeah so that's like--that's so
later that's like an immediate that's an
immediate reaction to Samsung doing it
you think like the patent of patent
filing and or is this something Apple
has been working on for a while I'm sure
they've looked at it I'm not sure
they've taken it seriously and look
Apple jumped on the trend when was it
the pet was it the Pebble watch was that
what they were called yeah yeah yeah the
pebble was the big Kickstarter 1 app
without became so hot every major
company started pumping out smartwatches
after the pebble opened people's eyes
because I
raised something like ten or eleven
million dollars on its Kickstarter it
was at the time a record-setting product
for a Kickstarter so look we know apples
not always first a lot of the times they
like to say that they they get it right
or at least they get it right the best
that they can so we'll see
Apple foldable phone I don't think we'll
see you next year if they're actually
gonna do this thing this doesn't mean
they're actually gonna do it but if they
do it sure maybe like two years three
years down the road we'll find out
things that are you want a foldable foam
bro you have to flip hell yeah I think I
think the most popular joke is Apple
already makes a foldable phone that's
right
iPhone six bendgate yes you are all
correct this render right here real
quick this render it looks like a like a
chair you know like you can put some
legs on the bottom and just have an
Apple chair it's cool it ain't even real
I we're just coming everything goes full
circle trends we got the razor flip
phone that was one of the dopest phones
I could see I like how our phone is
today but it could be interesting I'm
just saying it could be interesting yeah
yeah if you could fold a foot if your
phone could be half the size and fold
out like that and still have the bait
same screen real estate and you just
like you like flip it out cycle that
would be cool little thing I would be
totally cool with that
all right a new report from the Nikkei
Asian review says Apple is planning to
design their own power chips in house as
soon as 2018 and what is what does this
really mean all right so we know
recently that Apple pretty much squashed
a company they're doing their own kind
of core coprocessors we've seen the M
processor for for fitness and movement
we've seen this Bionic neural engine
chip that Apple is implemented to handle
the facial recognition image and speak
recognition really a machine learning
chip on the new iPhone 10 and we also
saw how Apple decided to build their own
graphics processor a little earlier and
this company called imagination
technologies was literally
destroyed in the stock market because at
the time they were Apple's number-one
supplier so apples like we're gonna do
this on their own apples really gonna be
doing the same thing they want to they
want to take even more control this
experience so there looks like according
to multiple sources that they will be
designing their own main power
management chips for use in these
iPhones coming as soon as 2018 there's
another company that's gonna be a
casualty of this called dialog
semiconductor whose shares plunged as
much as nineteen percent after the news
there's multiple reports claiming this
but the main advantage of this Apple
controls that chip Apple a lot of times
can tie their hard work together more
intimately when they have all the pieces
of the puzzle from the ground up being
built so this could help with charging
functionality battery management and
energy consumption which I don't think
anyone's gonna complain about
I think this if it benefits us the
consumer we're all about it sure do you
want to fall with better battery Beecham
I want my phone I don't want to have to
ever charge my phone I want it to be
solar power just work all the time I
don't have to plug it in nothing I don't
care about the wireless charging just
work there was a patent that Apple had
some level of solar charging through the
screen yeah this is from like a couple
of years ago again we haven't seen it
come to fruition these are just patents
but it is what it is and we stick with
kind of more talk about the iPhone and
this was kind of interesting
Johnny I've write apples I don't know
what his official title is right now I
believe he's like the veep is he the VP
of design I don't even know exactly what
his official title is but we all know
right he's their design he's their
design chief at Apple has had some great
hits and is also in my opinion had some
misses but he had this really
interesting interview with a Smithsonian
magazine talking about his work but
really he kind of shed light on Apple's
new campus specifically and so he's
talking about how Apple Park their new
UFO circular ring building is really
cool because they're going to be able to
have multiple different design teams
work together industrial designers font
experts motion graphic experts and
computer interface designers will be
able to come together
they show like this video clip that has
a lot of kind of some of the just the
design elements of their also this space
will actually have their own milling
machines and what is that why is that
gonna help Apple this enables them to
build physical prototypes sure they've
been able to do like 3d printed models
but these specific milling machines will
allow them to use the native materials
that would be on some of these products
and their first kind of concept and
we'll be able to grasp the idea of like
okay will this work or not I think
that's really cool that these are being
implemented on-site in Apple Park he
even says in this quote I think you only
really understand a material its
properties and attributes and
importantly the opportunity the material
allows if you actually work it yourself
and the most remarkable point in this
whole process is when you make the first
model we might like it
we might not but the first model you
make and then everything changes so I
think the other thing that uh there's
another quote in this story that made me
laugh is they had talked to him Johnny
I've about the iPhone 10 and I've talked
about it's all glass design and it's
edge to edge display he said this is
something that Apple has aspired for
years to make and then he dropped the
bomb in comparison he critiqued the
older iPhone designs and says and now
seems to me a rather disconnected
component housed in an enclosure when
talking about the iPhone 7 plus so he's
basically saying the 7 plus is dated
it's old he's over it doesn't even care
about it you've got dated technology if
you have the 7 plus it is unacceptable
that's crazy that he's like dissing that
his own product kind of you know it's
just like a its interests in a shower
that blows my mind actually I think in a
way though as a designer you have it's
always like you're always looking
forward to the next evolution so I think
your newest work is always gonna be your
best work you're all just working to be
like and it was good at the time but
that makes sense that makes sense cuz
you know like there's things that I've
done a long time ago and I look at it
now I'm like that is crap what is that
I mean as a creator of music unit you
know it's it aligns with that same type
of a thinking and mentality alright
another cool patent that has surfaced is
Apple wins a patent for really the true
depth true depth camera that is used on
the iPhone but using this to support
hand gesturing in a 3d interface for
IMAX are you all ready to be like an
Apple Jedi with your iMac so it has
different functions we're right we know
that Apple acquired primeSense
I think back in either it was either
2013 or 2014 prime sense was the company
behind the Microsoft Kinect Apple
acquired them and really what you have
in the iPhone 10 currently is aspects
not and it just not a Kinect itself but
aspects of a Microsoft Kinect in the
iPhone 10 in that lovely little notch
that you know I love so much love it so
there's in this knotch
right there saying we want to implement
the same technology in an imac do things
gestures like a push gesture with your
hand a wave gesture or move your hand up
to do things like unlock the computer
and other tasks I think it's I think
it's actually kind of cool I'm down with
this is cool but figure five is it's
kind of funny I mean with the arrow
where his thingy yeah where his hands
going up and down figure five yeah I
wonder if like where is your mind you I
saw figure five I was like what is
happening here oh he's dreaming a
blaster okay oh my god so your Mac might
might misconstrue some things hey that's
that's a concern there's if you watch
the video show we have a new term for
people that get really excited about
Apple Apple we get real excited about
that but you if you you got a do you got
a fat bowl if you're really exciting
your juiced up about it just Apple
bapple it up Apple it up alright and
before we take our little break Apple is
reportedly planning to release an even
cheaper nine point seven inch iPad in
2018 this is according to digit times we
know that right now the lowest priced at
least standard sized iPad the nine point
seven inches 329 digit times reports the
Apple is trying to target a price in the
range of two hundred and fifty nine
dollars we've seen really a new life
being breathed into the iPad line thank
you to the iPad pro which is one of my
favorite Apple gadgets in so long iPad
sales growth recovered this year after
remember they went something like three
straight years of declining sales
because it was just look you don't have
to replace him as much we've talked
about that it was a stale market there
wasn't any really new innovation but iOS
11 plus iPad pro awesome still can't do
as much as a surface pro but still
awesome for Apple users very cool yeah
baby
that that's what we want I love that all
right should we take a break to a show
some love to our sponsors my man let's
do it music sound all right check this
out the single router Wi-Fi model is
just doesn't work for increasingly high
bandwidth world so guess well what you
need is a distributed system the answer
is zero we've talked about Aero before
we love them whatever your Wi-Fi needs 0
has the power to seamlessly blanket your
home and fast reliable Wi-Fi via
ethernet wireless or really any
combination so you simply set it on a
flat surface plug it into a wall outlet
to expand coverage into any room not to
mention you have the addition of a third
5 gigahertz radio this is the
second-generation arrow that's now
tri-band which is twice as fast as its
predecessor and lets customers do more
in every room of their home
simultaneously plus with this a new
addition of the thread radio arrow can
now connect to low-power devices this is
gonna be really important for the smart
home for lakhs doorbells and other
sensors moving forward
also not only to have this main router
Eero has the beacon it's these half-size
kind of white square rounded squares
that are even more powerful than the
original arrow that you can plug in the
wall to kind of help your Wi-Fi get
covered in multiple rooms whichever
model you choose with arrows incredible
customer support you can call and get
ahold of a Wi-Fi expert within they say
30 seconds so I've told you this before
how I set up the arrow system that they
had us use in my parents house it was
really easy my parents house is pretty
big it's like three levels I put in a
couple of the beacons and then the setup
was cool it's really easy I mean it's to
me because apples getting on a Wi-Fi
gyro
is it's not only better than what Apple
is offering by far right now but it just
has that nice sleek design so I'm a fan
you also have the ability to customize
it and it's an easy simple setup like I
said didn't my parents house it was dope
so check it out for free overnight
shipping to the US or Canada visit
eurocom select overnight as the shipping
option and enter Apple byte at checkout
that's ero calm spelled eer oh the code
Apple byte APPL eb y te at checkout
thanks ero is dope it's actually a legit
really good product awesome man cool so
I'm not saying that because they
sponsored our show but I am saying that
they also sponsored their show yes okay
back to the show uh this I mean this
might be kind of boring but I think I
had to mention mention this we've talked
about how Qualcomm and Apple have beef
with each other there have been lawsuits
patent infringement complaints going
back and forth with each other it took
another layer to this kind of intricate
12-layer cake-- qualcomm on thursday
filed three new patent infringement
complaints against Apple saying there
were 16 more of its patents that Apple
was using in its phones no you go ahead
I was gonna say aren't they trying to
block Apple from selling iPhone X's -
yes iPhone tens iPhone 8 and 8 plus --is
because of this they are trying to block
them from being sold we know how how
that doesn't really work it's it's all
kind of like a threat that ends up
getting resolved but there's a lot of
history here Apple felt that Qualcomm
was unfairly charging higher prices for
their components in their phones then
when Apple has models of the you know
the iPhone 7 that had different until
motives and Qualcomm modems there were
plenty reports that substantiated and
showed that the Qualcomm modem was a
faster performing autumn but Apple
throttled it down so that it would have
equal ish on the same level of
performance as the Intel based modems
Intel modem based iPhones Qualcomm
wasn't happy about that this continues
to go on Apple filed a lawsuit against
Qualcomm Qualcomm does the same Qualcomm
is now like we said filing these patent
infringement complaints against Apple
this is not going to end anytime soon
it's just a wide-ranging legal war Apple
actually sued Qualcomm for nearly 1
billion dollars in January in patent
royalty rebates again they told you that
they had felt that Qualcomm was charging
them too high so there you go guys
have fun with that when big boys fight
when big companies fight it gets ugly
first world fights first world fights
all right software stuff a lot of stuff
this came out this week I'm gonna kind
of try and run through some of these
because you might not want to linger on
this but we know about we heard about
the root password vulnerability that
came out about a week ago this is where
anyone if you are a Mac OS High Sierra
user specifically the High Sierra users
could go into your user in groups kind
of where you type in your password to
get access to computer type in the
username root and leave the password
completely blank and that person could
get complete access to pretty much any
file on your computer Wow yeah so thanks
lennier again for finding this one out
that has been actually patched with a
Apple security update and then there was
like a follow up or some users after
that update we're having file sharing
issues that has also been fixed with
another update to that update this
is happening a lot yeah that's that yeah
like like every field like almost every
other day there's a new update to iOS or
mac o s-- or something yeah it there is
someone's like someone's on the
periscopes like you really read comments
I'm like yeah I do when I can when I can
take a peek like I'm doing the show
right now also there's another
autocorrect issue affecting users of iOS
11 and later this time if a user typed
in the word it it would potentially
autocorrect it to capital i dot t the
same thing was happening so for some
users that were typing in the word is it
would change it by autocorrect to I dot
s there's been no response by Apple for
a fix of this it's not happy to
everybody but it is happening to
hundreds of users not just like two or
three but a lot of people I finally
updated my phone from the from the I
error oh you did because I was out of
town and I couldn't plug it in my
computer my phone itself has been asking
me to update to the to one of the betas
but I do not want to do the beta because
it's not back you can't back it up right
you can't back up your phone right now
with eleven point two beta so I'm like
no I don't want to touch that so anyways
I did finally update the dot this
original I bug issue apples also seated
the fifth beta of iOS eleven point two
to developers or if you are part of the
public beta program which is free you
can download that as well you know we
talked about Apple paid cash Siri
specifically working without a
connection on the phone and then also
support for the 7.5 watt charging for
faster wireless charging I didn't know
this but I don't know if you can show it
in the in that article Beach in iOS
sorry on the iPhone 10 you pull down
from the top right hand corner to bring
up your control center we know that
Apple has this annoying bar on the
bottom of the phone to let people know
you swipe up for your to go back to your
home screen they're gonna put a second
bar on the lockscreen under the top
right hand corner just to let people
know that
yeah it's you can swipe down here as
well okay is it if you scroll down the
article more because I think it's in
here oh I see is this it no I can't see
it anymore no it's okay it's art it's
that blue thing okay are in the top
right-hand corner and a bar in the
bottom on your lock screen that's
awesome
oh I see it's just kind of like a visual
cue like you could swipe here I don't
think we're that dumb I honestly don't
think we're that dumb I think it's an
insult like it makes it really maybe is
an indication of the broad general use
of the iPhone fine but come on man I
mean we're not even like being tech
snobs here you really need to put a bar
up there now I don't think I think most
people that get their iPhone 10 that
aren't even that tech-savvy don't even
know what the bar is therefore they're
not be like oh there's a bar I should
swipe up they don't know that I'm pretty
sure if I saw that and I didn't know
what it was I would think it was like a
problem with my screen I mean like
there's like a issue there's a line in
my screen like what is this but what I
did first play with the iPhone 10 I I
you know I there was a little learning
curve I had to figure out how to do it
so you know where each way to swipe and
stuff so I don't know maybe they'll get
rid of it in the next update or
something yeah it's like they're gonna
teach us train us first and then yeah
anyways there you go the bar is there
like someone's saying in the in the chat
like it's for early adopters so um also
I have to admit that I was totally wrong
this I thought the iPhone 10 was gonna
be really really hard to get even
through the beginning of next year but
according to reports uh shipping
estimates for the iPhone 10 have
improved to under one week for the
United States they tend they I you know
we had heard stories about how iPhones
were getting shipped to customers
earlier that were seen like four to five
weeks they were getting it more in like
two to three weeks so I mean everyone's
gonna be happy about that there's
nothing bad with that is that someone
like cracking the whip or is that just
you know I think it's just them getting
their supply chain like just totally
ramped up and maybe changing the
tolerance of the face ID recognition
that I love that caller that called it
about do you think this is like a
scandal going on back then I'm like I
don't know Apple TV also gets this new
if you're using the preview versions or
the public betas of
i OS 11.2 and TV OS 11.2 they introduced
the ability to watch sports games sports
matches sports teams directly through
that watch app on your Apple TV or
through the Apple TV app on your phone
that is actually gone live if you have
early versions of this really cool right
now ESPN is really the only app that is
supported at the moment this isn't being
rolled out you know general consumer
live so I'm expecting will see other
apps like NHL MLB TNT even to get
plugged in with this but it is pretty
cool like I love that it's pretty sweet
and then just to talk about other
shipping delays with the Apple TV right
now an Apple TV with 64 gigs of storage
is facing a four to five weeks shipping
delay oh man so holiday you want that 4k
Apple TV that is still yet to get dolby
atmos support people know what i play
people know what bugs me that's that's a
four to five week shipping delay at the
moment so they straighten out the iPhone
shipping but not the Apple TV yeah maybe
you know I think just a bunch of people
Apple TV $1.99 that's like a I really I
don't want to say easy gift again but
it's kind of a nice gift to get someone
like a that's gonna be your present for
Christmas you know yeah I was seeing him
on sale for like 85 but that's you know
probably an earlier version over a Black
Friday and Cyber Monday I was seeing him
on sale for like 85 bucks
I was I was tempted we're gonna do it
alright um you know what I say let's
just go to our voicemails right now and
just get to it what do you think they do
it maybe for calling we had some good
calls but our voicemail did fill up this
week so we there probably were some of
you guys that didn't get through but we
thank you for trying and I thank you
yeah I cleared it out so you can call us
and leave a message and let me put the
phone number up just just so you guys
have it and here is our first call here
we go
get beat is elicit a dog from Chicago
said to bring up a point on apple
carplay mission that I can't use my
google map do you think app will ever
let you put Apple maps on carplay it
make it a lot more useful let me know
what you think looking forward to
hearing from you thanks right I'm pretty
sure he meant Google Maps he first said
are they gonna bring Google Maps and
they said are they gonna bring so are
they gonna bring Apple maps it's not
gonna do GLE maps i mean i could go on
the record and say i don't think we'll
ever see google maps in apple's carplay
it just doesn't make sense for them to
do that they're competing with androids
androids own car software system there
they're true it's Apple ecosystem thing
I know they have third party music
services that are supported by car play
but I just don't think we'll ever see
Google Maps in apple carplay how about
this at least for not for the next three
years after that maybe maybe they'll get
over themselves so car plays not open to
developers like like an iPhone like the
iPhone is you have you had they have
very specific deliberate partners that
they allow to show up on their display
because it basically looks like an
iPhone with things like a row of five
and five of apps that are you know that
grounded off corners and it's not like
they're gonna let you play games or have
apps just go to town on it it's Apple
it's a very controlled ecosystem we've
always known that so Google Maps I would
love it but it's not gonna happen
yeah yeah they need to open that up
though because the car is like the next
space you know like we've done the flame
up a lot of things up they need to open
up the home pod I mean they don't they
don't have even right now the developer
files have shown that they're not
looking to open it up they're only gonna
have Apple music as the native music
service on the home pod yeah and no
other third-party apps like Amazon echo
third-party apps thousands whether do
you use and you know we're gonna be
talking to alexa in our cars like in the
next couple of years
oh yeah oh yeah play me the song Alexa
do it okay here we got another car
another call here we go hey guys Nick
from Alameda again I just wanted to
comment on the puff of your last podcast
and talking about the home pod the
bottom line is that Apple can't see the
forest through the trees because they
want to design an entire product around
functionality
whereas Amazon design an entire product
around just functionality I look at the
Amazon echo as being a gateway or a key
to an entire fleece automated world and
that's where I think apples missing the
mark because for me I have an echo dot
and I used three point five millimeter
phone jack and I plug it right right
into the back of the bose system and it
sounds awesome
and that's fifty bucks and the home pods
350 so I could have a dot literally in
every single room if I wanted to for the
price of one home pod so I think Apple
needs the needs to take a look at
themselves and honestly design something
that is cheap affordable and maybe just
a modular hookup to something that would
allow people to interact with their
their ecosystem love the show Thanks
awesome call yeah I love that call
because not only is he talking about the
problem but he's talking about a
solution and you know what guess what
Apple isn't always first to market
they've made mistakes we've seen them
trail I feel like they're trailing like
they haven't been before at any time but
guess what the power of their ecosystem
allows them to trail and allows them to
one day maybe come up with a little home
pebble instead of a home pot right
because quite there is no way look at
okay how about this this Cyber Monday
and this Black Friday where were the
biggest deals
they were around the Amazon echo the
echo dot smart lights from Philips
Logitech Harmony hubs Google mini Google
home the smart home voice assistant was
the hotspot this during this sales
season it's gonna continue through the
Christmas break Apple again is delaying
their home pod until March or whatever
to early 2018 they shut down their
company for like a couple weeks in
December so we know nothing's gonna be
going on then they're missing all this
this is what is this year three or year
four of the Amazon echo where they're a
fully mature platform and now they're at
the point where mom and dad are doing it
not just tech tech no elite techno tech
fans it's mom and dad who have already
started do it now it's like grandma
starting to get into it right like
mainstream general consumer Apple's
missing this they can do something
similar but there's gonna be a point in
this race where people just think of
either Amazon or Google as the voice
assistant and for the home Siri might be
for your phone but it's not gonna be for
your home yeah and that's they you just
don't want to be there you don't want to
be number three you want to be yeah you
want to be number one but at least be
one or two you're you're like you're a
far away third right now and that sucks
that's sucks and series not even as
smart as Google Google's assistant or
Amazon's Alexa so it's just bad news and
it's disappointing the caller said that
the echo dot was $50 but I've seen it
it's on sale like 30 30 bucks it's super
cheap now and just right now you can get
up for 30 bucks should I tell the story
when we're all having lunch and then we
saw that the echoes were we're free and
everyone made a mad rush to the
computers well it's a great product
we're all sitting having lunch
Brian Tong couple work co-workers here
at C net and then we got a text or
something I think you got the text right
Brian that echo dots were free on Amazon
we all went we ordered and we all got
free dots so I know it was like a random
thing that happened but you know it was
a good random thing and yeah and again
serious serious apples well you know one
of their biggest missteps
honestly look I'm not a future I'm not a
future teller but I am no Tom yes
but you can't you can't understate that
they had this platform out what long
before anyone did and they build a home
pod without the foresight of having
Serie B at the heart of it they talked
about it in that report from Bloomberg
last week it was the center of they
wanted to make a high-end audio device
they didn't want to make a high-end
voice assistant that happened also be a
high-end audio device they wanted to
make a great sounding speaker that
completely changes how the home pod is
developed and built and looked at from
ground up from the from the company so
they're not and they're not catching up
anytime soon and it's a shame it's it's
a huge mess it's one of the biggest
misses that's all right you know what
though um before we go guys do have we
do have one more thing to do you wanna
talk about this sure let's talk about
that what's that the one more thing no
