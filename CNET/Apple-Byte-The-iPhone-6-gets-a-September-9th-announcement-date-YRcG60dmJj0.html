welcome to the Apple buy for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
the Apple iPhone 6 event gets an
unofficial date a future iPad could
bring gaming controls and did you know
Samsung actually did work for Apple
let's get to the show in that magic date
for Apple's next iPhone looks to be
September the 9th according to multiple
sources now it still hasn't been
officially announced by the bay gay but
recode says they have scheduled it
that's just about a month away but the
9th is also known as wonderful weirdos
day it's probably one of the stupidest
made-up days I've ever heard of and my
favorite teddy bear day yes I'm not
lying
like who wants an iPhone when you can
give that someone special a teddy bear
that just melts me like great in this
area all right in a couple iPhone
follow-up stories a cloning company
analyst claims the two rumored iPhone 6
screen sizes won't be the only thing
that makes them different their supply
chain checks report that the 5.5 inch
iPhone may include a more powerful
processor and a different touch module
compared to the 4.7 inch iPhone now
there are no specifics on clock speeds
the analyst says the size of the
processor may be larger pointing to the
a8 chip but it's a stretch with no
specifics right now we've also talked
about past rumors with the iPhone 6s
less than stellar potential battery
reports now point to a 2100 milliampere
battery which would be a 46 percent
increase from the iPhone 5s now that
still trails the galaxy s5s 2800
milliampere battery but the tight
integration between Apple's hardware and
software optimization should help make
up some of that difference we hope all
right Apple released the latest update
for OS 10 Yosemite s Developer Preview
and an updated look with the system
preferences and a redesigned top bar
launch pad now has a progress bar
there's a new looking volume and
brightness panel and a tweaked
calculator with Apple's favorite
translucency iOS 8 also released its
betta as well with some new tweets like
the ability to use SMS relay with your
computer it's one of the new continuity
features there's now an option directly
on the keyboard to turn on predictive
typing the ability to optimize your
photos with iphone storage by sending
full res versions to the iCloud and
keeping a smaller optimized version on
your phone and when Wi-Fi calling is
enabled on the network like t-mobile it
will be called out as t-mobile Wi-Fi
there are plenty more little hidden
secrets and improvements but the most
interesting beta release might be for
the Apple TV which brings a cleaner and
more refined look with Apple's thinner
fonts introduced in iOS 7 as well you
can check out its revamp two icons that
take a cue from Apple's cleaner and
flatter design direction let's check out
some iPad news and a new set of photos
claims to show the rear shell of the
purported iPad air 2 the images show off
of gold housing with several design
changes including a new speaker grille
with larger holes and a microphone next
to the iSight camera on the back now
this lines up with previous leaks and
replicas we've recently seen that also
feature the expected touch ID sensor so
what could be coming to the next next
iPad well Apple has been granted a
patent for a backside gaming controls on
an iPad that's right iPad booty controls
that allow the rear surface to be used
as an input device for gaming the patent
was filed in 2012 so this is a patent
that's been granted pretty quickly
the sensors would be aligned along the
edges in a grid-like pattern on the back
end may include ultrasonic pressure and
capacitive sensors and one or more
cameras could also be used to give
proximity information
now we've already proposed a name for it
we like to call it the iPad touch my
rear all right let's check out the quick
bytes Samsung and Apple have agreed to
end all patent disputes outside of the
United States suits in Australia Japan
South Korea Germany and other countries
will be dropped against each other now
slowly the two companies have been
making peace with both dropping appeals
to patent infringement cases and all
patent suits involving Motorola Mobility
good news coming from the App Store the
coop town kids announced July was a
record-setting month for apps for
revenue and Tim Cook even tweet
his thanks Apple also put out an
announcement showing off the power of
Apple's ability to create jobs with
roughly six hundred and twenty-nine
thousand jobs in Europe thanks to the
Apple economy and over five hundred
thousand of those jobs were part of
Apple's app economy and ladies and
gentlemen we finish things off with my
favorite story of the day a former
employee from apple's vancouver pacific
center store is auctioning off his
business card t-shirt and lanyard for
charity well why is it so special it's
because the dude's name is samsung sam
sung worked for Apple and it's the only
time you'll see Apple and Samsung on the
same business card so Sam put up the
auction on eBay all of the proceeds will
go to Children's Wish British Columbia
and UConn a nonprofit that grants wishes
to sick children and with eight days
left it's at 80 thousand and two hundred
dollars that's amazing
so Sam the Apple biters got nothing but
love for you and you deserve all the
props in the world that might end up
being one of the coolest stories of the
year all right that's gonna do it for
this week's show send me your emails to
the Apple byte at cnn.com or tweet me at
Bryant on it I will get to as many as I
can they so much watch it we'll catch
you all next time for another bite of
the Apple
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
