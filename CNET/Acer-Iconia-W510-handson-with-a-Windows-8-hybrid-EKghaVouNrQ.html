a first look at the Acer Iconia W 510
this may look like a small clamshell
laptop but it's actually something
you're gonna be seeing a lot more of
with Windows 8
a hybrid laptop and that means that the
display here besides being a touch
display like that
actually separates completely from the
rest of the system and you can carry
this around like a tablet you know just
like any other tablet it's got an
accelerometer in it so you can rotate it
and screen orientation changes you know
it's fairly thin fairly light it's got
that edge to edge glass over the top so
by itself it just looks and feels like a
regular tablet then you can snap it into
the base here and you have something
that's much closer to a traditional
laptop now all the components are inside
the screen here including the CPU what
you have on the bottom half is of course
a keyboard a touchpad and an additional
battery so the two can work together and
give you a really extended battery life
now the concepts pretty cool I've got
two things that are giving me pause
about both the W 510 and a lot of the
other upcoming Windows 8 hybrids that
we've seen number one is this system
instead of having an Intel Core i3 or
Core i5 processor it's got the next
version of Intel's Atom processor that's
the low power CPU we used to see in
netbooks a couple years ago people kind
of fell out of love with those four so
to bring the atom back and put it in
something like a cabin that really needs
a little bit of processing overhead for
the touchscreen and all the other cool
stuff that Windows 8 does you know makes
me a little bit worried about
performance although the new atoms are
definitely better than the ones in
netbooks I'm a couple years ago
number two is price you know what
they're asking for this particular
combination and this is very similar to
a lot of other windows 8 hybrid laptops
is 750 dollars and that's for the tablet
screen part and the keyboard you can get
this alone for about $600 you know when
you consider that this is an atom
powered thing and most atom powered
laptops from years ago cost maybe $300
at most 750 does seem like kind of a lot
especially when you consider what kind
of really cool Ultrabook you can
actually get with $700
now you can get a pretty good one I'm
just saying you know that being said as
a tablet those things works great the
keyboard I found that keeps her very
shallow I missed a lot of kids while
typing it's not really the best keyboard
experience and it is a little bit
awkward when you put the two parts
together it looks like a clamshell
laptop but not the previous one you've
ever seen so there's really a lot to at
eight they take into consideration here
if you are considering a hybrid laptop
I'm Dan Ackerman and that is the Acer
Iconia W 510</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
