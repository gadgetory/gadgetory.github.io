Bakalar and it's time to get loaded it's
verizon iphone 4 launch day the phone
became available at seven a.m. and each
respective time zone across the u.s. and
here in New York seen at TV was at the
flagship Apple glass cube store to find
out whether people wanted the phone
enough to brave the freezing cold take a
look hey it's Wilson tank here in New
York City at the verizon iphone launch
as you can see it's pandemonium out here
there are all of maybe 10 people online
most of them actually reporters but you
can't really blame them because it is 26
degrees here right now they must be
crazy just as much as I am I thought
there was going to be a really really
big line I was surprised I got here
around six thirty and I was fourth in
line so I was actually really happy but
I thought I was expecting a lot more
people where so Apple along with all the
tech media apparently thought that the
launch would be a lot bigger I mean it's
very obvious there's hundreds of Apple
staff inside there's even barricade
police barricades out here for the event
looks like the cold and the cost of
switching to break your contract and
maybe the fact that Verizon customers
have been waiting for four years already
means they can wait a couple of days to
get their iphone I'm Wilson Tang here in
New York an HP finally unveiled the next
generation Web OS products we've been
waiting for an event in California
former palm CEO John Rubenstein took the
wraps off its 9.7 inch tablet called the
touchpad the touch pad features a 1024 x
768 screen ways one and a half pounds
has a front facing video camera for chat
16 and 32 gigabytes of memory flash
support beats by dr. dre speakers and a
1.2 gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon
processor at first the device will only
be available for Wi-Fi but HP plans on
releasing three and 4G versions later
this year in addition to the touchpad HP
had two smartphones up its sleeve the
first is the pre 3 which
the display resolution adds HD video
recording front facing camera and a 1.4
gigahertz Qualcomm processor and it will
ship this summer the other new phone is
the veer and is akin to a scaled-down
version of the pre in terms of size it
has a similar slide-out keyboard but
will support hspa+ Wi-Fi bluetooth 8
gigabytes of storage and an 800
megahertz Snapdragon processor HP
developed the veer as an alternative to
what it sees as jumbo sized phones now
powering all these devices is web OS 2.1
which packs 50 new features including
the ability to create your own Wi-Fi
hotspot with compatible devices its
biggest feature is its ability to keep
all your devices in sync including
browsing history and context if you're
near another web OS device the software
adds a touch to share function that
begins a data transfer now web OS 2.1
adds a new photo gallery also called
exhibition and you can wirelessly print
to other HP printers finally HP says
it's working on plans to bring webOS two
full-size PCs and notebook computers but
provided no timeframe Web OS 2.1 will
ship in the summer along with a new
touch pad the pre 3 and veer gadgets
that is your news for the day I'm Jeff
