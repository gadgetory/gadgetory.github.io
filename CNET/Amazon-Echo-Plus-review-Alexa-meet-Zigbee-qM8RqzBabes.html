time the amazon echo plus it's a new
smart speaker that looks just like the
original echo smart speaker saved for
the new option of a silver finish and it
does all the same things as before it
plays music it looks up facts
it reads off the morning headlines and
it controls smart home gadgets so what's
the plus part all about the answer is
ZigBee a wireless standard that a lot of
smart home devices used to talk to each
other the echo Plus has a ZigBee radio
of its own so we can talk to those
devices too and it can control them you
won't need to plug an extra Bridge or
hub into your router to control any of
them because the echo plus is the hub at
least that's the pitch at a hundred and
fifty dollars the echo plus cost thirty
dollars less than the original Amazon
echo and it also offers incrementally
better sound quality there's also a new
ox out jack in the back the let's see
connected to your existing speakers of
course the same can be said of the new
second gen Amazon echo which cost just a
hundred bucks that means that you're
essentially paying an extra $50 for that
ZigBee radio and for the last echoes
basic design I actually see the appeal
there lots of folks prefer the original
echos volume ring to the new echos
volume buttons that said the appeal of
that ZigBee radio falls a little short
for me it's not because of the echo plus
itself but rather because of the Alexa
app put simply it's new built-in smart
home controls are too basic and too
underdeveloped from my tastes I can turn
on this color-changing Philips hue bulb
for instance but I can't change its
color and I can't schedule gradual fades
to wake me up in the morning for that
I'd still need the Philips hue app but I
can't use the Philips U app unless I
have the Philips hue ZigBee bridge and
at that point why even bother with the
echo plus if there's a glimmer of hope
it's a new feature called routines that
lets you trigger multiple things all at
once with a single custom Alexa command
if you're choosing let me show you what
I'm talking about
if I'm getting home from work at the end
of the day I can walk in the door and
say Alexa I'm home and you'll see that
entry lamps start to turn on that
hallway light comes on that ceiling fan
starts to spin overhead cool the place
down a little bit that's a routine and
it all happens because of a single Alexa
command I just wish you could
incorporate music playback into those
routines and trigger specific songs or
playlists with just a few magic words
right now you can't still I see
here an Alexa powered smart home hub
seems sensible enough and with a couple
of key app updates the echo Plus might
very well get there but I would wait for
that to happen before building your
entire smart home around it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
