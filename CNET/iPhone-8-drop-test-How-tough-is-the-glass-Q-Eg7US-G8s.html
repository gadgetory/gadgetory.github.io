iPhone from aluminum on the iPhone 7 to
glass on the new iPhone 8 to make way
for wireless charging and this is not
just any glass and the glass is further
reinforced by an internal laser welded
steel and copper structure we're so
excited because this glass is the most
durable ever in a smartphone but it's
still glass and we've all seen what
happens to phones with glass backs so
exactly how strong is the glass on
Apple's new iPhone 8 we're gonna find
out the fumble and drop out of the
pocket is probably the most common way
to break your phone so we're starting
our tests at about pocket height screen
size down I can already tell you the
back survived which is what I was
actually trying to break but let's take
a look at the front oh the front is good
too but now that I'm looking at it
closely you can start to notice some
damage there is a tiny fracture up here
on the top there's a small dent where it
hit and then on the bottom you can
definitely notice a crack again it's on
the side so it's not too noticeable and
then the aluminum frame has a dent here
on the corner probably where it hit
first now this probably would have
happened on the aluminum phone but the
cracks on the back definitely would not
have happened so the back is not
completely cracked yet and the front
survives so we're gonna continue on with
our next test this type of accident also
tends to happen at around eye level as
you're taking a picture so we're setting
our next test at about this height
Oh yep
it is destroyed the screen completely
shattered I can just I can tell you that
much
obviously it still works but you
wouldn't want to swipe your fingers on
this screen right now there's spider
webs on the top there's the crack goes
all the way to the bottom and but the
back didn't sustain any more damage than
it already had obviously the front is
pretty messed up but there's still more
surface to break so for our next test we
opened it up to you guys to see what
crazy ways you had broken your phone and
we chose this one slipped out of my
pocket as a carnival ride just shot me
upside down 50 feet high still plays out
in slow-mo in my head as it smashes on
the ground so we obviously don't have a
carnival ride here at scene it but we do
have a fourth floor welcome to the
fourth floor of CNET we're gonna try to
have this land with the back facing down
but it's gonna be really hard to control
so here goes two one
let's go see what damage we made
oh wow okay this phone is completely
useless Wow
okay I'm so sorry iPhone completely
shattered on the back on the front but
that was a pretty heavy fall so yeah
even the cameras broken everything on
this iPhone is completely destroyed it
is coming apart in my hands but yet the
screen is still sort of on you can see
you can see it light up in the back but
other than that it's completely falling
apart and did not survive our torture
test today obviously this last test goes
well beyond the normal wear and tear of
any phone and basically it was just for
fun
none of these tests are scientific but
they do prove that this is not an
unbreakable phone so put a case on it
and please do not drop it from that
higher just don't drop it at all now is
this the strongest glass ever made on
any phone and I'm so sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
