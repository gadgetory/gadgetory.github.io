and I'm checking out the Aden to Android
version of the Lenovo yoga tablet 2
sometimes the smallest things make the
biggest difference in the case of this
Lenovo tablet it's the useful built-in
kickstand that distinguishes it without
a doubt my favorite thing about this
tablet is its design we've seen it in
previous yoga models including an almost
identical tenant err and it remains one
of the most innovative at a little under
a pound it's comfortable to hold it's
chunky rounded spine even makes gripping
it in one hand pleasant though I often
found myself using the kickstand on the
inside the Lenovo yoga tablet 2 has the
quad core Intel Atom processor 2
gigabytes of RAM 16 gigabytes of
internal memory and a microSD card
that's expandable up to 64 gigabytes it
rocks the 1920 by 1200 pixel resolution
IPS display that's vividly sharp and
colorful with wide viewing angles the
front-facing speakers on the tablet are
pretty good it's a rare quality and the
preloaded bill the app is crucial to
getting the most out of the pair when
listening to movies it sharpens dialogue
in soundscapes and it makes music sound
fuller performance is smooth and Swift
your basic tasks like browsing the web
and streaming video even with many apps
open in the background the tablet
chugged along unflustered it's
stripped-down Android skin is my biggest
grave instead of an app tray the yoga
tablet has more of an iOS functionality
but with widgets I personally like
having app tray so I can keep my home
screens clutter free
according to Lenovo the tablets battery
can last up to 18 hours I haven't had my
hands on the yoga too for long but it's
lasted me about 6 to 7 hours on a full
charge but that's after heavy use the
yoga tablet 2 isn't flashy or
cutting-edge in any particular way
however it's still a special tablet
thanks to its useful built-in kickstand
an impressive set of speakers and as far
as tablets and a $250 price range go I'd
have to say it's an unexpected diamond
in the rough for more details check out
my full review i'm dr blanc over sina
and this is been a first look at the
Lenovo yoga
