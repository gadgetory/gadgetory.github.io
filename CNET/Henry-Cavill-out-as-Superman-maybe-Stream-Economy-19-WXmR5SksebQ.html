ridiculous week in Superman news reports
surfaced that Henry Cavill would no
longer Don the cake in the next Man of
Steel movie and the internet exploded
there were think pieces written people
said DC was doomed I mean come down
everybody there's actually a lot of
moving parts to this issue it is not
black and white and I thought we would
break it down they come logical way so
let's start with the recent past they
still made gobs of money at the box
office but Man of Steel Batman V
Superman and Justice League weren't
exactly the movies a lot of fans were
hoping for and honestly I was a little
disappointed in the characterization of
Supes
it's so cynical and I was really looking
forward to a more hopeful less mopey
Superman regardless of any of our
feelings about those movies whether you
love them or hate them here are the
facts earlier this year
Walter Ramada replaced Geoff Johns as
the lead executive for comic book movies
at Warner Brothers Studios so a new boss
as a lot of you might know means a new
vision and if hamada vision doesn't
include Henry Cavill as Superman
well those rumors might be true but on
top of that you got Matt Reeves so Matt
Reeves is the director who took over the
Batman movie from star ben affleck now
Ben Affleck said last year at Comic Con
some not this most recent one but 2017
that he is still thrilled to play the
Caped Crusader but it's been really
quiet on that front o Affleck did help
pen a script for this new Batman movie
and Reeves recently in the last month or
two mentioned the Batman film but didn't
quite say what capacity Ben Affleck
would be participating so it's possible
he also is out now that brings us to
present-day so what's been going on this
week well the rumor mill started going
crazy when reports surfaced that henry
cavill was officially out after the
failure of Justice League there was a
huge corporate reshuffling that's Walter
Hamada and then now they're saying okay
guys cabals out Batman's out we're
completely rethinking a Batman and
Superman back
square one even Mad Men alum Jon Hamm
got into the conversation saying he
wanted to play Batman and that sent the
internet into a tizzy the only official
thing we know about Henry Cavill at this
point is that he is signed on to star as
Geralt in the Netflix Witcher adaptation
which I'm very excited for don't get me
wrong but may not give him enough time
to say I know star and a triple a
blockbuster franchise as Superman now
TMZ though says the rumors are just not
true and that Warner Bros is simply not
developing a Superman movie at this time
a Warner Brothers issued a very similar
statement saying that no current
decisions had been made regarding the
future of Superman which current
decision could mean that they made the
decision a week ago or are going to fire
him in six months so take that with a
grain of salt cavil also posted a weird
cryptic Instagram video with the caption
today was exciting and he raises a
Superman action figure into the frame I
don't know who knows what that means as
of right now Warner Brothers is deeply
focused and prioritizing the Supergirl
movie which is an active development and
that Joaquin Phoenix Joker movie which
starts filming next month now if they're
going to fast track the Supergirl movie
it could mean that Walter Hamada is
looking to sort of maybe soft reboot
Superman through that film but again
there's no concrete evidence this is
we're having a little bit of knowledge
about Hollywood inside baseball comes in
super handy
no pun intended okay so there are rumors
that Henry Cavill has been very unhappy
about his pay playing Superman that
rumor also included allegations he
refused a cameo appearance in the
upcoming Shazam movie because of
contract disputes oftentimes when actors
sign up for these superhero roles it's
not just for one movie they can be three
six or even nine picture deals but if
that franchise is successful it gives
the star some huge bargaining power when
renegotiations are up and if you've been
paying attention
henry cavill has been in that's right
everybody three movies as Superman so
I'm guessing it's time
to pay the piper and by Piper I mean
Superman now this could be this entire
thing could be a rumor leaked by Henry
Cavill team of negotiating agents to be
able to drum up internet outrage and use
it as a kind of leverage to get what he
wants to play Superman again which would
be a superpower move but is actually not
that uncommon in Hollywood so what's the
verdict here honestly I don't know I
think it is perfectly possible that
Henry Cavill could be back as Superman
and I think it is also possible that Ben
Affleck could be back as Batman but at
the end of the day who knows and if you
want my personal take I think both of
them are done and it's really only not
being announced because Warner Brothers
doesn't have a concrete plan in place
and once they do that they'll just say
oh yeah they're leaving because of
conflicts of scheduling or whatever it
is that they want to give as an excuse
and that'll be that honestly though I
would hate to see DC scrapped the
universe it created I did see some
amazing flashes of brilliance in Justice
League even though overall I thought it
was just okay and if cavil gets a
director on board for Man of Steel 2
that harnesses his charm I think we're
off to the races if my prediction holds
true though and they are in fact dunzo
let's do some fan casting you know for
funsies I think for Superman Matt Bomer
is a really great choice look at this
beautiful man he looks just like
Superman and if you want a tall white
bread Wonder Boy look at army hammer
I think he could also be a really great
Superman I asked for Batman
well obviously Jon Hamm would be a very
nice choice for an older Bruce Wayne
maybe a Batman detective film which I
know Matt Reeves was talking about or
and hear me out on this one Internet
let's have Oscar Isaac do it because one
Oscar Isaac is hot and two I think he'd
be a great Bruce Wayne and a great
Batman but I don't know those are my
thoughts I'm dying to know what your
dream fan casts are if they are done
just leave them down in the comments
Henry Cavill you're not going to be
super on any male
good it's cause of the moustache that
miss - I'll think about our miss -
everybody single be imagine being
Superman roll up to the sit and be like
guys I've got a moustache and I've
disliked shave off the miss - Superman
