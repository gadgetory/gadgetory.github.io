tricks that cannot be done on an Apple
watch I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
cnet update if you own a SmartWatch
running Android soon you won't need to
always have your phone by your side to
get alerts google is rolling out a few
updates to Android wear smartwatches one
of which is Wi-Fi support if your
Android watch is connected to a Wi-Fi
network you do not need to have your
phone with you to get notifications send
messages or use apps now for this to
work your phone wherever you left it
needs to be on a nice to have a data
connection so for example let's say
you're at work and your work has Wi-Fi
but you accidentally left your phone at
home the watch can still get messages or
if your gym has Wi-Fi you do not need to
bring your phone with you to stay in
touch with the world that's not
something that Apple watch can do to get
messages on the Apple watch you need to
have your phone with you or the phone at
least needs to be somewhere nearby on
the same Wi-Fi network as your watch
Android watches have picked up a few
other fun tricks if your hands are full
you don't need to touch the screen to
scroll through cards you can just flick
your wrist outward or inward and if you
set your screen to stay on now apps can
also stay on the screen they just turn
black and white wing their idle and
that's helpful if you want to keep your
grocery shopping list on your wrist and
you don't want to keep opening up the
app multiple times android also added a
little feature for emojis if you want to
respond to a text message with an emoji
you can use your finger to draw on the
screen and that means there's some
Android engineer out there that had a
practice drawing poo emojis in various
ways to teach the system poo doodles
what a job the first watch to get these
updates is the LG watch urbane and we
don't know when that model is even
coming out yet but LG is having an event
next week on April twenty-eighth to show
off its next big phone the LG g4 and
maybe we'll also learn when that watch
is going to go on sale and how much
it'll cost and in other software update
news it's not a good day to be the owner
of the wink hub the smart home router
suddenly stopped working for some
customers because the company neglected
to update an expiring security
certificate the hub is like the brain
that controls all the smart
light switches and locks in a home but
this security flaw rendered machines
useless and customers need to tinker
with settings or requests to get a new
hub in the mail Corky which partners
with General Electric promotes its wink
hubs heavily at major retailers like
home depot and target but now all sales
have been suspended until it can fix the
issue smart home systems like the wink
are known for being buggy but this is a
whole other level of bug that's your
