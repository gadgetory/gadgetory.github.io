alright and this is your first year i
believe doing like a formal press
conference press conference yeah for
your products yeah it's one of those
things where you know we've been here
this is our fifth year here so its but
it's great to be back and it's we
dropped a lot of new stuff so we wanted
to have a press conference so we could
show it all off and really show people
the whole ecosystem we're presenting all
right well so tell me about the products
that you showed up I know we covered the
press conference but just a recap so
you've got the MakerBot replicator mini
this is the consumer 3d printer that we
were presenting and it's nice and tidy
but it's got it's no compromise it's got
all it's got a professional you know
MakerBot smart extruder it's got its
network it's just it's got it's a very
powerful machine in it tidy little
packet would you call that the starter
for people who don't have a 3d printer
already yeah this would be a great place
to start getting into 3d printing and
exploring the frontier and then we've
got the MakerBot replicator desktop and
this this 3d printer is for the prosumer
this is the machine that when we
announced it on stage Lockheed Martin
immediately called up and said we need
these for engineers like the replicator
brand has been around for a while this
is the latest generation of it that's
correct and so for people who want a
larger print volume they want to be able
to do a little more stuff get a little
bit more product out of what they're
printing and it's networked as well so
you can either plug a USB stick into the
front or you can connect it to an
Ethernet cable or connected by USB or
you can even connect wirelessly so you
can connect with your phone and actually
all of the machines were presenting have
a camera on the inside of them so unless
we feature right there previously you
didn't have those so you can actually
keep an eye on what your printing you go
get a cup of tea and be like Oh it'll
send you a message you know come get
your come get your 3d model it's done
and and that makes it all so easy to
share on social networks like
thingiverse cuz that's what I would
majan that's probably the thing that
when you're just starting out is the
hardest thing to get around is the
patients because it'd be pretty patient
that for your object to come into the
world right yeah I mean it does have the
effect of like a kid a goldfish bowl and
you're a kitten kind of its spellbinding
watching
you know your idea come to come to life
right in front of your range you know um
one of the big things that when we talk
about 3d printing people go well what do
I need it for I think this year you kind
of really showed what a consumer can get
out of it with with these toys that you
can print can you tell us about the App
Store and and how it works with like all
the toys so we besides three machines
and there's one more we launched a giant
enormous MakerBot replicator z18 that
and but you're you're absolutely right
we decided we were going to just instead
of waiting for people to cross the chasm
to us into figuring out you know we get
a lot of like well what am I going to
get into 3d printing were like you know
what we're just going to make you the
coolest stuff so you want to make it and
we made a grib unch of six different
collections of collectibles and so like
this one here this is a this is a chunky
truck and we made a whole line of a
whole construction set that you can make
so you just go online and pick the toys
you want or pick the whole set and like
how much they cost they started 99 cents
for each one and then 999 for the whole
album or collection and you know my
daughter's already like I want the pets
like okay so it's one of those things
where we made it easy and then we made
content so that you know we realized
like we kind of made the guitars of rock
and roll the rock and roll era but with
the 3d that these are sort of like the
guitars we had to make the music so that
people wanted to play me as I show but
on the other hand though you are having
people still submit their ideas there so
that open community of people were
cement their products there that other
people can take and refine or print out
themselves is that what this guy is or
is this yeah as a call this is this is
epic so our website thingiverse which is
a community of creative people that
people share their designs and this is
the prosthetic hand for kids so normally
prosthetic hands costs like tens of
thousands of dollars when you have a
MakerBot this costs like five dollars
and kids grow out of them like sneakers
so they usually don't get him right but
this the community came up with this
project shared it and now it's been
downloaded more than 50,000 times
and you know I've talked with kids who
were born with an idiotic dancer and
syndrome without any fingers and they
went to their school this one kid Leon
went to a school made a made a robo hand
on it sunday curb out of school and he's
used it to catch touchdowns so it's one
of those things where it's not just for
you know knickknacks these this is used
for things that make a real difference
in people's eyes but I can imagine with
these smaller parts that are involved in
this you could probably get away with
printing this on one of the mini right
it's made to be made on all the 3d
printers for launching that's really
great and so the pricing is the other
interesting factory on the mini you've
actually brought the price down dog
lowest price yet for the entry-level
consumer right yeah this is this is 1375
this one's 2899 and the ginormous one is
64 99 right so when you look at the
build volume the features that you get
its it's an amazing package we also
launched I should mention we launched
three new applications so it's not just
here's three you know 3d printers we
made it easy for people to connect on
their mobile device we made a creative
tool called MakerBot print chocolates
that's for the iPad and then we've got
the MakerBot desktop app where you can
browse thingiverse in the new digital
store right now wasn't also earlier it
was earlier this year you guys talked
about the laser scanner like wasn't that
another announcement relatively recently
that's another part of the whole
MakerBot 3d system and the MakerBot
digitizer is a desktop 3d scanner it you
know a MakerBot takes I think about 3d
printer takes digital designs and make
some physical right the MakerBot
digitizer takes physical things and make
some digital so you can modify them and
grab your the gnome out of your front
yard scan it and add more beard that's
great well breathe thanks so much for
joining us here and showing off to make
a bossa anyone here at CES and is
encouraged to head over to the MakerBot
booth and see what these things can
really do we've got more for you here at
the cnet stage so don't go anywhere
there's a lot more happening today dan
Ackman is going to be back here with the
next wave of the newest laptops here at
CES and at 11am check back here because
i'm going to be launching a brand new
show
called the fix that a whole lot more
happening right now so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
