that was really fundamentally different
the yoga book C 930 from Lenovo is
certainly different will you like the
differences well that's up for debate it
starts with a quick double knock on the
lid to pop it open it's a pretty simple
party trick but everyone I showed it to
was impressed once you open the lid
you'll find one standard LCD touchscreen
and the plates of a keyboard a second
e-ink touchscreen
nope physical keys no touchpad so how do
you type on this thing on the e ink
display a keyboard pops up on demand
complete with a built-in touchpad there
are a few different keyboard layout and
design options including one where the
touchpad appears and disappears as
needed giving you room for larger keys
you can also turn on fake keyboard
clacking sounds and some haptic feedback
but I'm gonna be honest it's really
nothing at all like typing on a real
keyboard after some warming up
I actually got pretty good at using the
on-screen keyboard but the touchpad is
tougher to use it's way too easy to
slide off it and start hitting the
spacebar instead what else can you do
with an e-ink screen well a stylus lets
you sketch or take notes which then can
be copied onto any other Windows app and
you can flip it around into tablet mode
and turn off the LCD making this a giant
eating creature which should keep the
battery going for days and days but if
you're thinking of using the yoga book
as a super premium Kindle reader now
that's where we run into the biggest
roadblock at least for now the eating
display only reads PDF files I asked one
novo if Kindle support was coming and
they were non-committal but said
software and feature updates may be
coming sometime next year for now I
genuinely enjoy testing this very
inventive laptop which dared to break
some norms in to search for something
new and unique but as a whole the eating
keyboard just won't work for most
typists and the lack of kindle support
under cuts would could be the system's
biggest selling point
