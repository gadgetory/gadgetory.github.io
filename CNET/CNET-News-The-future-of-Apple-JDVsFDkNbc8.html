for watching the future of a show where
we spotlight a major company and find
out some of the things that could happen
in the next year right now we're talking
about Apple and who better to discuss
apple with us then staff writer Josh
Lowensohn who covers Apple thanks for
joining us Josh a pleasure let's talk
first about perhaps some new products
that we may see in 2013 what do you
think sure I mean as a consumer company
the first thing everybody thinks of is
things like the iPhone and the iPad
right but of course the big thing
everybody wants to know about is what's
next sure a lot of the rumors are really
pointed to two things some sort of
streaming radio product to compete with
Pandora and a television set mm-hmm
we've heard rumors of TV sets for a long
time though did you sure we actually see
some hardware next year you know there's
two really warring camps one group
really thinks there's gonna be a TV any
other things there's going to be kind of
a more advanced cable box something a
little bit beyond what they're already
doing I'm kind of in that second camp
that thinks that something like a TV set
it's a little bit harder to sell right
off than it would be to do something
that could really replace the cable box
people to have at home and you can see
how a streaming music service would fit
very nicely with itunes yeah exactly it
but in asti that's not really like a
sexy or exciting product sure it's
really to compete more with upstarts
like Pandora RDI Oh Spotify these things
that are really kind of taken the idea
of purchasing music and making it more
of a subscription feature now when we do
talk about existing products you know
the iphone ipad ipod what kind of
changes will we see next year i mean
anything really monumental or just you
know a little tweak here and there i
think to 2013's going to be the year
that week in part because 2012 was so
much of a new product the one thing that
really did not get a big big overhaul
was the ipad we did see the mini though
we did but that's almost a separate
product the big big thing I expect in
2013 is a real kind of redesign of the
ipad we had both third and fourth
generation models this year but it was
basically the ipad 2 with some new
screen technology and some beefed up
specs sure i think they're definitely
improvements to be made in the form
factor that they could push out very
exciting now in 2012 we saw a lot of
leadership changes I imagine that
going to trickle over into the next year
what are your thoughts on on management
sure they really did have a lot of the
big moves last month in November that
really kind of put their executive team
and do three kind of power structures
and three big groups including
technologies and iOS software the big
focus i think is really going to be
tightening that down i don't think we're
going to see a lot of changes in terms
of movement the one big thing to keep an
eye on is who they hire to replace their
outgoing retail chief they haven't
announced anybody yet they're they're on
a search right now I suspect we'll see
something very early next year that kind
of shows who they want to be leading
their retail group and speaking of
leadership we're now what maybe 15
months since the passing of steve jobs
so 2013 will be a full year without him
how is this company going to continue to
move forward without his leadership
without his presence and without his
ideas in the pipeline I guess what do
you see in that in that camper in that
front sure I think a lot of focus has
been on the product pipeline things that
were in in production and ready to go
when Steve was still around I think what
Tim Cook will continue to do and what
Apple even did a little bit for Steve
Jobs came on it was really take a look
at products that needed some improvement
if you look at some of the big hits
they've had including the iPod the iPad
in the iphone it's really been taking
something that someone else has done and
making it better yeah and I don't think
that's going to change all right well a
lot to look forward to definitely Apple
TV sounds exciting yes thank you so much
