CNET and this is the sony alpha SLT a 77
V let's say I enjoyed shooting with the
a 77 more than any other camera since
the Nikon d7000 it's heavy especially
with the sixteen to fifty millimeter kit
lens which by the way has become my
favorite Sony lens but it's weather
sealed and well constructed the grip is
comfortable and it feels well-balanced
and with only a few exceptions it has
the controls in the right places the EVF
is a pleasure to use the cameras packed
full of solid features although it's
still missing a couple of key words and
of course the photo quality and
performance are right where they need to
be for its price class with the bonus of
really nice video the shutter button has
a soft but not mushy feel and it's
really easy to get used to the smooth
list of having no reflex mirror because
the SLT has a fixed mirror so there's no
reflex mirror to bounce while you shoot
almost all the back controls are
reachable via your right thumb but maybe
it's my lack of gaming experience but I
find most joystick navigation controls
on cameras awkward and imprecise to use
that said it's functional and I didn't
find it excessively profanity inducing
the EVF is delightfully large and
magnified compared with its DSLR
competitors and this type of electronic
level readout is the most effective I've
ever used and for the LCD Sony created a
fairly complicated mechanism to enable
the LCD to tilt as well as swivel it's
really useful though I can never quite
get into the position I want fast enough
because of all the different twists and
turns surprisingly the OLED screens are
almost too good well the technology
makes for great TVs because of their
super blacks they make every scene look
higher contrast than it is and saturate
the colors almost sir realistically
that's kind of a negative on a camera
plus the colors on the EVF and LCD don't
match each other
overall the a77 delivers a solid noise
profile for its class and generally
excellent photo and video if you process
raw the camera is good up to ISO 3200
and possibly ISO 6400 depending upon
subject matter the dynamic range is
fairly broad though I experienced more
unrecoverable clipped highlights than I
liked does an excellent job with shadow
detail well while the a77 has an option
for downsized JPEGs
there's no support for medium or small
raw or raw plus JPEG that's a key
feature for a camera in this class for
shooting video the a77 does a great job
at 1080 progressive rendering very nice
tones with no noticeable artifacts like
noiray or rolling shutter attribute part
of the enjoy ability of shooting video
with the camera to the lens the
autofocus works smoothly and quietly but
you can only use autofocus in what's
essentially an automatic mode it's
unavailable in shutter or aperture
priority or manual modes and I'm not
crazy about the automatic gain ISO
sensitivity decisions that the camera
makes in video mode or the fact that it
lacks any audio controls the camera is
not the fastest in its class that honor
remains with the 7d and then even lags
the Nikon d7000 but it does pretty well
considering its processing so much more
image data
the only real performance disappointment
is battery life which is rated at 470
shots and that's without the GPS active
the new autofocus system seems to work
extremely well and I've always liked
Sony's interface for selecting among the
focus areas and the zone focus which
clumps the AF areas in the center left
or right is the only mode I like to use
more than simply just leaving it on
center spot as for features Sony doesn't
provide lots of bells and whistles the
GPS for geo-tagging is probably the
lousiest along with the ability to
register up to eight faces for face
recognition but it has an excellent
subtle set of useful capabilities for
instance you can perform exposure
bracketing in either a continuous burst
or shot by shot with up to a five shot
bracket
it offers plus or minus five stops of
ins exposure compensation as well as
Sony's three shot auto HDR now for
manual focusing it has peaking it's got
some annoying quirks and feature lapses
but it's a fast fluid fun to shoot
camera that delivers excellent photos
and better than competing DSLR video I'm
Laurie grinning and this is
the sony alpha SLT a 70 70</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
