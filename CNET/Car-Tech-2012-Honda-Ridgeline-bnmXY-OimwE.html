it would look like this except Batman
likes to roll seen that style hmm let's
drive the 2012 Honda Ridgeline sport and
check the 10 think of the ridge line is
sort of a lighter footprint version of a
Chevy Avalanche or an Escalade EXT those
of course both v8 trucks that weigh some
1,300 pounds more but the core idea is
there an sut sport utility truck it's
what sets them apart and this one even
further so thanks to its dearth of
gadgetry and cylinders but is that all a
bad thing okay welcome to my high-tech
lair inside the ridgeline Hartley there
is no tech in this car I mean no tech
well unless you call the aux jack tech
that's like having a speedometer in this
day and age and that's about as far as
it goes yeah we got a CD slot there
isn't even Bluetooth available on a
Ridgeline Sport navigation not available
rear camera not available bluetooth
streaming haven't even got Bluetooth
calling are you kidding this is the
lowest tech ride I have ever reviewed
for CNET if you want any of that kind of
technology you've got to go up to what
they call the RTL trim level it's kind
of their luxo version of this thing but
that's another review the sport is real
simple the cabin design is kind of an
interesting handsome but weird mishmash
of round stuff and square stuff it
doesn't appeal to me it doesn't turn me
off everything's big those he can
operate it with your gloves on it's a
good truck thing and there are storage
binnacle 'he's everywhere here's a place
for canned vegetables over there you can
run an adoption center out of this bin
and the last thing I want to call out is
the most charming check it out my 69
Lincoln has a column shifter that's the
last time I handled one it connects to a
one choice only 5-speed automatic and
there's an overdrive lockout button
right here it's a big lockout a drop
ship from five down to three as your max
gear note that you can only get buckets
in the front no bed so that does cut
your max seating capacity
down to five bench in the rear buckets
in the front now back here is evidence
of why you might call the ridge line the
thinking Hillbillies pick up it goes to
way that's a magic gate down that way or
reach down here for the secret lever ah
now here in the engine bay is where the
ridge line further raises the eyebrows
of realtruck people because that motor
as you may notice is transverse-mounted
it's sitting sidesaddle real trucks go
this way 250 horsepower on this car
247 foot-pounds of torque gets this 4500
pound beast up to 60 in about eight
seconds while delivering myth 15 21mpg
through that one choice only five-speed
Automatic now driving a Ridgeline is
definitely a full-size feeling truck
experience it's got that kind of heavily
sprung the suspension that you know is
ready to take on a pretty good payload
note this vehicle does have independent
suspension on all four corners another
very car light trait but to be honest
your f-150s and Silverados and your ram
trucks they've all tuned out that truck
harshness though the markets just too
competitive to ride like a truck even if
you are one power is good not
overwhelming honda says lead the thing
in drive and don't engage anything
unless you really get in trouble an
extremely steep incline or you're just
stuck in a hole or a big mud bog or
something then you would turn on that
variable torque management for lock
button to get some rear locking up to
about 18 miles an hour it's obviously a
low-speed thing this is not like a jeep
where you're gonna be out there doing as
I understand it some really serious
offroading this is more of a vehicle
that can handle things so you don't get
in trouble
okay pricing a Ridgeline sports real
easy just go by it
it's 31,000 delivering you'll probably
pay quite a bit less because typically
they don't sell worth of dams of
discounting is not unheard of in terms
of tech options ha
you can add XM radio for 300 bucks rear
backup sensors for 450 both of those are
dealer installed there are no CNET style
factory options anything like moonroof
nav rear camera bluetooth you have to go
to the RTL trim level</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
