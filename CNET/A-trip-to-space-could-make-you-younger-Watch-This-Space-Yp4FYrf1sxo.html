experiments to work out where the space
travel will kill us all how does the
human body survive in space would your
space to an out live you and what's the
deal with the ending to interstellar I'm
Claire Riley welcome to watch this space
from the CNET studios in sydney this is
your weekly guide to everything on earth
you need to know about space and
tonight's headlines
you're old and you're going to die but
in good news if you travel to space you
might live a fraction longer side
effects of living longer may include
change gastrointestinal bacteria muscle
and bone loss and the crippling
knowledge of what lives in the vast
emptiness of the black abyss as we start
to think long-term about living in space
researchers want to know what effect
space life has on the human body and to
conduct their tests NASA is using the
most terrifying thing known to humankind
twins here to explain our senate's twin
news correspondents and editors at large
Miley and Kylie Riley ladies thanks
Claire she's totally right
so NASA did this like twins study to
like study twins and work out what the
effects of space travel would be on to
like totally identical people one of the
names something really lame like mark
and Scott we're so Scott Kelly lived in
space for a year and he got to like
Instagram from the International Space
Station but then his brother Mark who's
got this total like barista mustache
real Tom Selleck died he had to stay
back home bummer I know it was like
Scott was the Kin and Mark with the
Chloe anyway so when he comes back they
do all these like tests and stuff and it
turns out that Scott the cool space twin
has like totally changed he's got like
more inflammation and like less bone
formation Ottawa yeah and then they
found these changes in his chromosomes
that meant he was going to totally live
forever yeah thanks guys that's mostly
right NASA conducted tests on the twins
telomeres that's the little part at the
end of each chromosome in our DNA the
idea was that mark and Scott should be
pretty similar at the molecular level
twins am i right according to NASA
telomeres get shorter as we age
but after just one year in space Scott
Kelly's telling me is on his white blood
cells actually increased in length that
microscopic change may mean that he
extended his lifespan that is quite
literally some space age after Scott
returned to Earth NASA also revealed
that while 93% of his genes return to
normal after landing the remaining 7%
pointed to quote longer term changes in
genes relating to things like his immune
system DNA repair and bone formation 7%
isn't a huge difference but just like
when your smug brother got back from his
first trip around Europe Scott will be
able to tell mark that spaceflight
literally changed him
so space changes your bones your DNA and
your age and if my reading of that
Wikipedia article on Einstein's special
theory of relativity and the twin
paradox is correct then Scott Kelly is a
Time Lord who is both older and younger
than his twin brother I think said how
interstellar works can someone just
explain interstellar to me I just don't
understand it what we do know is that
because of an effect called time
dilation astronauts who spend time in
space actually aged less than people on
earth after six months on the
International Space Station for example
you'll be zero point zero zero zero
seven seconds younger than your chump
friends here on earth when I want to
care for my skin only space travel will
do the ISS because you're worth it
but it's not just twins who are teaching
us about aging in space we're also
learning a thing or two from worms space
worms researchers send worms to space
for all sorts of reasons for a holiday
to put them in tiny space helmets but
most importantly to track how their
cells genes and muscles change after
traveling to space in September 2018 UK
scientists sent hundreds of space worms
up to the ISS to study how space flight
contributes to muscle loss to learn more
about long-term human space travel sorry
to all those worms who are no doubt
getting swole for next summer but
according to tests at the ISS astronauts
can lose up to 40% of their muscle mass
after just six months in space and it's
not just muscle loss that astronauts
have to contend with there's the
psychological effects of living in
isolation and confined spaces with this
same people for months on end there's
the grim diet of freeze-dried foods and
without gravity astronauts living that
hashtag weightless life experience bone
density loss of 1% per month if we want
to live long-term in space or do three
year missions to Mars we're gonna have
to work on that if we don't want our
astronauts to be withered husks of
humanity floating around the great void
of space so what does this mean for our
totally real twins here in the watch
this face to do why don't we check in so
I lived in space and had to eat
freeze-dried foods that were totally not
Kido vegan and watch my bones disappear
I mean yeah I'm still like young and
datable but my skeleton is like a jungle
gym
life in space was hard you don't know
how lucky you had it I was forced to
live here on earth with its climate
change and its nuclear fallout that I'm
now old and wither that I might as well
be dead so there you have it space might
stop you from aging but you'll probably
still die while you're up there alright
that's it for this week's episode of
watch this space if you enjoyed our
program then make sure you click like on
your remote and subscribe for more space
news as it happens I'm Kylie rot I'm
Claire Riley for CNET goodnight and
Godspeed
so my momma man maybe she's born with it
maybe it's peeing in a bag on the
International Space Station listen honey
I didn't spend 14 years working the
craps tables on Fremont Street to have
to come here and listen to your space
junk those crab claws from the buffet
that is real vodka</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
