right now can't mess with you Hanako is
a software technology business that
builds smart systems for people who want
to maintain their independence as they
live their life into the later years
this is Amelia she's 82 and like most
seniors she values her independence so
our purpose is to really blend into the
existing home we do that with some of
the same components you might find in an
alarm system motion detectors flood
sensors fire alarms things that you that
you would normally expect to be in the
home
Amelia loves her home in Columbia
Tennessee which is 500 miles from her
daughter Allison the distance is
challenging but the smart home tech that
honey Co installed makes it easier for
Amelia to stay in the house that she's
had for so long I just like the location
of it it's close to grocery stores and
schools and whatever I need every single
day it shows you from 1:10 to present
where we've been five minutes here seven
minutes there so it's really easy to see
that she's moving around I always have
my cell phone with me so it's easy for
me to check on my mom no matter what
time of day or night it is
I have a lot of members here it's it's
more like home than any place I've ever
lived</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
