for Apple and the proof is in the hires
according to a report from Bloomberg the
Cupertino giant has assembled a team of
AR all-stars and engineers from
companies including Microsoft Facebook
and Dolby and this is by no means the
first indication that Apple is planning
to enter the AR space they're hiring
optical lens engineers 3d animation
experts and acquiring technology from a
are related startups even Tim Cook has
hinted at the possibility there's
virtual reality and there's augmented
reality both of these are incredibly
interesting but my own view is that
augmented reality is the larger of the
two unlike virtual reality which
promises to fully immerse goggle wearing
users in a virtual world AR allows you
to interact with the real world by
overlaying virtual images and data and
if the reports are true we could see the
fruits of these efforts before the end
of the year a report in February
suggests that the next iPhone could
debut augmented reality features similar
to what Google is already doing with its
tango enabled phones and it could extend
well beyond the iPhone Apple is also
rumored to be working on its own hollow
link like a our eyewear with German
optics manufacturer Carl Zeiss the
glasses could be announced before the
end of the year but likely won't be
ready until much later what we do know
is that at this point Apple is late to
the AR game tango enabled asus and
lenovo phones are already available and
microsoft has a two year head start with
its headset</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
