issues people had with the cult favorite
12-inch MacBook but before you ask yes
it still got just that one USB C port
the new feature I'm actually most
excited about is a revamped keyboard it
looks the same still very flat but
underneath is an improved butterfly
mechanism that really makes a difference
for a lot of people the old keyboard
just never felt right it was a
deal-breaker now the keys have a real
solid click and snap that was missing
before you also get newer CPUs including
Intel Core i5 and core i7 options for
the first time but before you get too
excited about that these are why series
processes which means they're pretty
much all about saving battery power over
actual performance still the MacBook is
fast enough for everyday stuff like
writing video streaming and web surfing
I feel safe calling it a mainstream
machine now it's not as updated as we'd
like you're still stuck with a not great
low res webcam there's still just that
single USB C port for all of your power
and connectivity needs and it still
starts at a hefty $12.99 that's why I
call this a cult favorite laptop it's
not for everybody but if you're the
right audience always on the go looking
for great battery life and great design
it's probably going to be one of your
favorites too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
