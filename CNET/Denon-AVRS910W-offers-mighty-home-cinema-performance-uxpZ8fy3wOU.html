receiver down is one of the brands to
turn to and it's do a VRS 910 W doesn't
disappoint when it comes to movie
thrills this is a seven channel receiver
which can also turn its hand to Dolby
Atmos or DTS X and it offers better
movie replay than the equivalent Onkyo
receiver it has all of the features
you'd want like bluetooth Wi-Fi and
Spotify connect plus it has convenient
input shortcuts on the front panel
however it doesn't have the company's
heroes multi room capability but you
can't control it with the den on smart
phone app design wise it looks like a
receiver and it does come with a
readable blue LED display it includes
eight HDMI ports as well as support for
HDMI standard 2.0 and the latest 4k
version the remote that comes with it is
attractive and well laid out and its
design is kind of stolen from its sister
company Marantz well it has a lot of
music features it performs at its best
with movies and it has more guts than
the onkyo TX NR 6 for 6 at the same
price the sound is open and very dynamic
it doesn't cope as well with music
though or with brighter sounding
speakers and so if you want something
that is more flexible than trying maybe
a Sony Onkyo or Marantz for around 580
dollars it is a very robust and
enjoyable receiver for home theater fans
