batteries in the news lately but it
probably wasn't good news cell phone
batteries have exploded on airplanes and
at least two houses have burned down
because of hoverboards catching on fire
am i onyx is looking to change all of
that though with its safe core battery
technology we're here in Carlsbad
California checking out their claim that
you can shoot a bullet into this battery
without it exploding
boom when a lithium-ion battery goes up
in flames
it can happen fast the temperature can
hit several hundred degrees Celsius in a
fraction of a second that's because most
lithium-ion batteries contain a
flammable liquid electrolyte and only a
thin plastic separator to keep the
positive and negative sides of the
battery from touching if you crush
puncture or overcharge a battery the
positive and negative sides can come
into contact creating a spark of
electricity that sets the whole battery
of flame
but now watch this safe core lithium-ion
battery get abused the exact same way
stab crunch no reaction and yes before
you ask we did check that both sets of
batteries were fully charged after
seeing how standard lithium ion
batteries fare under stress testing
you're probably a little concerned about
carrying one of these in your back
pocket on the other hand these are safe
course lithium ion batteries you can see
I'm holding them in my hands something I
definitely can't do with those exploded
lithium ions how is this possible
a me onyx has a secret sauce literally
this black gunk is what keeps safe cores
batteries from exploding a me onyx won't
share the formula but it's a material
designed to separate at a hundred
degrees Celsius before the battery can
explode the material detaches creating a
physical gap like a fuse that keeps
electricity from flowing fast enough to
totally destroy the cell which means
your battery gets warm instead of
exploding I think we can all agree
that's better and because the secret is
a special goop you can spoon on to
existing battery parts no need to buy
new battery making machines a me onyx
believes the entire lithium-ion battery
industry could be up and running in
months not years and they think save
core batteries Michael places we've been
reluctant to put lithium ion batteries
before like all-electric airplanes home
energy storage or even inside your body
because you'd want those batteries to be
pretty much bulletproof right
speaking of which that's a battery with
safe core and that's one without
we've smashed them we punctured them
we've even put some bullet holes through
them and still no fire
we don't know when or where safe core
batteries might show up first but if
someone were to give me an option I know
which one I'd want in my cell phone
this one not the exploding one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
