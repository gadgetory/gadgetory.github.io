phone lasted an entire day on a single
charge but what if it lasted two days
that's the promise of the LG X power to
a mid-range phone with a monster battery
we're talking about 15 hours of
continuous video playback you'd think
that means the phone would take a long
time to power up but with quick charging
it should charge 50% of the way in one
hour and charge fully in - besides that
the X power 2 has a 5.5 inch screen and
a 13 megapixel camera that has the usual
HDR mode and some effects up front you
have a 5 megapixel camera for all of
those selfies it does run Android
nougats 7.0 which is the current
software and that's a good thing however
the mid-range processor means you
probably won't get blistering
performance speeds the phone feels a lot
lighter and thinner than you might
expect for such a large device and it
doesn't have the same premium look and
feel as the LG G 6 but I still think
that's a fair trade-off for a phone
that's going to cost a fraction of the
price
at the end of the day LG is going to
hope that affordable long lasting
battery life is more important to you
than cutting-edge camera tech and the
fastest processor around look for the LG
X power 2 to start selling globally this
