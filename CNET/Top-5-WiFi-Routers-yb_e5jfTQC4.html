quite as excited about a wireless router
as you do a smartphone or a tablet do ya
but that's the point if you get a good
router it's boring in the best way easy
to set up and then it just works yes
there are such things in tech I'm Brian
Cooley with the top five wireless
routers
according to C net review scores number
five is the trend net te W 692 G ro
they've all got sexy names this guy has
the much-desired 450 megabit speed on
both the 2.4 and 5 gigahertz bands
you've been studying though it works
better on the 5 gigahertz side it also
has Gigabit Ethernet ports on the back
for the wired connections and an
easy-to-use web interface to set this
thing up now it's a little dated in that
it lacks support for IP version 6 or for
storage or for print server abilities
all those kind of bells and whistles but
at 120 bucks street price it's also
about the cheapest on our list number
four is the Netgear wnd r 3800 and 600
great wireless speed even though it
doesn't have that latest for 50 megabits
technology and its range is really good
too a lot of folks write us with
problems in that area it's got dual band
2.4 and 5 gigahertz ipv6 which is great
future proofing parental controls that's
interesting and cloud-based storage
support though it's performance when you
attach a USB hard drive to it for
storage on the network is a little weak
but the price isn't bad at 1:29 Street
number three is the Linksys efore T 200
maximum performance that's laying quite
a claim luckily this guy pays off it's
got the 4 50 megabits technology when
you're connecting to 5 gigahertz band
devices but not for 2.4 gigahertz
it's got gigabit ethernet ports on the
back the fastest wired connections and
it has really good wireless throughput
as they call it and range it'll reach
your house pretty well it also functions
well as a network attached storage
device when you plug in a drive it does
have a limit of 10 guest users at a time
though and it's got this clunky
all wort power adapter so prepare to
also go to Etsy for a little felted cozy
to hide that part about 155 Street
number two is svelte and stylish and yes
I'm still talking about routers it's the
asou RT and 56 you if you've got to
install your router somewhere around
your place where it's going to show this
could be the one for you because folks
won't come over and say wow loser you
got this gear all over your place
stellar is the word we also use to
describe its wireless speed and its
reach especially when it's on the 5
gigahertz band it's USB ports do a
really good job of turning an attached
Drive into network and/or cloud storage
and it even creates a cool on-screen map
of all your network assets neat to look
at and makes it easy to figure things
out about 124th Street prize number one
may sound like there's an echo in this
piece but there's not it's the Cisco
4200 but version 2 and 900 model the
latest version of our number 3 router it
actually rates slightly below the asou
sigh just talked about but that's
because this guy is so new the bar has
been raised our router King don't know
tells me this is the one he'd buy for
his place that should tell you something
it's got dual band concurrent for 50
megabits radios gigabit ethernet ports
excellent storage support and really hot
throughput especially when connecting to
5 gigahertz devices
it also looks kind of good but it's a
priciest at almost 200 bucks tree price
now if you need help understanding all
these specs we went through when it
comes to buying a wireless router check
