Moto X pure edition or Moto X style as
it's known globally features its
signature customizable design along with
a few new interesting upgrades for one
thing the display is bigger not as big
as the six-inch Google Nexus 6 which is
also by motorola but the screen has
jumped from a 5.2 inch 1080p display to
a 5.7 inch 1440p display unlike its
previous models the device also has a
microSD card slot so you can expand its
storage up to 128 gigs on top of the 16
32 or 64 gigs of internal memory it
already comes with camera specs have
been bumped up to 21 megapixels on the
back in addition to still being able to
shoot 4k videos there is now a night
mode for snapping pics in low-light
situations the 5 megapixel front-facing
shooter also has a wide angle lens and a
flash to brighten up all those selfies
inside is a 1.8 giga hertz hexa core
snapdragon 808 processor from Qualcomm
and three gigs of RAM there's also a 3
ampere our non removable battery that
can deplete quite quickly with heavy
usage during our preliminary test for
continuous video playback it lasted just
under nine hours in some markets however
the Moto X does come with a 25 watt fast
charging turbo charger from a completely
drained battery it'll take only about an
hour and 15 minutes to reach a hundred
percent the phone ships with android 5.1
point one and unlike what the name
suggests it doesn't exactly deliver the
purest android experience
Google's Nexus wine but it does come
pretty close there's no heavy-handed
manufacturer user interface just Google
Apps and motorola's familiar software
suite that includes gesture actions like
flicking the risk to onto the camera and
moto display which simplifies accessing
your notifications while your phone is
asleep mota voice carries out voice
commands like sending a text or looking
up info on the web finally there's moto
assist which adjusts your phone setting
depending on what you're doing and where
you are as I mentioned before you can
customize the Moto X with different
storage options accent colors and back
plates that come in leather wood or
bamboo unlike its cheaper Moto G
counterpart that came out this year it's
not submergible underwater it is
supposedly water repellent though so you
don't have to worry about a few droplets
of water here and there the device
starts at four hundred dollars unlocked
and it works on carriers that operate on
either the gsm or cdma standard that
means you could buy it and make calls or
browse the web on 18 t Verizon t-mobile
or sprint network again I'm Lynn and you
