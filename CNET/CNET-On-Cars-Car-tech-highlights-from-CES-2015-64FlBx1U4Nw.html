over the years but they're trying to fix
that now here's a giant mock-up of
what's in that the VW Golf R Touch
notice at the top is about a twelve
point eight inch master screen with most
of your information display below it
would be about an 8 inch touch panel
we're mostly virtual controls we'll go
this is not unlike what Honda and Acura
are doing with two screens one larger
one smaller but a very different flavor
and this lower panel by the way is
indicative of how VW is trying to move
to get rid of all switches and rotary
knobs in the car those physical tactile
controls from the old days if you will
it's debatable whether an all touch
interface is better worse just a lateral
perhaps from the traditional knobs and
switches also here and related to this
we're looking for who's going to install
carplay Android auto and mirror link
mirror links more of a dark horse but
Volkswagen here talking about moving
forward with mirror link which not a lot
of other car makers are doing that
addition to all those touchscreen
innovations that VW is showing is also a
new idea of controlling interface not by
touch but by gesture this has been tried
in the auto industry a couple times
we've seen it here at CES before it
keeps getting better and we're getting
to the point where it seems to be
nuanced enough look how this works
there's a sensor here right behind the
gearshift that will pick up my hand the
home position to go into gesture mode is
to hold your hand there open and it'll
recognize open fingers and then you've
just got five simple gestures not a lot
of complicated things you're not going
to do typing of text in the air or
anything you have a left a right you can
push down you can select with your
finger like you might imagine clicking
on a mouse now this is not replacing all
the gestures in a car it's primarily for
the more coarse ones and the ones that
are very commonly used volume change
climate change zoom in and out of a map
or go back and forth in a menu to select
something on his own now this is not set
for production any time soon but we're
starting to see how Volkswagen is
starting to really think differently
about how they do their interface
you may recall that when GM first
brought up built-in 4G through OnStar I
was kind of disappointed it was mostly a
hot spot in your car service but I don't
find that interesting now it's getting
more interesting unique custom built-in
services in the car powered by 4G in
this case here's one called OnStar at
your service based on where you are or
where you're programmed to go in the nav
rig they're going to come up with offers
that supposedly are going to be smart
based on where you're going and also
based on your interests they're playing
my tune they're showing a demo here of
Dunkin Donuts coupons popping up I'm in
they would also work with RetailMeNot
the big online coupon discount site to
bring those offers in based on where you
are and where you're going you can also
book a hotel at the last minute while
you're driving along through Priceline
so in that case you do get an operator
involved now the Devils in the details
of course how well this is elegantly
executed how well it's customized to
what I'm really doing and not just
nagging me we'll see when this hits the
market how well they've worked those
nuances let me also show you how they
want to use 4G to make you a better
driver
this one's called smart driver
assessment what this does is utilize the
4G connection in the car to harvest all
kinds of data points about how you drive
and do so for a long time 90 days is the
snapshot they take that's not even a
snapshot that's a big look that is cloud
service processed by OnStar and after 90
full days of you allowing the service to
see how you drive then they send you a
report they email it to you as well as
giving you tips along the way through
the vehicles interface how you could
drive better it could be braking
steering accelerator behavior the way
you travel at a certain speed in certain
zone that's one part then if you agree
to and only your permission they can
upload that to at this point one
insurance company to qualify you for
insurance discount now this is getting
into the area of pay as you drive or
usage based insurance you don't need a
4G connection for that a lot of the
insurance companies will give you a
little wireless dongle that goes into
your obd2 port but this is making it
more integrated into the vehicle and
using the 4g to a cloud service to
really crunch a lot of data about how
you drive not just some nuggets
consumers were wary of pay as you drive
a few years ago but the trends have been
getting pretty healthy a lot of folks
say you know what fine get a meaningful
discount I'm willing to let it happen
now let's talk about something
interesting on carplay and android auto
now here at Hyundai they're doing
something a little different as they
roll out toward getting it in showrooms
with most car makers you buy a car that
already has nabbed an elaborate media
and all of that and then you add car
player Android Auto to it and you've got
some duplication you feel like maybe
you're paying for more than you need
Hyundai's got an interesting strategy
they've announced here starting in their
16 model year cars they're going to have
this fairly basic display audio system
here they're trying to thin it down and
bring the cost down if you don't have a
phone plugged in it's pretty basic AM FM
Bluetooth streaming and calling and
that's really the all the bells and
whistles but then when you plug in your
smartphone Android or iOS it pulls up
car player Android auto and brings in
all that incredible richness you didn't
buy it two or three times those
functions are only coming from your
phone so you're really leveraging the
services and connections of your phone
in a less duplicate of way and not
redundant with what the car maker has in
there as well it's kind of very
efficient and elegant this allows them
to move it to a lower price point they
think is going to apply this 60 plus
percent of their sales volume in the 16
model year we got to wait a little while
for this one
in the meantime by mid 2015 Hyundai will
roll out carplay and android auto but
stacked on top of head units that
already have their nav and apps
now here at CES Tim Stevens and I just
hosted a really good next big thing
panel on virtual and augmented reality
and one of the areas where I'm most
excited about AR augmented reality is
coming up in cars especially in these
head-up displays that are getting very
popular this one doesn't just show you
information statically on the windshield
or through the windshield it puts it in
context on the road let me tell you what
I'm seeing here there's a warning about
a car that just crossed my path and the
warning follow of the car as I go along
now I'm getting indication about lane
drift and it's putting a colored line
right on the lane where I'm drifting
there's a traffic signal right in front
of me perhaps I didn't look up and see
the traffic signal it's put it right in
front of me so I don't miss the red
lights and here comes a car cutting me
off rat-bastard
and the vehicle showed me the corner of
the car to really emphasize that's where
the impact point might be coming here is
a navigation prompt showing me what exit
to take and it's kind of like that
fidelity advertisement it's putting in
this case a blue line on the road then
none of this is coming to production
tomorrow this is pretty elaborate stuff
in terms of projection technology and of
course making sure the data is right so
it's not giving you any false cues that
matters when you're on the road but I'm
glad to see a are coming to cars I can
barely think of a place where it matters
more
BMW's showed new ways to use laser
headlights
aside from reaching 1800 feet they can
elaborately beam shape so you can stay
on high beam while making cutouts in the
projection to avoid oncoming drivers
these lights can work with the nav
system to spill light out where the car
is going next
even before the wheel turns they can
work with the driver assist cameras to
call out pedestrians and animals on the
side of the road by lighting them and
BMW show tail lights that use OLED
technology for extreme flexibility of
the light itself but also flexibility in
the pattern by which it illuminates even
if this tech were ready today though
u.s. regulations lagged far behind it in
terms of approval</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
