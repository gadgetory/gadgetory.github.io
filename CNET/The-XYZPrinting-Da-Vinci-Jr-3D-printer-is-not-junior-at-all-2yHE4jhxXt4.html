Debbie NC jr. 3d printer from XYZ
printing now jr. for two reason number
one it is small
you better believe me because I look at
a big here but trust me on the inside it
is small the secondly because it is the
least expensive on the market right now
costing just three hundred and fifty
dollars now that's a huge deal because
most other three printer costs up to
thousands of dollars and actually do not
have anything better to offer than this
one but okay let's go back to the small
part because I know you've been hanging
on it well despite how big it is on the
inside the printer has a very modest
print platform and can print the object
as big as 5.9 inches in one dimension
now this is five point nine inches it's
more than it basically with this printer
here you can print the hook as big as
this and that is my main complaint about
this printer here it cannot bring large
3d object of course you can always bring
small pieces and then glue it together
to make a larger one but that's
different story and speaking of glue all
the like of which that is my second and
minor complaint about this printer here
the print platform is very slippery
and the preacher comes with three pieces
of this bad tape right here to cover it
to create fiction to hold the object
being built for moving around but didn't
work very well my testing and sometimes
the object actually slide causing the
print to fail like this one right here
and see that or even this one right here
physical it's a print as it oh now is
quite easy to fix
I just lays a thin layer of glue on top
of the print platform and that would fix
it now note that the glue here is not
included I just happen to have some
handy but you can always get your own
like other 3d printer from XYZ proving
them junior here uses XYZ proprietary
filament spool now the spool here looked
like any other spool but it come with a
chip on the inside
I and communicate with the printer using
near field communication or NFC
basically the spoons have the printer
what type of film it is how much left
and what color it is we do have to
manually input the information so it
makes your life easier
the bad news is you cannot buy cheaper
third-party generic filmin to you with
this printer basically each of the spool
has enough filming for you to bring
about half a dozen of these hogs or
maybe ten of these groups here now while
I light the most about the printer here
is the fact that is very easy to use
after box is required no calibration and
that means it works just like any other
regular inkjet or laser printer you can
print directly from a computer using
very easy to you xyzware software you
can also print from an SD card using the
screen here with these navigation
buttons now from on this one here check
out my full review as cnet.com basically
this compact small printer here is a
huge deal in 3d printing the kind of
huge that I can relate to and improve
and that's because I'm dumb knowing this
has been the first look as the da vinci
jr. 3d printer from XYZ printing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
