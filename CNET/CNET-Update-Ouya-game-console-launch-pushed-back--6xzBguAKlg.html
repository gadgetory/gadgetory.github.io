ooh yeah I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your CNET update the video game startup
ooh yeah has pushed back the launch date
of its console system until June 25th
which is three weeks later than when it
was originally supposed to ship the Ouya
is an Android based game system for the
living room that costs $99 and all games
are downloadable and free to try the
company says the launch is delayed
because it needs more time to meet high
retail demand and via CEO also said the
company is making adjustments to improve
the controller the Ouya will be sold at
Amazon Best Buy Game Stop and Target but
it's already been shipping devices to
people who funded its original
development through Kickstarter
donations technology has enriched our
lives in so many ways and now thanks to
an invention at Huggies babies can send
a tweet when they have peed in their
diapers yes this is happening
Huggies tweet P is a system with a
sensor that attaches to the baby's
diaper and when it's time to change the
unit will alert mom and dad with a tweet
and you can retweet it to let all your
followers know that your baby made a
hashtag tinkle right now it's only being
promoted in Brazil but perhaps someday
it'll come to the US so we can bless all
of our followers with peepee tweets
there's another great invention this
time from South Africa the company has
invented a way to deliver a beer to you
by a helicopter drone during the South
African oppe copy music festival this
August the OP eCopy
beer drone will be loaded with beer and
flown over festival goers arriving at
the GPS location of anyone who orders a
cold one from the mobile app the beer is
dropped by parachute and reloaded at a
nearby station because it's so new it's
just a promotion right now because it
would be tragic to pay for a beer and
have it accidentally delivered to the
wrong person in the Battle of photo apps
with trendy filters Instagram won the
popularity contest leaving Hipstamatic
in the dust
even though Hipstamatic has more filters
and camera effects
it's just that Instagram grew faster
because it had a social component but
Hipstamatic is still hanging on and now
is trying a new social networking tactic
Hipstamatic is
launching a spin-off app called ogle for
iOS and it's trying to market itself as
a network that's more than the bathroom
selfie but rather for more serious
photographers that are passionate about
photo art and just like before users can
still share their photos with other
networks like Facebook Twitter Flickr
Foursquare and even Instagram photo
nerds can request an invitation at ogle
comm it's free but to get all the lens
and film options it requires a
subscription of $1 a month or $10 for a
year that's your tech news update you
