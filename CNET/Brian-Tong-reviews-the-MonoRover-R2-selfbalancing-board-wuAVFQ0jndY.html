street you're wondering what are they
they call them like self balancing
boards sometimes they're like a
hoverboard or even a Segway without arms
this is the mono rover - and this is a
self balancing board now this is a solid
piece of equipment it weighs 22 pounds
the speed that it can go up to is
approximately 10 kilometres per hour
that's about 6.2 miles per hour the
distance it covers with one charge is
around 6 to 12 miles but this is all
kind of the rage right now you see
celebrities hanging out with these just
kind of moving around and I kind of
wanted to show you what this is all
about do you want to try do you just
want to try that yeah yeah I know you do
feel too much weight to the back it's
gonna go back let me give a shot there
we go okay okay
good good good it's almost exactly like
snowboarding it's all on your toes and
your heels I'm gonna come over here and
this is the weird jet I think okay look
sugar head on my Debbie Helen look at me
just look at me there you go good okay
now try and we need a little for like on
your tippy toes
there you go there you go there you go
all right the most unnatural thing I've
ever done
now check these things out you'll see a
lot of them on the internet on eBay they
really start ranging around four hundred
dollars to as high as fifteen hundred
dollars that was the original funky
enough that you first saw this star
topping around six hundred dollars
retail and let me be honest it's not the
easiest thing to get on but once you get
in there look you're gonna start
grooving like this here we go oh right
over there alright now you all can see
we're here outside outdoors it can
handle the road although it's gonna be a
lot more of a bumpy ride so you have to
be careful about that it can also handle
the concrete sidewalk real thin carpet
but it's not made for grass I mean come
on look at this thing how cool is this
is real cool so there you go guys check
this out this one's called the monorover
r2 there's a lot of them out there but
this is quite honestly the hottest the
funnest the coolest tech toy that we've
seen in the past couple years</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
