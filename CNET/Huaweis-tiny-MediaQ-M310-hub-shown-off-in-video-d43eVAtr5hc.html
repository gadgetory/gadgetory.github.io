Congress 2013 we're taking a look at the
huawei media qm3 ten so what is this
tiny mystery box well it's actually a
media hub inside it there's a quad-core
processor that's the same processor
that's running inside well ways ascend
p2 smartphone has just been announced
that's backed up by one gigabyte of RAM
as well it's got Wi-Fi it's got
bluetooth and it's got HDMI inputs and
output which means as well as simply
hooking it up to your television you
could hook up your existing set-top box
to this box and then have that going to
your television so it can act as a
middleman for those services believe it
or not inside this tiny gadget of 32
gigabytes of storage but if that's not
enough for you there's a micro SD card
slot on the side as well so you can
expand that so at the moment it's still
not exactly clear how this is going to
work but it's running a modified version
of Android you can see it's got this
software running on as television at the
moment you could do things like put
videos or photos onto the big screen and
I've also seen some tablet mirroring so
if you've got an Android tablet or
smartphone you could connect it to this
box which is then connected to your
television and have your tablets display
up on the big screen and because it's so
small you can even stick it to the back
of your TV so it's quite discreet while
they told me it's going to be coming out
around May or June time hopefully before
then we'll get to see a few more
services and apps that work with this
box so we get a clear idea of exactly
what we can use it for Huawei is also
cooking up this little dongle which is
called the media QM 210 this has a
single core processor slightly less ram
and only one HDMI port so you could plug
this into your TV you couldn't plug
anything else into it some songs also
cooking up its own media hub that
connects to your TV which goes
head-to-head with Apple TV so there's
quite a lot happening in this sector of
Technology so some things to keep an eye
out for this year I'm the West reg the
cenotes and this is Huawei's media qm3
