leave me and this is rumor has it the
show where we round up the week's
biggest tech irma and then we vote on
what sounds legit and what seems like
it'll never ever happen and don't forget
that you guys can vote with us keep your
eyes peeled for the pole in the
interactive player if you're watching on
Sina in an attempt to deflect from its
plummeting stock price Facebook is said
to be prepping a native Android app that
doesn't use html5 it released a native
iOS app for idevices back in September
and everyone loves it so this seems
pretty obvious as Zuckerberg even
admitted himself that html5 facebook app
was a huge mistake probably we will look
back on saying and that is one of the
biggest mistakes if not the biggest
strategic mistake that we made but we're
coming out of that it's about time
native code will help me stock my
friends pictures much faster next up we
have a rumor about Sony's possible next
flagship phone sony is the company with
the Xperia line of phones that are
always accompanied by an alphabet soup
of letters sony xperia s LT and the
latest one the TL which james bond will
use in the next film Skyfall sonia's
maybe getting rid of the alphabet soup
however at least according to
information first noticed by blog of
mobile kidding the company is supposedly
prepping a c6 50 X smartphone under the
code name of Odin by the power of Odin I
declare this phone dead on arrival all
we really know is that it'll have
android 4.1 jelly bean duh maybe one of
the Avengers will use it in their next
film get it like thor odin i already
went there next up the verge has hands
on photos of the boxee TV a device that
aims to combine over the air live TV
broadcasts DVR functionality and web
apps into a single home theater solution
this is my dream come true seriously as
a cable cutter this is going to change
my life where was this last week when I
needed to rewind the over-the-air
broadcast of the debate to see if he had
really said he was going to kill big
bird the current boxee box requires a
separately sold dongle to watch live TV
but the new box has a TV tuner an
external antenna is also said to be
included and the new hardware will
provide similar network streaming
abilities
to those found in the present model so
you can still watch all your ripped
homeland or whatever it is you love it I
don't care if this thing delivers bags
of money to my doorstep if it doesn't
have top chef on bravo then I'm out but
see it's a cost-benefit analysis I also
watch top chef but I buy it on Amazon
and even doing that I still save money
from paying a monthly cable bill right
but you watch it a day late and you're a
dollar short but see I'm not a dollar
short I got cash money in my pocket what
do you guys think is this the cable
cutting dream come true we've been
waiting for don't forget to vote well we
go ask the people of San Francisco what
they think no so there's this box that's
coming out supposedly it's a rumor that
will provide over-the-air broadcasts and
you can also DVR those shows with that
make you interested in cutting the cord
absolutely yes one quick question do you
know who honey boo boo is no all right
first of all do you have cable TV yes I
didn't would you ever consider getting
rid of it and just going cable cutter
free show okay one more question do you
know who honey boo boo is no good you're
better man for it do you have cable TV
no sorry item how do you watch TV on the
internet or do you watch TV at all
sometimes I watch it a TV program online
for me I don't have to pay for cable TV
oh yeah so you're not interested in TV
off to watch out like a TV program
online yeah now one more question do you
know who honey boo boo is I know how do
you move do you have a cable
subscription yes I do have you
considered becoming a cable cutter know
who would want to be a cable cutter so
most of the people on the street with
cable didn't seem willing to part with
it at all but a lot of them also didn't
know who honey boo boo was let's go
upstairs and see what the cnet council
thinks the cnet council's compose 25
editors who cast their votes anonymously
their opinions are not an endorsement by
cnet or CBS interactive obviously
because these are rumors folk
and the cnet councils verdict is
unanimous knows Wow our cnet editors
really do not think that DVR
over-the-air network television is the
killer cable cutter feature that could
lurk able addicts like you away from
your monthly bills Emily they can't live
without access to honey boo boo I don't
even know who honey boo boo is and I'm
proud our comment of the week comes from
rude who writes about the ipad mini if
all these rumors turn out to be accurate
then I'm convinced that Apple can no
longer keep its development project
secret kind of takes away from Apple's
magical and unexpected grand reveals
