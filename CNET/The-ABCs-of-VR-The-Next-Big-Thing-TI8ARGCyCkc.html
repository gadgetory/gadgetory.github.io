it a lot lately and will continue to it
is topic number one of 2016 but when I
say the word you probably imagine
head-mounted display the goggles if you
will that you wear that's almost a
detail in VR where VR hits the road is
in how you craft the media and that's
also where it gets messy now at a
minimum virtual reality is surround
video a whole bowl if you will a video
all the way around you on that head
mounted display not displayed on a flat
web page like on YouTube the next step
that many insist on for the VR label is
that you'll be able to move within the
scene now movement comes in two
different flavors you can move smoothly
wherever you like in some cases that's
more of a video game motif other times a
video production may only allow you to
choose a few different points of view
you can jump around two or that it takes
you to the next layer that some believes
essential to VR is movement of your
limbs can your arms and hands be
registered by the VR hardware so that
you can interact with and manipulate
objects in the virtual environment that
of course is much more like reality now
those who are developing be our hardware
be our content and VR messaging for
brands and media companies have somewhat
different agendas as a result the
definitions are not that clean right now
and therein lies job one creating within
the industry a rock-solid definition of
what VR is kind of like HDTV then
communicating that to consumers who
really don't know what this term means
and thirdly keeping it all distinct from
augmented reality which unfortunately is
bubbling up at about the same time it's
gonna be a busy couple of years in
visual town
