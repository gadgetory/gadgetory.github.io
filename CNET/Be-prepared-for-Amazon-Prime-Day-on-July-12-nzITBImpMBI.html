you care I guess I mean prime day 2015
wasn't exactly the bargain that Amazon
made it out to be it was also kind of a
mess to navigate and the deals just
weren't the best I think I bought like I
don't know a Dustbuster prime day is
only for amazon prime subscribers so if
you don't belong to the club this
information is completely useless to you
amazon says it has learned from last
year's shortcomings and is going into
prime date this year with a fresh set of
eyes sales will focus on TVs and toys
and Amazon is promising twice as much TV
inventory as Black Friday and Cyber
Monday combined they've even hinted at
Alexa power deals so if you own an echo
a dot or a tap you can just yell at that
thing all day to see what's on sale now
leading up to July twelfth amazon is
promoting prime day countdown deals
where you can already take advantage of
discounts don't forget prime day is
really just designed to get you to buy
stuff even though we poke a little fun
at it it did really well last year in
terms of sales but that said just
because an item is listed as a prime day
deal doesn't necessarily mean it's the
best price out there it's worth checking
services like camel camel camel which
tracks amazon price history there's also
honey which is a browser plug-in that
will alert you if any third-party
sellers have the same product for sale
but for less and don't forget those big
box retailers like best buy walmart and
others they are very much aware of prime
day and may try and undercut amazon the
same day keep it here for more
highlights leading up to prime day again
that's july 12 good luck shopping and I
hope you buy me something good
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
