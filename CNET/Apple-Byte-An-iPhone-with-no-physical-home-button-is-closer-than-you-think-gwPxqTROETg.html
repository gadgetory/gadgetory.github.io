welcome to the Apple bite for everything
good and bad inside the rule of Apple
it's all about the money this week and
the big a reported their earnings for
the third fiscal quarter of 2015 now
let's talk big numbers with Apple
revenue at forty nine point six billion
dollars and a net quarterly profit of
ten point seven billion the standouts
Apple sold forty seven and a half
million iPhones up from just over thirty
five million a year earlier 4.8 million
Macs were sold compared to four point
four last year but iPad sales keep
dropping falling to ten point nine
million compared to just over 13 million
last year
now Greater China revenues were up one
hundred and twelve percent compared to
US growth of thirty three percent so you
can easily see where there's money to be
made internationally but what about the
Apple watch well Tim Cook said the Apple
watch exceeded expectations but gave no
specific sale numbers
he also said sales of the Apple watch
for its first nine weeks were higher
than the original iPhone or iPad when
they first launched now the Apple watch
is grouped in with others that includes
the Apple TV Beats headphones and the
iPod and makes up only 5% of Apple's
total revenue now that category saw a
bump up from 1.7 billion dollars in the
second quarter of 2015 the 2.6 billion
in this third fiscal quarter now based
on a rough estimate of around 4 million
units sold research firm strategic
analytics says the Apple watch created a
dramatic shift in the SmartWatch market
size with Apple claiming roughly 75% of
the global market share in the second
quarter of 2015 now who's feeling the
most pain from Apple's emergence it's
Samsung get this they held 73 points 6
percent of the market share until the
Apple watch went on sale and now only
holds seven point five percent of the
market according to these estimates ouch
and in more Apple watch love or
propaganda depending on how you look at
it according to research firm wrist Lee
overall customer satisfaction with Apple
Smart Watch is at 97 percent they pulled
from a group of over 1,000 respondents
and it's the highest satisfaction rating
for any
first-gen product from Apple see the
original iPhone received a 92% rating
and the original iPad was 91% now here's
the catch
66% of respondents were very satisfied
and 31% were somewhat satisfied which
brought them to their number of 97
percent overall satisfied
so maybe apples 99% iPhone TV ad
included people who loved their iPhone
and people who somewhat loved their
iPhone alright in software updates
developers are also getting access to
the fourth betas for iOS 9 al Capitan
and watch OS 2 as well Apple has also
released the second public betas for iOS
9 and OS 10 El Capitan and for those of
you complaining to me that it doesn't
work with everything is because it's
called a beta all right so the quick
bytes and after taking Apple's recent
hardware sales into consideration iOS
unit sales are now matching Windows PC
sales Android unit sales surpassed the
Windows PC sales in 2012 but Apple fans
can rejoice you are now part of the club
also we've talked about future iPhones
removing the home button completely and
allowing the touchscreen panel to
eventually detect fingerprints well
we're getting closer after security
firms so Novation announced their new
technology that allows ultrasonic
fingerprint sensors to be embedded under
Corning Gorilla Glass the sensors would
be bonded directly to the display and
this could be the first step in paving
the way for future iPhones without home
buttons now so Novation claims their 3d
scanning tech can remain accurate in all
situations even if a finger is oily
dirty or moist and I usually don't like
saying the word moist except when it's
crucial to a story and you know what I'm
not gonna forget you all let's get to
our feedback of the week we asked to
hear from you the Apple by ders after we
did our poll of our own to see if in
fact 99% of iPhone users do indeed love
their iPhones so here's what you wrote
us Chris Montana says I love my
jailbroken iPhone smiles Porsche for
life says I love my iPhone because it
just works on email mano Reath Arun
writes I love my iPhone because it makes
the beautiful girls attracted to me
cool houssam wanted to let me know that
iphones make me feel warm in my pants
and Ryan Kim says that husband got rekt
I love my iPhone almost more than my
husband yeah you did alright that's
gonna do for this we show you can always
email us at the Apple bite at cnet.com
or tweet me at Brian Tong and I'll
respond when there's a break in my judo
class thanks so much for watching we'll
catch you all next time for another bite
