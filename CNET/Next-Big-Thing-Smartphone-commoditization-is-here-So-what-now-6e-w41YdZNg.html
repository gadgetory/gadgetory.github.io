bad smartphones anymore again the
FaceTime camera is a bit better the
battery life is a bit better and the LTE
worldwide coverage is a bit better this
phone is actually only slightly smaller
than the HTC One original you can see
that there are still aluminum accents
and the body looks really beautiful
still has a premium feel it's fairly
slim which makes it a bit easier to hold
and it has the same polycarbonate design
you'll find on a lot of Nikes previously
Mia's smartphone commoditization is
definitely here lots of great phones
with about the same specs and prices
doing a lot of the exact same things for
you the entire back and sides are made
from a single part and the front is one
glass multi-touch surface the display
features 445 pixels per inch and like
the Samsung Galaxy s4 and HTC One it has
a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution the
iPhone 5s is biggest party trick that
you will want to show off to your
friends is probably touch ID it reads
your fingerprint at an incredibly
detailed level really we're looking at
here is as I vibe that's the redesign it
comes in three metal finishes silver
gold and a new space grey one of the
most interesting new features is a
fingerprint scanner on the back of the
phone that's what this black box is
right below the camera module like the
HTC one that came before there is a 4
megapixel ultrapixel camera on the back
around the back you'll see the same
polycarbonate design that you'll find on
a lot of notches Windows Phones if
you've got quite small hands it's
probably isn't for you but it does give
you loads of room for watching videos
and checking out your photos most of the
sales and all of the prophets and the
smartphone biz have now coagulated
around two players Samsung and Apple and
you'll notice those two really just sort
of checkmate each other regularly
they've also struggled to a degree with
their latest big launches iphone 5c
galaxy s4 not quite as red hot as was
expected before they hit the market what
does this mean to you the price of just
$99 now first and most obvious this is
keeping pressure on prices to keep them
down
or flat as well as pressure on features
to give you more for the money you spent
last time you got a phone however that
combination plus a little slowing of
consumer's appetite to upgrade less than
they used to has been bringing down
what's called average selling price in
the marketplace you're going to see
phone makers strive harder to do
something anything to stay relevant in
the market or just stay in the market
look at curved screens gesture control
40 megapixel cameras fingerprint
scanners and phones smart watch combos
as recent examples but notice none of
those have had the seismic weight of the
arrival of the iPhone or no 7 or the
rise of Android in 2010 it's getting
really hard to catch a big wave as we
saw in the heydays of home stereo 35
millimeter photography home video we all
kind of geek out on the gear
specifically for the first you know five
seven ten years then we get back to the
content pretty quickly on devices that
are good enough reliable fairly priced
on the downside this could also mean
less choice in some ways devices like
blackberries moto droids was sliding
keyboards many windows phone are all on
something of a bubble about being here
tomorrow or not bottom line watch the
low-cost sector the smart money knows
this is where the huge growth potential
is and will be in the smartphone market
in a way price might be the next big
thing in smartphones all of this is
happening because the smartphone has
captivated our minds and our wallets and
our time like almost nothing in recent
digital history it truly is a tectonic
like no other
