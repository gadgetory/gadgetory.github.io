senior writer Greg Sandoval who covers
Netflix and it's been a year since the
insanity around Netflix is price hikes
and the Qwikster spin-off now you've
talking to employees both past and
present to give us a look into what went
on behind the scenes during this
trainwreck and at a once beloved tech
company so how was it like getting
people to talk to you about this I've
been covering the speed for six years
and I've never had anybody give me
anything
any information inside information
anything like that about the company
until now lots and lots of workers are
angry at Reed Hastings and how he
handled the Qwikster of the price hike
everything last year
they're very disappointed well it seems
like he was just pushing through with
dividing DVDs from the company starting
Qwikster it's hard to believe that
everyone was on board with this was this
a culture where people could speak up
and say hey we don't really like this
idea it used to be one person described
read as a happy-go-lucky guy but he
changed as they became more successful
read started keeping his own counsel he
stopped listening to people and he
pushed this thing through there were
lots of people who tried to talk him out
of it but he had an idea he's worried
about the future right we're going to
streaming and he wanted to be rid of
DVDs and he wanted to do it quickly and
that was it they pushed this thing
through and there's nothing to indicate
that it was well thought out they it
looks like they just slapped it together
so a year later a few days ago we hear
this great news about how they have a
billion hours of streaming in the month
of June now of course they've also added
several more areas to their subscriber
list but what does that fluff
announcement mean to you are they really
better off now a year later they're
trying to work their way back but
metrics like that that's not how you
measure a company like Netflix it is
still the same company at its core tell
us how much you're growing subscribers
tell us how much it costs to obtain some
of the streaming content because we know
what's going up everybody knows these
costs are spiking if they really want to
help us understand their business
they'll do that kind of stuff now they
have
their tail Hulu's not too far behind
cable companies are the competing factor
now what do they have to do to go
forward here's the here's the chief
challenge for Reed Hastings right now
he's got to prove that he can grow his
subscribers with what we as probably I
don't think I'm being unfair is a very
mediocre catalog right you go into the
streaming and it's reruns TV reruns you
have you know be title films
documentaries there's nothing fresh and
there's nothing new now Netflix is still
very cheap there's nobody offering a
better deal well people just say hey
whatever he's got there I'll find
something to watch because it is a lot
less expensive than any cable company
he's got to prove that and we're gonna
see that in the next few quarters well
thanks Greg for seen it I'm Bridget
