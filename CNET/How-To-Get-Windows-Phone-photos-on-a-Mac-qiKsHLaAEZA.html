convenient way to snap pictures on the
go unlike your point-and-shoot getting
photos off of this thing can be tricky
one of the tougher situations out there
is trying to transfer photos and videos
from a Windows Phone to a Mac can be
done though and I'm going to show you
how first step
open up your Mac's app store and search
for Windows Phone connector you should
find this free app after installing it
locate the app in your apps folder and
launch it you'll see this intro page
asking you to connect your phone with
the microUSB cable that came with your
phone connect your phone to your Mac and
if you get an error just unplug it and
try again it may take a few attempts but
eventually you should see an image of
your phone and some new options first
stop hit the device options button and
make sure the import photos option is
checked and changed the event name to
something more memorable the camera roll
if you want you can also personalize
your phone's name up here at the top hit
done and then hit sync and your photo
should get pulled over into iPhoto if
you have a different app that you prefer
to manage your photos in go into
preferences and select it from the list
if it's not there though you're out of
luck now if you don't have iPhoto or if
you just prefer to grab your photos
manually select the Browse device option
and you should see a list of all the
media you can transfer from the phone
from here you can drag and drop files
right onto your desktop or into another
folder finally if none of this is
working for you you can bypass the
software altogether and email the file
right from the phone compose an email to
yourself hit the paper clip and select a
photo to attach you can hit the
paperclip again and attach more photos
so there you go that's my best advice
for getting photos off of your Windows
Phone onto a Mac for cnet.com i'm donald
