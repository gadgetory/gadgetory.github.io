the new needle they've also had a whole
new legion of people sneering at it no
one seemed to take the cute little
rounded thing seriously that's finally
changing the whole new design kind of
chopped and channeled and slam and some
new guys in this BR line let's drive it
and check the test
now I could call this a turbo there's a
big badge on the back it says that but
that doesn't distinguish this beetle
anymore because recently even the base
beetle went turbo 1.8 this is a bigger
turbo at 2.0 you also get a sports
suspension of the Arline bigger and more
aggressive looking wheels a body kit
that particularly changes the way the
bumpers are molded and if you haven't
checked out a beetle at all in a while
well it's worn a new look since 2012
let's round it over the top a little
more broad-shouldered inside you got a
very cool little gauge cluster on top of
the dash we'll see in a moment
independent rear suspension came to
beetles recently as well in general you
could call this the GTI of beetles it's
a good summary for the R line now no bud
base this is a much more businesslike
cabin in the beetle our line first of
all you see you've got three clear
analog gauges here your speedo your tack
and your fuel gauge but it gets much
more interesting up here this little
blister is an R line thing where you've
got an oil temperature gauge you've got
this interesting lap timer in the middle
and over on the right you've got your
turbo boost gauge all of these of course
speak to a very different mission than
your standard beetle now we have the top
package on this vehicle which is called
Sun sound and navigation the Sun is the
roof overhead pretty big for an arch top
car the sound is the fender audio system
around the vehicle they little sub in
the back and fender branding all around
the navigation is right here the
navigation the screen is pretty small by
today's standards this is the iPhone of
car head units way behind the pack in
size once you get past that though your
choices are pretty solid you've got the
usual media options that range from
Bluetooth streaming to a pretty silly SD
card slot right here the MDI is the
multi device interface over in the
glovebox notice that this is the first
time I've seen a Volkswagen Audi product
that has the correct adapter for the new
iOS devices basically you want for
nothing on the media side the navigation
screen has several views but no earth
view nothing that's too complex
there's no connected navigation going on
here either dot pitch and resolution
isn't bad it's basically a perfectly
good system but there's something
cutting-edge about it but in general
this interface still makes no organic
sense to me
neither my mind or my eyes organized the
world as balls around the
ark but response to inputs is at least
crisp and quick and as you can see the
system is fairly verbose with a minimum
of cryptic icons if you get the VW
carnet app set up you'll have crash
notification roadside assistance stolen
vehicle location remote access to lock
and unlock the car and such also you can
set geofencing boundaries to know if the
cars left a certain area or if it's
driving beyond the speed you've preset
we're talking to your teenage kids there
some other our line touches are these
sports seats a flat bottom sporty wheel
as is the fashion these days push-button
starter over here and two glove boxes
you got the standard one here that's
standard Beatle stuff and right above
that is what they call the high four
five I told you this is not a show for
kids and this is old beetle stuff a
retro touch now under its short snout
you've got a hotter engine than in a
base beetle but as I mentioned earlier
all these guys get turbo engines now but
this is the somewhat bigger one it's a
2-liter turbo inline 4 of course sitting
sidesaddle driving the front wheels
that's beetle architecture aside from
turbo charging it's also got direct
injection so all the major hits of
current engine designer in here the
numbers 210 horsepower 207 foot-pounds
of torque the beetle is fairly spelt at
3000 pounds or so
it's up to 60 and six and a half seconds
your mpg with the manual is 23 31 if you
get the automated transmission it goes
one MPG the opposite way 24 City but
only 30 on the highway removing all that
power to the wheels of course means
going to the front wheels there's
something going through the bottom of
the car here there's no all-wheel drive
all those performance purists might like
it but you do have those a limited slip
differential in the are line if you're
unclear on that go see our car tech 101
from CNET on cars about LSDs
and you have two choices of gearboxes we
blessedly have been given the six-speed
manual yes this is a rarity these days I
bet most of these are going to ship with
a 6-speed DSG that's a dual clutch
automated manual gearbox
now I'll tell you I came prepared to
really love the beetle our line looks so
good on paper doesn't look so good on
the road the engine I give an a - it's
got great power minimal turbo lag makes
a nice note when you're really gonna get
winding into it then you've got a whole
different personality than the
suspension which has kind of got up a
lot of floats and porpoising going on is
your on and off the power
it doesn't match with the motor there's
something disconnected here and that's
fine
if you want to do a compliant suspension
at least dial out the road noise and
they don't do a good job of that I'm
getting a lot of really annoying
drumming from the road surface out of
all four wheels it's just it's just
irritating so it's a bit of Jekyll and
Hyde going on here I wish they've gotten
the underpinnings to be more of what the
engines trying to deliver it's not a bad
car to drive I don't dislike it but it's
not of a piece no driver assistance tech
to speak of on the are line not even a
rear camera which is very odd at this
point in history okay let's price our
little round red friend about twenty
five eight for an our line delivered
then I'm gonna add 1100 for that DSG
because while I like this manual gearbox
I don't love it I think that DSG is
gonna be a hot setup now I'm gonna go
another twenty nine hundred for the Sun
and sound package but not the Sun sound
and nav package my phone does a better
job than VW Nav in terms of WoW me and I
can live without the leather the 19's
and the bi-xenon but you may have a
different opinion there I'm all in just
under 30 grand for a beetle that's kind
of pulling across purposes it's got one
mission under the hood another mission
under the floor pant I wish they pull
those more into line
