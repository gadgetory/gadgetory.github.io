to put this on now I think where my
kimono is like I wear my bras travel
okay let's do it right photo shoot hi
I'm TJ Miller and I'm the star of yogi
bear 3d I played Ranger Jones oh yeah
lock down the park with eat lock down
the park the star do I consider myself a
big tech user what is a big tech user
I'm over 6 foot 2 I was unfamiliar with
the idea of a personal computing machine
and later I found out what it does and
that you can both find and enjoy
pornography with that I want it to be is
if you are like a cheesy photographer
leaning around the side of a building
yeah that's a great idea as long as
you're happy I'm Helen do you see that
you see what I said I said as long as
you're happy I'm happy
that's called placating
yeah Erlich Bachman I'm a big fan oh
really and what Metamucil where I like
about Silicon Valley the show I like the
satire I love working with my judge and
learning from them I think everyone else
in the cast is incredibly talented are
you trying to say bros before hoes it's
sexist but it's about friendship it's
pretty true to life yes we're kind of
satirizing how out of proportion their
egos are to what they're bringing to the
table culturally chops was a poser I
didn't even write code it's not magic
it's talent and sweat
you know a lot of them don't get it they
just they kind of they've drank the
kool-aid that they made for themselves
if you if you just would give us a
second that would be huge for me right
now because if but if this scene that
interview doesn't go well well I can
kiss my career in Hollywood goodbye all
right sorry
to
well
is the tech world in a bubble I mean it
better be because we just took a whole
bunch of pictures with me and a nail on
a goddamn balloon the tech arathi I've
you know not totally into that I don't
like the term at all I consider myself
more of sort of a sex symbol than part
of the tech community and it not a sex
symbol for human beings necessarily last
why now is it I've seen it boom run
right there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
