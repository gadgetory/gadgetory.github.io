and today we're taking a look at the NAD
D 30 20 this is a compact stereo
integrated amplifier that's currently
selling for five hundred dollars the NAD
is a sleek looking piece of equipment
it's wonderfully compact standing just
2.3 inches tall and you have the option
to use it lying flat or turned up on its
side there are no buttons on the front
when you power it on the front panel
display lights up with crisp white
lettering there are two touch sensitive
buttons on the side for power and
selecting inputs and that's not an ideal
location for the buttons but you're
usually going to be using the remote
anyway
the coolest thing is that if you're
willing to go with the stereo setup
instead of surround sound this small box
can replace a full sized AV receiver and
it'll end up looking a lot better in
your TV cabinet now unlike a lot of
integrated amps the remote has a nice
size to it and it's comfortable to hold
the only problem is that the button
labels are the same color as the buttons
which makes them very difficult to see
especially in a dim home theater on the
upside you can turn the amp on and off
via the remote which is actually a
feature that's missing from a lot of
competitors around back are the audio
inputs including two digital inputs an
analog input and one mixed use input
that can function either as an analog
input or an optical input as long as you
have the right adapter cable now that's
plenty of connectivity even for living
room use as long as you use your TV to
switch between devices and connect the
TV's audio output right to the amp even
better the NAD also has built-in
Bluetooth with support for the better
sounding app X codec so it's dead simple
to wirelessly stream audio from nearly
any mobile device it's also nice that
there's a dedicated subwoofer output on
the back so you can use the d30 20 and a
2.1 speaker setup without too much fuss
you'll also notice there's a USB input
so you can directly connect a computer
and if you have the right software this
amp can also support high resolution on
files we also had resident audio file
steve guttenberg give the nad a listen
and he was seriously impressed he
compared it head-to-head with the Teac
aho one and the NAD consistently came
out on top with a more natural sound and
a better defined sound stage both amps
sound great and have plenty of power for
most living rooms but the NAD definitely
had the edge in our subjective listening
tests the only major issue with the d30
20 is the price $500 feels a little
expensive especially when you can get
the full-size Sony strd NH 40 for $400
and that has six HDMI inputs plus
built-in Bluetooth Wi-Fi and airplay but
ultimately you're paying for the d30 20s
compact design and simplicity and we
think that's a worthwhile trade-off for
many buyers that just don't want to deal
with the hassle of a full sized AV
receiver and don't need surround sound
so if you're convinced that a compact
integrated amplifier is the right choice
for your living room the NAD 3020 is the
one to get with a sleek design a great
set of features and excellent sound
quality I'm Matthew moscovia and this is
the NAD d30 20</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
