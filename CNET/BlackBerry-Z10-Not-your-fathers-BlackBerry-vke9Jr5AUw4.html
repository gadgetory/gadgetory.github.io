BlackBerry z10 here is the first device
to determine if the company lives to see
another batch of smartphones and tablet
I'm Jessica's all court with CNET taking
a look at the good and bad in the
BlackBerry z10 now the z10 is a
beautiful looking device but it's also
very familiar-looking one that would be
hard to distinguish from a black iPhone
5 if it weren't for those BlackBerry
logos on the front and on the back if
you're picky about build quality the z10
isn't as finely tooled as the iPhone but
in my opinion it feels a little bit
better in the hand and in my test so far
it has been durable there's a 4.2 inch
HD LCD screen on the all-black z10 and a
subtly textured soft touch finish on the
back the edges are straight and the
corners are rounded you won't find any
buttons on the phone's face and that's
because the z10 uses only a series of
gestures to navigate around for more on
those be sure to check out my full video
and review of the BlackBerry 10 OS
you'll find the usual light and
proximity sensors on the front and a 2
megapixel camera lens there as well
there are also two microphones one each
at the top in the bottom the phone has a
micro HDMI port right next to the micro
USB charging port so you'll be able to
easily connect the phone to your TV the
power buttons up top and the volume
buttons are on the side they do triple
duty to also take screenshots and to
trigger the camera shutter the button in
between these two launches voice control
on the back of the phone you have an 8
megapixel camera lens and flash plus the
NFC module below the back panel you'll
find the micro SD card slot which comes
with a gigabytes pre-installed and which
takes up to 32 gigabytes of your own
memory the z10 runs on a 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 plus
processor and supports 4G LTE and HSPA+
there's also support for global roaming
now that we've got all the important
specs out of the way let's talk about
what you really want to know how well
this phone works and if you should
switch let's start with the camera
the 8 megapixel shooter was able to take
some nice crisp photos through the
standard and time shift modes although
there is autofocus with this you can't
move the focal point from the center so
you have to get tricky if you want to
focus on something a little off to the
side I do love the extensive photo
editing tools though you can take 1080p
and 720p HD video on here and 720p HD
video from the front camera blackberry
messenger is classic rim and in this
version you get video chats and screen
sharing as well as the usual free
BlackBerry to blackberry messaging it's
a good feature apps will be a sticking
point with the z10 and all other
BlackBerry devices going forward at
launch you'll find Twitter or Facebook
LinkedIn and Foursquare Angry Birds Star
Wars is the most fun pre-installed by
far and don't be fooled by this YouTube
app it's just a bookmark to the mobile
site so should you get the BlackBerry
z10 let me just say that if you've been
patiently waiting for rims next
touchscreen smartphone then I think
you're really gonna love this phone it's
got a grown-up look and feel and it
keeps all the security and business
features the smart Keyboard tricks and
blackberry messenger app that RIM is
really known for however if you're not
especially enamored of blackberry to
begin with and you're happy where you
are I recommend staying put for at least
another software iteration so that RIM
can further build up its app base and
iron out these first-generation and OS
cakes for CNET I'm Jessica's all-court
