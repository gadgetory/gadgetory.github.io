appearance of the iPad software it also
introduced one feature in particular
that makes the iPad operate a bit more
like a computer drag-and-drop
here are nine super useful ways to use
drag and drop on the iPad likely the
first way you will use drag and drop on
your iPad is to initiate split view from
the home screen press and drag on the
icon of an app you want to open without
releasing it tap the icon of a second
app drag the first icon toward either
edge of the screen to start split view
or drag it to the center of the screen
and release to float the window on top
with an app already open you can also
swipe up from the bottom of the screen
to reveal the dock and start split view
from there or you can float a third app
atop two side-by-side apps you can also
drag items between apps for instance you
can drag an image from photos into
messages just press on an image and
begin dragging to initiate drag and drop
select additional images by tapping them
while holding the first one without
releasing the images press the home
button and tap or hover the selection
over the messages icon then tap to open
a conversation drop the images over the
text field to insert them if you're
tired of copying and pasting or hitting
the share button to share your else from
Safari you can help drag and drop URLs
to and from Safari press and drag on the
address bar to drop the URL in another
app or drag and drop a URL into Safari
to load it without copying and pasting
likewise if you're sharing an address
you can drag and drop addresses from the
Apple Maps app into any text field be it
a text message email or note and if you
want to open an address you can select
it and drag and drop it in to Apple maps
you can also use drag and drop to share
calendar entries and reminders reminders
will be shared as simple text the name
of the reminder while calendar entries
will be shared as ICS files not only
that but you can drag and drop URLs and
other items into calendar or reminders
to create new entries if you want to
share a story from Apple News just press
and drag the story card when you drop it
into a text field the URL of the story
will be pasted one of the most handy
places for drag and drop to exist is
within spotlight with an app open you
can search for an app that's not in your
dock and star split view you
drag and drop search results from
spotlight into an email or you can
search for a contact and drag and drop
the contact card into a message the
possibilities are virtually endless when
you take a screenshot you now get a
small preview of it in the lower left
corner you can drag and drop this
screenshot just like any other image
drag and drop has always been used for
rearranging the home screen of iPhones
and iPads but now you can move multiple
icons at a time using the same method
for dragging and dropping multiple files
or photos for more tips and tricks and
