niche products and thanks to smartphones
it seems cameras and camcorders have
more and more of them these days such as
this the hundred and thirty dollar
Logitech beemo
I'm Josh Goldman was seen it and the BMO
is basically an easy way to quickly
shoot a few seconds of 720 by 720
resolution videos and move on press down
the big button on front and it'll record
let go and it stops it's not meant for
long recordings in fact the longest clip
you can capture is one minute it's just
for capturing the best moments once
you've got some clips then you pair it
with your iPhone or iPad via bluetooth
it's iOS only for the time being open
the BMO app and the latest clips will
automatically transfer to the device
from there you can trim and share or
edit a bunch of clips together add a
filter music and titles creating a small
movie in a matter of minutes the app can
also be used to do time-lapse videos and
remotely start recordings now is it
something you can do with your phone
absolutely but this is faster to take
out and shoot with more comfortable to
use and it's durable and water-resistant
so you can hand it over to your friends
and family without worrying too much
about it you can read the full review on
cnet.com but if you're addicted to apps
like vine and Instagram this is
something you want to check out I'm Josh
Goldman and that's the Logitech Nemo
