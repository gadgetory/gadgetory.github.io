I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update everyone's going bonkers about
the chromecast when Google unveiled its
$35 streaming device for televisions it
was only a matter of hours before it was
sold out on amazon and the google play
store it also quickly sold out on best
buy Google Play is selling them again
but shipping times can be as long as
four weeks and if you can't wait that
long some people are selling them on
ebay for as much as a hundred dollars
it's selling like hotcakes because well
the price is crazy cheap at $35 and
because it's a very simple solution to
playing videos from the web on your big
screen it doesn't do everything other
streaming devices do and it's not
perfect but it has lots of potential it
works with Android and Apple phones and
tablets if you have the Netflix app or
the YouTube app you press a button to
push what you're watching to the TV and
what's neat is that once you play a
video you could walk out of the house
and it will keep streaming when more
apps add this cast button like Pandora
or perhaps Spotify this will be an even
better product and no worries about
fighting over a remote because every
phone or tablet or computer on your
network becomes the remote now if you
want to use your computer it will stream
the content on one tab of your Chrome
browser so you can watch videos from
websites or play music from streaming
services but google says using chrome is
still a beta product so you may see some
hiccups but for a $35 I don't think
people would line about putting up with
hiccups be sure to head to cnet com to
check out our full review and
comparisons against Apple TV and Roku
it's been a busy week for google it's
also pushing out an update to Android
all Nexus devices will be first to get
Android 4.3 but we now have confirmation
that Sony's Xperia devices will also
eventually be getting the update the new
Android has small changes like smart
bluetooth which means it will sync up
with more fitness devices and gamers
will enjoy enhanced graphics support
families who share a device with
multiple accounts
you'll now have more control over
blocking certain apps for kids or even
blocking how much their kids can do
inside of an app and google translate
homepage can now understand handwriting
so for example if you come across a
Chinese character you don't understand
just draw it with your finger on your
smartphone screen and google says it can
translate it Google can support
handwriting for 45 languages but it's
only available on Android right now
that's your tech news update you can
find more details at cnet com / update
and follow along on Twitter from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
