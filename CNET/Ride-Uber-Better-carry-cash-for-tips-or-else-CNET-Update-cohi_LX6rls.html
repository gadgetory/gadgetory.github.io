carrying cash and Beyonce's lemonade
exclusive business of exclusive I'm
Bridget Carey this is your cnet update
the cashless car service uber may start
requiring you to carry some cash for
tips oh I'm sorry did you think that
tips are already included in the
transaction well you're not alone uber
did make it seem like tips were included
in fact on its website it says quote
there is no need to tip but tips are not
part of the fare and now if a class
action settlement gets approval from a
judge drivers may be allowed to ask for
tips what makes over so appealing is
that you hailed the car from your phone
you jump in you jump out without ever
needing to fumble with payment but
drivers in California and Massachusetts
sued uber over civil rights and in the
proposed 100 million dollar settlement
drivers can ask for tips so if you don't
tip well you're just going to look like
a jerk and your passenger rating could
suffer if you did already know drivers
do rate you as a passenger you can see
your rating in the settings and if your
passenger rating goes too low well you
may not get drivers to pick you up rival
service lift does let you tip inside of
the app but on uber there's no way to
tip inside the app which means you need
to carry cash to show your appreciation
for good service oh how antiquated and
music fans are also turning to old ways
of getting music these days it makes
more sense sometimes to just pay for an
album then pay for a streaming service
over the past few days some of the most
in-demand music cannot be found on
Spotify Apple music or YouTube only
untitled beyonce's new lemonade album
which debuted over the weekend is only
available to stream on title it's a
subscription service co-founded by her
husband jay-z title is not popular but
the app did quickly rise to the top of
the app download charts after lemonade a
beaut over the weekend that's according
to data from the tracking service app
Annie also Prince's music is only
streaming on title title does pay
artists a little more per stream but it
doesn't mean they have to make the
switch to title princess albums and
Beyonce's lemonade are available to buy
on itunes at amazon
with the download you can also give
beyonce special visual album the
hour-long film that's a mix of spoken
word and music videos that debuted on
HBO it was a big weekend for HBO with
all the buzz around Beyonce's lemonade
and the premiere of Game of Thrones but
new subscribers to the HBO now app were
left without their dragons because they
couldn't get the app to work wow my
dragons new subscribers took to Twitter
and reddit to complain of issues that's
all for this technique is roundup you
can hit a cnet com for the latest from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
