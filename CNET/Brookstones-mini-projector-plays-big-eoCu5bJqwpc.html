for cnet.com and I'm here with the
Brookstone HDMI pocket projector this
projector is considered a pico projector
weighs in about half a pound
it has a nice compact form factor and is
obviously very portable you do have to
plug it in at least to charge it up and
you can leave it plugged in when you're
showing a video on it it gives you about
two hours of battery life and our test
it did hit that number but it does not
have a any sort of battery indicator
that tells you that it's about to go off
this is called the HDMI pocket projector
for a reason because it does have an
HDMI port in the back there are also a
couple adapters for it however if you
have an Apple device you will need a
$40.00 adapter to make that work with it
and this won't work with all smartphones
necessarily it does have two built-in
speakers one watt speakers they do
provide some sound not great sound
pretty tinny but there's enough sound to
hear a movie you can also plug in an
external speaker to this device or
perhaps you want to listen with a small
Bluetooth speaker that you can pair with
a tablet or smartphone on the box it
does say something about accepting a
1080p signal but this is not an HD
projector it is an 854 by 480 resolution
projectors so it will take a 1080p
signal but it will downsize it to that
854 by 480 it does deliver a good
picture
it has about 85 lumens so it's a pretty
bright little projector you can project
to around 50 to 60 inches from about 6
feet away the room doesn't have to be
totally dark when you're showing a
presentation which is good a couple of
other small things worth mentioning this
does have a little manual focus control
on it it also has a USB out port which
allows you to charge your smartphone
this does have that built in battery so
you can charge a device while you're
using projector ideally of course you'd
have the projector plugged in while
you're charging couple of things this
projector doesn't have there's no
built-in memory or any sort of micro SD
card slot but all in all a pretty solid
little project
it does cost $300 that may be a little
bit expensive for folks now but these
pico projectors have come a long ways
since what we saw a few years ago should
also check out Roku streaming projector
which is also at this $300 price point
which allows you to stream Roku services
right from the projector I'm David
Conroy and that's the Brookstone HDMI
pocket projector thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
