Google Isha's it's all the Google thrown
into a show each week so let's get to it
and Google has tried like really tried
to rule your living room with our Google
TV platform that's had little success
they've also had their Nexus Q streaming
sphere that's pretty much dead and
they're $35 chromecast which is finally
something we're talking about but still
they haven't built a real winner now
we've heard rumors of a set-top box as
far back as June but according to the
tech blog the information their sources
say the googs is working on a nexus
branded set-top box that runs android
includes streaming services like netflix
and hulu and will also play games as
well now the Nexus set-top box will also
have a remote with a built-in touchpad
and they say it could arrive as early as
the first half of 2014 with an
aggressive price tag now none of
Google's previous attempts have been
able to gain any mainstream traction and
the living room is still up for grabs
between Google Apple and Amazon and all
three of these guys are already
competing against sony and microsoft's
game consoles now the latest release of
android 4.4 point one kit kat is being
rolled out to more nexus devices
including the nexus 5 and nexus 4 phones
and the nexus 7 and 10 tablets the
update also has code relating to video
output and chromecast Meereen that was
discovered by the cyanogen team now all
signs points the API locking things down
to specific devices chromecast Meereen
works a whole lot better on Chromebooks
and laptops compared to other Android
devices right now but the hope is that
it could eventually change and sticking
with the chromecast let's check out a
quick how-to showing you how to access
some of its hidden features i'm dan
graziano and i'm here with google's $35
chromecast this small dongle connects to
your hdmi port on the back of your TV
and allows you to wirelessly stream
content from your computer or android or
iOS device the chromecast currently
supports YouTube pandora hulu plus
netflix and HBO GO while android users
also have access to movies and TV shows
that they purchase from the google play
store but there are also other ways too
stream content to your TV using the
chromecast you should already have the
google cast extension installed on your
chrome browser if not go download it
from the Chrome Web Store this will
allow you to cast content from your
computer to your TV what you may not
know is that the chromecast can actually
mirror your computer's entire screen
click on the google cast extension and
from the drop-down menu select cast
entire screen it's also possible to cast
locally stored files from your computer
to your TV open a new browser tab and
press ctrl o on Windows or command o on
Mac select a file and then cast the
browser tab from the google cast
extension if you're encountering choppy
playback or dealing with a lot of
buffering issues while casting try
lowering your streaming settings click
on the google cast extension in your
browser select options and lower your
streaming quality to 480p your videos
may look a little worse but you should
be able to watch them without
interruption thanks for that Dan now
we've talked about the nexus 10 and it
really might be released by the time you
watch this according to every to is
consistently on top of it they confirm
that the LG v 5 10 leaked images we've
seen are indeed a Nexus device now it's
just one little tidbit of info that gets
you closer to Google's next big screen
tablet with the end of the year coming
up and samsung unveiled the galaxy J for
Taiwan it was teased with this just
simple just elegant trailer it's the
same model launched in japan and it's
basically a galaxy s4 with a snapdragon
800 processor and three gigs of ram
running android 4.3 out of the box now
it comes in red white and blue but it
isn't expected to make it outside of
Asia and let's check out some really
quick stories I don't know how I miss
this one for all of you but Motorola now
owned by Google they filed for a patent
application that was made public in
November for a smart tattoo that would
act as a microphone for your smartphone
now this is not a joke this is real it
would be able to connect to your
smartphone and the tattoo would also
double as a lie detector now check this
out this image shows the tattoo on your
neck but the application doesn't mention
if it will work with tramp stamps
and we'll end things with a little
holiday cheer dead zebra is where you'll
find the works of artists Andrew Belle
known for many things including his
collectible Android minis well on
December 10th dead zebra is releasing
ornamental Android figurines that are
actual ornaments and they come in red or
blue metallic finishes with silver
glitter accents now these guys are
really cool they're limited and they'll
be selling for ten dollars a pop with
quantities limited to two per person so
definitely we're checking out or giving
to one of your phandroid friends alright

show email us at google issues at cnet
com or you can tweet me at brian Tong
