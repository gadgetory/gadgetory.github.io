Pokemon go was a huge hit this year it
was the third most downloaded app on iOS
for 2016 however it's not as hot as it
used to be to help reinvigorate the game
Sprint is partnering with the Niantic
the developer behind Pokemon go over
ten-thousand sprint and boost mobile
stores will become pokus tops and gyms
starting on December 12th also in
December 12th Niantic will share details
on new Pokemon coming to the game that
probably won't be the only day for new
Pokemon Niantic CEO John Hanke suggested
that more are coming after that date as
well Sprint is currently the fourth
largest wireless carrier in the US
Sprint CEO says the company expects a
lot more traffic to their stores thanks
to this deal
financial terms of the agreement were
not disclosed however Sprint CEO says
that Sprint is paying Niantic for
increased traffic to their stores Sprint
will be the exclusive wireless partner
Pokemon go so don't expect places like
Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T stores to feature
pokémon gyms officially in the past
pokémon gyms and pocus tops have
attracted lots and lots of attention
we'll have to see whether or not the
promise of new Pokemon will send people
to Sprint stores for more information
