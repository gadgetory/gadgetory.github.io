I'm alfred Aang
Amazon's Alexa continues to move out of
the home with its latest expansion
called Alexa for hospitality that was
just announced today the new version of
the voice assistant lets you check out
of your hotel order a new toothbrush and
check the pool and gym times for any
local hotel that you're staying in if
they have this it's rolling out in about
ten marriott locations over the summer
Wynn Las Vegas also introduced Alexa in
all of its rooms about two years ago but
it wasn't Alexa for a hospitality this
one's a little bit more specific to like
actual hotels which i think is kind of
cool pretty interesting so why does
amazon want to know what I'm up to in
hotel rooms why are they spying on me in
my in my private hotel room so it's
interesting you say that Amazon like we
asked them specifically about some of
these things they said that they aren't
going to share voice data with the hotel
years they're gonna delete all the
information every day if you do actually
use this also if you have no interest in
using Alexa for a hospitality you could
either get a room that doesn't have echo
speakers in the room or you could just
unplug the speaker or keep it muted do I
have to pay more for a room that has
Alexa in it or is it probably not but
that's a good question I didn't ask that
is really annoying like do you want the
Alexa concierge in your room that's like
an extra service or something like that
I would I would really hope not and if
they're trying to get people to like
actually use the service and get used to
it that would be a really significant
limiting factor I would think so it's
not just in fogging out at the front
desk though or I like would have control
like the room temperature no that stuff
together yeah depending on how
forward-looking the different hotels
when it be so it's gonna be different
for each different hotel you're gonna
operate the lights play music change the
temperature in the room do all sorts of
like different smart home controls that
kind of thing so as this kind of thing
gets expanded into more hotels you can
expect to see more different like
connected devices and connected controls
anyway next up IBM created a system
called Project debater which pulls from
a library of about three
million news articles and scholarly
papers and its training in debate
techniques to create on the fly
arguments about space exploration or
telemedicine or whatever else you want
to argue about that sounds pretty cool I
don't know
how does it how does somebody decide who
wins this debate though that work III BM
like did a presentation and they
basically asked people in the audience
they were like who won this debate so
apparently the project debater did win
one of the debates pretty commandingly
what if they just had to project
debaters like debating each other I
think they might have covered Network I
don't know this is this was like my
immediate impression about this too was
that like this like in the world we live
today like you can't even convince
people that the world is round so flat
right like they built it to like just
shut all flat-earthers down but like
it's just it's does it really matter
that it has like 300 million like news
articles and scholarly papers if
somebody wants to like think something
like Project debater isn't gonna
convince them otherwise so that's what I
think somebody should set it up in a way
where it like sends out tweets to people
where like so it's like debating people
like on social media now is that's like
in person you know what I really like
that idea that's pretty cool
last Alfred you finally got a chance to
play Super Smash Brothers for the
Nintendo switch the game doesn't come
out until December 7th but give me some
impressions what did you think yeah so I
only got like two rounds to play with it
but it felt really good to play on it
like a lot of the tensions that were
there from like high high level play
that I experienced while playing on the
GameCube version was back like they
brought in a lot of like different
features the perfect shielding where
like you you have to time these like
shields and you can counter-attack like
at the same time yeah it had a lot of
great features on it unfortunately we're
out of time yeah so you felt like it was
like less of a party game and more of
like a potential like like a sport yeah
like a competitive like fighting game
again yeah that's pretty cool I
definitely look forward to trying it out
and hopefully beating you with Captain
Falcon we'll see if you want to read
more about these stories check us out on
CNN I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Alfred
thanks for listening
all right thanks everybody for joining
us we're gonna jump into the chat and
start taking some questions so we can
keep the conversation going right up
front sir enjoy wants been to answer it
sir enjoy
did you leave your show shoes at the
hotel sir enjoy you already asked me
that on Twitter and I answered you and I
said yes I did you're just trying to
shame me all over again yes I left my
shoes on on the bed oh oh I thought it
like you I got he was like if I'm behind
at the hotel if Brian can find the
picture is actually like a picture of me
like I'm the model for this story where
like I'm like hanging out on the bed
reading the literature about Alexa I
don't see your shoes there that's me
right there well sir enjoy very
accurately asked whether I was or wasn't
wearing the opening shot of the video
has you laying down on the bed with your
shoes on that's right sir enjoy watch
the video I was there goes everywhere
with his shoes on though I like went to
the pool at this hotel shoes were still
on there only clothes and everything I'm
one of those people yes I wear my shoes
in the pool it's like an extreme never
made my horrible secret has been
revealed by store enjoy does this
effectively hide my Thunder strange why
actually has a good serious question he
says will we see an Alexa icon next to
sorry again everybody for how many times
yes please mute your echo speakers
change your wake word people say Alexa
all the time yeah well that's the world
we've built will we see an Alexa icon
next to Wi-Fi pool gym etc as a feature
for online hotel bookings that is an
interesting thought it was like a
commodity like like on the website you
know just to like give people an idea
that like there's annoying like I'm just
like in the same way that I look at
Wi-Fi as like as like a thing that they
boast it's like that should be a given
like your hotel room should have Wi-Fi
already no no no no we stayed at a hotel
for CES and there was no Wi-Fi that's
terrible that that's like that should be
like a standard me like imagine going
somewhere is like we have a bathroom in
this hotel like that's like that's like
a given you saw her you have a bathroom
are you arguing that Alexa should be
standard and I think that's what Amazon
wants I think they wanted to be
like everywhere so I think that you know
I think for now they'll probably like
boast like oh this room is like Alexa
enabled there's something like that but
I think the ultimate goal is to have it
be as like ubiquitous as like and that
is this plan
this room has pillows like duh if you
are super interested in going to a
Marriott that's gonna have these the
folks at Marriott told me two different
locations that are definitely getting
Alexa for hospitality
those are Charlotte Marriott city center
in North Carolina and Marriott Irvine
Spectrum in California so if you're
around those areas and are like super
into this I guess you could book a room
and try it out it was during the demo
you could ask Alexa directly like hey
Alexa I need a toothbrush and you just
talked to Alexa you don't even have to
like call the front desk or anything
they go toothbrushes yeah I'll send you
a toothbrush I bought in ten rush at a
hotel that host and they asked they they
initially asked for ten toothbrushes and
Alexa was smart enough to be like sorry
your maximum is 5 you can order up to
five toothbrushes what do you want
behind to me brushes my teeth
either way while we were doing the
debate we got one toothbrush signup to
us and then or sorry while we were doing
the demo and then by the end of the demo
the toothbrush did show up in the room
which I thought was kind of cool so
there were some like fun little like ooh
that's magic like aspects to this but
you know in the world we live in these
days there are obviously going to be
people that just aren't gonna be
interested in this and that's why even
if you have like an Alexa enabled hotel
they're almost definitely gonna have to
continue to have rooms that just don't
have echo speakers in them like people
are just not gonna want it yeah to
certain extent some people I want Google
home speakers that exactly what I saw in
chat is asking says what about Google
Alexa sucks lol Wow Romans right there
is it possible that there would be a
version of this like a Google home for
hospitality yeah absolutely just Google
hasn't gotten to it yet and I think that
there's just this constant push and pull
between these two companies to try to do
this land grab as quickly as possible
and Amazon at the at the moment is
leading the field and
is just getting to things a little bit
faster they look like the Google
assistant like outsold the Amazon like
echo this year that might be true for
like q1 or q2 but in general overall
overall the market in the US is that the
echo speakers roughly account for 70% of
the total market base and Google home is
about 30% and Apple I don't think really
counts yet like the home pod maybe it's
like a single digit type of situation
was that you laughing yeah that was it
was in with a chortle there was Alexa
was chortling a Michael Brown says home
pods for life yo it'd be interesting to
see if they started to use the
hospitality market as a new competitive
place if you start seeing like Alexa
branded Amazon brand to Google branded
Apple branded hotels
what are we done I think that like if
you're doing like a super luxury hotel a
home pide to me sounds like the right
move just because it's like more
expensive it's very pretty
I'm not trying to knock the echo I use
echo speakers all the time but if you're
at like a super luxury hotel I just kind
of feel like that additional apple
brandy I don't know do you super luxury
place you should have a person doing all
your lights off and getting your
toothbrush you are correct sir send my
comments yes and he plays like or she
plays like a violin or something when
you like ask for music that's like super
luxury I really like that idea in your
hotel and get you a toothbrush so you
have a like a harpist that also gets you
toothbrush that's super luxury okay I
think you're right about that that might
be the most first world thing we've ever
said on this show and that's saying a
lot mm-hmm
anything you say brand-new to the show
says hello guys why the name 3:59
because it shows supposed to be three
minutes and 59 seconds and we fail
miserably also how tall I am it's also
the time that the show is we actually
realized after we put the show together
that the name is terrible because some
people thought it was like one degree
off of 360 and then other folks thought
it would be the the show runs at 3:00
3:30 long p.m. so
sure that's what I thought when I was
doing research on it cuz like during my
job interview and I'm glad they didn't
bring it up now just cuz I'm like oh
yeah that's what it means so if we could
do it over again I guess we would just
call it like the Ben Fox Rubin show or
like the Ben rules probably yeah yes
probably the biggest personality on the
show I would say so yeah I feel like it
would be more appropriate if we just
called it confirm for Brawl yes it's
always us rotating roster of you guys
coming through well ID everyone is here
now yeah that actually worked out better
than I expected
mm-hmm yeah ultimately the show supposed
to be three minutes and 59 seconds and
an O R is done the marketing people here
at CBS thought we should just call it
that see how that pans very creative but
either way thanks thanks for joining the
podcast it's always nice to have new
folks come in so and thanks for the
question
Ricky B Alfred do you think they'll
bring back wavedashing no there's no way
they're not gonna bring that back I
thought I heard that they were going to
they brought back wave landing and they
brought back two directional air dodges
where like if you air dodge and you hold
the direction with it like you go that
way now which was in melee but they're
not gonna bring back wavedashing from
what I've seen they've already brought
back like directional air dodging they
did bring back - dancing and wave
landing still has a lot of like lag when
you like land on the ledges and things
like that but yeah wavedashing there's
been this whole debate that it was like
only in smash as like a glitch and
that's why they took it out in the
future ones but there's also been
arguments like they've talked about it
before in a way that like makes it look
like it wasn't a glitch so but I think I
think the general consensus is like it's
not it's not being brought back there's
like a lot of other movement options
that you can use in it like you know
directional air dodging coming back in
wave landing being like a big part of
that so I don't think wavedashing is
coming back though what about ice
wobbling no they already demonstrated
that that's not coming back either so
that's too bad wobbling is this
technique that ice climber players use
where like because there's two of them
they can just grab you and just like you
up and you can't get out of the grab
that's like a guaranteed kill out of
time yes Wow but I thought the ice
climbers of all would be so difficult it
but it's really hard to you
to do is the thing is like a very
advanced technique because like you have
to time the hits like perfectly and so
often like be really sensitive about how
you press the buttons so they got rid of
that in this one because I know it like
when you play for the ice climbers now
when you grab them the other ice climber
doesn't copy your movements anymore the
other ice climber just like stands there
I was like hey what's up mmm
so yeah they're like wobbling it's not
gonna be bad they're trying to make the
game a little bit more competitive
because from reading your story it
sounded like melee was it was really
hard it provided a handful of unfair
advantages the people that actually knew
how to utilize yeah right yeah which
which like I I think from from a player
perspective is very annoying like from
from a pro perspective somebody that
plays the game a lot they probably loved
it because you're gonna win like 99 like
much more exciting to watch like when
you're talking about these like
advantages that only pros know how to do
if everyone knows how to do it though
then like it's way more exciting to
watch I guess it's like the closest
example I can like make an analogy to is
like the MMA where like these are all
like advanced fighting techniques but
everyone knows how to do it so it's like
much more entertaining to watch yeah
cool any other questions by the way yeah
there's another good one from Sur enjoy
as always Alfred you got news on smash
competitive scene smash boards which is
a home for the smash community are doing
a Super Smash Brothers ultimate
Invitational already how are they doing
it like do they have access to the game
I don't know about that but I'm sure
they're just setting a date in it yeah
yeah well means I'll check out I mean if
it's an invitation or although I don't
think I'm gonna get an invite so like
cuz they're probably gonna invite like
pro players and not journalists who'd
you like just think that they're good at
the game by the way how did you get to
play the game because it doesn't really
is until to Sam so they had a demo at
Nintendo like the New York store they
had it like during e3 from like
Wednesday to Friday and I went on a
Thursday around like 1:00 p.m. ish I
kind of went so that like I'd avoid like
the pre-work crowd and the after-school
kids so like this is like the ideal time
where only people that snuck off out of
work to play would do and yeah there was
like no line when I went and I saw a
photo from Friday when like everyone
wasn't
working and there was like a massive
line that day so it was just the
short-term demo like if I can today it
wouldn't be available stinks access to
that full roster though
no no they only had like the demo
character so Ridley wasn't in it who
else was it like Jigglypuff wasn't in it
like they they had like the main
character so plus they had some new ones
like the the inkling the splatoon
character oh yeah of course are gonna
tap that that's the yeah new yeah is
that the only new because everything
else is returning
well Ridley and oh that's clearly a big
deal yeah you did you win by the way did
you play another human or look ya played
another guy who also snuck off during
his lunch break nice you know let me
interview him because he's like I gotta
get back to work I'm like yeah before
yeah I don't want your boss finding out
this is where you were during lunch so
the we like I said we got like two
matches like they were both like 2
minutes and 30 seconds and in the first
match I was trying to like figure out
all the new stuff like oh this is how
fast you fall around this is how you can
grab the ledge and stuff now and I was
trying to figure all that stuff out he
just kept fighting me and I didn't want
to be like hey hey for an article okay
so I was like okay whatever then the
second match I just beat him up so nice
cuz I was like I gotta get a photo of me
winning that's it's all I care about
nicely done well I'm interested Alfred
are you going woo too fast are you going
to buy as soon as it comes out I'm
release date are you gonna gonna like
sit back and wait and get there casually
I'm probably gonna get her on release
day I mean I like went to like the
midnight release for the 3ds version
which came out like a month earlier than
the Wii U version and for brawl and that
came out I found a store that was
willing to release it like three days
earlier than the actual release date and
how much did you pay them it was like
$10 more oh but even before that I like
there was this one store in like Coney
Island that was doing play through like
you paid like five bucks to play it for
an hour so I liked it because they had
like the Japanese version of the game so
I like went there to play that for for
like a good while before I came out
publicly at this point I'd like to throw
out a disclaimer for anybody that
doesn't care about Super Smash Brothers
this is probably the last time we're
gonna talk this again Siviglia battle to
select December but in December
if you want to like just skip watching
the podcast for like about a week or two
it's gonna be like Walt Whitman
challenge then though yeah I'm putting
my friend code out there and see if any
of our viewers want to play me I was
gonna ask if you were interested in
doing that because I was thinking about
volunteering mine too I just got a
switch I just be Odyssey I would totally
be up for having some more people to
play with yeah I don't get on dad often
but at the very least I was gonna see if
you wanted to have a tourney Alfred here
local I'm sure we could get Joey in the
lab to play yeah we should also do a
cash prize we should do a cash prize
like I don't know like like how much
like $500 yeah you a cash prize among
like our office oh okay cool
oh you're saying like take a internal
pool yes yes I I would love to take all
your money yes you definitely would I'm
not saying I'm good at the game but I
have fond memories of playing melee yeah
now I'm gonna have to like buy a switch
and start playing immediately because
that's in the meantime I need to beat
you in the meantime we can also start a
rocket League team I just got rocket
League again so that one's not that easy
I've been playing smash 4 on the 3ds the
last few days though like just to prep
for smash ultimate just getting like the
the physics are more similar to that one
than melees that game is it's not fun I
don't like II sorry if you guys play
smash more but it's not a fun game well
anyways somebody's looking for more
switch friends out there go ahead and
tweet at us tweet at me I'd be happy to
get some more friends on switch and
we're also at the 359 party because
Mario Tennis is gonna come out this
Friday I'm getting this I totally missed
the boat on that one it's coming out on
Friday it's gonna be really fun I'm glad
I got all my like Alexa for hospitality
questions I just gonna relax let you
guys keep talking about video games we
actually want to take a quick pivot
syringe ORS got one more good question
what will I be Em's debate or base its
arguments on
I mean how vetted will its research
source be what if its sighting fake news
and trolls
it's just Rick and Morty episodes yeah
it just took the scripts for them and
just learned based off that it's a it's
a good question I would assume because
this was a project that IBM had been
working on internally like as
researchers for years that they were
vetting most of the information
are all the information and and like
using the sources whether it was like
the New York Times or like certain
scholarly publications as like the
backup so I like fake news yeah fake
news indeed I I would I initially
thought that this was like a pretty
basic concept where all he did was like
create little scripts for certain things
but I think it was pretty interesting
that it tries to like figure out like
stuff on the fly like that so what if I
went to the master baiter every time and
I was like I know you are but what am I
say that sentence again slowly no we're
not I keep the IBM today yeah you write
a bit of a Freudian slip no that's not
true it's very I know you are below like
yeah every time I just went to the
equity IBM do bears like no you and I
just kept that that was my reply the
whole time all right whatever what if
like project debater just like totally
flipped out after you did that like
three or four times they'd be like just
go to your right
no you know dinner for you Alfred no you
I think it'd be funnier if you just
tried to answer only in memes and the
thing just got dumber and dumber ooh
what'd I do yeah challenge accepted I
think we are out of time that was
actually a fun episode unlike the other
one yeah I'm like all of the other ones
but thanks everybody for joining us
we'll be back tomorrow with episode 417
I don't know what the hell we're talking
about we only ever figure - no it's not
