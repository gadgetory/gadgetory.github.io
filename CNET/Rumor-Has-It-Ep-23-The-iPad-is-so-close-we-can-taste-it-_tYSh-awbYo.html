now it's tuesday march six 2012 and
welcome to rumor has it I'm Kareem levy
and I'm Emily Dreyfus and you are tuned
into the Internet's tackiest gambling
show where each week we round up the
hottest rumors and decide which ones are
true and which ones are pure fantasy and
then we bet and then we bet on them and
in fact actually the bedding board this
week is back to equal we're at a tie
again oh right because of the cannon the
cannon mark my 53 yeah thing that we
didn't bet on the actual date it was
coming out we just bet it was coming out
soon came out and Laura Gruden held in
her arms like a lovely baby totally so
now we're we both have a point on the
board halation day for last month when
Emily didn't win I don't wanna say lost
yet she lost thank you thank you mama
mia we're gonna do that next week
because we have something kind of funny
ya later today we are going to go out
into the streets to create a hilarious
humiliation day video for you and so
don't miss it next week that's next week
Sancho before we get into our show we
have something very important to talk
about I think Steven wants to uh yes
I'll take it from here we have we have
an imitator what it was to say imitation
is the highest form of flattery yeah
yeah yeah I'm flattered or not flattered
you mad yeah this is terrible Emmitt
imitators yeah so we got a voicemail
from Nathan in Australia and he's gonna
he's going to kind of set this up for us
so let's take a listen hey rumor has it
this is nice and calling from Australia
I'm just going said I was absolutely
mortified when listening to this new
circle podcast called the cult car I
should when they copied your idea of yay
9 section and didn't even give you any
credit for apple steals other people's
paintings but I've been seized Apple
podcast did the same anyway I thought
you might be interested to know that
these people are copying your ideas so
we are interested on a hand a lawsuit of
the show and then we got another email
about an email about who I thought was
the same guy no I didn't remember what
the voicemail is the name was and it's a
different person let's see if i could
find that email he was like two minutes
in they do this and I was like okay now
that two people have said it we have to
take it seriously we have to investigate
yes we are on the wrong got an email
from Robbie Barrett who is also on the
case detective robby who said to listen
to cult cast number two about a minute
or two in what we do not advise that do
not listen to it unless you want to
comment on them their stuff and say you
copied rumor has it who did it first
yeah yeah and then he said you should
sue them so basically two people have
advised us to take this law and torah
now I do know a bunch of law school
dropouts perfect that's exactly Lori so
we're gonna round up her gaggle of
lawsuit dropouts and sue the pants off
of beep beep I'm not gonna say their
name yes let me say their name I did
some investigating and I actually pulled
an excerpt from the show and this is
this is him verbatim copying our segment
it's it's I don't like it you might
expect there are lots of juicy iPad
rumors and stories talked about and I
thought to kind of get through all the
rumors quickly we could play a fun new
game you get eye cream may create hours
ago called yay or nay
and you're going to say yay if you
believe the rumor to be true and that
we're gonna see that rumor happen we're
gonna say nay if you believe it to be
inaccurate yeah your name and he created
it literally several hours ago why did
he have to say nothing that that
listeners and viewers should know is
that they started that like two weeks
ago and we went back into our records
and I decided when was it that Emily
came in one morning and said Kareem we
will now be doing this and green was
like wait stop what do you mean and it
was februari seventh yes day we first
and he viewed yay or nay yea or nay if
they start using our music and theme
whatever that the thing that Stephen
made yeah and if they do Cano's intro oh
then we'll really know yeah that they're
basically just spicing up our show no it
could be coincidence but seriously back
off our turf yeah this is our somebody
said the solution is obvious call let's
see Big Rob the solution is obvious call
them out on Twitter and allow the
internet to run its course thank you
that's exactly right that's what will
happen is they will be booed out of the
country okay internet works in
mysterious ways okay but now we've
gotten that out of our system let us get
to our special episode guys I know you
know what's coming you see this from a
mile away tomorrow Apple is having an
ipad event and likely they are
announcing the new ipad and i think that
there's consensus among the people of
the world but that's what's gonna happen
so we are gonna have a special ipad
focused show today and for all you Apple
haters I'm so sorry but this is one
thing that i will tell you because we're
having the show today we won't have to
have it ever again yeah until the iphone
sorry yeah sorry that's a week it'll be
all android and webos no no I want me
know I bless but will be Android and it
will be Windows Phone and it'll be
wonderful but today we've gotta take the
bull by the horns and talk about the
ipad before we have to that's our job
and it's not because we're getting paid
by Apple it's not because we work for
Apple secretly or not fatty it's because
there's I mean this is what is happening
in the world tomorrow there is an event
and we've been talking about rumors
since I don't know ninety four episodes
baby
yeah um and the thing is this eat
whether or not you want the ipad the
device that's going to come out tomorrow
there's so much hype surrounding it
there's so many eyes on it that it's
going to be really really important can
it live up to the hype will it be a
game-changer has Apple managed to get
the retina display does anyone care will
it be more expensive it's all going to
have a huge impact on the technology
world and on the market so let's get
down to the rumors that we think are
really gonna happen all right the first
one is the rumor that I think has been
going around since last July that the
ipad the new ipad will not be called
ipad 3 but will rather be called ipad HD
I can't believe this rumors been coming
around since July that's pretty yeah oh
yeah I mean anything in July it was all
anonymous sources and we were drinking
rum every time anyone spoke about it
because this is you know we drink
whenever anyone mentions an anonymous
source but just yesterday our cnet news
Apple blogger Josh Lowensohn confirmed
with a trusted source now granted this
is an anonymous source we said you
should all drink even though one of our
people but he spoke by phone to a apple
app developer who has been right before
right and so has a proven track record
in Josh's mind who confirmed one hundred
percent without a doubt that the ipad is
going to be called ipad HD now to me
this rings completely true because as
we've been hearing and as people who've
been listening to this podcast for all
24 episodes will know the big feature
that is the main reason why there even
is going to be a redesigned ipad is to
get a Retina display a higher resolution
jam more pixels into that display that's
why apple's doing it that's that is I
mean that the way that they could fail
tomorrow is by not delivering this high
def display because everyone assumes
it's coming so and and even though like
it was called iPad that was called ipad
2 and they do that with the iphone they
have like a numerical way of doing
things they have in the past deviated
from that right by calling out the big
feature and that is was the first time
they did that was the iphone 3g right
which without exactly which was the
reason to even create a new iphone at
that time was because it was suddenly
going to have 3g which was at that point
a really big deal it wasn't going to be
a slow little slow poke running its data
on an edge network I remember those
never that does news like eons ago yeah
but so because this one feature is so
hyped it kind of to me make sense that
they would call out that feature because
realistically a lot of people are saying
and I think Kareem and iron and Stephen
are in consensus it's not gonna be a new
shape they want the way the old covers
to fit it want the old apps that are
designed for a four by three aspect
ratio to work you know right because
everybody exactly because that's their
banking on how many apps they have right
now totally and they wouldn't scrap
those thousands and thousands of ads by
apps by and ads and adds exactly and
revenue um by changing the shape and
size so I think the big thing is gonna
have is a huge high high def high res
and that is how they're gonna convince
little old people like me who literally
bought my ipad to what six months ago
yeah the other day the other I mean and
granted thought was a while ago and I
still love it and I'm not gonna get rid
of it but this is the way they're gonna
make me try try to convince me to go
further into debt to buy their new shiny
toy well and I still have the first
generation iPad and I'm like new ureter
totally well and what's funny when I was
talking with I hung out with my parents
as weekend I hung out with some of their
friends and I was like and they were
asking me what I thought was going to be
the big news on Wednesday because now
I'm a rumor expert obviously and and I
was like well i think you know it's
going to have an HD display or the
retina display and they were amazed that
it didn't already have that because
they're like i have an ipad 2 and it
looks unreal look so much better even
than my iphone and I'm like I don't even
know how I mean it's basically you're
gonna be like in India head of it well
how is it gonna fit how's it gonna get
anybody well know what they're gonna do
is I can tell you exactly they are going
to cram in um it's going to be better
than 1080p basically it's going to be
2048 x 1536 pixels so essentially
they're going to double the amount of
pixels in the screen it's going to be
like in real life and I actually totally
agree with your parents that like the
iPad
you already looks wonderful i watch
movies on it i watch HBO go on and it's
crisp it's clear a beautiful however
sometimes you can see where it falls
apart when you interact with live
streaming with facetime now part of the
problem with facetime because the
cameras off right I bet do is so bad so
hopefully the new iPad tomorrow we'll
have a better camera and I'm sure that
that'll be like the last thing they even
mention at the announcement because it's
not a big deal but it'll make things a
lot better but I mean I'm just freaking
out like imagine if they make the camera
really really great then this high res
HD when you FaceTime with people you're
gonna be so distracted by being like
look at my look at how amazing I look or
like how did I look you're like you know
you have that moment like I'm looking
pretty good oh yeah things are going
pretty great and then you see yourself
in HD and you're like oh god I really
gotta reevaluate my place hopefully and
my makeup situation or he'll be like
actually grandma I don't want a face
time with you right now because I'm a
little scared sorry grandma um but so
basically that's um one rumor I pad HD
not ipad 3 great the next rumor is that
it may be running iOS 6 now this is a
controversial rumor I tweeted about this
earlier today and every single person on
Twitter it appeared to me said Oh
dummies I was 6 and I lost all respect
for you when you said the word something
oh you just lost two hours I don't know
I did I lost your mother like someone
called me on more on now I will have you
know winner that ARS technica another
little tech blog found iPads running
ios6 in their traffic logs now that does
not mean at all that the device coming
out tomorrow is going to be running iOS
6 all it means is that something dubbed
iOS 6 on an iPad which could very easily
be iPad tues or read that let's not have
to invite s let's also point out that
they pinpointed this to uh what what
what yeah 14 oh yeah yeah so it was from
Apple headquarters it wasn't just
I mean and that makes sense right
because they're testing the other
texture and I mean Apple does as we know
from the times they've lost iPhones in
bars they do give their developers and
their testers devices to take out into
the world and take home with them like
the other day when I was at my friend's
house and he was using an iphone that
had a little developer number on it it
was a prototype and he is all trying to
show me pictures of his baby and I was
like yeah I'm pretending to look at the
pictures of your baby but really I'm
memorizing the prototype number eight in
the house her I was like so Emily what
was it she's like no I'm not it i have
it i googled it i just it doesn't come
up i don't know what it is yeah 2446
memorized it oh I totally didn't look at
those amazingly gorgeous baby photos for
you I sacrifice yeah not so new for 46
means something somewhere to some baby
yeah or maybe he's nothing but what I'm
saying is I think that that that is
probably not even a new iphone I'm sure
that was like an old old old prototype
but what I'm saying is that it peep they
do give devices out to test but these
I've pads that were found running iOS 6
on ours técnicas traffic logs on sup
using safari were located in cupertino
at apple headquarters the testing was
happening in house so I mean to me that
means I don't know what maybe it's not
that far along in development all right
and it's just interesting that like they
just found it now like when there's an
event coming you know what i mean so
maybe it is coming out soon tomorrow
yeah not however like when mountain lion
was being tested they found evidence of
it in logs six months before it came out
so the fact that they just found
evidence of it means that maybe it's
very much still in production however if
it were to have iOS 6 that would be very
interesting for us because I mean the
new iPad would then who knows what it
would have it right have more
capabilities in terms of different touch
gestures and that would drive with the
rumor that you're gonna discuss in a
moment I know that is there maybe
there's no home button yeah which is
crazy um yes sirree as well i mean well
series on iOS 5 right well what's
interesting about the iOS 6 is like I
feel like this is the first time that
I've heard this rumor like it just
happened the other day and
and all these other rumors like the HD
or no home button you know there's just
yet a lot of chatter about that and so
this iOS 6 thing seems like it just came
out of nowhere and like I don't know I
feel well we could bet on it later but I
feel like it is a little premature for
it to happen tomorrow because we just
started hearing about it and usually we
hear about something for a thousand
years before it happened totally exactly
so yeah it's interesting though that it
just happened I mean it's kind of a
coinky and probably they will announce
something like oh and also there's gonna
be a new I work and a new ilife suite
and therefore you're gonna have to
download iOS 5.2 right in the six months
alright so as Emily mentioned the other
rumoured that is going to be big is uh
that the ipad 3 may cast off far away
the home button which would be a huge
departure from their design so when
Apple sent out its ipad event invite
last week everybody freaked out over the
missing home button in the photo as you
can see there is you know an apple
always when they when they send out
invites or they always have like a
secret message like their wednesday the
seventh like that's when the date is and
oh god what why isn't there a home
button like that just yeah seemed a
little bit too coincidental to not mean
anything so people were quick to point
out that the ipad in the picture is
actually maybe on its side is that
landscape yeah and i was immediately i'm
showing is that you can move the dock to
the side so like cuz what in that image
the doc is down below where you would
normally find the home button but maybe
what they're showing is that that doc
can be moodle little slider rather than
staying cuz it always stays on on the
normal one oh you know oh i see that's
interesting yeah i forgot that that
happens i guess i could have brought the
ipad in here i I was gonna bring mine
into it I can oh so anyway so people are
you know commenting and they were
looking you can tell that it's in
landscape because of how far away the
apps are spaced from each other like
they were I mean they were looking at it
in so much detail that I barely even
noticed that the home button was missing
when I looked at that picture until josh
lowensohn like made that picture with
like a pugio the day there's like
meeting here look here so I was like wow
that's pretty crazy but I don't know so
iOS was at 4.3 wrong with it the
touch screen jesters as you were just
mentioning where you can like move with
four fingers you can use your hands kind
of like what the mac OS x 10 mountain
lion 90 I am a stabbing robot I am a
stabbing robot you guys that's five
voices my boy e-roc reference I don't
think that counts as a as a voice that
was a five that's five five win um so
anyway so the touch gestures have been a
thing there you know that you could
already do it on your trackpad on your
Mac you can already do it on your iPad
so you can swipe with four fingers you
can do this to close an app you can
whatever so the home button is kind of I
don't want to say unnecessary because
frankly I don't use the touch stressors
I have them enabled but I still click on
the button or double-click to bring up
all the apps that I have open heart over
and so I guess they're kind of moving in
that direction that you don't really
need the home button the home button
really only gets you back to your I
think of the home button is like the
button of last resort yeah gotten too
far into your app and you're like I must
go back must abort abort mission work
and push it so hey exactly this will
self-destruct so I mean I guess that
button might not necessarily be
necessary unless you you're looking for
Siri because you hold on to it up series
so if they get rid of the home button
does that mean that Siri won't be there
well Siri just be like another app on
the dock Thank You Siri have our own
special touch screen thing regal like
nothing here we come maybe you have to
make all those voices and faces together
on sir you have you seen um how I
windows 8 unlocks I was playing with we
have a tablet that has windows 8 they
down on it and it's really cool it
unlocks with like a touch password and
intersex Rosenblatt has it set up that
like so when it's when it is not on and
when it's locked it has a picture of his
motorcycle and then he has a secret
password that involves him touching the
images of his motorcycle in exactly the
right weird pattern and that's the
unlock that's pretty awesome so that's
maybe you have to unlock Syria like that
your LCD on write my name I mean the
whole gun the funny thing about Syria
those the whole point is to make it like
easier
text message while you're driving and
like to do all this time I mean I guess
you don't know surely need to do your
ipod if you're like sex xx 1 yeah like
drawing her face on the screen like a
love letter to Syria by that time is
crashed and then you're like Siri get
the police and she's like you want to
listen you want to listen to the police
okay so anyway so this rumor about the
the myth that you know getting rid of
the home button has been around since
the ipad 2 came out when touch gestures
came out so interesting it's kind of
interesting to note we'll see you know
yeah maybe it is that the doc is now
moving to its side which will be
exciting but not as exciting as a
redesign totally um but this is a very
controversial rumor I mean some people
are like of course though everything's
moving in the direction of touch screen
only and other people are like that
puttan is perfect yeah don't shut my
move the button yeah I hope they don't
cuz then how are you gonna hard boot I
mean my phone gets stuck and I have to
hard boot it sometimes right that's true
cuz right now you have to click the top
thing I've never had to hard boot my my
iPad though someone would shoot I know
my first generation iPad is probably
they're probably sending things to it
right now to break it so i buy an ipad 3
i'm sure there is that lasting longer
than we thought dad oh my god over the
air update to home buddy stop working so
anyway okay so the next rumor that might
happen tomorrow that has been loud and
clear in the rumor mill is that Apple is
prepping an eight gig ipad 2 like they
did when they released the iphone 4s
they then said that the iphone 4 will be
8 gigs and will be ninety nine dollars
so in order to compete with all the
stuff that they're not tablet and the
cattle fires that remove that both have
eight gig versions right so then so and
and they're a little bit cheaper I don't
think they're going to drop the price
much but if the ipad 2 is still going to
be on store shelves and then they
release kind of a cheaper version it's
their way of being like all right fine
you guys can have this thing why
wouldn't they do that because it's like
I know you know yeah it's not an apples
like their mentality to like compete
directly like that with other people but
I mean if they did it with the iphone
they might as well do it with this one
my gut tells me that this is not
something Apple would do with the iPad
because they kind of invented the tablet
market there they run they run the show
they develop they created the need and
they don't I don't think they really do
need to compete with kindle fire and not
tablet because they're not really the
nook tablet and the end the Kindle Fire
competing with that each other you're
like oh they're competing for the like
five percent of the market that the
iPads not dominating right and a beat
master in the chat room has a good point
says that they need cheaper iPads for
selling ibooks to school that is true
which is a good a good thing but the
only problem I see with an eight gig
ipad is you know I have a 16 gigabyte
which is the smallest iPad watching and
I was like this is gonna last me forever
and ever I don't I'm not gonna cut ever
and all of a sudden i'm downloading fifa
that soccer game and it's like one
gigabyte i had to delete everything and
look the thing with iCloud is that your
games still exist in the cloud you don't
know if like rebuy them you can just
redownload them and kind of switch up so
it's like you're saving your stuff in
the cloud but it sucks like that i mean
not also waiting almost set up your ipad
i think that like just the system takes
up four gigs right which was shocking
and i guess it on an eight gig they
would have a more like stripped-down
system because that would be half of
your memory yeah so i don't know but
without an expandable memory like an SD
card slot or ever will not happen that
was definitely not going to happen so
without that I mean that's how the
kindle fire the nuke tablet has a SD
card yeah I guess yandel Fire doesn't
but interesting tablets big selling
point and i also think like if they did
do this they created an 8 gigabyte ipad
that would be cheaper it would not be
the magic number of 199 that the nook
tablet and the kindle fire are i just
don't think i will can go that low i
don't think they will go totally not if
it has a Retina display which they're
gonna be paying a lot to make and is
well this is for the ipad 2 ipad 2 is
gonna be eight gig not an ipad you're
saying it won't uh they're gonna release
us like they did they released the eight
gig iphone 4 when they did that iphone
4s yeah does that change your mind a
little bit no i don't know don't it
doesn't change my mind but it does make
me think that maybe it would be a little
bit cheaper because i was think
that you did this little ass till like
one hundred and fifty dollars more than
the kindle fire which I still think
maybe is true the starting point would
be like 350 right instead of 499 yeah
but interesting very interesting so
we'll see all that tomorrow so let's
take a quick quick break so we can
regroup and get ourselves and we'll see
you on the other side television is
about to change and we're the ones who
are going to change it hello what would
you like to watch introducing Sri TV the

you
and we're back thanks for joining us
again on the other side of the break um
so we just ran down a couple apple
rumors for tomorrow's event emily has a
couple more that we're going to just yay
or nay on later yeah I just want to
bring the mention two more features that
people expect to get in the ipad and
that are really exciting first would be
the a6 processor chip and most likely it
will have I believe it probably will
have a new chip the question is will the
a6 actually be quad-core because that's
the thing that was rumored to be coming
out in June yeah core asus quad-core a6
and maybe it won't be called the asics
if it's not quad core but Donald Bell in
his predictions post Ryan down really
good reasons why they would not want a
quad-core chip in this new ipod because
it would slow it down or and because it
would ruin the battery life that's the
main issue right which people would
freak out they hate bad back however you
need a lot of power and processing power
to run the graphics that are going to be
wanting that we're going to want on
something that has such a good HD
display if they have it so I don't know
I'm not sure that's up in the air and
then the next one is whether or not it
will have 4G data right and people are
super into that rumors yeah I think it
will have forces now AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon
both have 4G networks that are in more
places they're way more reliable than
they were before and iPads do come with
a data requirement and with the moment
that 3g was available they were on 3g so
i think that it is there's a strong
likelihood that the data version of the
new ipad will be able to run 4g and in
that case it'll be so fast but then
we're all gonna feel like idiots I don't
know Moe I don't know what we're
thinking before we think it yes but
those are the last 2 i've had rumors
that i just want get on the table
alright so let's move away from the ipad
for really quick for just a second and
there was a rumor that came out this
week that portals valve will release a
steam box console according to overcome
so valve which is the company behind the
hit computer game portal which i haven't
played but i've heard people getting we
are alive sucked away into that
that's what portal about yet I spent
like six months playing this game yeah
that's what i've heard which is why i
can't pick it up because you'll never
see me again because I get totally
immersed in these kinds of games and
there are also the people behind the
popular online game downloading system
steam has been working on a hardware and
or has sorry been working on hardware
and software for a steam box which is a
set-top console that would rival the
xbox 360 the playstation 3 and even
Apple TV according to a report from the
verge sorry I citing unnamed sources
drinking now there's I just caught a
copy editing mistake that they spelled
citing wrong I'll go in and fix that
later this device could be released at
e3 in June or the game developers
conference which is like this right now
Jesus yeah I this breeze from last week
so I guess it's next month but it suits
me so holy crap this is what my notes a
holy crap this would rock everyone's
world which would be so I had to do a
little bit of research by talking to
some friends who play the steam which is
Sparkman from the chat room and he was
telling me that he's played some steam
games a little bit basically it's
downloaded games from their site that
you download onto your computer or
whatever and you can play it on you even
have a mobile app I guess it's a nap
whatever mobile you can play it on your
mobile device you can play it on your
Mac you can play it on your pc and it's
PC games that you can play anywhere even
if your computer isn't necessarily a
gaming computer because you're it
doesn't need the resources i guess that
a gaming computer hey yeah i think it
like allows you to it offload some of
the work load onto their servers their
Soviet even if you have not as you don't
have an alienware tower computer that
can do it it can supplement so that you
can play the great good game and so and
it's not like streaming necessarily it
is downloaded onto your computer but
yeah so it's a little bit maybe it's
kind of like how the kindle fire works
like some of the stuff is happening up
there and some of the stuff is happening
on your i remember when it first came
out dan ackerman was like ace is blowing
my mom yeah and summoning the chatroom
said that they were talking about it
yesterday in labs cast so I think this
so this is blowing everybody's mind um
so what's interesting about this rumor
is that day if they are creating a
set-top box and the rumor doesn't say
that they will be doing that by
themselves so they're not going to get
into the hardware manufacturing business
yet they might partner with alienware or
dell or I guess dell isn't dell
alienware i think dell is alienware yeah
okay sorry that was actually I'm not
positive um anyway there might be
partnering with a hardware manufacturer
to create the set-top box and the it
will even be able to is dull yeah it is
Adela's alienware the steam box will be
able to serve up games from its rival
which is EA's origin which is really
good job opens up their game library and
what's cool about steam is that they put
a lot of their older games on sale
they're usually a lot cheaper than
buying them at the store from amazon or
whatever so steam is a really cool
system having its own dedicated box
means that you can do all your gaming
through this one box you know rather
than having it take up resources from
your other stuff or whatever yeah I read
everything or I heard someone speaking
about how Ackerman was saying that this
may be vaporware mmm because this
something like this happened in the past
where a game company said oh we're gonna
create a whole new device that is
optimized for our games and when it
finally came out it was just a computer
oh and it was basically just a gaming
computer and so I'm I think that it'll
be very interesting to see if this turns
into an actual legit gaming console
right is a set-top box or if it's just
like a computer that's optimized to run
steam totally well and then what was
cool about that little you know the
diagram that they had in the in that
story was that it looked like an Xbox
controller and yeah which all the
buttons yes and if I'd like yes buttons
or I don't I mean I guess you don't
because it's all pc games but if you
need like an X button or this button
were a rolly wheel yeah that's the only
switch out the components so that's a
pretty neat way of doing things that
might be the future maybe you know maybe
more a controller should be like that
although I really do love my xboxes
controller it's big it's ergonomic and I
finally have learned what the RT and LT
and art whatever buttons arm where they
are so I don't die while I'm like
looking like this
I also think that something like this
makes sense because like classic really
dedicated consoles may not be long for
this world I hate to say it but right
when I get one like neither like goodbye
well I heard a person from EA talking
about how the next generation of xbox
and ps3 may really be the last ones and
then from that moment on it's going to
be sort of focused more on like creating
a universe that is melded together for
gaming that is a mobile pc and other
things which would then in that
direction be basically desktop and
mobile gaming that have the power to
have the graphics of games on ps3 and
xbox right which is I mean it's just
kind of like how maybe the new PS Vita
is because you don't like by actual
games anymore like you download that
you're just you just are using this
device to play games that exists that
you're downloading or in the cloud but
it is a dedicated piece of hardware
writes really interesting to see I mean
maybe it's just that people are
constantly saying but it's gonna die
dedicated gaming hardware is gonna be
dead in a few years and maybe it never
happens yeah well I don't know if it
isn't especially and I would be sad if
it did because I like having a dedicated
box and and it's cool that the Box can
do other things like watch Netflix HBO
Go every that eight that you know the
next box on yet so I wanted to come to
ps3 come on HBO you know i just bought a
little like a six dollar DVI to hdmi
thing to hook up my computer to my TV so
i can watch HBO go and now there was a
rumor the other day that it might come
to xbox and so i just spent six dollars
from nothing oh I need to see my brother
all right okay so let's move on I think
that we should just I'm gonna basically
duck timer myself on this next room or
because who cares about you the doctor
I'm sure yeah this is about this next
rumor is about an apple subscription TV
service and it comes from macrumors a
report claims that Apple is interested
in offering entire channels as apps that
could be used on a number of the
company's devices including the apple TV
which may be getting a refresh tomorrow
at the ipad event and potentially the
apple branded television set that is in
the works so the Wall Street Journal
said something about this a little while
ago that said
basically said that Tim Cook is focusing
on trying to do this to try to get
content subscribe partnerships with
movie companies and TV companies and NBC
and CBS and blah blah blah to provide
content their way because Apple believes
they know how to do it better and Walter
Journal said that they had created a new
technology for delivering video but then
did not say exactly what that was and so
basically this is just another example
of Apple kind of wanting to control
video they dominate music with with the
ipod and they sort of created that whole
online market they managed to make
really good deals with publishers for
ibooks though it was a struggle but but
Apple has not managed to do that with
Hollywood they have not had as much luck
and a lot of people it's hard to woo
Hollywood you got to take him out to the
right restaurant right right on the
Rights take seriously no I mean you
honestly really have two people said
that that was why Google TV failed was
because Google didn't go news moves the
right way they didn't do the old-school
schmoozing they showed up with their
Silicon Valley outfits on they weren't
dressed up they didn't take them to the
ivy in beverly hills and the people in
Hollywood really you don't know how to
win us over you did it wrong that's so
old school I love it it actually makes
me like feel good about everything I
play that there's little old timey
things very only old-timey red wine and
a good steak yes how you that's how you
got a deal in this town yeah well I know
it's like if you're wearing the right
baseball cap and you have to order a
Caesar salad from the right restaurant
an Arnold Palmer yeah but I I think this
would be kind of cool mainly because
what this would be saying is that you
could download the Bravo app the
Showtime app I would imagine or the NBC
app and then you could get your what the
TV that you want instead of having to
pay for bundles dr. timer so I think
doesn't it might be going in this
direction I think that if Apple's trying
to do it I applaud them I want to be
able to have choices like that I'm not
sure that it's going to work but I think
that everyone would feel liberated by
being able to say look I just want an
app for NBC Bravo Showtime Food Network
and whatever the channel is that my
boyfriend likes to watch that has top
shot oh that's good it's the worst show
on television but I watch it anyways
as of love for love in the right right
musing buy you a steak and a glass of
wine yeah like behind what I'll do
anything so all right so let us how
