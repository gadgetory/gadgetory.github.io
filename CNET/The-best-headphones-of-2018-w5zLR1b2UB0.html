got a few top holiday headphone picks
for you let's start with the popular
premium noise cancelling category or in
the past Bose has dominated but this
year I give the Editors Choice Award to
the Sony WH 1000 X mark 3 Sony tweaked
the design of the mark 3 and it's now
right there with the Bose in terms of
comfort it delivers excellent sound and
noise canceling is loaded with features
and has strong battery life it's only
downside is that well it's expensive at
$350 Bose QuietComfort 35 - remains a
good choice in this category but the
Sony is just a little bit better right
now my second pick is the Jabra elite
active 65 T their set of truly wireless
earphones that compete with Apple's air
paws not only do they fit some people's
ears more securely than the air pods but
they also sound better because they have
a noise isolating design that doesn't
let sound leak in like the air pods open
design does I'm also a fan of
Plantronics do in your noise-cancelling
neck band Sall headphone the backbeat go
410 they're little like boses quiet
control 30 headphones but cost a lot
less and can plug into in-flight
entertainment systems with a headphone
cord that connects to its USB charging
port they're a good everyday headphone
that features good sound and good noise
cancelling moving on to my budget pick
the trivet X free tune it may not be as
comfortable as a Bose or Sony headphone
but you'd be hard-pressed to find a
better sounding or better built
full-size bluetooth headphone for 50
dollars
as far as sound goes it really does
measure up to headphones that cost a lot
more if none of those models sounds
enticing I've got plenty of others to
choose from in our full gift guide these
days there's no shortage of headphones
and we'll be covering all the best ones
