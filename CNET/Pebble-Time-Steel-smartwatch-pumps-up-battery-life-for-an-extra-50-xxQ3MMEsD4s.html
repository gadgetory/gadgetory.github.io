I've got a pebble time steel on my wrist
pebble offers something different to the
equation than Apple watch and Android
wear because it feels a little more like
a watch what do I like about the latest
version that's available now for $250
this battery life battery life battery
life this thing gets up to an estimated
10 days of battery life between charges
the pebble time which cost $50 less gets
7 days the Apple watch gets about a day
Android wear a day or two so you don't
have to worry you can just charge us and
keep going and sleep with it and use
some of the fitness apps like the misfit
app for sleep tracking always-on this
display is reflective so you can use it
in bright daylight the screens always on
like a digital watch it's very easy to
read it has a backlight at night it gets
a little bit washed out looks more like
a gameboy with backlighting but the fact
that you can always peek at your wrist
big plus
funky watch faces there are so many
weird little fan made and make your own
watch face tools that pebble has on its
store almost all for free and you can
play around with these weird digital
ones strange weather ones little
homemade apps and you keep yourself
occupied the pebble time and pebble time
steel can store dozens of these apps on
your watch at any time but I don't like
its design is me it doesn't really catch
your eye people may think you're wearing
an Apple watch it doesn't look as nice
though as opposed to the original pebble
steel which came out about a year and a
half ago had a really standout retro
steel look this one compared to the
pebble time that is $50 less yeah it
doesn't really look like adds a lot to
the equation the pebble time steel comes
with a leather band that looks soso but
it will also have a steel link band that
steps up the looks we don't have that
yet and you can swap the bands out
pretty easily with a bunch of other
options price at $250 the pebble time is
less expensive than the Apple watch but
it's about the same price as many
Android wear watches yet it still feels
a little bit expensive and it's kind of
low tech this thing does get messages
via bluetooth and it does run some
fitness track
but it doesn't have heart rate tracking
it doesn't have nearly the level of
technical finesse that an Apple watch or
Android wear does you cannot make phone
calls with it however if you have an
Android phone you can use a built-in
microphone to dictate responses to
messages I love that the pebble time
steel feels more like a watch you don't
have to worry about I just don't know if
I would pay $250 for it
