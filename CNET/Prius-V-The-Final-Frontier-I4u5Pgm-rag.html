Nintendo's 3ds unveiled and launch games
announced new car tech from the 2011
Detroit Auto Show hot cop car is coming
to a rear view mirror near you and a
whole new fleet of priuses or pre I
hybrid cars are headed your way it's all
coming up right now
hi everyone I'm Molly wood and welcome
to the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer some unique
tech wisdom in the form of the bottom
line let's get started with the good in
our wrap-up of CES 2011 last week we
showed you Jeff Bakalar first look at
the Nintendo 3ds now there was only one
thing wrong with that demo the scream
didn't turn on well this week Nintendo
held an event in New York to officially
debut the working version of the three
DS plus show off some of the games that
will be coming soon to the platform hey
everyone I'm Jeff Bakalar prasina calm
we've got a first look at the Nintendo
3ds it's right here March 27 is a
release date is going to retail for two
hundred and fifty dollars three cameras
on this thing there's one facing the
user qu around back for 3d photos very
cool innovation right there you've got
an SD card slot Wireless compatibility
allows you to play on the go with people
around the world which is really
impressive over here is the notification
LED really going to give you a lot of
information about what's going on with
the 3ds really is going to deal with a
lot of the connectivity Wi-Fi base and
also local sort of stuff this will
really give you an idea of what's
happening with it
yes there's a lot of connectivity that's
automated with the 3ds so there's really
not a lot of manual configuration that's
going to have to happen the 3ds can
detect other systems and hook those up
automatically which is really cool up
front you've got the four buttons that
we're all used to on D s systems but on
the left side of the unit is the analog
stick which is new for Nintendo
portables really excited to see how
developers use that along the bottom are
three new buttons as well the Select
home and start buttons the home button
will allow you to pause mid game look
into other apps without losing the
action that's going on in the original
game we're excited to see stuff like
that they've also streamlined franco's
it's a lot easier now to play with
friends we're happy about that
improvement as well up top is the 3d
screen we actually have it turned off so
it's better for the camera we're also
looking at the knee maker software right
here you can take a photo of yourself in
the meme acre software will configure
the character to look like you which is
pretty cool we've never seen anything
like that before the 3ds is also
backwards compatible with the Nintendo
DS and all the downloadable dsi gamers
so we're happy to see that implemented
in the design as well at launch the 3gs
is going to be available in black or
there's also a lot of pre-loaded
software including a game called face
raiders that takes a photo of you and
inserts that into a shooting gallery
pretty cool there's a game tracker it's
an app that tracks all of your progress
through games and rewards you there is a
physical mobility monitor a sort of like
a pedometer that tracks movement your
physical movement with the device that's
something we've never seen also included
is the ability to take 3d photos that
you view them on the 3d screen can also
watch 3d videos on the top screen really
impressive stuff that's going to do it
for us to first look at the Nintendo 3ds
I'm Jeff Bakalar for CNN com thanks for
watching hey I'm Jeff Bakalar for
cnet.com we're here at the 3d as press
event in New York City we have
everything we need to know about the
hardware but what about the software why
don't you come with me and let's check
out some of these games
our first game demo is steel diver you
might remember the game as a tech demo
but Nintendo gave it its own game for
the 3ds it's going to be one of the
launch games and basically you're
controlling the submarine the height and
acceleration of the of the vehicle and
you get to shoot missiles there's also a
periscope mode we actually have to move
your entire body to shoot missiles at
oncoming shift so that's our first game
demo there's a lot more stuff this year
let's go check them out right now I
guess you can't release a new game
console without an atom so here it is
Madden football for 3ds please sort of
like how we used to on the iPad that
sort of experience but it's going to be
coming out very soon in the 3ds game
launch window we're really psyched to
get our final hands on it and that's it
for Madden football alright the next
game we've got is legend of zelda
ocarina of time it's a game you might
recall widely regarded as one of the
best zelda games ever
makeover for the 3gs the 3d really adds
something special to it the effect is
spectacular and it's going to make you
want to play the entire game over all
over again all right this is pilotwings
resort takes place in the scene
member from wii sports resort pilotwings
is a
you fly around and hit goals and use jet
packs the top balloons and stuff like
that really fun and the 3d effect on
this is so far the most impressive that
we've seen out of all the games here
it's a lot of fun gives you that really
realistic 3d flying effects there's a
lot more games I have to play Resident
Evil some point let's go check it out
alright this is super street fighter 4
like a 3ds completely rendered in 3d
this is a very interesting experience
because you're playing in one dimension
the backgrounds in another and you're
sort of you know its almost tough to
keep your eye on the action because
you're sort of looking around all over
the
but this is going to be one of
window title 3d s is coming soon can't
wait to play the final version let's see
what else we got alright we finally made
it this is resident evil mercenaries 3d
it's sort of like an all-star game it
features a lot of scenes from pests
Resident Evil games and combines them
into one sort of are you experienced by
far the best looking game we've seen
here at the event today and the 3d
effect is just awesome once you lock in
it really a spectacular alright there's
a lot of other games here that we didn't
get to like Nintendogs plus tax read
racer there's going to be a lot of stuff
available at launch but one thing we
want to sort of disclose to everyone is
you know all these games we've been
showing has had the 3d slider off now
you have to have it all so that the
camera is able to shoot the image and it
doesn't look all screwy but when you do
pick it up and you turn that 3d effect
on it works really well and once you're
locked into that sweet spot the game
actually is pretty spectacular that's
going to do it for us here in New York
at the three BS press event I'm Jeff
Bakalar for cnet com thanks so much for
watching that thing does look pretty
amazing and 250 bucks it's a bit less
than we thought it might be huh maybe if
I buy one for my son I can finally have
my iPad back now while most of us were
packing up our company issued long
sleeve t-shirts to return home from Las
Vegas and CES Brian Pooley was bundling
up for his trip to Detroit for the 2011
north american international auto show
why they scheduled them so close
together I will never know but Brian and
his crew were serious troopers and here
are some of their highlights
how do you say six just got a lot more
interesting it was always kind of the
feather hearing or their car in their
line great car sells well but either the
luxury of the eight or the nimbleness of
a four or a three or the sporting
pretentions of an r8 it was kind of you
know sober Audi but it's gotten really
well equipped now this is an all new
version although it doesn't look
dramatically different notice it's got a
shorter rump a little longer front so it
gives it a more rakish sporting look
underneath it's based on the seven one
of the very new Audi's that is a really
hot looking car a little more space and
volume all around we're also seeing
three familiar engines here a 3.2 v6 a
4.2 v8 or a 3 liter supercharged v6
inside quite a bit of revising of the
dash notice this kind of horizon band
across the top of the instrument panel
we've got a little different sculpting
hear of this centre stuff quite a bit of
LCD it's been pushed out right up
against the speedo in the tack and of
course we've got a really nice push and
swivel screen right here that is
controlled by Audi's familiar mm I
interface notice this I'm seeing now
borrowed from the a8 you've got the
touch pad here which we've shown you
before that can be used to draw letters
on the screen or in this case point2
radio presets what-have-you very cool
Audi only stuff even bigger news is this
audi a6 hybrid first time out he's had a
hybrid in a sedan or a passenger car
there's a q5 hybrid this will use the
same powertrain 2 liter little tiny
little turbo gas engine hooked up to a
45 horsepower electric motor now one of
the things they did come on back here
was to put a big old kludgy battery in
the trunk this is called a retrofit
folks not a completely re-engineered
platform now if you can put up with that
sacrifice you're going to get some
interesting numbers this thing is
supposed to be doing about 38 combined
MPG for a biggish car with a whole lot
of luxury goods rammed in it that's a
nice number and we'll be looking for
this guy hopefully sometime in 2012 the
distribution plans aren't firm that base
a6 with any of its conventional engines
happening late 2011 a long day shopping
or covering the detroit auto show you
come back to your ford c-max and what do
you know your hands are full tennis keys
in your pocket you can put one of these
down in the snow or the slush of the mud
or the wedding you know you pick it up
and it's also true it's a grocery bag
and the bottom rips out but they've got
something here called a hands-free
liftgate deal you take your leg and you
wave it underneath the middle to bumper
right about there and because I have the
RF key in my pocket the vehicle knows
and i'm authorized to get in here and
list the door for me off we go another
interesting thing forward showing here
at detroit this year is a way to keep
these guys from spending much time at
your front door regarding your kid it's
a new level of services on my key from
fortis have been around for a while but
now they've got two new functions one
you can set this up the key you give to
your teenager or anybody for that matter
to set the top speed at 65 70 75 or 80
for new tears for how fast they can go
top end it also can be set to block any
of the nasty channels on satellite radio
I'm talking to you Howard and previously
it's already had the ability to do
things like mute the radio until the
seatbelt is clicked also to maintain
radio volume at no more than forty four
percent you can almost rename it my
surly teen but if that's the only way
they're going to get the keys they'll
play ball and they might even smile last
bit of tech i want to show you they have
to do with you know consumer
satisfaction with this whole electrified
era Ford's got a couple things happening
in the future dashboard we've seen
myford touch before but a couple of
those screens are new one is called my
view it's going to show you the effect
of various vehicle systems on your range
not just how you drive but if the radio
is on if the heaters on if the lights
are on we don't need to be they all take
some juice out of the battery and we're
learning that that's a part of the
factors that will drive people nuts when
it comes to range anxiety and there's
another one in here called break coach
it tells you as you're driving and of
course that's using regenerative braking
an electric car if you've got all the
energy back you could have in that
breaking scenario so it'll say well you
just came to a stop you got about eighty
percent of the juice out of
the Yokota if you break a little
differently as I'll show you then I can
get a hundred percent of the available
energy me Patrick of the battery well
here's a fun proposition a BMW 1-series
the little guy in an M configuration yes
now what's unusual here is this is the
first M car I've ever done that doesn't
have a special purpose built handmade an
engine they just borrowed up a three
liter twin scroll turbo like you might
find in the Z 435 is that motor is good
for 335 horsepower and 332 foot-pounds
of torque in this little guy that means
zero to 60 in 4.7 or so Plus this
retains the overboost function of that
motor in some other cars which means for
short blasts at wide open throttle you
get the torque up to three hundred and
sixty nine foot pounds i think so that
makes for some interesting dynamics
speaking of dynamics they've worked over
the rear end the suspension all the
various tunings to make sure you can
have a decent chance of keeping it right
side up one gearbox thank you god it's a
6-speed manual and that's it no fancy
computerized blah blah not no one it
doesn't make sense lots of work done to
the body into my eye that's a good thing
one's the vols with a little bit pitiful
to me especially this big saggy sad sill
line down here I hate that but now my
eyes taken away from that but these good
looking fender bulges front and rear and
some really great looking really kind of
retro style BMW BBS looking wheels this
guy's going to run about forty seven
thousand dollars base they're only going
to make 2,700 of them so get ready get
in line electric cars and connected cars
were the big buzz at the Detroit show
and everyone from Hyundai to Porsche had
something we loved check out all of
coolies Detroit videos at cnet TV com
and now let's take a quick break but
never fear we'll be right back with more
tech review right after this
you
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on in the good even as
Android phones continue to gain market
share and challenge the iphone there's
no question that iOS still has the best
games so what's an android owner to do
well here's brian Tong with some answers
you welcome to tap that app guys i'm
brian Tong and this is the show where we
cover the hottest mobile apps in the
mobile space iOS games get a lot of the
attention and for good reason but this
episode is all about finding android
equivalents for those games and one-up
them by finding free versions first up
Cut the Rope is one of the hottest
puzzle games on iOS devices right now
it's 99 cents on an iPhone and 199 on an
iPad to slice the rope with your finger
to collect stars and get the candy to
the green guy but there's a version or
basically a blatant ripoff of it for
free call the Rope cut on Android it
isn't as smooth the physics aren't as
tight but it does a decent job plus is
free now we all know about fruit ninja
that's 99 cents or 299 on Apple devices
and it's 99 cents on Android but I bet
you haven't heard of fruit ninja kaka on
Android slice as many fruit as you can
avoid the bombs in the graphics may not
look as good but who cares it's free too
now have you seen ninjump where you
scale two sides of a building and jump
back and forth slicing birds and
avoiding obstacles at the same time well
backflip Studios has also released an
android version so why pay when it's
free and how can we talk about mobile
games without talking about Angry Birds
it's 99 cents on an iPhone but you can
fling those birds at those pigs for the
low price of free free free on android
now many of these apps will have ads
running on them but free is free and if
your friend brags about his iphone games
forget about it you'll have something to
shut them up with now if you guys have
any other apps or dance moves you'd like
to see send us an email to tap that app
at cnet com i'm brian Tong thanks for
watching and I'll see you on fruit ninja
kaka
do ninja kaka yeah maybe my
four-year-old would rather have an
android phone instead of a 3ds either
way I get my iPad back all right let's
see what's happening in the bed this
week it's bad news for the bad guys as
we revisit the Detroit Auto Show and
Brian Cooley shows us the next
generation of police cars yeah we don't
review cop cars at cnet car tech more's
the pity because they're kind of cool
with all kinds of interesting tech that
other cars don't have the crown vic the
most popular police car going out of
production here's what Ford is proposing
that fleets used to replace it it's a
Taurus based police interceptor and
although if you took off the gear and
painted it one color it might look
pretty ordinary there are a lot of
different things going on here let me
tell you about a few of them first of
all a car like this is emphasizing
durability has two idle all damn day
long has to be able to get a 75 mile per
hour rear-end collision and maintaining
safety and integrity for the officers
they have a lot of common parts on these
so whether you have this or that utility
version over there just about all the
maintenance items are the exact same
part even though there are different
cars and actually have somewhat
different engines oh and all v6 now no
more police interceptors with v8's
because today's v6 does what yesterday's
v8 did and probably quite a bit more now
beefier usually means heavier you don't
want that in a car where you're trying
to get better fuel efficiency to save
government's money as well as drive this
thing on a v6 so hoods are now aluminum
lots of the pillars or boron steel a
stronger yet lighter steel little
pricier but there's a reason for that
Ford even pre drills this hole because
these cars have to deal with very
exacting roof crush different types of
tests for and even drills this hole for
the light itself in a perfect precise
spot because these vehicles have to
handle some very stringent roll over in
collision collapse tests and if they
don't get that just right it'll break
and fold away too easily
let's go inside now the inside of a
police interceptor is probably the part
you don't want to see in your lifetime
so let me show it for you here on the
show floor first of all notice the seat
bolsters here they're actually kind of
flat because when you got a SAM Browne
on and a couple clips and some pepper
spray and your weapon you'd be dragging
this thing all day long cops hate that
so they've shaved these down even though
you might think it holds them in place
less but you got this grippy kind of
utility fabric that will help with that
up here on the wheel either on this
version or one that has the myford touch
controllers on each side you'll find
specialty buttons for things like lights
and siren and PA you wouldn't have that
on your taurus oh here's a great
spotters tip if you ever want to know if
a taurus or one of those utilities was
actually originally built as a police
interceptor here's the dead giveaway
column shifter they don't offer column
shifters anymore on regular retail cars
that's a police thing only and they do
that because they want to leave this
area here clear for a police department
installed console full of their gear
brian Tong pull over to the side with
your hands up and the product in your
hair well that's easy and up here where
there's normally what a little sunglass
binnacle type thing they've taken that
out and put in a flat place to mount
things like forward-looking sensors for
speed guns now you think a Taurus is a
significantly smaller car than a Crown
Vic at least it prints that way but I
gotta say when you pull out the console
you get a lot of space in here in fact
there's plenty of room back here for the
weapon rack I imagine those are replicas
now the changes continue in the back
seat is well this door opens like
70-something degrees wider than the
standard Taurus which this car is based
on so when they're ramming your uncle in
the back seat here you won't bump his
head so readily also a very simple very
clean one piece plastic door panel so
when he wants to be generous and share
his bodily fluids we can take care of
that later with not too much mustn't
fuss now sport utility police cars have
been fairly rare in the past Ford's
gonna try pushing this really hard
alongside the sedan as well and then of
course you got cars like this which
don't look like police cars until that
happens yeah that's how bt and I would
roll we do you know CSI seen it this is
a concept of a detective or federal car
that I love
standard motor in the sedan's a three
and a half liter v6 the utility gets a
3.7 it's also available with a 3.5
EcoBoost that's the twin turbo with 365
horsepower they reshape all the shift
points in the transmission the
suspensions heavy-duty so is the braking
so is the cooling and by the way all the
new police interceptors sedan or utility
are all all wheel drive now makes it a
lot easier for the police to the focus
on the perp and not on keeping their car
from fishtailing I think episodes of
cops may look different in the future
airbags are mounted differently so they
don't deploy into mounted gear and cause
problems and ballistic door panels keep
the bullets out to some degree these
cars will be coming in to police fleets
mid to late 2011 because the bids begin
right around july most governments are
on that mid-year start of their fiscal
year when they start to go out and buy
new cars for their fleets it's going to
take many years for all the crown vics
to wash out but in the meantime you
might start wanting to get used to a
different profile in your rear-view
mirror watch out for good call Brian
that is definitely the only time I want
to see the inside of one of those rides
alright let's wrap up our auto show
coverage as we move along to the bottom
line
when it comes to hybrid cars everybody's
trying to get in the game but there's
really only the one you think of well
soon there could be three of that one
when you have a property as hottest
Toyota's Prius brand what do you do you
do what's called a line extension in the
brand and marketing world you build more
models and variants off of it that's
what's happening with the Prius here's
the first additional model to where the
Prius badge it's called the prius v and
this is kind of a a little bit of a
people mover it's not dramatically
larger than a Prius sedan but it's got a
little higher roofline a little more
flatly art roofline and a little more
mass all around that gives you kind of a
mini mini van powertrain is the same as
a standard prius sedan as a result when
you add more mass with the same
powertrain you can end up with a little
bit lower MPG so where the current prius
sedan does 49 highway 51 city this guy
will do 38 highway 42 cities so you get
on average about a 10 MPG haircut but a
lot more room let's look inside okay
different layout in the front here the
cabin little different sculpturing in
the center stack we're going to see the
same technology again the same kind of
controls that it's the same powertrain
you've got your electric eco and power
mode these we've also seen on the
current Prius now look at arrears here
you see some real usable space very
flexible flatten the bull second row
seats and beyond that second row with
pretty good seating flexibility you got
a cargo box back here that's just a very
different thing in a Prius and you know
overall from the outside I think the way
this works out in here makes for better
lines out there this is just simply a
handsomer car than a Prius sedan don't
you think now Prius high-mileage nuts
have been adding batteries homebrews
style to their cars for quite a while
making plugins here's the factory
version finally announced for real the
prius plug-in it's the standard prius
sedan but of course we've got a charging
port up here that leads to a bigger
stock of batteries in the car what's the
point it can do more electric driving
than the standard prius that means your
overall
lynden MPG is going to be even higher
the numbers aren't out just yet but they
say you'll get 13 miles of pure electric
running and then after that it goes into
traditional regenerative hybrid mode
when you do plug it in if it's dead
empty you're going to only take about
three hours to get a full charge on that
battery now again it's not a battery
electric car that runs all of its range
on electric power that's why the charge
is relatively quick three hours on a 110
hour and a half on a level 2 or a 240
volt charger this guy is going to be
creeping out sometime in the early time
frame of 2012 and last of our trio of
pre I is this new one very concept as
you can see they're calling it the prius
c concept this is possible production
2012 this is not slated for production
yet but this would be the leanest
smallest most compact of this new triad
of prius vehicle so the opposite
direction of the v is to something very
city oriented you can imagine having the
same powertrain with less bulk mass and
weight would then raise the MPG numbers
even higher than they already quite
astounding ones that the prius sedan
gets the form factor here has been
penned by the european design studio for
toyota it's got a little bit of a CR z
DNA going to it but definitely has the
urban statement all over it so we've got
three levels of prius now as promised
about a year ago whether taking prius
from a model to almost a sub brand
within the Toyota brand
the bottom line this week a Prius for
the rest of us now yes the prius has to
offer more options to really take off
outside of San Francisco that is where
it's already king but man a Prius mini
mini van is there anything less sexy
than that if we can watch that Audi
video again all right that's going to do
it for this week everyone but come back
next time for a brand-new cnet tech
review and until then there are tons of
great videos available every day at Cena
TV com I'll see you next time and thank
