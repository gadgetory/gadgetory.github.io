wondering with this new app with a
little house icon is hang on it's too
dark in here
Siri I'm hope Home Sweet automated home
it's the whole map the missing piece of
apples interconnected smart home and now
that it's finally in its final form
we're putting it to the test on the
large scale of the C net smart home Siri
let's make dinner here's some
information
it doesn't always hear you exactly right
Siri let's make it dinner but when it
does you can use scenes to lower the
blinds and change the lights with a
single command the app controls
intuitively quick press to flip things
on or off or hold it for more advanced
options like brightness or color I
really like how easy it is to create
scenes you can also create rules so when
you flip a switch a bunch of lights turn
on or off or similar automations so you
can activate scenes when you come or go
or based on the time of day you setup
can still be a pain you have to turn on
two-factor authentication and have
either a fourth gen Apple TV or a fairly
new iPad to be able to do anything
remotely or to use any of those
automations other nitpicks
the app doesn't have a back button and
setting up multiple users is still a
real pain that takes a long time if it
works at all fortunately you can control
your home with voice commands to your
Apple TV or with the buttons in the
control center of your phone I've got a
home kit skeptic for a while now and the
whole map isn't perfect there's no one
spot to see a list of all of your
devices Hank lock that
but it does do a good job of
streamlining a large smart home with
multiple devices into one experience
bringing home kits potential that much
closer to fruition
