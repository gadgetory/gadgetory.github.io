we're here at South by Southwest 2012
we're here in the second market house
this is like the recovery lounge you
need a lot of those who stopped by
Southwest it's pretty great because it's
in a bar but it starts out the day with
blue bottle coffee always a good thing
I'm Brian Thomas seen it of course and
also today we're joined with Lee Linden
he's a CEO of karma this is a really
cool gifting app that's plugged into
Facebook and leave for people that
really don't know about it I got to see
for the first time can you kind of
explain what it's about yeah you bet so
we're a new social commerce service for
in the moment gifting karma reminds you
of the important events and your friends
and families live so someone gets
engaged they have a baby they move new
job and right from your phone you can
instantly send a beautiful and really
thoughtful gifts it's sent immediately
to someone else's phone or their
Facebook they can choose their color
flavor or size they enter their shipping
address and it's delivered as a
beautiful gift straight to the door a
few days later see that's what I like
about it those because you're taking
advantage of kind of a digital nature of
the giving the people can put in their
own address yes and choose the specifics
of the gift you don't think people know
each other's shipping addresses anymore
and furthermore if you had to wait three
days for something to be delivered you
kind of miss that moment and so karma is
all about in the moment gifting right
when you think of them you can reach out
and help celebrate say I miss you or
congratulations or happy birthday now
with Karma do they do both users have to
be on the service or only one of the one
of the people has to be in there for the
transaction so we've designed it so you
can tend to gift to anyone they can have
a blackberry and iphone and android a
Windows Phone there's the desktop PC
still receive your gift still see your
card customize it into their shipping
address have a great experience but they
do have to have email right they
initially have to receive that email
like my grandma maybe not so much so a
gift recipient can receive their gift
via SMS email or Facebook one of those
three channels so this is interesting
because you know there's a lot of
sometimes people become friends viewers
that you don't really know on Facebook
sometimes they compete people of the
other sex that you might be interested
does karma work to someone someone's
advantage like that you know so totally
effective flirting all the time well she
can be like
yes or no by your presence yeah we r we
gonna have pepper lunch and we have had
people writing in and saying you know
using karma they just met someone at a
bar maybe they have their phone number
or their Facebook they want to send some
chocolate or something else that's kind
of nice and let them know that they drew
enjoyed meeting he's the Facebook hook
right yeah well and actually let's talk
about that it sounds like so if you
connect with facebook you have those
reminders just on a broader level how
important it is it right now to build an
app that talks to every other social
network available or is it just about
Facebook well I mean we started with
Facebook we think there's a lot more to
do out there Facebook has experienced II
you know people's engagements or they
move cities or that have a new job but
what karma does actually is a a semantic
analysis on top of people's Facebook
walls so we'll look to see if people are
saying congratulations or I'm so sorry
on your friend's Facebook walls and kind
of extrapolate that to be okay this is a
moment you might not want to miss about
one of your friends and and that's a
unique thing to Facebook that we we kind
of took advantage of and we're very
proud of so it'll alert someone like if
something happened let's say a great
thing happened to Molly and it would
alert me that oh I might want to be
aware of this and send Molly gift
exactly you might have a lot of noise
and you may have a lot of friends but if
if ten people were posting I'm always
wall in saying congratulations I'm so
proud of you that'll pop up in karma and
you'll be able to see that context and
you can send a gift right there that's
cool so what would it say like hey we
think maybe something good happen to
Molly everything maybe something bad
happen to talk alright you know that so
we have two categories one called
celebrations one called once called
tough days and we pick up people and
then we show you the comments on
Facebook so you can see right from karma
and kind of figure out what's going on
oh that's a good time because I know
another thing that we liked what we saw
about the app is you know a lot of
people we love choice and even if you
give give someone a gift through karma
you can either choose let's say the
color of a product or you let them
decide which one they want that's pretty
unique yeah you know we felt that
there's this analysis paralysis around
giving people gifts and so there's a
bunch of beautiful great products out
there but they come in different sizes
flavors colors styles and with Karma you
can just give you know a bottle of
domaine chandon and let your recipient
shoes there
right and you can give it that's a good
one for the bar exactly the resident
that user tip shim good always work so
we're speaking of the gifts what is the
catalog where are you drawing the gifts
from and how are they curated yeah we
have a team of curators in San Francisco
that reach out to really great and
beautiful products we have over 50
partners including domaine chandon
jawbone this week we just added kate
spade and jonathan adler and the cliff
family vineyards and every week you'll
see us adding really amazing products
from partners we trust and we think make
beautiful gifts are you going to get
like good deals on them well we work
with them in a long-term relationship
we're not trying to discount or
liquidate their inventory we think their
products are great for gifts all year
round and so we do partnerships to make
sure that they're photographed
beautifully they look good on mobile to
consume them and they can be gift
packaged and sent directly to your
recipient so now you guys launched
before South by Southwest right was that
on purpose where you're trying to avoid
some of this noise well we certainly
want to get out there as soon as we
could we thought people one in our
product we had been beta for a couple of
months and we were getting some great
feedback and you know it's been a week
and a half and we're already sending in
a thousands of gifts people are using it
at South by Southwest they meet someone
new every child and connector in front
yeah where it works see where it's right
yeah I got all this time awesome yeah no
that's great well congratulations on the
lunch and any new features that you've
rolled out since launch that we need to
know about um so you know we have some
new partners coming on and mentioned
kate spade and Jonathan Adler I think
you'll see some other great partners
coming on board from new partners and
from New other companies and next coming
weeks and so forth you can also browse
by price now and so that's a great
functionality item and yeah we're just
getting started so I think you know as
the as the weeks and months ago value
you'll see us really expanding this
category social commerce and we're
excited do it that's great I haven't
seen anything like it so we're looking
forward to playing with it thankfully
