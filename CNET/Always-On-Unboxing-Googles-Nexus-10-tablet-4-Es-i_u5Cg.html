a true iPad competitor a 10-inch tablet
and it is running the latest and
greatest in jellybean it has the Nexus
branding let's get this guy out of the
box this is of course our review unit so
we don't have the nuts and bolts
unboxing if you will but we'll do our
best
I wonder how Google's gonna keep on
keeping track of all these numbers
because they have the Nexus 4 in the
Nexus 7 and the Nexus 10 10 but the
Nexus 4 is a phone but the next seven is
a tablet I'm just saying it's getting a
little messy in the Nexus world okay
focus focus
all right you check this guy out this is
actually much more like the surface in
that it's very rectangular you can tell
it's probably meant to be viewed
horizontally more often than vertically
seems just a little less squared off
than the iPad it has a nice surface on
the back actually it's sort of plastic
and a little bit tacky by which I mean
it doesn't slide around as much like you
grab a knife I pad these days and it
just goes flying this not so much
okay our screens already coming on
nicely preloaded with apps because Eric
Franklin's been having a good time with
this back in the CNET lab it's a nice
looking thing let's see what else we
have in the box not much
there we go probably a little charging
brick and of course our Nexus QuickStart
guide or like I mentioned earlier the
only tech support you're ever likely to
get with a nexus product all right
that's just how it is at least there's a
warranty and that is all okay let's talk
specs find out why you might want to
choose this over an iPad the Nexus 10
tablet is built by Samsung it is a true
10-inch tablet it has a 10-inch diagonal
display with a 2560 by 1600 pixel
resolution the front is Corning Gorilla
Glass 2 so it should be pretty durable
of course we'll try that out the weight
is about 1.3 pounds a little bit heavy
but it actually doesn't feel that heavy
there's micro HDMI out it has a 5
megapixel camera on the back and a
front-facing 1.9 megapixel camera
there's Bluetooth Wi-Fi and NFC and of
course this tablet is running Android
4.2 jelly bean so you can really take
advantage of some of those cool
jellybean features like the Google now
cards what is Google's stock price the
Nexus 10 has two ways to charge microUSB
and that cable is included in the box or
a magnetic Pogo pin charger now that's
gonna charge the tablet a lot faster but
you have to buy the charger separately
it's $399 for 16 gigs or $4.99 for 32
gigs if you are looking for a 10-inch
tablet this holiday season I have to say
this is looking like the strongest iPad
competitor I've seen in a long time
unlike previous Android tablets it's
running a truly completed operating
system jelly bean is fun to use it has a
lot of useful features and it's easy to
figure out
unlike honeycomb plus I think the
pricing is very smart starting this
tablet at 399 means frankly it's kind of
a better value than a new iPad I would
give this one a serious look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
