information but now when you search for
common health conditions or diseases
Google search results will display
relevant medical answers showing
symptoms treatments and details above
the links google says the answers that
pop up have been checked by medical
doctors but Google isn't your doctor so
you should consult one if you have a
medical concern and when Google is not
working on health questions its funding

a new dog like robot its name is spot

robot it's electrically powered and
weighs 160 pounds and as the sensor head
that helps it navigate through rough
terrain and although the video doesn't
make clear how this robot will help our
society we see spot schrott around
offices climb stairs and if you give it
a swift kick in the side it'll stay
upright but please do not kick our
future robot overlords it'll only make
them angry when they eventually reboot
