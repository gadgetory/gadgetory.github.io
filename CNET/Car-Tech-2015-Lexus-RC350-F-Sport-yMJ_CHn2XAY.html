along with the new NX crossover and
making Lexus younger sporty air but also
delivering on that custody thing they
did let's see how all that's working out
as we drive this 15 RC 350 all new
models and check the tech now the RC as
you can tell is all about one thing a
stylish sporty self-indulgent two-door
coupe slot it in your mind against let's
say a BMW 4-series or an Audi v in
general proportions lines and Mission
now we have a 350 that means you have a
v6 we'll get to know in a minute there's
also an RC 300h a hybrid version of this
car but unfortunately here in the u.s.
neither our carbon awareness nor our
current gas prices are high enough to
warrant its importation now inside the
RC is a handsome tidy cabin with some of
these Lexus cues that I love you've got
this nice laid back console with great
ergonomics they do this so well that's
your LFA inspired instrument pod with
that moving video Tekamah tur in the
middle that physically moves to the
right under certain modes to give you
more information screens on the left
it's frankly a bunch of gimmickry but
it's cool now your LCD up here in Lexus
fashion is looking a little dated
it's not widescreen it's still kind of a
4 by 3 ish ratio however you've got a
new controller driving it you know I've
been hating the remote touch controller
which is this sort of upside-down puck
they used to have here now look what
they've done they've got a trackpad too
really nicely calibrated cursor control
and then when you get to what you want
just click it's very laptop light you
also get these glowing zones that remind
you where the cursor is to keep it easy
to digest while you're driving a cursor
is not ideal in a car unless you make it
do this little trick this is a well
featured system with the exception of
navigation and Mark Levinson the two
main options you'll want to consider to
add to this
and speaking of interfaces you've also
got Siri eyes free supported on this Vee
go through the voice command buttons if
you've got a 4s or above Lexus in
general just really loves radio you've
got satellite radio of course HD radio
you've got HD radio tagging also the
ability on this vehicle to do some pause
and play of what you're listening to on
the radio now controlling drive modes in
the RC is pretty straightforward you've
got a rather traditional looking shifter
here for your automatic transmission
with a manual gate to the left here on
the wheel paddles that are split down
shift up shift left and right
respectively and then this is the rather
familiar lexus drive mode control that
is pretty simple push it to go to normal
turn it to the right to go to sport mode
or again to go to Sport Plus and then
the other way counterclockwise gets you
into eco mode up front on the RC 350
you've got a three and a half liter v6
feeding those cylinders is a combination
of injection method which is notable
they've got multi-port fuel injection
which is kind of riding shotgun on top
of the more modern direct injection but
they serve different purposes in the
engines operational range and Lexus has
put them both in here
no turbos or other fancy artificial
trickery your power goes out to the rear
wheels base and you can see the engine
is sitting longitudinally of course
8-speed automatic if you get rear-wheel
drive six-speed automatic if you get
all-wheel-drive
either way the power is the same 306
horsepower and 277 pound-feet of torque
now if you go all-wheel-drive you pick
up a couple hundred pounds you also get
a bit of a haircut on acceleration at
mpg your zero to 60 goes from 5-8 up to
6o and all-wheel drive and your mpg goes
from 28 highway to 26 all-wheel drive
city numbers stay the same under way you
definitely buy a Lexus hype about how
stiff and rigid this car is pushing it
through corners on twisty roads it
definitely feels of a piece
it's got real guts it's got good power
it's got a nice overall layout of its
dynamics and the way things respond but
it's always civilized shifts are not
that quick and I'm in sport now I'm in
Sport Plus and I spent a lot of time in
both modes and I find the suspension is
also very compliant that's gonna throw
some people who come to this car and
look at its outsides and say wow this is
gonna be a sharp edge surgical
experience to drive I don't know that it
is on the other hand it's very liveable
mile after mile which a lot of the more
gutsy highly taught cars are not unless
price this guy you're at nearly forty
nine thousand dollars in F Sport trim
now the F Sport adds a fair amount of
money and a fair amount of toys as well
including heated and cooled sport seats
a very different adaptive smart sport
suspension
you've got 19-inch wheels and of course
that very slick LFA inspired instrument
panel and quite a bit more if you want
all-wheel drive 'it's another two grams
navigation and Levinson Nutter 2600 a
moonroof is optional interestingly if
you really want to go track purist
you'll delete it it's 1,100 bucks to
take it that exotic variable steering
and rear steering is two thousand
dollars more add in some adaptive cruise
and pre-collision LED fog lights now
you're seen that style and now you're
also pushing in the mid 57,000
