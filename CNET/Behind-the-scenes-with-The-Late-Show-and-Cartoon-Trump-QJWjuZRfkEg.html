in a locker room and a bus it's all was
it's not a big deal
I'm Tim wookie I am the lead animator
for the Late Show it's Taco Tuesday
Steven all the puppets that we do start
out in Adobe Photoshop as illustrations
that involve some frame by frame
animation so for instance we wanted to
do a little hand gesture of Trump going
like that you'd start out with the base
illustration of Trump and then go in and
draw each arm gesture you can take it
over and just directly import it into
character animator so it immediately
tracks your face with tracking dots it's
got your pupils
it's the mouth and the eyebrows and that
is immediately translated into the
character huge okay huge then as we did
more of these we started doing stuff
that sort of tipped the hat that not
only is it fitting politically that it's
a cartoon but it's actually happening
live the most noticeable instance of
that was when we did a live convention
show and we had cartoon Hillary on
high-touch of hands Steven robbed of and
I'm a writer and senior digital producer
here at the Late Show I was one of the
producers who walked by when Tim was
playing around with the software you
know back in the day it's not really one
thing it's basically a stack of
technique all working together yeah
Donald if I may tell you that Donald if
you don't debate people won't know who
to vote for on Election Day a good point
I can't do it in election day Tuesday
November 8 no way I was really
interested in trying to develop a way to
have scenes that were just looser than
we're possible with animation otherwise
like where you could have a framework
for what the scene was gonna be
not necessarily commit to a full script
cartoon Trump everybody let me just get
my inhaler this was right after her
coughing doubt so one of the gestures
they asked for was for her to be able to
appear as a ghost you can go from
Hillary's sitting upright talking to
Stephen to floating Hilary Ghost you
know the sky's the limit we can start
developing a cast of characters that are
cartoons that Stephen interacts with so
it's not just about the program and it's
not just about the animation and it's
not just about the writing or the idea
it's all those things coming together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
