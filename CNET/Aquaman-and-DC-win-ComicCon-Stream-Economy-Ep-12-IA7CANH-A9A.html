sunny San Diego for comic-con the
biggest geek pop culture show of the
year a lot of stuff happens I don't want
to waste your time so let's get into it
Warner Brothers and DC took full
advantage of Marvel and HBO's absence
here at comic-con and made pushes on
multiple fronts the Warner Brothers
panel in Hall H was bananas with
trailers and panels from Godzilla Sam
and the fantastic beast sequel patty
Jenkins and gal gadot came on stage to
talk about Wonder Woman 1984 complete
with a clip and then Jason Momoa and
James Wan along with the rest of the
cast were on hand to introduce the first
full trailer for Aquaman that trailer
looked completely bonkers but you know
what I'm kind of into it and honestly I
will watch anything with Jason below in
it so thank you thank you thank you dear
see you're the best there's also a new
official name for the DC Cinematic
Universe it's now called worlds of DC
there was also an announcement of
pricing and additional details on the DC
Universe streaming service which will
launch later this year movies like
Justice League the new frontier original
series starting with Titans and beloved
shows like Batman the Animated Series
will all be available there but it's not
just DC superhero shows and movies part
of the monthly subscription includes a
community tab access to a slew of DC
comics and other exclusive pricing for
the service starts at just 8 bucks a
month so aside from all the movie
trailers which were totally epic I have
to say it really feels like DC has a
huge win this week y'all nice job some
of my favorite Comic Con news came from
franchises we thought were long gone but
fortunately for fans they're making a
comeback at the Clone Wars 10 year
anniversary panel supervising creative
director Dave Filoni announced the show
was coming back from the dead with 12
new episodes to finish the story of
Anakin and ahsoka fans will be able to
check out the last 12 episodes of the
Clone Wars when Disney's new streaming
service that hasn't quite been named yet
launches in 2019 another news for fans
this guy right here Joss Whedon just
announced Buffy the Vampire is getting a
revival this time around he'll be
executive producing while midnight Texas
creator Monica oh wow sue Breen will
step in as
writer executive producer and showrunner
of the reboot
unfortunately for fans of some other
beloved franchises they got some
not-so-great news
the creators of Netflix's Voltron
legendary defender announced its eighth
season would be its last but you still
have 26 episodes to enjoy and I'm
totally buying this the good news is is
that the next two seasons have been
bumped up to 13 episodes each meaning
you've only got 26 more episodes of
Voltron to go but I'm betting it's gonna
be an epic last two seasons season seven
hits Netflix on August 10 on top of that
Walking Dead fans can finally start
planning their official goodbyes to
Sheriff Rick Grimes actor Andrew Lincoln
announced on The Walking Dead panel that
this upcoming season of high would be
his last
and maybe it's my last oh we don't know
how Rick will go out or win but we do
know Norman Reedus is about to see a
massive payday for stepping into the
show's lead role and maybe it will shake
up the show's format and storylines
enough to bring back some viewers those
are some of my favorite headlines from
San Diego comic-con 2018 but what stream
economy would be complete without some
words from our favorite curmudgeon
take it away Marc's arrows although they
are Comic Con let's talk about Comic Con
no I'm magical time of the year like
Christmas for lives editor what you mean
a Marvel's not gonna be our new Marvel
comic con there's Nemo our Comic Con
