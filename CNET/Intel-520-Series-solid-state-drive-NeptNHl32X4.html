over here another solid state drive and
no not just another sort of state drive
this is a new Intel 520 series and if
you take a close look it's actually very
special first it's made all aluminum
casing here which make it very sturdy
and kind of nice-looking and it turned
out the drive is only seven millimeter
thick so in order for you to fit in a
standard 2.5 drive bay you have to add
some care extra thickness and this piece
can be taken off if you want to use the
drive you know as a thinner drive and
you know what let's just take it off now
the frame pieces off and it's turned out
you can also take off the top of the
drive showing inside the flash memory
and the circuitry now you cannot do this
with hard drive that will destroy this
but with solid state you can do this and
still keep the drive safe if you put
back the top that's compared with
another drive that is at the standard
thickness you can see it's much thinner
by the way don't do that home because
this drive here cost about $1000 now we
haven't seen the flash memory and a
secretary
what if haven't seen and cannot see is a
new firmware version 400 that Intel put
into the dryer to make it run much
faster than other drive and actually in
my testing it indeed offer great
performance and this is a standard you
know 2.5 Drive is intended to if I use
with laptop computer but if you have a
desktop intent has that for you to run
inside unify the molex to SATA power
cable a SATA data cable a mounting
bracket to fit the drive into a 3.5 inch
drive a and all the mounting school and
last but not least a sticker for you to
show up the drive you can stick on a
computer on your chest
now the Intel 520 series is a rather
expensive costing around $2 per gigabyte
making it one of the most expensive SSD
on the market but with all this is
actually worth the price I think and
once again my name is Don
and this has been the first look as the
520 series of state drive from Intel and
don't forget to check out the full
review at CENTCOM for more formation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
