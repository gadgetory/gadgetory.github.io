bringing great online entertainment to
your TV is simplicity one barrier to
viewing online content on TV is getting
your TV's connected in the first place
our first design principle is to build a
product with as close to zero set-up
time as possible now once you're set up
you may not want to learn a different
interface on your TV everyone loves
their phones tablets and laptops why not
why not just make them work with your
TV's your personal device should be your
remote third we're designing to enable
TV experiences across platforms and
across devices all of the Android phones
and Android tablets iPhones iPads
Windows desktops Mac and Chrome OS
laptops should just work with your TV
unlike other solutions we will not force
you to have the same operating system on
all your devices today we're going to
show you how we can make this happen it
starts with a new device from Google and
I happen to have one right here in my
pocket introducing chromecast the
easiest way to bring your favorite
online entertainment to your TV
you notice that chromecast is small it's
just 2 inches in length we were able to
pack a lot of power into this tiny
device because it's built on Chrome
technology it's running a simplified
version of Chrome OS once you take it
out of its beautiful clean box all you
have to do is plug it into any HDMI
input on your TV power through USB
connect to your home Wi-Fi and you're
ready to kick back and watch
chromecast won't clutter your
entertainment cabinet it simply
disappears behind your TV let me tell
you a little bit about how it works and
then we're going to go to a demo once
once chromecast is plugged in let's say
that you want to watch YouTube on your
TV you just go to the same YouTube app
that you're already familiar with on
your phone tablet or laptop and you will
see the cast button in the UI you simply
press the cast button to play a video on
your TV
chromecast receives the command from the
YouTube app pulls the video you
requested directly from the cloud and
plays it on your TV what's unique about
the solution is that we bring the
highest resolution content directly from
the cloud rather than relying just on
your personal device to push the content
meanwhile back on the couch you have
full control over playback of the video
from your phone tablet or laptop
whichever device you are using your
YouTube app on now let's see chromecast
in action I'd like to invite Rishi and
a.k to demo for us ok
Thank You Mario so it get a really
excited to show you chromecast in action
so for today's demo we've gone ahead and
brought a variety of different devices
you'll find in a typical living room
cluding phones tablets and laptops and
over here we've plugged in a chromecast
into a standard HDTV the TV is off for
now now we're going to show you how
these devices can control this TV using
chromecast and for those in the room
we're going to be placing the TV feed on
the outside monitors and the device is
on the inside runners alright so let's
get started so let's say I'm in my
living room and I'm hanging out with my
friends and I want to show them one of
my favorite YouTube videos well I could
do it on a small little phone but it's
much better doing this big beautiful
screen
so let's shout to show you how you will
do it so let's go ahead and bring out my
Nexus 4 and I'm going to open up the
YouTube app now this is the YouTube app
I use everyday so it's already logged in
has access to my favorites my channels
my subscriptions so ak's going to hand
pick one of my favorite music videos now
this is pretty standard YouTube thus far
we can see in the top of the YouTube app
is the new cast button that Mario just
mentioned simply press it and allows you
to send that YouTube video to different
devices in this case we're going to pick
a living room which is the name of the
chromecast I connect it to this TV so
now let's take a look at the TV because
what's happening here is actually pretty
subtle but really cool chromecast is
turning on my TV switching it to the
right input and now playing YouTube in
HD on the TV that's it just a simple
press of a button YouTube automatically
detected my chromecast device on my home
network so not to do any additional
configuration or setup so recapping your
chromecast device get you access to
great content from YouTube Netflix
Google Play movies &amp;amp; TV play music lots
of content from the web through Chrome
tap projection and still to come Pandora
and many more apps with a simple press
of the cast button you're watching on
your TV while still having full control
over your device unlike other solutions
it works with Android iOS Chrome for
Windows Chrome for Mac and Chromebook
pixel so we've talked a lot about the
product this morning and we're really
excited about it but you're probably
wondering how much does it cost and how
can I get it
our engineers have worked really really
hard to make chromecast as affordable as
possible for as many consumers as
possible
so we're happy to announce that
chromecast will retail for $35 for $35
it's affordable enough to connect up
every TV in your home the chromecast
device is available for purchase in the
US later today with expansion to other
countries as quickly as possible
you can order chromecast starting this
afternoon from amazon.com bestbuy.com
and Google Play it will also be
available from Best Buy stores across
the u.s. as early as July 28 and through
our partnership with Netflix for a
limited time you will also get three
months free of Netflix with the purchase
of a chromecast device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
