smartphone and get ready to share more
than your tweets once you agree to find
friends Twitter starts collecting your
personal information when you use the
application in order to match you with
other people who might be using it your
address book goes up to the server
besides your contacts names phone
numbers and email addresses Twitter
records browsing history and search
terms what Twitter wasn't telling people
was that they were keeping that address
book for 18 months which is a long time
to keep all your personal data in an
email to the Los Angeles Times Twitter
spokeswoman Carolyn Penner said quote we
want to be clear and transparent at our
communications with users along those
lines and our next app updates which are
coming soon we are updating the language
associated with fine friends to be more
explicit CNET's rafe needleman says
Twitter however is not alone all the
social companies are doing this some of

we be concerned yes the reaction from
Twitter users in downtown San Francisco
with mixed I always wonder about like
where the information is going to go
like what what other uses gonna have I
figure usually internet you better get
used to the fact that you don't have any
privacy I don't think I'm very
uncomfortable with that because if
there's something I want to share then I
don't mind sharing it because of Public
and Governmental pressure most apps
being written now or updated like
Twitter will allow users to authorize or
opt-out of sharing personal information
