it's episode 354 of the 359 podcast I'm
BVG and in the house today we've got
Alfred Inge and Roger Chang to talk
about something stuff yeah happy Monday
heck right here we go here we go all
right so what we're talking about
Verizon's new policy it's a scoop from
CNET about Verizon basically locking
down their phones reversal of it's
fairly generous unlocking policy we'll
break it all down in the podcast we'll
also be talking about blockchain our
colleague Steven Shanklin has a nice
explainer piece on what blockchain is if
you've ever wondered and lastly we'll
talk about the Olympics because who
doesn't love the Winter Olympics me
crickets crickets yeah come on I
actually have been watching I didn't
like it but it turned out the Olympics
were hacked on day one Alfred has all
the details so if any of questions leave
it in the comments section Brian will
pick up the bass and we'll get to them
in three minutes and 59 seconds from
three to welcome to the 359 I'm Rutter
che I'm Alfred Aang Verizon is locking
down its phones
starting today Verizon will start
locking phones down to combat theft for
now it'll unlock phones immediately
after you activate your service but in
the springtime they're gonna start
extending that lock period so even if
after you buy that phone it'll be locked
for a period of time which they haven't
specified yet
I'm confused how does this prevent theft
again so the idea here what they're
trying what they're arguing is that
these can basically take these unlocked
phone turn around and sell them right
away so if these phones are locked down
so you can't use another carrier SIM
card in that phone that it's a lot less
appealing for thieves right once they
take that phone they can't actually turn
around sell it in my market they
couldn't bring it overseas because
they're locked down but do you think
that when somebody steals a phone though
it's not like the phone has a massive
like Verizon like logo on either they'd
be able to say oh that phones locked I'm
not gonna steal it no for sure that's a
really good point there are tons of
unlocked iPhones out there their
argument was there been there's been
enough stolen goods even going to
Verizon stores and
or add from Verizon stores themselves
that they're putting this in a new
policy in place and I understand this
has been frustrating for a few folks
yeah consumers are not liking this now
look at her background Verizon actually
agreed with agreed to unlock all their
phones as part of a deal with the FCC
when they bought a certain swath of
spectrum from 700 acres this is a
spectrum the powers their LTE network
and so basically ever since LTE phones
came out they've unlocked all their
phones they have actually the most
generous policy in place every other
carrier does require you to wait between
40 to 60 days before they will unlock
your phone so this is a this is a big
change and it's it's a hassle for folks
who have to go overseas and who are just
law by assistance and with a verizon
phone alright so next up the one talk
about blockchain I'm sure you've heard
of blockchain or at least Bitcoin cuz
everyone's talking about it
Stephen Shanklin has a nice piece
breaking down the foundation for Bitcoin
and other cryptocurrencies and its core
is it's a lot of walking us to it but at
its core blockchain start helps build
trust in these untrustworthy times there
is actually a really sweet animation in
the story that yes explains at all
because yeah blockchains been out for a
bit of a while now but I every time I
try to explain how to like dive deep
into it it's just I have no clue what's
going on here right it's the idea of
like the sort of dispersed network of
blocks of data that are all individually
encrypted but all kind of work together
right there at my head just kind of get
blowed up
but shanks piece doesn't just look at
big Honan cryptocurrency but looks at
how basically can ensure other it can
ensure how products are either are
actually legitimate whether diamonds are
conflict diamonds whether the food that
you're getting is actually you know well
did not counterfeit and so really the
way it affects our lives in more ways
than just yeah yeah so up next officials
confirmed on Sunday that the Winter
Olympics have been hit with a cyber
attack it happened during the opening
ceremony and it lasted for about 12
hours their Olympics website was taken
down and the Wi-Fi network like at the
stadium in Pyeongchang was wasn't
working but you know if you watch the
opening ceremony you might not have
noticed it at all it all went off
without a hitch anyway
yeah All Things Considered that
not really that terrible and it seemed
like the hack was definitely more about
inconvenience yeah anything so
researchers had taken a look at the
malware and basically noted that this
attack wasn't really to you know steal
any information there are a lot of
public officials there you know the Mike
Pence was there South Korean president
absolutely so there's a lot of
information that you can get out of this
but this attack was mostly just to mess
things up and like you know take down
the network and things like that it's
still too early to say who had done this
attack but taking a look at the code it
does reference a lot of it was just for
destruction purposes there you go
for these stories and more checks on
CNET I'm Roger Cheng I'm Alfred aying
thanks for listening and that attack was
in fact called the destructor right they
owned a destroyer oh yeah so this was
this was the name given to it by the
folks that were looking at the code its
Cisco yeah yeah destructor yes that was
one of it that was that was so there
were three different parts so there was
like something steals like credential
stealer browser stealer which is how
they got like credentials to it in the
first place and then destructor was the
one that like basically deleted all the
memory and the attack the recovery
process so that's why I was down for
like 12 hours as opposed to like if you
just delete a bunch of stuff usually
you're able to like reboot and just get
it back through your process yep
deleting things yeah so it was like
actively deleting it and all the copies
of it so this was the like this was
clear that they weren't trying to steal
the information because they were
actively getting rid of it all right
well there you go all the like I said
all things considered considering all
the hacks that we have seen they've been
a lot more destructive that's not that's
not the worst yeah I mean maybe this is
teased for more oh my god yeah to be
fair there's no signs that like it means
that they're completely out of their
system right right nothing is sacred
anymore however when you'd said one of
our lead stories is going to be hacking
the Olympics I had this like weird image
of like neo in the matrix and like
uploading all the medals away and
there's a beating in real time like in
real space there at the ceremony and
then out of nowhere it's just like well
North Korea won all the gold medals just
give it to
well that kind of happened with Russia
of four years ago dinner
that's not our place to go either that
or hacking the Olympics resulted in oh
we thought we were all gonna be
snowboarding today nope spoilers boating
I don't even know where to go with that
one
shall we jump into some chat questions
do it for one Matthew dad sure what's up
- does the Olympic hacker get a gold
medal ooh I mean I think that's more of
a somber Summer Olympic more injured
more importantly how far how soon is
hacking going to become an Olympic
competitive sport I don't know they're
saying eSports are yeah I mean they have
they have competitions at like a lot of
major hacking conferences they have a
capture the flag thing at blackhat at
Def Con it's not Olympics oh yeah boy I
was kind of joking I know I'm also kind
of not yeah that's the thing like if
eSports can be put into consideration
it's not that much yeah they have a lot
of these competitions there was one in
2016 at Def Con where was BOTS only like
it was like which BOTS can write the
best malware to get around this like I
mean that'sthat's kind of somewhat of
the Olympics in like ten years from now
it's gonna be all bots yeah it's gonna
be like which Olympic which BOTS can run
faster it should just be like no
shouldn't it should just be a whole
country of bots like the nation of bots
robot robot nigga or something I feel
like that's coming there's like a
dystopian great button on that note that
sure wants us to shift gears over to
Verizon all right will Verizon still
allow us to bring our own phone yeah
you're talking about so there is a
grandfather clause at play so yeah
they're want to clarify that these are
phones that Verizon is selling so they
will still accept unlock phones coming
in there's no change of that policy this
is really just for the phones that you
purchased from Verizon directly but as
we see a lot of these partnerships grow
and grow and more exclusives starting to
hit the market this could become a
consumer concern yeah I mean look this
is a this is definitely a potential
annoyance for consumers but you know you
sort of have to the counterbalance is
that you know there is a fairly active
theft market it has gone down in recent
years but it's still it's still
significant enough that that Verizon I'm
still not buying their explanation for
this policy I real
don't think that if somebody's stealing
a phone like when they're like stealing
it from somebody they're gonna see you
like oh this was Verizon you can have it
but no no sorry
so the point isn't to I mean really the
theft of turn isn't necessarily for you
as consumer it's more stealing phones
from Verizon directly okay their supply
like basically now that they know that
this is a this is a truck heading to a
Verizon store than well this may not be
as attractive isn't like we can't sit
doesn't have that yeah because all the
other all the other carries have their
phones locked down and ready so
Verizon's are the only ones that are
unlocked from the Oh so it actually it
is from from a theis perspective if they
see that this is a verizon phone they
see this is a shipment of Verizon phones
or if they're at a Verizon store they
want to steal Verizon phones from the
stores themselves they already know
these are unlocked phones that I can
easily turn around okay so there's more
to protect them than the it's more about
protecting Verizon okay but also I mean
how is that policy helped out all these
other companies that I have locked
phones though like are they not being
like robbed anymore I had that I don't
know I thought I mean but there's a
reason why these other carriers have
policies in place that are 40 50 day
wait yeah I think it's probably worth
time to try to make a rough breakdown
like you said the blockchain video the
animation that's up is really
fascinating and it does really help
spell things out in a way that the
layman can understand yes but maybe we
could try to put a little perspective on
it and hear to the best of our abilities
again this is a really complicated issue
maybe with our forces combined we can
make it conversation worth having who
wants to take a stab at that do you want
us to define blockchain for you yes
please
as someone who is completely stupid to
the cryptocurrency and blocks thanks
very valuable no look I mean that's the
thing like even I tried to offer a brief
definition on the during our podcast
taping and the idea that these are
literally blocks of encrypted data that
are linked together and and
that kind of contained in different
computers the idea that they're sort of
decentralized makes it theoretically
yeah so so the idea is like the whole
theory of like decentralizing something
Shanklin starts a story off with like
it's really hard to trust things on the
internet there's like that famous New
Yorker cartoon like on the internet no
one can tell your dog well really can't
trust anything in life yeah so the idea
is like blockchain because it's
decentralized so it's not just like me
saying something to you like that
information is like I would have that
information that you know this guy is a
dog online then Roger would also have
that information you would have that
information and like it's uploaded to
all these different computers and then
the idea would be if that dog tries
going online and saying like I'm not a
dog I'm like a human and they're like
there's everyone that has this data that
there's tiered accountability yeah
basically like that's a dog like the
idea like for I think effective analogy
I feel whatever wonder example he gave
was with the the DMV analogy yeah idea
that like the DMV owns your database and
if you go in there and you have to DMV
we'll all of a sudden you know you can
change names or whatever but if you know
the DMV is blockchain to contain all the
state to store all this data you
couldn't go in and have to be envied
yeah you couldn't hack every single
computer that has that data verifies
that you own this car yeah that's the
idea of like being decentralized
essentially like that's what provides is
like authenticity to it and what we are
worried about is what do you mean I'm
still like I'm still kind of in the in
the dark about this as far as what risks
there are inherent risks to blockchain
and how it functions uh well in terms of
risks I mean there are some downsides to
it obviously with cryptocurrency people
are using or investing in high powered
rigs to mine for currency that is a
massive waste of energy no waste but
it's it's math it consumes a massive
energy right there I most of the risks
that I look at for blockchain has to do
with like malware and cryptocurrency
stuff right just like it sits
which what my story on that's coming out
in a few days just essentially and we do
have a story looking at the downsides of
all this yeah and I was in the next few
days this is part of a larger package of
stories that that talks about blockchain
cryptocurrency
Bitcoin there was a story over the
weekend about just all these like
government websites that had been
infected with a crypto jacking where
they take over a website and then the
more you that you're on it like you're
you're actually helping like somebody
mined for cryptocurrency that way and so
if you're on a website it's loading like
really really slowly there's a good
chance that like you know there's a
crypto minor like put on it and I've
been seeing a lot of stories over the
last few weeks about like all these
crazy places that it's been in like
hospital equipment yeah they put a
crypto miner on a hospital equipment so
that's the new thing now so instead of
like malware like asking you to give
them money it's like you're essentially
helping them make money without like
even knowing about it
well isn't that kind of like the plot of
the movie office space I never watched
off his face
what shut up really I actually never
watched I've seen scenes for me but I
never watched I mean so the plot of
office space is the plot of Superman for
right so it's basically kind of just
know that that was hijacking accounting
systems microtransactions
microtransactions what are you talking
about is hijacking computer cuz this is
another complicated bit about Bitcoin
cryptocurrency you can actually mine for
your computer can solve complex
mathematical puzzles to award themselves
Bitcoin or cryptocurrency it's really
difficult to get a lot of power but what
these hackers do is basically write
programs that take over all of your
computers and have them kind of run the
run those process computation got it
foremost for you yeah so instead of you
wasting all that money you know on your
electric bill like all these like
thousands of people whose stuff you've
infected are doing it now for a minute
there wasn't there I don't know was it
NASA or somebody they were using like a
third-party application that you could
load on a computer that it would
essentially utilize you're volunteering
your computer's processing power yes so
it kind of in a similar vein is not
exactly except this is voluntary yeah
right we're taking yeah it's like if
your computer is running a little bit
slower than normal
there might be a reason for that gotcha
can I just say that the more more we
talk about the stuff in the terminology
that comes up like crypto mining the
more and more know Jackie Chan you I
know the more
real life sounds like an episode of Law
&amp;amp; Order yeah there I treated out this
today there was research from
Malwarebytes about drive-by crypto
mining which that's a whole nother thing
where I thought that was a joke when you
said it no other term like that so it
was basically if you log on to like a
different Wi-Fi network and this
specifically targets Android devices if
you log on to like a random Wi-Fi or
something like it'll take you to like a
capture page where it looks like a
normal capture page which is like just
endless like ever every second that
you're on there it's actually using your
processor to like to the max and like
mining from Manero which is another
cryptocurrency and it's gotten like
800,000 visits and like per day for like
less yeah now they're not gonna get the
money I keep under my mattress well
thing it's not taking it's not taking
anyone's money it's not stealing
anybody's money it's just it's stealing
you the computational power your phone
so yeah we're down the battery makes
your phone run slower and you're not
getting any of the money for it
yeah you're not getting paid naturally I
did just funny that we're talking about
this so much because I went to a
restaurant over the weekend and on their
their website I've never been there
before I was like I wonder what's on
their menu and it's this Italian joint
and right front page on their website
it's like we accept Bitcoin oh really
and it's like your website was built in
Geocities but you're accepting Bitcoin
it would just caught me off guard it
that was like a front page thing for
this like old family restaurant out in
Queens
nice that's probably a bad idea for them
my favorite thing my favorite story with
cryptocurrency or any kind of like
blockchain stuff is all these companies
that add blockchain to their names and
get like well that was Kodak right they
announced they're like you're doing
we're going to the blockchain
Long Island iced tea company with
Reuters like your stuff more than
doubled yeah it worked thank you to Dan
McClane for pointing out that that was
actually the plot of Superman 3
Superman's re had nuclear amman right
you're right worst thing yeah happened
to come my bad my bad
good call Michael Brown is asking what
carriers any of us here on the show have
out of curiosity is anyone here a
Verizon customer I have a Verizon yeah
my work phone is Verizon and
my personal phone is at t-mobile because
I'm on my parents plan yeah I ended up
combining my work and personal phone in
because I don't like caring too much my
jackets and I'm I'm not an AT&amp;amp;T cuz full
disclosure we get a discount
can I scare ya wait we get AT&amp;amp;T as a as
an option I thought it was Verizon and
like the whole way when I started 10
years ago I got AT&amp;amp;T with through CBS
and I got my discount mother did yeah so
that that's my current situation but
that yeah not all that interesting
imagine soggies asking about the
potential thieves for the verizon phone
yeah what do thieves turn around and do
how is it different 45 60 days down the
road so the idea of the the wait period
is it shows that you're like an active
customer you've been on for at least two
months and that's usually studies have
shown that you have to drop off period
like before the month is over what what
they found is a lot of folks sign up
with stolen identities get the phone and
within a couple of days within a couple
of weeks
turn around they'll just drop the
service stop payment service take the
phone and sell in the black market you
could sell it overseas or you could sell
here and sorry I lost my train of
thought there
but block channeling some really weird
I know convoluted complicated things
today all at once so yeah but again
that's that's sort of wide that there's
there's a waiting period basically for
the carriers it shows that you're
actually a legit customer who wants to
stay on the service as opposed to trying
to turn around sell that phone right
gotcha
we are just about out of time but before
we go I want us to theorize what the
Robo Olympics will bring for us
I for one who can mine for the most
blockchain welcome our future robot
overlords what competitive sport ollie
drone racing well I was gonna say take
place in the Robo Lin really I'm like
robot battles well battle bots for sure
yes flagship that's going to be the
oldest giant like giant yeah yeah it's
not the TV show mecha fight I want the
giant next another we saw we had seen
something at sea
- if the mecha racing remember that yes
yeah yeah yeah I think there'll be a lot
of maybe virtual race Racing's not
nothing I want I want them to actually
like tear each other apart yeah I would
pay good money to see right right right
human pilots are strictly automata
because that video pilots video from
Boston dynamic of that robot that did
the backflip yes
yeah robot gymnastics camisa oh yeah
okay it's all right here pretty much
with one backflip come on hey
so what else out there a competitive
vaping like cloud no that's a robot look
like the different like like I've seen
videos it's stupid as this is stupid but
I'm saying like that's in the running I
think that's in the running and that's
not a robot doing it though that's like
a person I mean technically holding
something for losing the attack yeah I
guess yeah what other quote what else
qualify has anybody got any thoughts in
the chat the claw machine not the claw
machine were like the most stuffed
animals real-time oversized mechanical
Tetris oh yeah these are all this is bad
just take just tape a knife onto a
Roomba and see who gets a knife duct
tape to the top that's that's a plot of
metal head right there yeah okay I think
that's gonna do it for the day we need
to go decompress after this blockchain
crap I just I don't I would say wake of
it yeah where we got a full week of
blockchain stuff we can we talk about no
facets it's gonna be great
no no it's gonna be good questions we've
got a great package
it's called blockchain decoded check it
on SEANET first story obviously Steven
Jenkins piece and if you liked anything
you saw or heard on this podcast please
