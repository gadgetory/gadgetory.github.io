Smash Brothers ultimate is upon us I am
very bad at that video game my buddy
Alfred is very good and he reviewed it
foreseen it
we're gonna play a few rounds I'm gonna
talk to him about what this game is all
about if he likes it and you're gonna
sit there and enjoy it I hope let's get
right into it all the new characters at
the bottom they ordered it from
basically their parents in the games
electron illogically yeah except no me
fighters I don't know they're always
just in the corner for some reason I
don't know why but in cinema is one of
the new characters he's a Pokemon that
is a cat wrestler so very good they said
oh who any of these people are and I
grew up with Nintendo my whole life not
man but that doesn't make any sense
well cloud is not a Nintendo yeah that's
right
what is this sort of package offer that
maybe wasn't in the last Super Smash
game that was on Wii U the stage was in
super smash bros melee but it was not in
brawl and this is like one of the
tournament stages that people play a lot
in melee because it has like a really
large like blast zone
I'm at like a really high percentage
right now and even if you hit me like
all the way up I probably would not die
compared to the last super smash game
when this was announced they were
worried that this was just gonna be like
an evolution of that first
oh yeah Wii U game what can you like
yeah a lot of people were really worried
that would just be a port like in the
same way that Mario Kart 8 deluxe was
just Mario Kart 8 on switch this is a
completely different game this is you
know obviously if like all these new
characters they changed the physics up a
lot and it's like much harder to you
know run away from people it's much
harder to like you know constantly dodge
somebody without any consequences which
makes it like much more aggressive to
play like it forces you to like get out
of like you're hiding spots and like go
and fight instead which I really enjoy a
lot it's obviously like much more fun to
watch I'm not good at this game yeah at
all can you cuz you could tell cuz I
just kind of fell off this for no reason
there for someone who's a casual you
know Smash fan like me or what are they
gonna notice that is kind of different
from the last iteration I think the
biggest thing for more casuals is looks
like you have a moves list now so I
don't know what you're doing at all you
should go to your character and like
look through that they were talking
about how rage is different now yeah so
rage was a mechanic that they introduced
in Smash for the one for the Wii U and
the 3ds which basically was that your
knock-back like you hitting me off the
stage was a lot further if you were
losing that's fun like when you're
playing with friends cuz you know you
have to like comebacks and all that sure
and you want the playing field to be
even in some capacity yeah but I mean
for competitive players that were kind
of annoyed by that because it was
basically you know if somebody's losing
then
you know they have an advantage and like
the game was kind of rewarding them for
that rage is still in this game but they
like severely reduced it now as
ambitious as this game is with the
amount of characters do you think they
handled it well do you think they were
able to like wrap their heads around it
and really give like a complete kind of
package yeah even in the story mode you
could see that they did a lot as far as
the story mode goes and even like on
just the characters themselves like I'm
playing with Simon Belmont from
Castlevania yeah so he has all this
attacks but look if you just hold a you
just hold the whip out and you can just
swing it around that's good and they
don't tell you that you said you enjoyed
some of the story stuff you think they
deliver on that yeah the story I thought
that it'd be like Subspace Emissary
which came out for brawl on the Wii well
you know once you did it it was over and
but yeah there's so much replay value on
the board I haven't even finished it yet
I've been playing it for about four or
five days now I've actually been playing
it way more on the handout than I have
on a TV like this just because I'm out
and about a lot and I don't like to like
stay home and just play video games all
the time playing this on the go my
friends has been pretty fun I use like
the joy Khan controller what you would
think is really annoying cuz it's so
small and there's not as many buttons on
it as a GameCube controller has but from
the matches that I played like it's
limited like obviously but it's still
like really good to play with you think
this is the best you know kind of like
eSports friendly version of the game
that they've my would yeah I would
definitely say so they they added a lot
to it
to make it more eSports friendly like I
think the scores on the screen like are
really helpful for spectators I'm very
interested to see where it goes like in
the meta game wise just because you know
when the last match released you know a
lot of people thought that bow there was
supposed to be a really good character
and then it took enough after enough
time people like figured out the meta
game
and figured out that you know there's
much better characters than Bowser
honestly this were like the last Smash
Brothers game which I hope it isn't I
think I'd be like happy with it that's
high praise thank you very much Alfred
thank you for the beating and if you
