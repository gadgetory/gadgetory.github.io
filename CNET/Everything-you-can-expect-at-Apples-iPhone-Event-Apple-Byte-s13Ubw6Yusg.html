the Apple bite for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple this is
the episode where we're going to break
down everything we know and expect to
see at Apple's iPhone event that's
taking place on September the 12th at
the Steve Jobs theater at Apple Park and
guess what it's the very first time
they'll be holding an event at their
shiny new campus so let's jump into
everything we've heard an apple bite
nation if you've been watching you know
about 99% of this stuff but guess what I
know you're still watching I see you
okay first up it's the 10th anniversary
iPhone and it's still unclear exactly
what they'll call it reputable leaker
Evan Blass says he's heard iPhone x a
name you heard us throw out there before
people were talking about it as an
option case makers at Aoife and Berlin
we're changing their iPhone case cue
names to iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 plus for
the lower tier phones and using iPhone
addition for the 10th anniversary phone
now that's one of the few true unknowns
that we'll find out at the keynote with
blast saying that pre-orders will happen
on September the 15th with the phone
releasing at stores and shipping on
September the 22nd now it's obviously
the 10th anniversary iPhone that
everyone is waiting for it will be the
first major design change the iPhone is
seen in about three years with Apple
finally moving into a 5.8 inch OLED
display with a minimal 4 millimeter
bezel around its curved glass edges the
biggest change will be the complete
removal of a physical home button it
won't be on the backside of the iPhone
either and according to Bloomberg we'll
see the introduction of a software dock
similar to the iPad running iOS 11 that
will include different gesture controls
to open and close apps or for
multitasking now how will functionality
like touch ID and Apple pay be replaced
well according to reports the chin at
the top of the phone will house a 3d
facial scanning sensor that will lock
your phone as well as authenticate
purchases Bloomberg's mark diamond says
Apple will pitch face ID is faster more
secure and more accurate than touch ID
and it will have to be to keep Apple
oilless very happy now details in an
earlier home pod firmware leak also
indicate it might be able to detect your
face while laying flat on a table
surface and a feature to tap to wake
your phone found on Android phones Kobe
coming to the iPhone as well this 3d
facial recognition feature will be the
centerpiece of this phone and we still
don't really know exactly how it works
but you can be sure Apple isn't going to
let you unlock your phone with a picture
from another phone like the galaxy s 8
and Note 8 still do as for the chin at
the top of the phone get used to it
Apple doesn't plan on trying to hide it
the status bar will be split into left
and right sides the Cupertino kids
internally call them ears the left side
will display time while the right side
shows Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity
according to reports now the deep blacks
of the OLED screen will allow it to
blend together with the ears at times
the ears can reportedly change depending
on the app but they will be noticeable
on the home screen with wallpapers that
are not dark or during app usage okay
the new iPhone will get an all-new ten
nanometer a 11 processor that looks like
it will just beast any other phone on
the market say like you saw with the
iPad pro Cadoo right son well wireless
charging is also expected to come to the
new iPhone with purported leaked photos
showing off its internal components with
a wireless charging coil inside reports
have also said the actual wireless
charging accessory will be hard to get
will potentially be available after the
phone is released at a later time with a
software update around iOS 11.1 now the
headphone jack won't be coming back
that's a no-brainer
and improved ip68 water and dust
protection are expected as well we'll
see three new phones the keynote
successors to the iPhone 7 and 7 plus
and the 10th anniversary iPhone you know
this and a new leak from Benjamin Gaskin
shows two purported SIM card trays that
are made to match the color of the
iPhones body we might see colors
specific to the anniversary edition like
this new blush goal that is different
from the previous rose gold along with
silver and black now the new iPhone X or
the iPhone edition or a future iPhone
whatchamacallit is expected to be priced
around $1000 at a starting price but
we'll find out all the official details
in just under a week now that's not the
only thing we expect to see at Apple
September event the Apple watch Series 3
will be announced as well we aren't
expecting to see a major form factor or
design change but the biggest change
will be the addition of LTE to allow the
watch to work independently from your
phone with its own data connection
now reports say direct calling may not
be available for the LTE Apple watch but
the ability to use VoIP services like
Skype and FaceTime audio might be the
option instead new activity tracking
support has been revealed through the
home pod firmware a leak as well
including things like dancing bowling a
question and you know ball so hard
basketball like what crossover dribble
okay now the biggest question is has
Apple addressed battery life it's what
reportedly held them off from releasing
LTE and last year's series to Apple
watch we'll find out also the 4k Apple
TV is expected to be announced but there
are lots of questions surrounding it
before its release 4k is nice and we
should expect it will be running at
least an a-10 processor like it's about
time but what 4k content will actually
be supported a Wall Street Journal
report says Apple and movie Stu's
they've been battling over pricing for
4k versions of movies to be sold on
iTunes now Apple wants to sell them at
the same $19.99 price point that new HD
releases get on iTunes
while the studio's want to charge 25 to
30 dollars for a 4k version of movies on
iTunes
there's been no resolution to this yet
and Apple is reportedly scrambling to
get it done for this keynote now Apple
also announced the Amazon Prime video
app would be coming to Apple TV back in
June at WWDC but a recent report says
the app may not make it in time as well
that's two potential sources of 4k
content being left out for the 4k Apple
TV we have to at the very least be able
to instantly throw a 4k video from our
phones to the TVs through the new Apple
TV so that's something that the last
model couldn't do but if you're selling
a 4k Apple TV you better have more than
a few Netflix shows to support it and
you know what Apple knows this too
alright this keynote would also be a
great opportunity to feature a new and
improved Siri we didn't get it at WWDC
and I hope Apple shows us how Siri has
evolved because it's good but it's not
great and it doesn't match up favorably
to the competition from Amazon and
Google can we get more news about the
home pod maybe an official release date
and you know some new bells and whistles
and if I had to pick a sleeper product
that could surprise us Apple isn't going
to release a new version of the air pods
anytime soon you know there's still four
weeks on backorder so in my mind it's
not gonna happen I could be wrong but
maybe Apple drops a new
color in product red or even black for
the air pods like that might be the
second biggest news after the new phone
if they do the damn thing now Apple
September 12 Kino starts at 10 a.m.
Pacific time we'll have all of our scene
at live pre-show and post show coverage
right here on CNET live stream in
youtube starting at 9:00 a.m. Pacific
one hour before the keynote and you know
what we'll be taking your live calls
during the pre-show and post shows this
is a big one for Apple and there will be
so much to talk about I'm excited and
I'm sure you are too unless you've
already had these features in your
Android phone for a few years and I know
some of you just got mad at me for
saying that but come on Apple bye nation
grow a pair
that's gonna do it for this week's show
you can email us at the Apple bite at
cnet.com or tweet me at Brian Tong we'd
love to hear what you're thinking before
the keynote thanks so much for watching
and we'll catch y'all next time for
another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
