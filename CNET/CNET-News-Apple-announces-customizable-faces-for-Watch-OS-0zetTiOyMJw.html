and watch OS 2 that includes a beautiful
new photo space to be able to select any
photo that you have and create a watch
face out of it you can make more than
one of course and switch between them as
you like or you can select a photo album
and every time you raise your wrist
you'll see a different photo from your
album show up so we did some time-lapse
photography and some beautiful locations
around the world the way this works is
when you raise your wrist you'll see
this 24 hour shoot that we've done in
different locations and it will be your
current time there so if it's noon
you'll see noon in London if it's at
night you'll see Big Ben all lit up and
we've done this not only for London but
some other locations too you can choose
from Hong Kong Mac Lake which is a
beautiful place in the Sierras as well
as New York and Shanghai and London now
you can customize your watch with these
images but you can also choose to show
the information that you like on your
watch face with something in traditional
watch terms is called complications
now with watch OS 2 we're really excited
to enable app developers to make your
own complications and what if you could
go forward in time and actually see that
information update on your watch face
well we're supporting that and watch os2
was something that we call time travel
and you'll be able to rotate your
digital crown and you can go both
forward and backward through time and
the information will update right on
your screen when I rotate the crown you
can see it's changing the time and it's
showing me things that are coming up so
you can see all the information that
you'd like to see in the time that you
want to look at really really fun way to
interact with time on your watch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
