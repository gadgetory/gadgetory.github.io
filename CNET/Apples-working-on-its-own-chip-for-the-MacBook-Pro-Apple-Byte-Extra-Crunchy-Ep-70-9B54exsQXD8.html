crunchy podcast with your host mr. Brian
Tong what's up everybody welcome to the
show it's the big show it's the Apple
byte extra crunchy all that Munchie
episode 7d we're killing it at Monday
May 7 Oh when we hit 100 we're gonna
have to do something crazy on the 70
times it's crazy
we've been doing this for a long time it
seems like it's a long time so again we
had some issues with our voicemail
system so if you did call we apologize
it kind of got messed up we will
continue to take your calls we loved all
the calls that we got last week when we
kind of set the theme of the future of
Apple this is kind of one I want to set
you guys up for next week we've heard a
lot about Apple talking about augmented
reality I want you all to chime in with
these rumored Apple glasses that we've
talked about the past few shows yeah
what do you think about it and what do
you want to see in them or what do you
think will make them great I'll give you
45 seconds to a minute but really the
shorter it is the better because then we
can talk about and using the show
extra calendar week during this quarter
compared to last year's that fell and so
I'm not I'm not exactly sure I just read
that I just read it okay I know don't
don't ask me everything I think it was a
leap year laughter you know
oh really Brian why is that I'm like I
have no damn idea so weird so here's the
thing Apple last year in the first
quarter of 2016
had their best sales quarter ever then
it dipped down the past three quarters
and now kind of in a resurgence during
the holiday season it flipped the script
and did it one more time who were the
culprits what what do you think was the
product Beecham that got them to this
point well last week we talked about the
iPhone 7 so that's what it was right
here for your QR correct ding ding ding
ding Wow I have to say you can never
underestimate the power of the iPhone
and the Apple brand it's insane so
here's the numbers Apple sold a record
seventy eight point three million
iPhones during the quarter that's up
from seventy four point eight million a
year earlier if you want to talk about
Mac sales Mac sales rose slightly from
5.4 million this year compared to 5.3
million last year just basically a
hundred thousand units
I think that's an actually surprising
number in a bad way Apple release their
new touch bar max right in the q4 and a
brand new product there's a lot of pent
up demand for that and you're telling me
that they just eked out last year which
didn't have any significant new models
that's actually to me a little bit of a
letdown yeah that it didn't have i'm not
saying give me millions and millions
more but i would have expected the max
to have a higher tick than just point 1
million units from a year ago my friend
my best friend the ipad oh my gosh
continued to decline falling to 13 point
1 million units compared to 16 point one
a year ago and even at that i they still
sold 13 million that's a lot
3 million 3 million less than last year
Wow still a continuous I believe it's
arguably declined for the past
eight quarters in a year uh eight
quarters in the over the past two years
is the iPad category just to bounce back
a quick thing about how impressive the
iPhone success is during the course of
the year they track you know phones who
sold what what company was doing the
best so during the course of the year
Samsung was the leader in ship shipments
of phones again that's not necessarily
sales but from purely shipment volume
Samsung each quarter was the leader
until q4 Apple finally surpassed Samsung
now I do want to make it clear that if
you total all four quarters and you make
it a final total of all four quarters
Samsung still did out ship Apple for the
year but for Apple they even surpass
Samsung in one quarters pretty
impressive in really what it came down
to his appleson not only was it the
iPhone 7 but during the earnings call
Tim Cook said that this year for the
first time the sales mix when we talk
about iPhones versus iPhone plus the
iPhone 7 plus had the largest share of
that mix that it has ever seen compared
to past iPhone plusses Wow so sometimes
got to sell me the plus is definitely a
popular model for them that portrait
bouquet effect they're gonna keep doing
what it was you know I'm frustrated
because of someone who loves the phone I
don't like the fact that they're
fragmenting the models like oh the
high-end gets this feature and the
regular model doesn't I I hate that
actually but yeah it is a pain but you
know from a business standpoint and
again this is not what Apple used to do
this is why I continue to say this is a
different Apple from a business
standpoint they make more money per unit
when you're selling them an iPhone 7
plus instead of someone like me who's
like I'm just gonna get an iPhone 7
because it fits better than my skinny
jeans yeah true yeah aesthetics you know
yeah but the the the the most shocking
thing to me is last year Apple just had
like this crazy negative year you know
like people were just upset with them
and like why are they doing why are they
making all these changes and they still
overcame and sold so many iPhones
remember our call one of our callers
last week when we talked about the
feature of the iPhone said
oh when is Apple gonna be the market
leader again and you know what we said
is look in q1 of last year they had
their best their best quarter ever in
the history of the company he said when
are they gonna get back to the glory
days of Steve Jobs financially they are
in the glory years like these like
surpass right this is the holy glory
like OMG WTF chicheng to team momoney
momoney momoney this is it this is it
right now so from a financial success
standpoint they're doing just fine but
again we've got a radiator rate they may
not necessarily be the most innovative
company right now but they're doing just
fine and I think that you've seen Apple
kind of now knowing that they still
continue to hold this dominant spot they
don't mind waiting a year they don't
mind waiting even two years they don't
even mind waiting three years before
they put certain features in their
products like wireless charging like bra
yeah maybe years later they're gonna
wait and they're gonna try to do it as
best they can and maybe even try to like
reinvent it you know it's and it's
unfortunately you know people are still
bought see everyone wants them to be
more innovative you know how you get a
company to be more innovative you stop
buying their products but that's not
gonna happen
yeah clearly that's not gonna happen are
these the glory your theme song for
Apple beautiful that is that that is
what it's all about so there you go a
recap of Apple's earnings on really
significant one note Apple continues to
refuse to tell us how many actual Apple
watch units they sold but according to a
strategy analytics these are rough
estimates based on units shipped not
sold
they believe that Apple shipped a
record-breaking 5.2 million Apple watch
units this last quarter making it the
most popular SmartWatch of the holiday
season that's according to the latest
research Apple captured an estimated 60
3.4 percent of the worldwide SmartWatch
market Apple's closest competitor
Samsung only eight hundred thousand
smartwatches in the quarter Wow and the
Samsung one is a lot cheaper
the Samsung one has this dope dial a lot
of cool stuff to do
the Samsung one has this dope dial like
basically think of the iPod scroll wheel
around the face of the watch it's a
circular watch it is sick yeah Apple
just just steal it
steal it already I mean I have the
digital crown though the digital crown
worse no I mean I wear CB forever
I'm completely unusable it doesn't work
very good I've never tried it they chant
for the record they change their entire
operating system to pretty much make the
digital crown almost useless with the
new OS because they they tried to make
they kind of forced you in the OS to use
it so much and people aren't using it
it's like an extra button that has a
windy dial that really just used to zoom
in and out of your apps and people don't
really look at the entire apps on their
watch they just go to now that watch OS
3 has a tray of basically your 10 most
used apps and just hit one button you go
there you're not gonna be juggling 20
apps on your Apple watch
you're just not yeah no way so the to me
the digital crown is almost and some
people you know y'all can call me 1-800
what's our number six one six two six
three eight the digital crown is almost
useless to me quite honestly yeah it's
almost useless yeah I know you can do
this time jump where you look at your
watch face you can scroll it up and down
and see what's coming up next how many
of you really do that you don't let's be
real you don't you do that my nieces and
nephews do that because I think it's fun
to look at I'm like oh you're ready it's
pretty you're the one that's using
you're using my digital crown thanks I
appreciate that so 5.2 roughly estimated
5.2 million Apple watches a shipped now
Tim Cook did say in his earnings report
that it was the best Apple watch quarter
ever but they do bundle it in their
other products that can that also
include the Apple TV there what else
does include I'm I believe it includes
like their Beats headphones as well that
other products category that they don't
list specific unit sales dropped 8% to
4.2 billion dollars in the quarter
compared to four point three five a year
ago so we'll see what happens with that
I did think also you always get some
kind of cool fun little notes from this
earnings report Tim Cook did say when he
was asked about what are you guys doing
you're sitting on 200 billion dollars in
cash
what's coming up in the television space
what about original content Tim Cook did
say that uh we're you know based on his
words we're dipping our toe in the water
we're gonna try a few things we're come
on Tim loosen the purse strings start
throwing out some cash some open up the
damn floodgates seriously it's like hire
some real producers hey um carpool
karaoke ripoff probably not gonna do too
well
the dr. Dre biopic with the sex scenes
in it what was the app the app show the
planet of the I ended of yeah I'm I'm
okay I'm not gonna there's no way in
hell that I'm going to subscribe to
Apple music just to watch these shows
hell now for people that are listening
that haven't been following the track
Apple's planning to put their exclusive
content that they produce only on the
Apple music service because clearly that
makes sense to put it on a music service
so bad change the name of it do
something different put it on your Apple
TV but they're gonna they're gonna
hopefully think that it'll drive
subscriptions I'm I'm not one of those
people but I would say that if plan of
the apps was put on a different platform
and the characters that they choose that
are developing the apps are compelling I
might at least watch a few episodes will
have to give herself I got to give
everyone you know like every product I
give it a chance before I talk smack
about it we're lucky we got to critique
these things but a Tim Cook here's what
Tim Cook said at the earnings about this
that whole getting into TV in terms of
original content we have put our toe in
the water doing some original content
for Apple music and that will be rolling
out throughout the year we are learning
from that and we'll go from there the
way that we participate in the changes
that are going on in the media industry
that I fully expect to accelerate from
the cable bundling beginning to break
down okay cable bundling beginning to
break down dude Apple you could have had
a subscription service a long-ass time
ago oh yeah and you didn't like you
already failed this whole dip your toe
in the water there's a company I talked
about it on our show that's kind of put
their whole foot like they've jumped
like head to toe in it's called Netflix
have you heard of them they're a good
they're like 80 millions of
they need 80 million and one because
this bro is my bro over here still yet
to jump on I'm slow oh wait did you say
your bar into friends account
thanks Patrick eighty million
eighty million times that by I'm
actually divide that by five because you
can allow five accounts to be shared
still that's huge
it is massive so uh you know we'll see
what Apple does in 2017 one other side
note about the iPad Tim Cook did say
that there are exciting things in store
for the iPad pro I really hope so it's
my favorite Apple product like and I
know I'm in the minority and I don't
care there's people that say I'm a hater
on Apple should just listen to me like
gush about the iPad pro or just the iPad
in general it's like dude okay can I
tell you squig story let me tell my
story I'm funny one two okay over the
break because I was feeling nostalgic
about that
7 year I pad anniversary oh yeah I went
online and I got an original iPad 16
gigs it's literally in pristine
condition like the person who sold it
might have only touched it once I bought
it for a hundred bucks
whoa and this is just for me as it keeps
and it works it's fully fiction
nothing's gonna work there's not any
there's not a single dent on it there's
nothing it is pristine and I was just
like you know I have the original iPhone
that is actually mine I kind of
regretted selling the original iPad I'm
like you know what if I can find it I
don't want to spend $200 I don't want it
someone who's like Oh stealing the body
this thing is spankin it's gorgeous I
should bring it in even that's awesome
and I'm so happy I'm like that's that's
what's up that's how much I like the
iPad okay people that think I hate Apple
okay continue yeah I was just gonna say
like yesterday I got home and my wife
had just taken the iPad from my son
who's four years old and I could have
made the best iPhone or an iPad
commercial just my son just screaming
just going oh for like half an hour just
screaming I want the iPad that's that
would be a marketing campaign that Apple
should get but that's actually you know
it we should maybe maybe this is
something to do on the Apple buy video
show which would ask people to submit
videos like you know how Jimmy Kimmel
does like when they tell the
kids that they ate all the Halloween
candy oh yeah yeah take an iPad away
from your kid and just record the
reaction that's a good one it's actually
there's be some funny stuff in there
doing my son was insane he was insane
mentally I'm gonna do a contest about
that okay let's uh we've been we've been
going in all these different directions
but let's take a break
talk about our sponsor yes our sponsor
Marah in the house technology has
changed the way we run have you guys and
gals heard about this thanks to
smartphones now even casual runners can
map their routes create pumpup playlists
and track their progress but you know
taking advantage of all these
technologies is meant to take out your
phone you got to look at it it's kind of
annoying and you lose that motion that
motivation so now there's Mara it's a
hands-free running assistant that uses
voice recognition and the microphone in
your earbuds to help you optimize your
runs now check this out you can tell her
what kind of run you'd like to do ask
questions about your speed your pace or
your location it's Maura AI and you have
to have her you can have her play your
albums in music but it's also really
cool it can come it tells you
comparisons to your past runs to warn
you about changes in weather
she'll track your progress by note
progress by noting your hot spots and
this is cool you can also connect Maura
to Amazon's echo and ask her about your
lifetime statistics and records you've
set while you're getting ready for your
next run check it out visit Maura AI
Maura dot ai correction that's an easier
you are elder amara.org
pretty cool I don't want to try it out
that's cool I've been seeing a lot of a
lot of these companies doing that where
they have a virtual assistant like you
know coaching you and pushing you like
you better run run fast and then you
start getting pissed off at the hello
I'm gonna run run I like it so Maura
taught AI back to the show back the
stories we told you apples working on
their own mac chip this story coming out
this week from Bloomberg which is a
really awesome mark German formally 9 to
5 Mac he's really the man I'm gonna keep
on calling the man because he gets every
man damn scoop good on your mark Normand
cuz you keep me in business too
Real Talk keep us informed Apple is
designing a new chip for future Mac
laptops that would take on more of the
functionality handled by
Intel processors according to people
familiar with the matter in the report
they says the chip went into development
last year it's similar to one that's
actually already been being used in the
touch bar MacBook Pro we know that touch
bar feature there's a chip that manages
that you know that shows off the emojis
the shortcut apps all of those things
internally this new chip that they're
working on is called the t 310 it would
handle some of the computers low power
mode functionality and also it's based
on the ARM Holdings technology right arm
chips huge and Apple technology we have
the a-10s in the phone's a 9s currently
in the Apple iPads and also down along
the line it's the the a line of
processors have been ubiquitous with
Apple for at least geez I feel like five
six years at least even more than that
maybe even from really early on um Apple
although apples only account for 75% of
worldwide computer shipments they've
really kind of set the standard for
design and improvements they're trying
to really be less dependent on until
this is not them completely ditching
Intel but this new ARM based Mac chip
known as the t1 sorry the t1 that was
the one that powered the touch bar but
this new t3 10 chip is what they're
working on to work on some of those
low-power in the background things again
this is not a hard core processor that
will run your machine but I always
remember the rumors of when is Apple
going to release an ARM based processor
MacBook stand alone no Intel chip
whatsoever
they're they're kind of working towards
those baby steps but right now it's a
complimentary chip they do expect that
this new chip the t 310 could make it to
MacBooks
in the new model that is releasing this
year that's really round security number
so so are everyone who bought their new
MacBooks right now just flapping you're
ahead of me like damn why did I wait I
told you all seriously I told you all
this year I was like thinking you're
about to say like 2018 2019 which I just
said this year so so not only we're
gonna get the KB Lake processor family
be lake yeah yeah they're gonna get the
new update um you're going to get this
new T 310 ship that's going to help
along with the machine your machine is
going to be significantly better than
problem by that time let's be honest the
touch bar will be more mature yes yes
yes
people are asking like is how much is so
I've been corrected multiple times like
been clinic tabulate forever people like
dude it's KB like it's baby like that's
it's a lame I know so will this KB like
processor help performance wise it's
supposed to be a 20% increase in
performance as well as battery life so
I'm gonna guess quite honestly although
it's not a world-changing thing
look the MacBook Pro line currently
actually has battery issues even though
Apple released that beta update to solve
some of those and just really to get
Consumer Reports to be like yeah we do
recommend that I have plenty of friends
who are using the touch book matte touch
bar MacBook Pros let's say they still
don't get the best battery life yeah
yeah so to me a 20% increase let's say
it's supposed to get 10 hours let's even
say you're really getting it more like 6
you're getting basically another hour or
two so that alone and better performance
is more than enough reason to be like
yeah because the processor family they
put in the current touch bar MacBook
Pros are really from like a year ago a
year and a half ago Holly so let's make
the jump it also is gonna support 32
gigs of ram for all your powerhouse you
guys yeah that's pretty
so those three things better processor
32 gig rams touch bar will be much
better much more support will be out by
then and was a 310 chip written yeah
come on don't tell me it's not worth the
waiting yeah that'll be an exciting
keynote this year you'll still you'll
still have to use dongles though oh you
could count on dongles yeah ready to
dong we're here to stay so that that's
just kind of a wrap up on what's going
on with Apple working on building their
own ARM chips again complimentary there
the report did make it clear that there
is no intention for them to drop Intel
anytime soon cool so just sit on that i
I do think what I actually want to see
and this is still coming early it's
coming like in two or three years but
whatever we're time out the future AT&amp;amp;T
is going to roll out initially
5g networks in two cities
now the 5g standard has been established
but quite honestly by the time it the
chipsets roll out get into people's
machines and phones and blah blah blah
it's really and B and by the time the
standards all figured out it's gonna
really be about two more years or so
yeah yeah so everyone's saying I want 5g
you're not gonna really have products
right now that are gonna even take
advantage of it but maybe we'll finally
see a laptop that connects purely on
cellular connection now by that day
because I think 5g is at 500 megabits
per second top speed Wow that's more
that's more than what our Internet
through a pipe through a cord delivers
to us so that'll be interesting to see
how that that's a game-changer to me a
vowel we use our devices in it'll
probably most likely help slim down the
Machine a little bit they're already a
few laptops that do that right there's a
like a cool I don't want to say a
Chromebook but there's a couple laptops
that have cellular connectivity G yeah I
can't remember yeah they're not max
that's for sure
well maybe in two or three years they
will be yeah all right I'm just some
other quick updates the Apple earpods
sign silently kind of behind the scenes
received a bug fix firmware update if
you have your air pods connected to your
phone and you look into your general and
your settings there's a slot in there
that says air pods the current the
previous number was three point three
point one it's been updated at three
point five point one there have been no
explicit kind of improvements I will say
though that my ear pods they're supposed
to air update when you plug them in when
they're in the case but my air pod still
have break ups once in a while really
yeah they I was driving one time and I
don't know if it was competing with a
Bluetooth signal in a car or whatnot but
there were times where I'd basically
lose 3-2 force about three seconds of
connectivity to my friend and it kept on
happening over and over and over and it
wasn't cuz the batteries were low but it
happened I'm like okay something's up
with these air pods because I'm you know
I'm using them a lot just to try them
out and that can drive you crazy - yeah
it's so do you drive with them on is
that on you like a new behavior I'm not
gonna admit that I mean that's I don't
think it's a dangerous thing no it's I
just don't want to admit that I
we're pods but I mean that seems like a
behavior change you know yeah yeah if
you're just kind of wearing them all the
time yeah I mean the people that are
wearing them all the time come on just
stop that
like seriously bro stop like it's stupid
if you're a lady you can cover up with
your hair I think that's pretty awesome
actually
there's what there's a dude Dominic
though he's an IT guy here and he wears
somebody has like like cool earrings
yeah stuff and it looks cool you know it
Dominic you cool man
I know I got him I got I got I got
nothing but love for Dominic man so this
bug bug fixed firmware update is out but
they have not Apple never specified
exactly what it does in a quick one
we're gonna skip over just a quick
headline Facebook reportedly working on
an app for the Apple TV to bring
long-form video content yeah yeah guess
what people do listen and watch things
that are longer than I made it in 30
seconds yeah Facebook's going for it
they're gonna inform content you know
I'm not well let's like we'd like to
keep our jobs here but Beecham's
laughing about well yeah yeah they're
gonna 90 second videos and there you
have to have a 90 second video on
Facebook in order for it to serve an ad
so that's a new rule and then they're
gonna start like getting on set-top
boxes Roku all that stuff so they want
to make more money
they also said that I believe that
Facebook also said that they would only
have 15 second ads in there yes I
believe if I'm correct you're correct
and actually YouTube just made that
announcement this morning to 2018 only
15 second ads no 30 second ads ever
again look when you get millions of
views you better vote sorry you better
freaking switz Wow you better switch
down to 15 seconds you guys are making
money no matter what let's just be
honest and who everyone hates a 30
second everybody hates a 30 second ad I
hate us a 30 second ad and you know we
get a lot of good feedback from viewers
who watched see that about that exactly
oh thanks nerd nerd alert LG is ultra
fine 5k display right this is the only
display that Apple is promoting for you
to get as a secondary screen for your
MacBook it you can even plug two of
these LG 5k ultra fine displays to your
it's just been revealed and found out
and confirmed by LG themselves that if
you have one of their displays near a
router so let's say you have a wireless
router within 2 meters that's basically
like 6 feet the screen will cause will
either flicker out wilcott can also more
likely than not cause your MacBook Pro
connected to it to also freeze causing
you to restart because it has issues
dealing with being near a router like LG
has confirmed this this is again the
only it doesn't affect other external
monitors but the hardware can become
pretty much unusable like the monitor
the monitor that Apple recommends the
only monitor that Apple recommends
because remember Apple got out of the
business
yeah has these issues again people that
don't have a near their router fine you
won't have these issues but I would say
a lot of people in apartments typically
at most of the computer stuff is all
near the router I know mine is most
people's things right because you want a
hard line it in you have it right next
to it I mean you know my router sitting
on my my TV stand you know right next to
my television and sometimes I put a
computer right there or you know that's
kind of weird yeah yeah so uh it's been
inconsistent but yes it glitches out it
can cause you to really might have to
restart reboot your computer to get it
back and sync you might have to be going
through this back and forth but it is a
known issue by LG LG has admitted it
there is no word on really what you can
do other than not use your screen near
your router so good luck to y'all um
this one kind of put a smile on my face
it was kind of more of a sad trombone
Justin long you remember the guy from
the get him out this is PC ads very
effective if you very I guess they're
trying to catch that magic in a bottle
again Huawei has now hired him in a TV
commercial it's kind of like a bad
Hollywood remake actually if you think
so it's like interviewing I don't know
if you can we don't want to play the
audio cuz it's kind of distracting but
for people that can see it I think if
you scroll down on that article beech
the
is there um he basically is sitting down
and he's like interviewing a hallway
mate phone energy tech have I ever
directed anything before no do I have a
director outfit a scarf a hat and a vest
yes this is the worst that ever this
arguably that might have ended Justin
Long's illustrious career yeah by the
way I think I can't remember which one
it was
I feel like he was in a lethal weapon
movie no he was in the die hard die hard
last I heard the last I heard that was
actually cool yeah yeah yeah don't die
with a vengeance or something die hard
with a vengeance that was a good one
that was a fun one Oh anyway is that
Justin Long nothing but love for you
because long rhymes with Tom and some
people have called me long time
hi oh don't listen kids cover your cover
yours alright a couple good apples far
following Mario's mobile success
Nintendo plans now to release two to
three new iPhone games each year sweet
remember how many years I've been
telling you this like Nintendo freaking
released games for like 5 bucks on the
iPhone I've been saying this for five to
six years yeah yeah yeah easy might even
be longer than that they have lost so
much money for not listening to me
Super Mario run was a success I believe
the number was somewhere out like only
seven or eight percent of people who
download the app actually ended up
paying for it but then it had something
like 74 million dollars yeah it was
something ridiculous along those lines
it was 70 plus million the stat was like
seven or eight percent of people bought
the version that's $10 per so they still
did just fine they still made around
like sixty three million dollars they
made so far and when did it release tear
Lord honest like a month ago maybe in a
month at three million was it right
before CES or something like it's like
right before we take a break yeah so um
other games that are coming out for at
least Nintendo this year they just made
an announcement about Fire Emblem Heroes
for iOS it's coming and Android it's due
to release actually on Thursday which is
today at the time of this recording and
and the final game that is expected to
be coming this year will be animal
crossing which will just if you get into
the game it's gonna just suck your life
away I've played it I'm gonna stay away
I played a long time ago you stay away
from me
you get these critters you like meet
other people and like like these things
note though I weaned myself off words
with friends and that whoa whoa it was
very difficult it's hard I'm just gonna
drop a note here for my homies unjust
injustice too they have this beta out
it's insane
injustice injustice this the DC Comics
game that I'm playing that so much I'm
not gonna get into it but just look it
up or just sign up for the beta your
minds gonna be blown nice what platform
is that Xbox and ps4 Rox
got it justice baby true okay and then
the final story that brings a smile to
my face if it does actually happen if it
does happen according to the New York
Post which can sometimes kind of put out
some sketchy stuff let's be real
and our very sensational headlines which
we all love according to a report from
the New York Post Prince the man the
myth the legend oh my gosh I'm one of
the biggest Prince fans reports that
Prince's Warner Music Group albums will
come to Apple music on February the 12th
now right now Prince's music is only
available on title but is expected to
get a broader rollout in two weeks
his music will come to Apple music
Spotify Pandora Google Play Deezer and
others honestly I sound really stupid
right now I have not heard of Deezer do
you know what Deezer is that's the first
time I ever heard of these ever I know
what these DS is these days well yeah
so princess music it was available on
streaming services up until July 20 2015
the artists pulled his work from those
platforms prior to his death it doesn't
mean that all of his stuff will be out
and available but the fact that it could
see the light of day ice something is
skeptical inside of me knowing how
Prince's camp operates yeah I mean right
now his family is like really trying to
fight each other to get control of
Prince's album and I think Prince would
actually be against this he's not a fan
of being on the Internet I agree which
is why he took all the stuff
he's thinking out of quote like what
does the internet what good is the
internet ever done for anybody here's
something like that right
he thinks it's a very negative place so
this is interesting I mean it's clearly
a move by the label and his family to
get some money some revenue happening so
and if you recall right um there was a
time where if I believe I don't even
think print I could be wrong earlier
early on in iTunes years correct me if
I'm wrong I believe his music was
available or was not but he did release
one of his new albums overseas in the UK
as a physical CD in the newspaper or
magazine oh really huh yeah and it was
during the time where the iTunes store
was out and it was kind of like a
statement of like um yeah I'm still
doing physical media yeah yeah like just
to kind of say I'm not about this
probably making less money you know
right going through the ivory but it was
a statement by Prince and all I'm gonna
tell you is Prince is the best concert
I've ever been to in my entire life so
just a greatest concert I've ever seen
the musicality was I've never seen
anything like it so jealous and so let's
assume that was one of those artists
that I was super happy to see so anyways
we love your prints hopefully you show
up on Apple music even though I'm not
I'm still not gonna subscribe he's got a
couple tracks on the Amazon Prime and
stuff like that yeah I think and anyways
come on let's be real if you're a real
Prince fan you bought his music yeah you
already I know you own his discs I mean
let's this is for the Millennials to
learn yeah yeah um if you I'm gonna even
refer people to watch well there's
there's a lot of things you can watch
but watch Prince's Super Bowl
performance that was on the rain was so
good in the rain look it up we don't
play any Prince music here because like
his camp in the past like was it it was
like a baby video or something they they
took down or they got in an illegal
battle with no there was a baby video
dancing Utah yeah yeah yeah yeah it was
playing in the back of my background of
like the parents house yeah at their
house and he sued because thou and then
I think they ruled against him because I
said that's just kind of natural sound
that was happening yeah house it wasn't
like you know wasn't like a
it wasn't like a drug focus it wasn't a
focus of the video yeah
but anyways exciting stuff so all the
youngins seriously if you want to hear
what music music sounds like listen to
Prince did okay what about okay before
we go a quick thing didn't you and your
wife kind of like to have was princess
told me about this
rinse yeah I'm that's the reason why my
wife and I are married we're at a club
like oh it was like a work party yes
that song kiss but yeah Prince away that
was like my opportunity I turned to my
wife and I kissed her right during that
part and that was like we played that at
our wedding stuff so yeah Prince thank
