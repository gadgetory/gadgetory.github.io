crunchy podcast with your host mr. brian
Tong what's up everybody welcome to the
show it's the big show it's the apple
byte extra crunchy all that munchy
episode 7 d we're killing in san dimas
70 when we hit 100 we're gonna have to
do something crazy on the seventy times
crazy we've been we've been doing this
for a long time I kiss it seems like it
has it's a long time so again we had
some issues with our voicemail system so
if you did call we apologize it kind of
got messed up we will continue to take
your calls we loved all the calls that
we got last week when we kind of set the
theme of the future of Apple this is
kind of one I want to set you guys up
for next week we've heard a lot about
Apple talking about augmented reality I
want you all to chime in with these
rumored apple glasses that we've talked
about the past few shows yeah what do
you think about it and what do you want
to see in them or what do you think will
make them great i'll give you 45 seconds
to a minute but really the shorter it is
the better because then we can talk
about and using the show 1 800 61 62 63
8 is the phone line to call leave your
name where you're from just get into it
but we want to talk about apple's
rumored augmented reality glasses what
do you think about that prospect will it
help them will not we want to hear it
all we'll talk about it all next week
but that's kind of just to set you up
but let's get in the show this week
Apple just honestly kind of blew my mind
this week they reported their earnings
this is for q1 of 2017 financial quarter
fiscally that would be equivalent to the
last quarter of two thousand sixteen on
the calendar so that would be october
november and december apple had their
best quarter ever in revenue that's
crazy best quarter ever in the history
of the company posting revenue of
seventy eight point four billion dollars
compared to revenue last year of seventy
five point nine billion now on pure
quarterly profit they were a little down
but again they had the highest revenue
quarter of all time of the history of
the company there are seventeen point
nine billion in revenue versus 18.4
billion last year now here's another
thing there was an actual
extra calendar week during this quarter
compared to last year's that it fell and
so is there like a leap year was that a
i'm not i'm not exactly sure i just read
the i just read it okay i don't don't
don't don't ask me everything siege it
was a leap year left here you're all
y'all rightly Brian why is that i'm like
i have no damn idea so weird so here's
the thing apple last year in the first
quarter of two thousand sixteen had
their best sales quarter ever then it
dipped down the past three quarters and
now kind of in a resurgence during the
holiday season it flipped the script and
did it one more time who were the
culprits what what do you think was the
product Beecham that got them to this
point well last week we talked about the
iphone 7 so that's what it was right
here for York you are correct ding ding
ding ding Wow I have to say you can
never underestimate the power of the
iphone and the Apple brand it's insane
so here's the numbers apple sold a
record 70 8.3 million iphones during the
quarter that's up from seventy four
point eight million a year earlier if
you want to talk about mac sales mac
sales rose slightly from 5.4 million
this year compared to 5.3 million last
year just basically a hundred thousand
units i think that's an actually
surprising number in a bad way Apple
release their new touch bar max right in
the queue for and a brand new product
there's a lot of pent up demand for that
and you're telling me that they just
eked out last year which didn't have any
significant new models that's actually
to me a little bit of a letdown yeah big
time that it didn't have I'm not saying
give me millions and millions more but I
would have expected the max to have a
higher tick than just point 1 million
units from a year ago my friend my best
friend the iPad oh my gosh continued to
decline falling to 13.1 million units
compared to 16.1 a year ago and even at
that I they still sold 13 million haha I
mean that's a lot 3 million three
million less than last year Wow uh still
a continuous i believe it's arguably
declined for the past
eight quarters in a year ours eight
quarters in the over the past two years
is the ipad category just to bounce back
a quick thing about how impressive the
iphone successes during the course of
the year they track you know phones who
sold what what company was doing the
best so during the course of the year
Samsung was the leader in ship shipments
of phones again that's not necessarily
sales but from purely shipment volume
Samsung each quarter was the leader
until Q for apple finally surpassed
Samsung now I do want to make it clear
that if you total all four quarters and
you make it a final total of all four
quarters Samsung still did out ship
apple for the year but for Apple to even
surpass Samsung in one quarter is pretty
impressive in really what it came down
to his Appleton not only was it the
iphone 7 but during the earnings call
Tim Cook said that this year for the
first time the sales mix when we talk
about iphones vs iphone plus the iphone
7 plus had the largest share of that mix
that it has ever seen compared to past
iphone pluses Wow so sometimes got to
sell me the plus is definitely a popular
model for them that portrait bouquet
effect they're gonna keep doing it and
what was you know I'm frustrated because
of someone who loves the phone I don't
like the fact that they're fragmenting
the models like oh the high-end gets
this feature and the regular model
doesn't I I hate that actually but yeah
it is a pain but you know from a
business standpoint and again this is
not what apple used to this is why I
continue to say this is a different
apple from a business standpoint they
make more money per unit when you're
selling them an iphone 7 plus instead of
someone like me who's like I'm just
gonna get an iphone 7 because it fits
better in my skinny jeans yeah true yeah
aesthetics you know yeah but the the the
most shocking thing to me is last year
Apple just had like this crazy negative
year you know like people were just
upset with them and like why are they
doing why are they making all these
changes they still overcame and sold so
many iphones remember our call one of
our colors last week when we talked
about the feature of the iphone said
oh one is apple going to be the market
leader again and you know what we said
is look in q1 of last year they had
their best their best quarter ever in
the history of the company he said when
are they gonna get back to the glory
days of Steve Jobs financially they are
in the glory years like these like
surpasses right this is the holy glory
like omgwtf chaching to t-mo money mo
money mo money this is it this is it
right now so from a financial success
standpoint they're doing just fine but
again we've got a radiator rate they may
not necessarily be the most innovative
company right now but they're doing just
fine and I think that you've seen Apple
kind of now knowing that they still
continue to hold this dominant spot they
don't mind waiting a year they don't
mind waiting even two years they don't
even mind waiting three years before
they put certain features in their
products like wireless charging yeah
like bra yeah maybe years later they're
gonna wait and they're gonna try to do
it as best they can and maybe even try
to like reinvent it you know it's and
it's unfortunately you know people are
still bought see everyone wants me to be
more innovative you know how you get a
company be more innovative you stop
buying their products but that's not
gonna happen yeah clearly that's not
gonna happen are these the glory your
theme song for Apple
beautiful that is that that is what it's
all about so there you go a recap of
apples earnings on really significant
one note apple continues to refuse to
tell us how many actual apple watch
units they sold but according to a
strategy analytics these are rough
estimates based on units shipped not
sold they believe that apple shipped a
record-breaking 5.2 million Apple watch
units this last quarter making it the
most popular SmartWatch of the holiday
season that's according to the latest
research Apple captured an estimated
sixty three point four percent of the
worldwide SmartWatch market apples
closest competitor Samsung only eight
hundred thousand smartwatches in the
quarter Wow and the samsung one is a lot
cheaper the samsung one has this dope
dyed a lot of cool stuff to do the
samsung what has this dope dial like
basically think of the ipod scroll wheel
around the face of the watch it's a
circular watch it is sick yeah apple
just steal it steal it already i mean i
have the digital crown though the
digital crown worse no I mean we're
seedeater ever I'm completely unused
isn't it doesn't work very good I've
never tried it they chant for the record
they change their entire operating
system to pretty much make the digital
crown almost useless with the new OS
because they they tried to make they
kind of forced you in the OS to use it
so much and people aren't using it it's
like an extra button that has a whiny
dial that really just used to zoom in
and out of your apps and people don't
really look at the entire apps on their
watch they just go to now that watch os3
has a tray of basically or 10 most used
apps just hit one button you go there
you're not going to be juggling 20 apps
on your Apple watch you're just not yeah
no way so the to me the digital crown is
almost and some people you know what
y'all can call me 1 800 what's our
number 61 62 63 8 the digital crown is
almost useless to me quite honestly yeah
it's almost useless yeah I know you can
do this time jump where you look at your
watch face you can scroll up and down
and see what's coming up next how many
of you really do that you don't let's be
real you don't you do that my nieces and
nephews do that because I think it's fun
to look at I'm like oh you're ready it's
prettier you're the one that's using
your
using my digital crown thanks I
appreciate that so 5.2 roughly estimated
5.2 million Apple watches a shipped now
Tim Cook did say in his earnings report
that it was the best Apple watch quarter
ever but they do bundle it in their
other products that can that also
include the Apple TV there what else is
include I believe it includes like their
beats headphones as well that other
products category that they don't list
specific unit sales dropped eight
percent to 4.2 billion dollars in the
quarter compared to 4.35 a year ago so
uh we'll see what happens with that I
did think also you always get some kind
of cool fun little notes from this
earnings report Tim Cook did say when he
was asked about what are you guys doing
you're sitting on two hundred billion
dollars in cash what's coming up in the
television space what about original
content Tim Cook did say that uh we're
at you know based on his words we're
dipping our toe in the water we're gonna
try a few things where come on Tim
loosen the purse strings you start
throwing out some cash some open up the
damn floodgates seriously it's like hire
some real producers hey um carpool
karaoke ripoff probably not going to do
too well uh the dr dre biopic with the
sex scenes in it what was the app the
app show the planet at the end of the i
i'm i'm ok i'm not gonna there's no way
in hell that I'm going to subscribe to
Apple music just to watch the shows
he'll now for people that are listening
that haven't been following the track
Apple's planning to put their exclusive
content that they produce only on the
Apple music service because clearly that
makes sense to put it on a music service
so bad change the name of it do
something different put it on your Apple
TV but they're gonna they're gonna
hopefully think that it'll drive
subscriptions I'm I'm not one of those
people but I would say that if plan of
the apps was put on different platform
and the characters that they choose that
are developing apps are compelling I
might at least watch a few episodes
there will have to give herself I got to
give everyone you know like every
product I give it a chance before I talk
smack about it
we're lucky we got to critique these
things but a Tim Cook here's what Tim
Cook said at the earnings about this
that whole getting into TV in terms of
original content we have put our toe in
the water doing some original content
for Apple music and that will be rolling
out throughout the year we are learning
from that and we'll go from there the
way that we participate in the changes
that are going on in the media industry
that I fully expect to accelerate from
the cable bundling beginning to break
down ok cable bundling beginning to
break down dude Apple you could have had
a subscription service a long ass time
ago oh yeah and you didn't like you
already failed this whole dip your toe
in the water there's a company I talked
about it on our show that's kind of put
the whole foot like they jumped like
head to toe in its called Netflix it
have you heard of them but they they're
a good olive about 80 million subscriber
they need 80 million and one because
this broke my bro over here still yet to
jump on I'm slow I'm slow wait did you
say your bar into friends account I am
wearing a friend of mine uh thanks
Patrick 80 million 80 million times that
by hum actually divide that by five
because you can allow five accounts to
be shared still that's huge it is
massive so uh you know we'll we'll see
what Apple does in 2017 one other side
note about the ipad Tim Cook did say
that they're exciting things in store
for the ipad pro i really hope so it's
my favorite apple product like and I
know I'm in the minority and I don't
care is people that say I'm a hater on
Apple should just listen to me like gush
about the ipad pro or just the ipad in
general it's like dude okay can I tell
his quick story yeah I was good let me
tell my story I mean you got a damn
funny 12 okay over the break because I
was feeling nostalgic about that
seven-year iPad anniversary oh yeah i
went online and i got an original ipad
16 gigs it's literally in pristine
condition like some the person who sold
it might have only touched it once i
bought it for a hundred bucks whoa and
this is just for me as it keeps and it
works it's fully fashioned nothing's
gonna work there's nothing in here
there's not a single dent on it
there's nothing it is pristine and I was
just like you know I have the original
iphone that is actually mine I kind of
regretted selling the original iPad I'm
like you know what if I can find it I
don't want to spend 200 doll I don't
want to someone who's like Oh stealing
about this thing is spanking it's
gorgeous I should bring it in even
that's awesome and I so happen like
that's that's what's up that's how much
I like the iPad okay people that think I
hate apple okay continue yeah I was just
gonna say like yesterday I got home and
my wife had just taken the iPad from my
son who's 4 years old and I could have
made the best iPhone or iPad commercial
just my son just screaming just going Oh
for like half an hour just screaming i
want the ipad that's that would be a
marketing campaign that Apple should get
by its actually you know thinking we
should maybe maybe this is something to
do on the apple byte video show which
would ask people to submit videos like
you know Jimmy Kimmel does like when
they tell the kids that they ate all the
halloween candy oh yeah yeah take an
iPad away from your kid and just record
the reaction that's a good one it's
actually there's be some funny stuff in
there doing my son was insane he was
insane mentally I'm gonna do a contest
about that okay let's uh we've been
we've been going in all these different
directions but let's take a break talk
about our sponsor yes our sponsor mara
in the house technology has changed the
way we run have you guys and gals heard
about this thanks to smartphones now
even casual runners can map the routes
create pump up playlist and track their
progress you know taking advantage of
all these technologies is meant to take
out your phone you gotta look at it it's
kind of annoying and you lose that
motion that motivation so now there's
Mara it's a hands-free running assistant
that uses voice recognition and the
microphone in your ear buds to help you
optimize your runs now check this out
you can tell her what kind of run you'd
like to do ask questions about your
speed your pace or your location it's
Mara ai and you have to have or you can
have a play your albums and music but
it's also really cool it can come it
tells you comparisons your path runs to
warn you about changes in weather she'll
track your progress by note progress by
noting your hot spots and this is cool
you can also connect Mara to Amazon's
echo and ask her about your lifetime
statistics and records you set while
you're getting ready for your next run
check it out visit Mara a
mara dot AI correction that's an easier
you are elder Amara dot two day that's
it mara dot a I pretty cool I kind of
want to try it out that's cool I've been
seeing a lot of a lot of these companies
doing that where they have a virtual
assistant like you know coaching you and
pushing you like you better run run fast
and you start getting pissed off at the
uh oh I'm gonna run run I like it so
Mara taught a I back to the show back
the stories we told you apples working
on their own mac chip this story coming
out this week from Bloomberg which is a
really awesome mark Gurman formerly a
9to5 mac he's really the man I'm gonna
keep on calm the man because he gets
every man damn scoop um good on you mark
Gurman cuz you keep me in business too
real talk keep us informed that Apple is
designing a new chip for future Mac
laptops that would take on more of the
functionality handled by Intel
processors according to people familiar
with the matter in the report they says
the chip went into development last year
it's similar to one that's actually
already been being used in the touch bar
macbook pro we know that touch bar
feature there's a chip that manages that
you know that shows off the emojis the
shortcut apps all of those things
internally this new chip that they're
working on is called the t310 it would
handle some of the computers low power
mode functionality and also it's based
on the ARM Holdings technology right arm
chips huge and Apple technology we have
the a-10s in the phones a 9s currently
in the Apple iPads and also down along
the line it's the the a line of
processors have been ubiquitous with
Apple for at least jeez I feel like five
six years at least even more than that
maybe even from really early on um Apple
although apples only count for
seventy-five percent the worldwide
computer shipments um they've really
kind of set the standard for design and
improvements they're trying to really be
less dependent on until this is not them
completely ditching Intel but this new
arm based mac chip known as the t1 sorry
this t1 that was the one that powered
the touch bar but this new teeth
retention
is what they're working on to work on
some of those low power in the
background things again this is not a
hard core processor that will run your
machine but I always remember the rumors
of win is Apple going to release an
arm-based processor macbook stand alone
no Intel chip whatsoever they're they're
kind of working towards those baby steps
right now it's a complementary chip they
do expect that this new chip the t310
could make it two macbooks in the new
model that is releasing this year that's
really round so number so so are
everyone who bought their new macbooks
right now just slapping your head of me
like damn why did I wait I told you all
seriously I told you all this year i was
like thinking about to say like 2018
2019 which i just said this year so so
Wow not only gonna get the kb like
process or family or abby lake yeah yeah
they're gonna get the new update um
you're going to get this new t310 chip
that's going to help along with the
machine at your machine's going to be
significantly better than problem by
that time let's be honest the touch bar
will be more mature yes yes yes yes
people are asking like is how much is so
I've been corrected multiple times like
been clinic a be like forever people
like dude it's kb lake it's maybe like
that same I know so will this kb like
processor help performance wise it's
supposed to be a twenty percent increase
in performance as well as battery life
so i'm going to guess quite honestly
although it's not a world-changing thing
look the macbook pro line currently
actually has battery issues even though
apple release that beta update to solve
some of those and just really to get
Consumer Reports be like yeah we do
recommend that I have plenty of friends
who are using the touch book matt touch
bar macbook pros that say they still
don't get the best battery life yeah
yeah so to me a twenty percent increase
let's say it's supposed to get ten hours
let's even say you're really getting a
more like six you're getting basically
another hour or two so that alone and
better performance is more than enough
reason to be like yeah because the
process of family they put in the
current touch bar macbook pros are
really from like a year ago you
a half ago Holly so let's make the jump
it also is going to support 32 gigs of
RAM for all your powerhouse you well
yeah that's pretty so those three things
better processor 32 gig Rams a touch bar
will be much better much more support
will be out by then and was a 310 chip
written yeah come on don't tell me it's
not worth the waiting yeah that'll be an
exciting keynote this year you'll still
you'll still have to use dongles though
oh you can count on dongles ya ready to
dong we're here to stay so that that's
just kind of a wrap up on what's going
on with Apple working on building their
own arm chips again complimentary there
the report did make it clear that there
is no intention for them to drop Intel
anytime soon cool so just sit on that I
i do think what I actually want to see
and this is still coming early it's
coming like in two or three years but
whatever we're time out the future AT&amp;amp;T
is going to roll out initially 5g
networks in two cities now the 5g
standard has been established but quite
honestly by the time it the chipsets
rollout get into people's machines and
phones and blah blah blah it's really
and be and by the time the standards all
figured out it's going to really be
about two more years or so yeah yeah so
everyone's saying I want 5g you're not
going to really have products right now
that are going to even take advantage of
it but maybe we'll finally see a laptop
that connects purely on cellular
connection now by the day because I
think 5g is at 500 megabits per second
top speed wow that's more that's more
than what our internet through a pipe
through a cord delivers to us that would
be amazed so that'll be interesting to
see how that that's a game changer to me
of how we use our devices in it'll
probably most likely help slim down the
machine a little bit there already a few
laptops that do that right there's a
like a I don't want to say a Chromebook
but there's a couple laptops that have
cellular connectivity G yeah I can't
remember yeah they're not max that's for
sure well maybe two or three years they
will be oh yeah let's oh all right I'm
just some other quick updates the Apple
earpods I silently kind of behind the
scenes received a bug fix firmware
update if you have your ear pods
connected to your phone and you look
into your general and your settings
there's a slot in there that says
err pods the current the previous number
was three point three point one it's
been updated a three point five point
one there have been no explicit kind of
improvements I will say though that my
ear pods they're supposed to air update
when you plug them in when they're in
the case but my air pod still have
breakups once in a while really yeah the
I was driving one time and I don't know
if it was competing with a blue coup
signal in a car what not but there were
times where I basically lose 3-2 force
about three seconds of connectivity of
my friend and it kept on happening over
and over and over and it wasn't cuz the
batteries were low but it happened I'm
like okay something's up with these
earpods because I'm you know I'm using
them a lot just to try them out and that
can drive you crazy too yeah it's so do
you drive with them on is that on you
not like a new behavior I'm not gonna
admit that I mean that's I don't think
it's a dangerous thing no it's I just
don't want to admit that I where i er
pods basically haha but I mean that
seems like a behavior change you know
yeah yeah if you're just kind of wearing
them all the time yeah I mean the people
that are wearing them all the time come
on to stop that like seriously bro stop
like it's stupid if your lady you can
cover up with your hair I think that's
pretty awesome actually there's one
there's a dude Dominic though he's an IT
guy here and he wears somebody has like
like cool earrings yeah stuff and it
looks cool you know like kind of dig it
Dominic you cool man I know I mcadams I
got I got I got nothing but love for
Dominic man so this bug bug fix firmware
update is out but they have not Apple
never specified exactly what it does um
in a quick one we're gonna skip over
just a quick headline Facebook
reportedly working on an app for the
Apple TV to bring long-form video
content yeah yeah guess what people do
listen and watch things that are longer
than I made it in 30 seconds yeah
Facebook's going for it they're gonna
know talking form content don't you know
so I'm not well let's not look we like
to keep our jobs here but beechams
laughing you know I know you're talking
about yeah yeah but yeah yeah they're
gonna 90 second videos and there you
have to have a 90-second video on
facebook in order for it to serve an ad
so that's a new rule and then they're
gonna start like getting on set-top
boxes Roku all that stuff so they want
to make more money they also said that i
believe that facebook also said that
they would only have 15 second ads
I'm in there yes and I believe if I'm
correct you're correct in actually
YouTube just made that announcement this
morning to 2018 only 15 second ads no
30-second ads ever again look when you
get millions of views you better vote
sorry you better freaking switz wow you
better switch down to 15 seconds you
guys are making money no matter what
let's just be honest and who would
everyone hates a 30-second everybody
hated a 30-second ad I hate us at
30-second ad and you know we get a lot
of good feedback from viewers who
watched cnet about that exactly oh
thanks nerd nerd alert LG is ultra fine
5k display right this is the only
display that Apple is promoting for you
to get as a secondary screen for your
macbook it you can even plug two of
these LG 5k ultra fine displays to your
computer it's just been revealed and
found out and confirmed by LG themselves
that if you have one of their displays
near a router so let's say you have a
wireless router within two meters that's
basically like six feet the screen will
cause will either flicker out wilcott
can also more likely than not cause your
macbook pro connected to it to also
freeze causing you to restart because it
has issues dealing with being near a
router like LG has confirmed this this
is again the only it doesn't affect
other external monitors but the hardware
can become pretty much unusable like the
monitor the monitor that Apple
recommends the only monitor that Apple
recommends cuz remember Apple got out of
the business yeah um has these issues
again people that don't have a near
their router fine you won't have these
issues but i would say a lot of people
in apartments typically most of the
computer stuff is all near the router i
know mine is most people's things right
because you want to hardline it in you
have it right next to it I mean you know
my router sitting on my my TV stand you
know right next to my television and
sometimes I put a computer right there
or you know that's kind of weird yeah
yeah so it's been inconsistent but yes
it
glitches out it can cause you to real
you might have to restart reboot your
computer to get it back and sync you
might have to be going through this back
and forth but it is a known issue by LG
LG has admitted it there is no word on
really what you can do other than not
use your screen near your router that's
funny so good luck to y'all um this one
kind of put a smile on my face is kind
of more of a sad trombone although
Justin Long you remember the guy from
the get amount is PC ads very effective
if you vary he's I guess they're trying
to catch that magic in a bottle again
Huawei has now hired him in a TV
commercial it's kind of like a bad
Hollywood remake actually if you think
about it so it's like interviewing I
don't know if you can we don't want to
play the audio because it's kind of
distracting but for people that can see
it i think if you scroll down on that
article beach the link is there um he
basically is sitting down and he's like
interviewing a huawei mate phone energy
you're experiencing tech have i ever
directed anything before no do I have a
director outfit a scarf a hat and a vest
yes okay yeah it's pouring this is the
worst at ever this amarga bleah that
might have ended Justin lungs
illustrious career yeah by the way I
think I can't remember which one it was
I feel like he was in a lethal weapon
movie like he was in the die hard I
hardly last I heard the last I heard
that was actually cool yeah yeah die
don't die with a vengeance or something
die hard with a vengeance that was a
good one that was a fun one I was like
anyways I just long nothing but love for
you cuz long rhymes with Tong and some
people have called me long time hi oh
don't listen kids cover your cover years
alright a couple good apples far
following Mario's mobile success
Nintendo plans now to release two to
three new iphone games each year sweet
remember how many years I've been
telling you this like Nintendo freakin
release games for like five bucks on the
iphone I've been saying this for five to
six years yeah yeah yeah easy might even
be longer than that they have lost so
much money for not listening to me Super
Mario run was a success
I believe the number was somewhere like
only seven or eight percent of people
who download the app actually ended up
paying for it but then it had something
like 74 million doubt it was something
ridiculous along those lines it was 70
plus million the stat was like seven or
eight percent of people bought the
version that's ten dollars per so that
they still did just find they still made
around like 63 million dollars they made
so far and have when it when they
release dear Lord honest like a month
ago maybe in a month at three million
was it right before CES or something
like right before we take a break yeah
yeah so um other games that are coming
out for at least Nintendo this year they
just made an announcement about Fire
Emblem heroes for iOS it's coming and
Android um it's due to release actually
on Thursday which is today at the time
of this recording and then the final
game that is expected to be coming this
year will be animal crossing which will
just if you get into the game it's gonna
just suck your life away I've played it
I'm gonna stay away I played a long time
ago you stay away from it you get these
critters you like meet other people and
like get collect these things note
though I weaned myself off words with
friends and that was whoa whoa it was
very difficult it's hard I'm just gonna
drop a note here for my homies unjust it
injustice to they have this beta out
it's insane injustice injustice this DC
Comics game that ok cool I'm playing
that so much I'm not gonna get into it
but just look it up or just sign up for
the beta your minds gonna be blown nice
what platform is on xbox and ps4 rocks
got it injustice baby's room okay and
then the final story that brings a smile
to my face if it does actually happen if
it does happen according to the New York
Post which can sometimes kind of put out
some sketchy stuff let's be real and are
very sensational headlines which we all
love according to a report from the New
York Post Prince the man the myth the
legend oh my gosh I'm one of the biggest
prints fans reports that Prince's Warner
Music Group albums will come to Apple
music on februari that 12 now right now
princess music is only available on
title but is expected to get a broader
role
on in two weeks his music will come to
Apple music Spotify Pandora Google Play
deezer and others honestly I sound
really stupid right now I have not heard
of deezer do you know what deezer is
that's the first time I ever heard of
these are I know what these DS is these
days but yeah so princess music was
available on streaming services up until
July 2015 the artist pulled his work
from those platforms prior to his death
it doesn't mean that all of his stuff
will be out and available but the fact
that it could see the light of day I
something is skeptical inside of me
knowing how princess camp operates yeah
I mean right now his family is like
really trying to fight each other to get
control of princes album and I think
prince would actually be against this
he's not a fan of being on the internet
I agree which is why he took all the
stuff I think he's thinking he had a
quote like what does the internet what
good is the internet ever done for
anybody hears something like that right
he thinks it's a very negative place oh
this is interesting I mean it's clearly
a move by the label and his family to
get some money some revenue happening so
and if you recall right um there was a
time where if I believe I don't even
think print I could be wrong early early
on in itunes years correct me if i'm
wrong i believe his music was available
or was not but he did release one of his
new albums overseas in the UK as a
physical CD in the newspaper or magazine
oh really yeah and it was during the
time where the itunes store was out and
it was kind of like a statement of like
um yeah I'm still doing physical media
yeah yeah like just to kind of say I'm
not about this probably making less
money you know right going through the
ice for sure it was a statement by
prints and all I'm gonna tell you is
Prince's the best concert I've ever been
to in my entire life so Jay greatest
concert I've ever seen the musicality
was I've never seen anything like it so
jealous and so let's see him those does
one of those artists that I was super
happy to see so anyways we love your
prints hopefully you show up on Apple
music even though i'm not i'm still not
going to subscribe he's got a couple
tracks on amazon prime
I'm and stuff like that yeah I think and
anyways come on let's be real if you're
real Prince fan you bought his music
yeah you already i know you own his
discs i mean lets busy this is for the
Millennials to learn yeah yeah um if you
I'm gonna even refer people to watch
well there's a lot of things you can
watch but watch princes Super Bowl
performance that was on the rain is so
good in the rain look it up we don't
play any prints music here because like
his camp in the past like was it was
like a baby video or something they they
took down or they got in a legal battle
with I don't know there's a baby video
dancing Utah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
and it was playing in the background
background of like the parents house
yeah at their house and he sued because
thou and then i think they ruled against
him because i said they're just kind of
natural sound that was happening the
house wasn't like you know wasn't like a
it wasn't like a drug that one focus
yeah it wasn't a focus of the video yeah
but anyways exciting stuff so all the
youngins seriously if you want to hear
what music music sounds like listen to
