to the 404 show on this Thursday
November I guess it's the 19th who can
keep to 20th you guess is the 19th it's
still the 20th yeah all day did it who
can possibly keep track of things like
this during the Anarchy that that is our
new studio installation but thank you
for tuning into the show today my name
is Jeff Bakalar I as akhtar where are
you and somewhere else in Manhattan I am
located on the upper west side today not
on the eastside westside thanks for
clearing that up and mr. Stephen beach
him all the time bad let's go thanks so
much for doing this again with us man
yeah it's awesome dude happy to do we
got so much great feedback when we were
doing this a couple weeks ago thanks for
filling in again and making this happen
I have some updates on the studio we've
been working three days straight trying
to get this studio into place and it
sounds like fingers crossed we'll be
back in there tomorrow and we'll be able
to do a brand new show out of the new
new studio so that's excellent it's
great there's so much crazy stuff
happening in this office right now I
can't even begin to explain it but
thanks for bearing with us during this
little bit of a down time and yeah we're
going to be keeping the the Twitter's
updated and let you guys know just what
the hell's going on I like your
background actually in your gas there
the backyard you know there this is a
nice this is from one of the new sort of
floating offices in the in the new setup
a little herb in New York City backdrop
I thought would be appropriate so how to
check that out I've been dying for that
backdrop for like what 30 years now you
finally got it congratulations Jeff this
is as good as it gets this is how you
know you've made it when you can look
I'm get another building across the
street from your sad sad conference room
but yeah it's great the news the new
office is actually kind of amazing and
maybe we'll do like a video to show
everyone all the ins and outs but let's
just get into the show let's get into a
few
stories a lot of controversy in the
world of uber this is uh this is kind of
like a serious note that will start
things off on so I as you sounded like
you didn't know a lot of what was going
on so so I want to help explain to you
just what the hell is happening I know
as far as I know there was like this one
reporter that I guess like one of the
New York Regional Managers or something
they were trying to get information
about this reporter and they didn't ask
for permission and there's some kind of
god mode or God view and that's as much
as I know well what was it got a boat
that's really cool um yeah so it's such
a strange story so I guess the best way
to describe it is a couple I want to say
like a month ago uh this this writer
Sarah Lacy came out with a story about
the sort of weird misogynistic culture
that she found to be the case with in
uber and a little later there a meal
Michael who's an executive at uber was
at this very high-profile dinner and he
jokingly but nevertheless he did say
this he talked about you know possibly
investigating journalists who were
criticizing uber and he talked about
like spending upwards of a million
dollars to dig up dirt on these people
sort of like well the door swings both
ways sort of thing like I for an I sort
of thing is the way came off that made
all the news obviously because it was a
very strange thing he claims he thought
he was off the record I'm sorry dude
you're at this like gigantic celebrity
attended dinner that's being covered by
the media what you say is going to come
out nevertheless you fast forward a
little bit and then news comes out that
a BuzzFeed writer was meeting an uber
New York general manager and the guy she
was meeting was like she shows up at the
meeting and the uber guys like hey I was
tracking you I knew when you were going
to get here it's like what and
apparently what come came out
all this is that within goober and they
say at an executive level is this sort
of backdoor all-seeing eye program
called God view number one what the hell
are you calling it God view for like
that is you do not do there's nothing
but nefarious associations that can be
attached to something called God view
right unless we're talking about a video
game which is which were not this is
real freakin life um and you know that
really resonated negatively throughout
the entire you know uh internet you're
there have this ability to find out
where you are where you're going where
you are before the car comes to get you
and I know this is a little you know
sort of contradictory dealing with a
company that's in the entire business
model is based off of GPS location but
at the same time it's just very strange
and a lot of these things are just
hitting at the same time and it's really
kind of banging them up on a PR level
for sure yeah they seem seriously
screwed that's our nautical today about
like rubriz got a real problem there's
not like Facebook there's no Buy in
there's nothing keeping you are I from
saying i'm not using uber anymore I'm
just gonna move to lift and then like I
think Tom calm at this great articles is
like seven real dead serious things that
uber is done including like sabotaging
lift by booking rides when Dad I'm
canceling them and also poaching lyft
drivers are like this is the this extra
thing especially with God view which is
just headline gold I mean you couldn't
ask if you were a writer like God view
that's perfect you guys are getting
nailed to the wall for this one it's
just like it's another religion pun no
it wasn't oh god I said wall ball not
cross oh god no no crosses here cross to
bear that was it religious I was the
theology major so anyway um I wore guy I
was not um so the the other thing is
like you take all of these things into
consideration right you're like oh man
you know Uber's like they're muscling
you know innocent journalists
they're talking a big game it's like
they're in the mob right it's like they
are a bunch of like Sopranos that are
just sort of you know throwing their
weight around a little bit I don't know
I and at the same time I'm conflicted
obviously because uber is a fantastic
sir that's wait hey man it's the way the
best thing this is this is my focus hold
up hold on it you're talking to dude
whose father has been in the new york
city taxi cab industry for upwards of 30
years okay sounds like a girl and issues
first of all it was like jeff has
graphics it has everything to do with
the fact that like my pet my father's
livelihood is based off somewhat excuse
me off the success of the cab industry
which is being annihilated by uber well
there's less competition yet I still use
it all the time cuz it's way better than
taking a new york city cab well have
either you guys ever used lift have you
tried that one yet once I've he slipped
how was it I mean was it this it's
basically the same thing as uber right
it the app seen the little clunkier uh
the driver did not know where we were
which was way fun I always love it when
the driver calls you like where are you
it's like that's the whole freakin point
if I had to tell you where I was I would
have just called you but yeah that but
I've had to happen with goober as well
but then one left experience I had the
driver was very confused and asked me
how to get there like I don't freakin
drive I don't know just just go we'll
stop asking me that's like a lazy lyft
driver lazy well like lyft definitely
has that hippie mentality to it right
like I associate hippies with like I'm
sorry the whole pink mustache yeah i'm
not doing in the pink mustaches it
what's that should mean my nose
confidence it's optional well look you
look at it like this right you get into
a car with a pink mustache and no matter
what you're like all right I'm not
getting murdered in here yeah like I
think no matter what happens as long as
this cars got a pink mustache on the
front of it I'm gonna be relatively safe
that's right you can identify that car
like did you
the car where you got hit in the head
with a hammer actually I was uber that
happened right and over but like it look
oh by the way I had a pink mustache on
it yeah kinda whittles it down right
away like exactly check it out left over
there they all got that blacked out
toyota camry right they all drive the
same exact car so it sort of falls into
the ether but it's a really strange
story uh but I don't know it's like like
I said like I love uber so much i love
the service and obviously like the
problems they're facing our way up the
food chain you know like the dude who
drives you around it's not him or her
you know you don't really have to like
concentrate on them being part of the
problem but uber definitively at a
corporate level at an executive level
needs a culture shift they need to
change the way they at least say they
operate like lie to me uber tell me
you're not you know trying to spend a
million dollars to dig up dirt on a
journalist cuz cuz he or she wrote
negatively about you that's I don't know
you got anything to add to that I think
leadership comes from up top and I've
I've how do I artfully says I've been in
places where if the leadership is shoddy
it just it can affect everywhere so if
they don't get their act together I
think ubers just they're not going to
survive I mean flat out there's enough
competition and to come up with other
ones other competent car services very
simple at this point in uber has so much
to freaking lose if they don't start
firing people from the top I mean don't
you think yellow cab is like working on
a nap right now you know I mean there's
gonna be competition in that whole space
pretty soon I'm sure you're talking
about New York City I'm talking about
like yellow cab taxi cabs like if they
just build an app that would you know
that would cut into a lot of over Uber's
business i'm sure you are one hundred
percent correct mr. Beecham the problem
it's true Beecham knows what's up the
problem though and like I mean dude it
took 10 years for credit cards to be
accepted in cabs okay right and they're
still bitch at you if you try to use a
credit card that's my biggest complaint
about taxis that mentality is changing
just because they're not getting
they're not getting pounded on the on
the rates as much as they used to um but
the problem is that because it's tied
into the city of New York you know taxi
business the very old school you know
it's like this if I hate to keep using
like this mafia oh you know analogy and
not saying these guys are really white
this is the most appropriate usage
analogy it's probably correct true
they're like there is the sort of myth
it's this glacial pace of progress the
second they do that someone's gonna lose
their job like the guy who runs dispatch
or whatever it is like there's unions
there's all this really ugly red tape
that has to be traversed in order for
this to be injected into the workflow of
New York City cabs I think there's
something like 13,000 cabs in New York
City to have them like you know
undertaking this digitalization of the
way we get cabs in New York would be a
massive project you are hundreds and
right no Beecham it absolutely should be
the case like they should have this and
uber would would feel it uber would I
basically have to make a flat rate in
New York to compete right because you're
there luxuriating rates right now too
right right based on based on priority
of how busy it is during the day or
something exactly opportunity not cool I
don't well um I don't know I think
that's actually I learned it like a
rainstorm they raised the prices or
something you know it's surge pricing
pricing yeah they surge pricing is whack
right i do understand like you know all
of a sudden it's raining and umbrellas
cost ten times what they cost when it's
not raining that sort of thing but i
think in terms of what the way they go
at it it's like the supply and demand
sort of thing and i get it like they
can't just magically make more uber cars
available on the road I'm kind of torn
on the whole surge pricing thing but I
definitely understand but I think the
pure right though New York City has to
figure out a way to get yellow cabs on
it and once that happens you were going
to be in good shape
I think there's actually a bunch of apps
are ready for that I looked it up just
now when we were talking yeah but
there's nothing is not exactly the same
yeah you're right the other thing about
like if you can get if you can hail a
yellow cab like I want the cars that are
nice inside an uber cars but I think
like of ninety percent of them I've been
in there really nicely taken care of
ninety percent the yellow cabs I've been
in have some kind of weird aroma then we
cleaned up by a newspaper they don't
want to smell not even it has been
placed on top of whatever smells that's
what exactly and this is the problem
yeah it's a lot of people died in New
York City cares if you like or no I'm
kidding they just go to the bathroom and
then it sucks I don't know what to tell
you that's a big part of it too it's the
whole experience my experience I think
uber drivers seem to be way nicer than
New York City capture I was in an uber
car and they had small waters he had
small bottles of water I was like oh god
this is fantastic yeah it's like going
to the bathroom at like a high-end hotel
get the Beecham's are you like I have
this precious resource what you'd like
some water just a small bottle of water
that's all you need it goes my way and
even that Spotify stuff they're starting
to do you heard about that right I don't
know a lot about that but that would if
I was a driver I would be annoyed by
that because now I have someone else you
know controlling what I'm gonna hear is
that how it works yeah basically like if
you can hail an uber ride that uh is
that plays nice with like Bluetooth
audio and you could sync up your Spotify
playlist and and i'll be playing when
you when it pulls up to you to you so
that your music sorry playing so you
could be like you can have some kind of
music is basically all about killing car
drivers that would be the playlist to
have i'm gonna get in there with like
death metal happened yeah drivers oh
like half an hour like napalm death
korps i'll be song i been sick and we're
gonna have a four hour drive all right
that's enough with the uber stuff i just
felt like we that's it's a pretty major
deal what's going on with them i'm glad
we glad we chatted about that alright
what else you have for us is
you know so last time we've been talking
about the Steve Jobs movie we talked
about Christian Bale being in the movie
then dropping out and they were Seth
Rogen being in the movie and then maybe
not in the movie there's news today out
of the hollywood reporter saying the
Steve Jobs movie is not happening at
sony Sony was the company that was
putting this together you know Sony they
bring in movies like spider-man and
other spider-man movies but they were
they were going to have the Steve Jobs
movie is supposed to happen everybody
seems to be backing out but the studio
is still shopping around the the rights
to it Universal in a universal the
makers of wolfman coming up pretty soon
there's a fighter cross over man it's
just the big universal should add steve
jobs to its monsters like you got wolf
man dracula a third guy who i'm
forgetting and then steve jobs that's so
offensive to the jobs estate i really
know that's that's so crazy that they
would drop that they're looking to get
rid of the rights i don't understand
lung it that's the third one sorry oh I
could sleep tonight uh I don't write
like why are you shopping around the
rights I feel like even though the
Ashton Kutcher one bombed I still think
there's a lot of value in that property
why you shopping it around well Aaron
Sorkin still attached and then there was
you got he's written the script that's
the things being shopped around I mean
is it's I guess Sony maybe they didn't
want the amount of headache going into
this because I wouldn't take the whole
competition thing between Apple and Sony
I don't think that's even playing into
it over the years but to have this kind
of thing the amount of scrutiny is going
on there and about the amount of money
that have to throw at the high budget
actors I don't know if they can afford
this considering how Sony's very very
kind of on the edge when it comes to
money don't you think yeah yeah you know
it's it's interesting I think maybe you
know I wonder if Sorkin's deal has
anything to do with it like i Doan and
this isn't like you know a fact but you
always hear things like oh he's
difficult right I wonder if like they
we're at UH they butted heads on
something I don't know this also the
latest rumor two who's gonna play Steve
Jobs is Michael Fassbender magneto from
x-men is gonna be darker I'm okay with
that no how's this American accent
anybody heard Michael Fassbender's
American accent let me look him up can't
be worse freaking Charlie hunnam's oh my
god okay you already been watching
Sunday nur key again haven't you yeah
it's good it's it's two nights ago is
actually like one of the best episodes i
think the series has ever had but man
that dude he should have just been
British like they should have had him be
British kind of like my knowledge
there's Fassbender yeah dude he's I
think he'd be a perfect jobs he's
intense and I think he could pull it off
too but I don't know if it's gonna if
it's gonna work out and if if universal
is gonna go with it it just seems nuts
but back two sons anarchy you remember
how like you could have a British guy in
there right you coulda just said they
grew up in England and they just came
back that would've been the end of it
well there's a lot of Irish dudes right
mm-hmm so it's like why not why not do
you watch that show Beecham no not I
haven't watched that one yet it's it's
weird but yeah his the main character is
the guy who's in a Pacific Rim you know
that dude I haven't seen that movie
either but you know using undeclared
undeclared that's the first time I saw
Michael Fassbender was in that picture
right there oh really you don't so i
don't really dumb but that makes it good
because i like seeing a movie like of a
Steve Jobs movie and someone I don't
really know Bryce a more believable for
me no I I totally agree if it was
Christian Bale I just would have been
like I wonder how I could see Christian
Bale on that though he's a great actor
yeah I could he is a great actor but the
whole time I'd be like oh I wonder how
they got that weird mole off his face
for Steve Jobs like that's the whole
time I would have been like all was his
prosthetics EG what did they do what did
they do and he doesn't act like to write
he does yeah yes yeah sony backed off of
that because it bales mole it was 22
unworkable clearly that was it it's a
controversial mole book I mean come on
it's got a mind of its own
alright this is a crazy story about
walmart getting jacked on a few clever
shoppers who found a loophole with
PlayStation 4 yeah so there's a bunch of
stuff that's been going on online where
people have been proud of going to
walmart and getting the PlayStation 4
for like ninety dollars playstation 4
does not cost 90 bucks anywhere unless i
guess you like you bought the parts and
made it yourself and your sony right
just having a sony centric episode but
was going on was these people were
taking and creating fake price listings
on amazon.com showing that the
playstation is being offered for 90
something dollars then they would print
out the listing before amazon took it
down and go to walmart where they said
they would price match anything online
so they would bring it in they'd show to
people like oats taken down but that
didn't seem to be an issue so a bunch of
people proudly were showing off their
90th PlayStation fours what this has led
walmart to do is they're not allowing
price matching like this anymore cuz
they're like we got screwed okay they
all nodded liars they modified their
price matching pair photoshopping with a
photo shopping amazon prices is that
what they were doing there was a couple
of different ways yeah one of the ways
one of the ways is just setting up your
own fake listing and having like a
company that looked like Amazon I think
some people actually wrote like Amazon
without one of the A's so just like Jean
so like people looked real and it's not
real or like they would try to present
it as real at the time so yeah they've
modified this thing may be restricted it
to 30 competing retailers they have to
be real can't make them up and you can
have like you can still do price
matching but this is why we can't have
nice things to people no I hate super
actually kind of I mean it's slimy for
sure but I it's they didn't break the
law right i mean amazon has it i wantam
is it because amazon has a marketplace
right is that and that's what these came
from they came from them's on
marketplace so you just fake listings
right there fake listings within the
amazon marketplace so yes they are
fraudulent in many facets are they is it
illegal it's a gray area
it's I think it's really called fraud
dude that's fraud like your demonic
somebody good lawyer you're gonna get
until I don't have I don't have my my
degree in fraud or defrauding and I
didn't really take a look at that kind
of stuff but I'm pretty sure that's it's
hilarious we're talking about DUI is the
other day and you're like it's not a
crime is it like it's a crime he's a
criminal he's in the criminal yep okay
all right so so so back up for a step
because this is essentially what could
have been the case too okay I I'm a bad
dude right and I stole a box of ps4 is I
got for ps4 is that came in a box fell
off a truck in Chinatown right I put
them up on amazon for a hundred dollars
a pop I have the product I'm a I'm a
seller on amazon now i am it now you
guys are across the country and you know
that walmart has a price match you don't
know that the ones i'm selling on amazon
are hot you go and you and you and your
bio you price match ups for to walmart
and you get it for a hundred dollars the
the customer there the one that tries to
price match they're not in the in the
wrong this sounds like a law-school
final questions like yeah you're right
because what happens is the person show
your work i think a long essay answers
like with that person who didn't have
any like any actual evil thoughts I'm
just not using the proper language was
at all they're not intentionally trying
to defraud somebody right first guy Jeff
the man who defrauded walmart that guy
yeah he's in a world of trouble but the
guy who would like just printed out cuz
he thought it was real it's kind of like
if you bought stolen goods it doesn't
necessarily mean that you're evil if you
have an idea that it's like oh well this
PlayStation fell off a truck here you go
for five bucks you might have an idea
something's up right okay you are
correct and I'm glad we deconstructed
that now that I said it out loud it
makes sense um I want to talk about this
real quick a little complementary story
about Amazon Marketplace selling but
going through a little bit of personal
controversy with amazon and i have not
been public about it until this very
moment because i thought i could solve
it and we couldn't solve it so I have
an amazon marketplace seller account
that i would sell you know anything
around the house that like I just didn't
want any more gifts that I would get
just you know I'd use it maybe like five
times a year um my brother got a gift
from one of his he tutors people and
what he got a gift right and I tried to
sell his this product that he had it was
a mouse from Logitech didn't have the
receipt whatever it was tried to sell it
on amazon for him and two days later i
got a message from amazon my seller
account is suspended forever no
questions asked turns out there's a lot
of fraudulent activity in selling
specifically logitech products now I did
not do anything wrong I followed the
instructions that I've always done when
I'm selling something on amazon and they
basically said hey the product you're
trying to sell is fraudulent no
questions asked you're done forever
what's going on with that that's messed
up that's all that sounds that sounds
terrible so like logitech i guess i mean
what do you think it is just there
peripherals people are selling keyboards
and logitech remotes like and why items
are so i dug a little deeper it turns
out they've had a history of fraudulent
products being sold that's fine that
doesn't make me the bad guy I have no I
have a hundred percent feedback I've
never had one issue not even a return
never been a problem turns out they only
and this is an unwritten law they have
this thing that if you are selling
logitech products you have to be an
authorized reseller and if you're not
they instantly flag that transaction as
potentially fraudulent and suspended my
account forever forever I can never sell
anything again on Amazon couldn't you
just get a
new accounts under new name and
everything but then I then I'm sounds
like you know after our previous
conversation on the bad guy if I do that
well you lost you'll lose all your
feedback right you'd lose everything
positive about that old account yeah but
like do so much work to avoid having
logitech stuff I mean now I learned my
lesson the hard way I just can't sell
logitech stuff even though on the
product page on amazon it says in the in
this nice shiny button on the right side
sell yours here so did you ever talk did
you get to talk to someone at at amazon
like an actual person so I did oh my god
i did five half hour to hour long calls
and none of them were ever ever resolved
it was owing than just see you as the
enemy or something yeah they're just
like you're a scumbag didn't say this
but they're like like you're just a
scumbag trying to get away pulling a
fast one on us and it was and I was
always super super civil very polite
never once raised my voice but the fifth
call I was like listen what you're doing
is really screwed up but yeah there's
like no way around it and I guess I
could create another account may be
under like you know Stacy's name whoever
it is but I don't know it's so insane
what happened I and i try i even i tried
to get i had a friend who used to work
there and he said it's a dead end I
don't know that's crazy so I didn't even
know amazon is kind of like a craigslist
kind of thing huh i never use that
before really i mean at you you will
you've never liked bought something
through like the new and used link on an
amazon product page i don't i don't
think i have but i don't i didn't know
that you could sell anything like I
thought like you could sell music or so
you know products like that but I didn't
know you could just sell like you know
like something like you would on
craigslist yeah if any if amazon has a
product page for the product you want to
sell odds are you can sell it and and
you can have like an individual seller
account which is what i did a very
infrequent transactions i like i said
maybe five a year um you know it's it's
insanity
but anyone can sell anything as long as
you're not Jeff Bakalar remember that
that is a good luck well you know what I
learned you know what I learned real
quick they're still ebay ladies and
gentlemen it works really well so yeah I
didn't take that down yeah it's still
wrapped even after the prom boom pretty
much sell anything on ebay besides human
organs yes and even that was exactly
yeah and that's and that's still a gray
area all right we might have room for
one more story here what do we got let's
talk about this crazy artist this guy he
plans to wear an oculus rift virtual
reality headset for 28 days straight the
idea he's just wants to do an experiment
it's really odd thing he's to it his
name is Mark for Reed he's gonna have
some handlers helping him to get to this
man in bathroom he says gonna wear
constant he's gonna shower with it he's
gonna go to the toilet with the thing on
he's gonna eat with the thing on um
that's gonna be that was Mellie VR
headset that was enough for me bro what
the why why would you do this I don't
understand the point of this like how
bad is your life have to be they like
look for the month I'm not gonna be here
just pop this on I mean is it I uh I
kind of get what he's trying to say like
I get the art that he's trying to make
and he's trying to say like this is the
dystopian future we're all headed
towards right enough to feed you look at
this yeah look him he's like a goddamn
key oh man that's pathetic but like so
what is he looking at though uh it's
gonna be some footage that is not
supposed to be out of the ordinary
there's gonna be a person that Farid is
never met who's on the capture audio and
video and the sounds gonna be played
back on the guys headset so he's call
this this man the other person the other
so whatever that other person sees Farid
is going to see so if some if the guys
going to it like the examples if you're
going to bike ride a funeral a bad movie
or even a bathroom
farid gonna see it so he's actually
entering like the John Malkovich portal
right except hell control right right so
oh that's super weird man but I you know
as crazy as it sounds and people are
gonna be like how is Jeff defending this
asshole no it's he's trying to like say
that we will eventually be so
uninterested in living our own lives and
want to be sort of like you know uh
transported vicariously into someone
else's life Ike I think that's what he's
saying right here's the hear the request
for the other so the person whose life
is gonna live like days later cause
you're gonna get that he's gonna get
this footage it's gonna be played back
in this and his VR headset later he's
got specification for the other the
other has to be a male he's got to be
heterosexual and in a relationship this
is the straight male parts because
buried is a straight male and he doesn't
want to quote complicate things Oh
Patricia part is sabrina has a narrative
of what's happening man relationship is
more likely say aloud that he's going
out to buy milk then one who lives alone
for example so he's gonna have some idea
of what he's about to watch I'm assuming
but man this is this is intriguing
there's gonna there's a Kickstarter for
this as well for the documentary of
somebody recording what's happening to
this guy is this I'm just helping pay
for this gotta do this documentary fine
but I'm not paying for free that's crazy
for farad like I see the thing is just
like if the guy if the other why can't
tell right now is if the other drinks
milk does he have to do it too or like
why okay screw that like yes you bring
up a very interesting question but like
dude for a month he's essentially going
to give himself brain damage totally
also I think he's gonna damage his eyes
too I mean yes that's gonna hurt your
eyes big time yes he's gonna he's gonna
screw up his and like he might do
irreparable damage to like his
coordination like he might have to learn
how to do things again
a month that's a long time is a long as
time I've this day you're right after
look like just think about when you've
been on a roller coaster when this be
our roller coasters when you come out
you're a little bit wobbly it was like
three minutes oh my dude he's gonna puke
he's gonna puke no i'm not a dude unless
you want to bet he's not gonna make it
28 days who's gonna drop some don't like
to two weeks probably i give them teeth
28 d ambitious man what am I got a
scratch do you go up and under can you
dizzy Lizzy allowed to do that I don't
know the all the rules yeah the least of
his problems if you had a rash all of a
sudden up here you've been sweating and
it's been pressed against your face for
so long and how do you shower with this
thing I mean it's not waterproof I I
don't even care about those details I
