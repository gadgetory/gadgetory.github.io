capable and lovely laundry appliances
and this LG dryer fits right into that
mold the first thing your to notice
about this LG dryer is that it looks
great it has lots of smooth curves and
very nice modern design elements it's
definitely a handsome looking machine
you're also going to notice that this LT
dryer is huge it has a big 9 cubic foot
capacity that's enough to handle big
comforters and large laundry loads you
also get tons of features different ways
to handle different types of clothing
and garments it has steam modes 2d
wrinkled and to freshen up different
types of clothing as well so it's very
handy and very capable machine the
controls are right up front as well and
they're also very easy to use into
manipulate one downside to this dryer it
is expensive it costs eighteen hundred
dollars it's almost two thousand dollars
to spend on one laundry plan included in
that price though is integrated Wi-Fi
and the ability to connect to a mobile
application and that allows you to check
on different functions while you are
away from the machine but it's also a
little clunky and hard to understand so
that's something you're gonna pay for
extra and it doesn't work as well as I'd
like it to we don't have time to get
into everything I think about this dryer
right now for more check out my full
review but overall I think this dryer is
worth the money if you have a lot of
cash to spend
if not you can spend a lot less and get
very similar performance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
