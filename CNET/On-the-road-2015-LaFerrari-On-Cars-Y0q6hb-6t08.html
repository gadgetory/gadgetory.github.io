surprised they paint
with me is Ferraris ultimate street car
ever the laferrari following in the
lineage of the f40 the f50 the Enzo they
only do one of these about every 10 or
12 years they're very special leaders
very limited you don't just show up in
Lodi with a million and a half dollar
cheque and take one home you have to own
some Ferraris important ones at that and
then they made a in to sell you one of
these and when you do bring it home
you've got something more than the
latest ultimate Ferrari you've got the
first one in my estimation to jump fully
with both feet into the 21st century
this car is important the styling of
laferrari was actually done in-house at
Ferrari which is actually notable after
50 60 some odd years of having
Pininfarina and almost all of their cars
but what's happening here is really
interesting there's not that much left
for a stylist to do in the modern
supercar era the shape is determined by
how the car functions in the wind
there are almost more holes and ports
and cutouts than there is positive mass
what you're seeing here is a
carbon-fiber skin drawn tight over the
least amount of guts the car has been
and of course this is Ferraris first
Street hybrid
it's called hikers technology hybrid
kinetic energy recovery system it
actually dates back to 2009 and f1
didn't take that many years for it to
hit the street when you've got something
this pretty you don't hide it and they
don't here's the heart of the beast
starting with a 6.3 liter naturally
aspirated v12 underneath this enormous
carbon-fiber plenum is some banned in f1
technology variable-length intake
runners it allows you to have the engine
run perfectly at any rpm range by
varying the run from intake to the
cylinder which doesn't want to always be
the same and in this car it isn't then
you get to the more modern stuff this is
the HP you the hybrid power unit which
brings in power from the batteries and
sends it on down to the electric motor
right down there bolted on the tail end
of the transmission up here you see some
of the orange cabling that's a dead
giveaway this car is electrified it
leads up to batteries that live behind
the two front seats down and low and
they each live in their own little
hermetically sealed refrigerators this
electric apparatus weighs over 300
pounds so it better earn its keep and it
does contributing a hundred and sixty
three horsepower to the massive combined
950 and the best hundred and forty-seven
of the total 664 pound-feet of torque as
a result of the electric componentry
back here the traditional engine up here
does need to worry quite so much about
being a torque motor it can do more with
breathing at high rpm hence redline is
92 50 and the low-end stuff is brought
in by the electrics where does it all go
interestingly and against current
fashion it goes to two wheels only in
the back while other supercars are going
all-wheel drive this one plants it in
just two places through a 7-speed
dual-clutch transmission
Ferrari is outstanding f1 gearboxes now
in addition to using carbon fiber on the
outside you've got a clear message of
carbon fiber on the inside cuz this is a
carbon fiber cabin tub it only weighs
150 pounds the actual shell I'm sitting
in part of how they kept the weight down
is keeping it small as you can probably
also see by having these seats actually
be immovable there's a stationary
vengence they were able to make the
cabin smaller because you didn't have to
leave room for the seat track to move
back and forth instead you adjust the
wheel and the pedals back here is an LCD
instrument panel not their first but in
this case it's changeable it has
different modes that is a first for
Ferrari you've got a more traditional
tack centric look and then you've got
one that more speaks to the fact this is
an electrified car with a centre roundel
that has different indications of
whether you're regenerating or expending
electric power here's a real
crowd-pleaser this sort of carbon-fiber
bat weighing down here as your drive
controls reverse automatic and launch
control the last little trick is over
here behind this door
here's a USB slot that is different from
the one for media and communications
this one holds a memory drive is going
to pick up recording of video from the
forward-looking camera behind the mirror
and this one over here in this trick
little carbon fiber pod that's watching
the driver it puts those two together
and records them as you make your laps
let's say I'm on the track in the wet
and a 900-plus horseman
don't tell my life insurance agent one
of the first things you notice in this
car is the fact that it doesn't present
a huge amount of hybrid Ness there
aren't a whole bunch of electric modes
there isn't that electric boost button
like you have on a p1 this is a car that
really buries the hybrid part but buries
it under the accelerator it is in fact
what you would call technically a mild
parallel hybrid but of course there is
nothing mild about the results now to
mortals like us all supercars feel the
same in one respect they are all much
more than you can exploit but what do I
find distinctive about this car it's
really a joy to drive at your limits
invoking more grins and less sweat and
weather on the track or on the street
asking you sacrifice very little in
terms of livability Oh while making you
feel like a superhero okay now when
you're driving a car and by the way it's
someone else's car that goes for about
$8,000 an inch slice you're glad for
certain technologies to keep it under
control
first of all Ferraris remarkable
stability control this lovely DCT
transmission is it's perfect there's
absolutely nothing about it in tractors
street that I don't like big ol carbon
ceramic brakes are of course like
driving a nail through this thing when
you need it to but you also get some
nice breaking through regen going back
into the motor
that's classic hybrid stuff but also
when the engines got too much torque
cooking like like I'm in this turn it'll
convert some of that into power back in
and as you can see all around this car
you've got active flex and slots behind
me the most fascinating giant emerging
wing and auto-tune
pricing a laferrari doesn't matter it's
about a million and a half or so and you
can do endless personalization to take
it where you want the real story in
conclusion here is that if you're lucky
enough to own or just drive one of these
you've tapped into a lot of technologies
and design ethic that are the future of
Ferrari but also a supercar that is a
joy to drive not just a hellacious
hammer on the track few supercars can
pull off that balancing act
