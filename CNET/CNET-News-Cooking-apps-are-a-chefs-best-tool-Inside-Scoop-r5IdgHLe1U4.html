I'm CNET's car Tsuboi joined by Jay mark
Habibi associate editor and well viewers
it's that time of year we're all cooking
big family meals for the holidays and
j-mart has got a few apps Android apps
right that might be able to help with
the process Jay Mohr what's your first
go-to holiday cooking app well the first
one I really like is called in the
kitchen it's made by the Food Network
and you know I'm a pretty big fan of the
Food Network I like some of their
celebrity chefs and one of the great
things about the app is that you can
actually search by celebrity chef so you
can just go through some of their
profiles click on the one that you like
and look at some of their favorite
recipes like if you just love Bobby Flay
and want to grill that bird and all the
sides some Southwest action in there
yeah yeah I like that is that a free app
totally actually no science dollar
ninety-nine okay they're pretty well
worth it it sounds like to get the
recipes of celebrities yeah yeah and and
they're all in there all your favorites
some of some of the chef's they only
have a few recipes in there there's like
Morimoto I think he only has like five
recipes in there but some of the other
ones have literally thousands of their
recipes in there very cool what's the
next app that you like it's called big
oven and that has over 250,000 recipes
in it and that's really the reason that
I like that when it's the biggest
kitchen database I've ever seen some of
the other things it offers is a kitchen
timer useful which is really important
yeah and then there's a unit conversion
tool to go from grams ounces
we're like pints to quarts and things
like that yeah because if you're
following recipes that are safe from you
know England you're they're gonna weigh
different measurements Horace yeah nice
and third and final app it's called cook
Li it's also free big ovens free to but
cook --let's free and one of the things
I really like about cook Li is the
interface design it's it's gorgeous
there's there's a screen called
inspiration and it's a little bit like
an Instagram type screen so it's picture
based you can just go through all of the
photos of recipes and then click on the
ones you like from there so this is a
pretty new app isn't it it is it's
really young actually and and there's a
lot of bugs in it because it's so young
but I think to make up for that is is
the interface design which is just it's
gorgeous unarguably
very cool thank you so much for the tips
