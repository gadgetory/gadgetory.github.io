dolby atmos compatible receiver at $599
it offers excellent sound quality and a
number of useful features it has one of
the most stable and friendly multi room
music systems and the unit also offers
bluetooth in and outs to headphones the
receiver includes seven channels plus 2
seconds own speakers at acclaimed 90
watts each and this is useful for
listening to Dolby Atmos and DTS X
soundtracks the receiver also includes 6
HDMI ports which offers support for 4k
movies and high dynamic range in terms
of sound quality the Yamaha is pretty
warm even when compared to a Maran
slimline receiver at the same price
this makes the Yamaha a good match with
brighter speakers like clips for example
if you have at most hight speakers
you'll get a fully immersive sound stage
when listening to the RX v68 one dialog
has excellent detail and bass effects
have punch music is also just as good as
you'd expect from Yamaha and we love
using the music cast streaming app of
all the proprietary systems is up there
with Sonos as one of the easiest to use
the only disappointing things about this
receiver are a slightly confusing user
interface and a remote which has way too
many buttons but this aside this is an
excellent AV receiver which deserves to
be on your shortlist especially if
you're upgrading to Dolby Atmos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
