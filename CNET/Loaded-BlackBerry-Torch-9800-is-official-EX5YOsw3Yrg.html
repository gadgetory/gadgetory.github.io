Jeff Bakalar and it's time to get loaded
as expected Research In Motion launched
a new blackberry phone yesterday the
blackberry torch the new phone has a
slideout keyboard 5 megapixel camera and
a touchscreen the phone comes pre-loaded
with OS 6 and will be available from 18t
with a two-year contract for 199 dollars
expected to hit other carriers in the
near future speaking of blackberry OS
six the new software contains many
improvements including a new touch
capable interface also in the software
is a brand-new browser based on the
WebKit rendering engine in fact the new
phone is named after torch mobile the
company that RIM acquired to use for
their mobile browser also in OS 6 is a
wireless media sync a new music player
and much more the new OS will also
arrive on older blackberry phones
including the bold 9650 9700 and the
pearl 3g to places that won't be getting
the new blackberry or Saudi Arabia and
the United Arab Emirates the countries
have ordered that cell phone service
providers there stop supporting
blackberry phones because the
government's cannot monitor encrypted
blackberry data the UAE has said that
BlackBerry's are a national security
risk because terrorists may be able to
use them to plan attacks rim says that
the email and data on its blackberry
enterprise servers are encrypted and
even rim can access that information
google has finally rolled out multiple
logins this means that you can now log
into Google services with more than one
user name now this is useful if you have
more than one gmail address the new
feature has to be enabled in your google
account settings and will only work with
gmail calendar google sites reader voice
app engine and google code they all too
easy to use website jailbreakme com for
the iphone is raising some security
eyebrows researchers have uncovered that
the jailbreak actually exploits a PDF
viewer related bug to run root level
code on the iPhone analysts are saying
that this exploit is particularly
vulnerable because it relies on the
Safari web browser to execute
and websites could potentially use it to
run nefarious code facebook has finally
updated their app for Android phones
while it's still not on par with the
iphone version the new update is a
dramatic improvement the app now
supports notifications events liking
posts h.264 videos but no facebook chat
yet those your headlines for today I'm
