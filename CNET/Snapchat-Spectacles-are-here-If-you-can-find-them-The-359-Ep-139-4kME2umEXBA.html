about Trump yeah god this will be a draw
the 11 election fish will be an election
free chat had enough there we go we are
gonna be talking about snapchat
spectacles how you you can get your
hands on the wearables actually rather
difficult we'll also be talking about
Yahoo the latest laser fire police that
is the dumpster fire that is Yahoo and
lastly we'll talk about fortunately
offered is not here to talk about this
story but will be talk about his piece
looking at the kind of the new
techniques that cops are using to slow
down or stop cars and high speed chases
yeah you should check it out check out
the video will show you the video it's
pretty awesome we just showed Brian he
was pretty impressed yeah cool to watch
it is something right out of a Batmobile
or James Bond car I feel more Bondy out
of it that's just yeah yeah we'll show
you I would be surprised if Batman had
it in the back like it in a movie he
like fire that out all right yeah sure
I'll go scour my hundreds of issues of
Batman comics and I'll find something
there you go as always if you have any
questions leave them in the comment
section Brian will pick out the most
relevant ones and we will try our best
answer them no promises no it's about
Babu Beale Speed Racer James Bond you
know some of that stuff yeah alright
Moneypenny let's get this let's get
started and starting the recording in
three two
welcome to the 359 where we talk about
the top tech news of the day and only
the crap we want to throw in I'm Roger
Chang I'm Ben Fox ribbon snapchat
spectacles are here can you feel the
excitement yes okay snapchats wearable
goes on sale today but it's gonna be
tough to find them I can't go to a store
like Best Buy to get one you actually
have to hunt one down hotel nice nap
on Friday we're vending machine kinda
looks like a boxy version of the minion
yeah and so there's apparently only one
of these out there floating around the
country and it's one location one day it
keeps moving right now at the time I
checked the map it's it's somewhere in
Los Angeles in between Venice Beach and
Santa Monica so if you're in the area
and you want a spectacle that's where
you want to get one but this is this is
kind of weird right like what do you
make of this this odd way of selling or
is it just the fact that they don't have
enough of these things or oh I don't I
don't think that's it I think it is a
weird way to try to sell to generate
interest in a device but it makes a lot
of sense from snapchats perspective
snapchat has typically I mean like have
you ever even seen a TV commercial about
snapchat they've done I would make it
uncool right well they're they're really
been pushing that that effort of trying
to be a little bit more guerrilla a
little bit more renegade for sure us old
people wouldn't get it that's true
that's in our heads like what the best
vibe was both over the age of 30 why
can't we understand I go to a beach
right now and get my snapchat optical
that being said if they do want it to
take off and they want it to be like a
revenue source of any sort he will get
to Best Buy at some point or maybe
they're gonna sell it maybe they'll sell
it directly I think they could probably
get away with that but the way the way
they're doing this is such a limited way
do you think that they have serious
plans of making spectacles into
something that's a real business or is
this just sort of like this weird
one-off thing that like look at this
weird experiment that we've got I think
that's a very good question I don't know
the answer to that I would like to see
them eventually make it more of a
mainstream product as opposed to this
thing that you can only get in a snap
bite in one location I don't know I
looked at it I wasn't too thrilled with
the looks Alfred liked it though he was
yeah under the age of 30 yes basically
was able to legally drink yeah yesterday
that's not true he's not that young
close alright so next up I'm talking
about Yahoo it disclosed last night that
some of those employees were aware of
that massive hack
in 2014 so it's just that didn't
actually come out until this year didn't
come out right so like just like a
mother to ago and so mm-hmm yeah just
the latest development like as you
called it the dumpster fire that is this
Yahoo hack saga yeah and is that does
the does that reach a level where that
needs to be investigated further that
people were sitting on this information
for the past two years what does that
mean for investors and I continue to
mention this anytime we talk about Yahoo
is this is like what does this mean to
Verizon purchasing it yeah I would
probably think that like you you still
think Verizon is gonna buy this company
I mean I talked to the CEO just a few
weeks ago and he was this was still a
deal that made a lot of sense you know
they were very cautious about sort of
looking at this investigation we're
keeping an open mind but he seemed
fairly confident that this was still
gonna go through my guess it'll still go
through but you know a much smaller
they'll probably pay a lot less right
and I've said this before on the podcast
but I don't see how they keep the Yahoo
CEO like yeah
all right lastly you need to check out
alfred ings story on mobile spike which
cops are not using to stop cars during
high-speed chases it's cop car actually
pulls alongside the suspects vehicle and
a spike fires out from the side of the
car in front of the tires rendering them
flat and immobile so insane right you
know what I really like about this it's
been a very nasty election it's been a
difficult time we're not talking about
that we can all get behind mobile space
we can it's like awesome right you know
it's shields regimes go on Batmobile
Speed Racer I mean I love you America
there you go alright for more about
these stories check us out on CNN I'm
Roger Chang I'm Ben Fox Ruben thanks for
listening so cool right I want one and I
well no suspects to chase pretty sure
those are just for cops no they should
sell chicken mates you should be able to
buy that in fact the snap buy that buy
like you press one but another mobile
psychic that's so gnarly though like
it's always fun to see new technology
but when it actually becomes
legitimately bad
yeah oh yeah this is utterly badass this
is it's like I don't know cop tech is
some some cop tech is the most badass
some of its kind of lame like the fact
that our NYPD are our boys in blue use
windows but this is awesome and there
should be more of this I can't imagine
any like in your cop car I'd like to see
this like like the bike patrol using
similar things to stop other like like a
city bike or something like there was
that video clip of a battle be like a
little like plank that's FAR's right
right like it does have to be spikes but
it could be like it could be something
be something or whatever yeah just like
hook people with it what's gonna be next
in cop tech are we gonna get like the
ejector seat and all that hope we've
seen oil slash mostly have the ability
like fire off like large fishing nets
that suspects like he was running away
just push a button that covers the
suspect you can I like I like shooting
it through like a net gun though I think
that would be very superhero I like a
t-shirt gun like poster like what
Pokemon well you're not using that's for
Pokemon you're using pokeball that's
different yeah I would like to see cops
use pokeballs together criminals be
great whyever we figured that out yet
this just reminds me you said this came
out a little while ago but I only became
aware of it recently this um it's called
the the grappler yeah this I thought was
kind of cool right like look at this
thing so they really excited effective
yeah that seems totally totally
excessive I don't know I also made the
point like if you see this guy get Steve
the cop coming with his giant
contraption the fries car you know the
likes are weaving around right you never
see mobile spike spike is mostly so it
is hidden until the last minute kind of
what makes it awesome yeah come on it's
like the ninja version of cop cars
stopping tech I think there's a thing
cool I do I mean yeah they're both cool
I just I feel like the other one is one
is less practical than the other okay
fine maybe a little more practical but
still cool so cool yes
and if if they help actually stop
high-speed chases and do what they're
supposed to do because Alfred told you
right is that you're supposed to usually
police cars they just hit you on the
yeah normal technique if they want to
stop a car they have to stop a
high-speed car they get on alongside and
then they kind of bump the the rear and
like cause the fishtail yeah and but
that I mean that could lead accidents
it's unpredictable with this thing you
fire off the spikes and the car keeps
going straight but it eventually just
slows down with it right so it's not
only bad ass but life-saving yeah and
what's more badass than that yeah right
now like there's there's no real
practical way to lay strips down like
you had like cops will have to manually
con do it you have to know ya know where
the router actually lay them down and
cops have died actually laying down the
stress strips because I don't get it
done in time right so yeah so this this
actually saves both pedestrian and and
police flies badass and helpful what if
they could put like a a cannon fire
strip mechanism sure like a trebuchet on
the top of the car and it's the the
strips are like counterweighted so that
comes down it always comes down flat
yeah I love all these yeah this is great
yeah I hope the cops are listening we're
gonna change the world
do we have any comments are we just
gonna keep saying the word badass yeah
bad Freak wants to know where are the
spectacles and you said there's a map
available yes yeah so on dos the site
you check out the the link is on our
CNET story I'll put the link in the show
description yeah perfect right now it is
it's like somewhere along the beach a
little bit north of Venice Beach
actually in Los Angeles so and again
it's there for just today and it moves
to another location and bt-dubs it's one
hundred and thirty dollars so it is not
an impulse buy no although I mean if
you're look if you're going to the
Africa track town the snack
you're gonna be plunking down 130 no I
just want people to know how much it
costs people paying more for regular
sunglasses true
interesting true like designer ones
Alfre probably did I merely I actually I
did mine are pricier than that fair
enough
all right we got to wrap it up early
today we got a busy day ahead of us
