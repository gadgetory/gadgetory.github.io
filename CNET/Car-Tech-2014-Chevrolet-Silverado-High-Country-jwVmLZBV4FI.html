Detroit three these are big volume
sellers and big profit margins sellers
see don't dare screw them up let's take
a look at the all-new slow vibrato this
2014 four-wheel drive icon check the
tech
we don't get many of these and there are
a number of you asked for us to get more
the bad news is CNET got a truck
we're not truck people I'll be the first
to admit I mean we're based here in
downtown San Francisco typically you
don't see a full-size pickup illicits
pulling up to read your gas meter or
pulling a float in the Pride Parade so
I'm gonna approach it this way not as a
truck guy cuz I'm not up with you on
that but as a car I can tell it's a big
part of this vehicles mission as well as
towing at home now I'm not sure if I'm
in a cabin or a living room on a ranch
somewhere in Montana I mean look at this
thing you're not in seats you're in
chairs there's room to really spread out
and everything's kind of a pollster even
more than a lot of high trim cars this
is a very civilized place to do trucking
but and then again this is the top of
the line as a high country here's the
head unit that all these vehicles have
it's an eight inch my link interface
touch LCD with voice command there is no
controller anywhere here so you're
either touching that screen or talking
to it now note something interesting I
here at the home menu what's missing
true turn by turn GPS navigation instead
the base rig has OnStar nav which is
that thing will you call the operator
and they download very simple prompts
onto the screen
connecting to OnStar I need directions
please I want to happen I'm going to CBS
Interactive in San Francisco I'd be more
than happy to download the route to the
Phineas Interactive in San Francisco
thank you for you the NOx I have a great
day
thank you you can option true built-in
nav but it's not base even at this lofty
trim level I was kind of surprised by
that still I way prefer to have an
actual nav system here and better than
that
a connected nav system that lets me
search Google or Bing or something there
are a couple steps behind unless you
option up what is base however at this
trim level and the higher trim
Silverados is a rear camera that does
have trajectory no special views though
no looks from different angles no
all-around cam it's a big vehicle but it
does have really good visibility because
being a pickup there are no deep pillars
like in an SUV you can really look
around and see what's around you pretty
quickly so I'm okay with the lack of
sort of perimeter awareness tech now for
the audio system you've got radio which
is am/fm HD radio satellite radio all at
this trim level now under the media but
you've got bluetooth streaming with
pretty good tag presentation there's a
lot of room there for the meta
information I've got my optical disc
here that's becoming kind of a scarcity
in cars these days you've also got an SD
card slot over here underneath the
armrest which brings me to my next
interesting note on this vehicle look at
all the power from 12 volt outlets to
120 outlets to all kinds of USB charging
outlets to more USB outlets good grief
you can charge anything off this truck
now all those sources go out through a
Bose audio system standard here it's not
a surround sound system nothing fancy
and highfalutin that way it's just a
good basic sort of lots of speakers lots
of oomph you've got a DI see a Driver
Information Center here between the tach
and the speedo
one of the best screens on it is this
fuel economy screen it does a very good
job of putting all the information
together to coach you to drive more
efficiently the yellow arrow at the top
is your average fuel economy the bar
graph underneath that is your
instantaneous and the green
there at the bottom is your best average
over one of several mileage snapshots
right now I've selected the 50-mile
look-back but this is a really good tool
to coach you how to drive for efficiency
within context that means something and
finally way over here is your real
truckin stuff here's your trailer brake
actuator and calibration alright there
below that is your four-wheel drive knob
look how easy it's become these days
it's all electronic most folks are gonna
leave it in Auto but you also got for
low and high in two-wheel drive all
right there now in terms of apps all
you've really got is Pandora and it sits
here kind of all by itself which I also
argue with so there's radio there's
media and then at the home screen
there's Pandora - fractured the nice
thing about it is you can launch from
here and it will launch Pandora on your
phone not all cars do that reliably okay
up here in the sizeable engine bay of
this guy we've got the big engine not
the 5.3 liter base v8 but instead we've
got the big v8 the 6.2 liter both of
them are direct injected and both of
them have active cylinder management
that means it'll run is a v8 under load
or run as a v4 under cruising or very
light load
hence MPGs not bad at 1420 given the
fact this guy weighs nearly 5,400 pounds
and we're in 4-wheel drive configuration
here so there's a lot of complicated
drivetrain mechanism to drag things down
zero to 60 who cares
you've also got 420 horse 460
foot-pounds of torque which of these
guys rave about being substantially
higher than f-150 or RAM in similar
configurations payload on this 4-wheel
Drive short box is nineteen hundred and
fifty some odd pounds towing capacity
ninety six hundred
now let's talk beds we've got a short
bed on this guy makes it almost kind of
look a little funny when you got a big
cab in a short bed 5/8 is your standard
you could add 10 inches to get this
thing out to six six that would be
optional that's what I'm gonna do I
don't think you can carry a lot of the
stuff you want any want to bed this size
now where Ford has this kind of airline
stare that comes down to help you get up
in your bed GM does something much
simpler they've carved out of step in
each corner of the bumper sure you can
sneak your leg up on the bumper but it's
just that extra what five inches that
make it possible without throwing out a
joint in your hip once you get up here
look how nice and easy that gate drops
it's a small thing but it's in this
theme of kind of car light creature
comforts that I find interesting now the
first thing you're struck by certainly
in this nice high trim high country is
if you haven't been in a pickup truck in
a number of years you're gonna be
surprised
the phrase rides like a truck just kind
of isn't useful anymore
they ride like cars quiet well sound
dead buttoned down as you might imagine
this body-on-frame construction is like
a bank vault there's prodigious power of
course although it doesn't come on in
any really sharp way but that's not the
point of a pickup this huge leg room in
the back of this crew cab by the way in
fact I could sit behind myself no
problem and it's kind of like that
legroom you get when you score an exit
row it's really good
now let's talk about driving this guy
big yes but remember that a pickup has
great visibility because of so much
nothing behind it so we're looking out
here and there is no blind spot
detection in the mirrors you're on your
own there what you do have is forward
collision warning that I've got here and
also lane departure warning
neither is active they're both warning
so if I get too close to this car in
front of me and I close too fast I get
an alert on the head-up display here as
well as on the dash as well as getting
the old General Motors run plumb work
they've got these vibration things built
into the seat it's used to be a Cadillac
trick
now there's spread it around a bit so
it'll vibrate the butt of the seat say
whoa you're about to hit something up
front same thing happens at you
into something and the sonar think
you're about to hit a tree or a car now
that same technology in the
lane-departure situation uses the camera
in the windshield to see if you're
drifting and it will vibrate the left or
right side of the sink whichever way
you're drifting on the lane it's really
well calibrated I find it it just hits
it just right it doesn't wait too late
and you're already in the other guy's
Lane
nor is it too early where it's like
leave me alone I'm just driving here
it's well done all in all I could drive
this thing all day long it is a really
comfortable big American car that of
course is actually a truck this price
this big guy as I mentioned this is top
of the stack so a high country
four-wheel drive is gonna run you about
50 grand just to start and another 2,000
if you want the 6.2 v8 that we've got
this guy the high country premium
package brings you the sonar front
collision warning lane departure warning
with the buck bumbler heated wheel and
some other niceties it also includes the
trailer brake panel we saw if you want
real navigation built in that's eight
hundred more there's a 3G hot spot for
600 bucks I can't see the point so I
pass on that and for just 60 bucks you
get a really bright LED bed light I
would definitely do that
all in we're a little under 54,000
loaded up this is a vehicle that
obviously is very capable the
interesting story will be Silverado and
RAM versus the new all aluminum f-150
Ford's taking a whole new body approach
and hoping they can flow in even more v6
--is that have done really well for them
Chevy says stick with steel and we've
got the most powerful v8 in the class
it's an interesting dichotomy and those
two are starting to diverge more than
ever before
