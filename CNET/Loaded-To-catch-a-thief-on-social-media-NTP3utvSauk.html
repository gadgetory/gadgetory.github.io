Carey on cnet com and it's time to get
loaded Apple is outright rejecting any
app that can access the unique
identification number of an iphone or
ipad called a UDID now it's similar to a
vehicle identification number on a car
and these serial numbers for Apple
devices are supposed to let a developer
track your users habits when using their
app but if the information is abused it
could let advertisers track every user
habit without the user knowing or even
worse it's been found that a UDID tied
to select gaming networks also makes it
easy to tap into that person's Facebook
or Twitter account now about six months
ago Apple said it was going to face out
apps using these unique numbers in the
next operating system but techCrunch
reports said this is the first time
we're seeing apps being rejected from
the app store for simply accessing this
number well the next generation to hunt
down carmen sandiego turned to social
media to find her okay carmen sandiego
isn't real but the US government is
wondering if social media can help track
down actual criminals and to test that
idea it has created a worldwide game
called the tag challenge on March 31st
five fictitious suspects of a jewel
heist well how their mug shots published
and actors posing as these thieves will
be in public areas around the world in
new york washington d.c london stockholm
and slovakia the first team to find and
upload photos of each of the suspects by
noon on sunday april first will win the
competition and five thousand dollars
the hope is to study how these players
find the suspects and of social media
can be used to track down fugitives or
missing persons Square has released a
new development to pain with your phone
without ever taking your phone out of
your purse or pocket the makers of that
popular card swiping device attachment
are pushing a new app that does not
require the card swiper what used to be
called the card case app has been
renamed to pay with square and has been
expanded to android devices so here's
how it works when you walk into a store
that uses pay with square you just give
the person behind the register your name
and they charge your account and then
you just walk out without
changing cards or pulling out your phone
it's just another way square is heating
up the mobile payment space after PayPal
recently unveiled its own card swiper
for mobile devices and blackberry maker
research in motion is closer to debuting
a new blackberry foam the company will
give out as many as 2,000 blackberry 10
test models to developers in May
encouraging them to build apps for the
new operating system and of course
generate public interest for the new
model which would be available toward
the end of the year those are your
headlines for today I'm Bridget Carey
