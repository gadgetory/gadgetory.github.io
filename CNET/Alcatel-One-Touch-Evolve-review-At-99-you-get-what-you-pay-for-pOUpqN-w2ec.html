a first look at the alcatel one touch
evolve at $99 full out the evolved is an
entry level smartphone available on
t-mobile it's aimed at anyone still
using a feature phone who's hoping to
make the leap to a smartphone without
paying a lot of money despite its low
price the phone doesn't look cheap with
its matt back cover and silver accents
it's a tiny phone at just 4 inches tall
two and a half inches wide and less than
half an inch thick it's easy to use one
hand it and can slip into most pockets
up top you'll find the standard
power/lock button and headphone jack
along the right side there's a volume
rocker on the Left there's the microUSB
port for charging behind the back cover
there's the battery you'll have to
remove it to get to the SD card and sim
card slots which is a hassle there are
no physical buttons on the front of the
Evolve just hot keys on the screen bezel
the only light up when you tap them
which makes it hard to remember which
key is which at least until you get used
to the phone the 4 inch 480 x 800 pixels
screen looks dim even at max brightness
text is easy to read but overall the
screen doesn't look sharp it's also hard
to read in direct sunlight and it picks
up a lot of smudges the Evolve is
running android for dot 1 an alcatel
added its own colorful overlay with
custom icons and a custom notifications
menu there are also a few pre-installed
apps from t-mobile such as visual
voicemail and mobile hotspot there's a
5-megapixel back shooter and VGA
front-facing camera on the evolved I
major not against the main camera is it
has a fixed focus lens which means that
any up close shots you take will look
blurry indoor photos from the camera had
digital noise and lighting issues while
outdoor shots looked much more natural
the camera captures video at 720p and
the clips I shot with impressively clear
the Evolve runs on t-mobile's network in
the US but can only access 3g
connections that paired with the one
gigahertz processor makes the phone
sluggish when downloading apps are
loading web pages mobile games like
temple run to play without problems but
the graphics didn't look as sharp as
expected
as cliche as it sounds there's nothing
evolved about the evolve it's running an
old version of Android has a limited
camera and is slow yet for $99 flat out
for $28 down and three dollar monthly
payments for two years with t-mobile
it's one of the lowest cost phones on
the carrier which is sure to lure
bargain-hunting smartphone shoppers you
