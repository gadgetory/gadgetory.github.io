I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update the review is in for Microsoft's
first tablet the surface the downsides
the App Store is bare bones and it's
slow when using Internet Explorer and
that desktop mode feels like a useless
feature for a tablet and can be hard to
navigate with touch but there are good
things about it the hardware is praised
for being well built it comes with
office 2013 and the keyboard cover
accessories are handy way to get work
done but that cover costs extra the
surface might not be able to replace
your laptop just yet for business you
see it depends on the programs you need
to use but it sure could be a laptop
replacement if you only do basic tasks
you may get annoyed by the lack of apps
for entertainment and social networking
the windows App Store is just slim
pickins compared to the choices for
Apple and Android of course we'll see
more windows absent I'm the surface
loaded with Windows RT hit stores Friday
but a surface tablet with full windows 8
will arrive sometime next year and
before you shop you should know the
difference between Windows RT and
Windows 8 there are many flavors you see
of this new operating system you'll find
many tablets and laptop tablet hybrids
loaded with Archie you can think of it
as Windows 8 light RT can only run
Windows Store applications so you can't
download just any program let's move
from tablets two phablets if you wish
your phone was a hybrid between a tablet
and a phone then say hello to the galaxy
note 2 and it's 5.5 inch screen which is
now being sold at t-mobile for three
hundred and seventy dollars with a new
two-year contract yeah that's a pretty
hefty price tag but it has more features
and other smart phones like the built-in
stylus pen and some extra productivity
software 18t is going to sell the note
for cheaper than t-mobile starting at
three hundred dollars ATT is taking
pre-orders Thursday but it arrives in
stores November 9th and check out this
new service called Chirpify the program
which you purchased something that's
posted on twitter or instagram just by
replying with the word by sounds pretty
extreme to complete a purchase with a
quick one word social media reply but
Chirpify has seen some
success with low priced items Greenday
used it to sell an album on twitter and
within the first four hours 250 people
bought the album through a tweet tattoo
artist kat von d signed up to start
selling her items on Instagram you'll
likely see Chirpify more often as the
holidays approach as a way to quickly
donate to a cause but you have to first
to give trip fi your paypal and shipping
info before you go on a spending spree
the company plans to expand this to
tumblr and pinterest that your tech news
