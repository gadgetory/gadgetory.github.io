I'm at CES 2013 I'm looking right now at
project shield and videos project shield
it's basically it's a gaming device it
runs a pure version of Android and it as
you can see it kind of looks like a
video game controller will this screen
5-inch screen at the top the resolution
is 1280 by 720 and you know just holding
it in your hands it just feels like you
know like to my experience it feels like
an xbox controller it has you know the
same same letter buttons has this middle
button here that goes right right to the
TegraZone has a d-pad over here two
analog sticks trigger buttons on the
back also shoulder bumpers on the back
also has a micro SD card slot a
micro-hdmi micro USB and a headphone
jack also has these speakers on the top
here and in videos using some new
technology which I couldn't hope you or
talk about it at length but the speakers
sound really powerful one of the biggest
coolest aspects of this thing is that it
streams pc games so if you have an
nvidia pc running a g4 650 or later you
can stream from your pc to this device
over Wi-Fi so let's say if you're in
another room of your house and you want
to play a high end pc game but you don't
want to sit at your desk or wherever
your pc is you can just take it to your
bedroom or the kitchen or other rooms
which you could probably think of be
great for this kind of thing so it's
there's no price yet it's coming out in
quarter to but that's pretty much all we
know right now feels kind of light feels
about as heavy as an xbox controller
probably a little bit heavier than that
once again i'm eric franklin and this
has been a first look at the nvidia
project shield
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
