that's also Bluetooth Keyboard a formula
eraser drives around with a VR headset
on and it's super awesome and dangerous
it's definitely dangerous and also a
little egg that you can live in off the
grid anywhere in the world
pretty weird not dangerous but weird
some are daily
greetings citizens with the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best speak
talk show in the known universe I am
Ashley skele
join me as always Kail anonymous it's
Wednesday
mm-hmm I'm going to Google i/o tomorrow
so we're shooting I'm telling you in
advance guys we're shooting two shows
today so you're live right now no I mean
tomorrow tomorrow I'll be lost so when
we say okay so tomorrow's episode I will
be in two places at once text so you're
spoiling that tomorrow we're wearing the
same underwear as we're wearing today
essentially spoiler alert guys spoiler
alert
um which always underwear alert number
one headline of the day today but but we
do have more so let's hit it
fun facts about tomorrow daily really
we're really losing our credibility with
the underwear story but yeah it's that
yeah okay all right so what he got all
right let's talk about the Eco capsule
um I saw this and thought it was so cool
and so strange but also kind of what the
future looks like to me like I think
about things in the futuristic things
and it feels like this is a thing that
is one of those things um this is a
little egg-shaped house this is a house
that you can live in you can see the
pictures a producer Logan was kind
enough to grab a whole bunch of pictures
offline and it is fully portable it is
powered by solar and wind energy and can
capture and filter rainwater and do so
basically you can live completely off
the grid it is about fourteen point six
feet long which is four point five
meters long two point four meters wide
and two point five meters tall so is
about eight feet tall so it is really a
little egg shape here's the interior it
has a folding bed a table two chairs a
little kitchen a toilet and a shower so
pretty much everything you need for
basic living has some storage space so
there's some storage space that you have
available to you and and some and
there's like two windows so you get a
couple windows and so the solar power
actually charges an onboard battery so
even if there's a cloudy day you can
pull from the battery okay so you can
see you can harvest and store energy on
a sunny day so for those cloudy days
you'll have energy and architects are
saying that it can support somebody
living
off the grid for almost a year just
pretty great yeah pretty cool except for
they have to get like food and stuff but
whatever they do you have to go this
week would not water because if you have
while depending on where you are but if
there's rain it can convert and filter
rainwater and do so it can capture
Mountain Dew water not quite Mountain
Dew um but yeah so this is it's really
cool it's kind of a really neat
sustainable off-the-grid house
and they were saying that you can ship
it you can airlift it you can tow it you
can even it can even be pulled by a pack
animal so you could have like a couple
of burros pulling that thing down a path
that's good I got lots of burros the
internet you have a lot of donkeys
hanging around so they're hoping that
this is in there the game is this is for
vacation and or living off the grid
nothing nothing really else not like Oh
exploring other planets or because I
mean obviously it's not liking yeah no I
don't think it's for anymore like harsh
conditions like it's not I wouldn't
imagine it's not like rated to survive
like a tsunami or something like that
i'm i would imagine it'd be the same as
any other house in fact maybe a little
more dangerous cuz it's not like on a
foundation right it's not hooked to a
foundation but it sleeps one person so
its own person so it seems like it's a
really great thing for somebody who
wants to maybe do some adventuring live
off the grid
check out places of the world that maybe
they want to live in for up to a year
and and i like that it is eco-friendly
live off the grid you don't need a lot
of you know extra power and hearing your
solar right from the side so they had a
toilet yeah what's the deal with that
well I'd imagine it's the same as an RV
same type of thing as an RV so you got a
little yeah there's a little toilet on
top left corner and then it goes where
well there's a huge way it's like an RV
so - Matt I would imagine because they
haven't unveiled it officially yet it's
gonna get unveiled at this event called
the pioneers festival in Vienna
I like this week and but I would imagine
it's like an RV where you have like a
tank and then you have to empty it
safely oh you can't just dump it
anywhere you want great um but yeah
there's I would imagine you have to you
have to pump it the same as an RV okay
so it's a little bit on the learning
curve it's obviously they haven't
released the price they do want to take
pre-orders later this year and then they
want to ship them sometime next year so
this is like something that they're
hoping to bring the market very very
soon and they haven't announced a full
price for it but
did say shipping would be about $2,500
to New York
so if but then again I mean for me it's
like why would you want to ship this
thing to the states like I would want to
pick it up and like Vienna and take it
somewhere remote like there's not a lot
of whole there's not a lot real remote
places in the US like you're not maybe
living off the ground like desert that's
about it desert and maybe like some
parts of Montana are probably pretty
remote like there's some maybe not farm
life fields things that are remote but
not there's not a whole lot of remote
places in the US and I would imagine a
lot of the remote places are places you
would not be able to take that thing and
live off the grid like like national
parks you can't just ride that thing up
the mountain and start staying there so
but I thought it was really cool and I
thought about I saw so many people
talking about this online and I wanted
to talk to him about it with you guys in
you and use it as our hashtag of the day
which will be TV eco cap on and I want
to know where would you live if you
could live anywhere in the world in this
thing like where would you take it where
would you live off the grid for a year
like if you if they said okay we're
gonna pay you whatever you make in a
year to go live off the grid somewhere
like all of your expenses are covered
and you're gonna live off the grid like
where'd you go I wanted to live intra
noble but that doesn't you know you
can't protect itself from anything does
seem a little bit dangerous yeah oh no
this Savannah thing out with some
animals all right like that I don't I
don't know how this is any different
than actually having like an RV with
solar panels on top of it well it's much
smaller okay
oh it's a small house with no wheels
yeah there's no Angela's wheels there's
no engine
it's active month okay well that's my
answer then the Savannah Savannah okay I
would say I kind of like the idea of
like living in a like the mountains in
like Bavaria I get the mountainous kind
of areas nice we live in a nice area
like that I get nice views good weather
probably go K weather get a lot of
enough rain but enough Sun to sort of
sustain the the solar and wind power
it's also wind powered so maybe some
some wind eNOS would be good but yeah I
would say like around there I I seem
like I feel like I would like that but
where would you live where'd you take it
where'd you wear
would you live off the grid for a year
it's or you know if you really hate this
thing tell us what you hate about it
tell us what's not going to work about
it but yeah TD eco cap to eco capsule
you can find it online I think it's cool
I really like it but tell me about this
driving thing because it sounds insane
it's not it's actually really boring so
we're moving on to the next story which
is no we have to talk about your I'm
just kidding it's not boring so you you
know that people are just scratching the
surface of what can be done with VR and
people are just trying all different
types of things
well Castrol is getting on top of this
by actually having a driver where vr
while he's driving an actual car so he
can drive in a simulated space there's a
lot of moving parts to this including a
car a Mustang what is it like six six
eighty or something like that so it's
incredibly dangerous that he's doing
this so let me let me kind of outline
first of all this is like an
advertisement thing that they're doing
but it doesn't make it any less cool
because it puts like two months of works
to get this one video going all right
Wow look at that so they asked formula
formula draft driver Matt powers to
drive his rush stage three Mustang
around a test track while wearing this
oculus rift they would simulate in
things like falling rocks cliff dropping
collapsing track and worst of all he's
driving this actual car now as you can
see they had to do a lot of program
because they basically did turn the car
into a controller it's got like light
sensors on the front to see where he's
moving it reads his acceleration his
brakes
it reads everything it turned his car
into a controller he had to drive this
many many times to get used to the like
VR because he said at one point he would
turn and his head was turned a different
way than it was actually in the VR so
there was a lot of stuff that went into
doing this um
powers said the driver said orginal
drift was exhilarating and challenging
like nothing I've ever done before it's
been awesome not being in it's a it's
been awesome not only being involved and
testing the next generation of gaming
technology but also the possibilities
that open opens up Motorsports in
general are mind-blowing so yeah there
you go
I basically you can go check this out
this is the making of video they also
have the official video that they made
but it's incredible to see the
they were two months to get all of it
calibrated so this guy didn't crash and
die while making this video so it's
pretty cool it's part of a series called
titanium trials this is only one of many
but this is the one that had to do with
virtual reality we think this is really
cool and also very dangerous variable I
can't believe how they show this like
virtual world and it looks like kind of
a big disk that is it's it's like a
track but it's it's crazy looks like a
real weird future just topia planet that
you would see in like thor like it's a
really creepy sort of landscape and then
he's in this amazing must it's weird
they could have just had him driving
around on the car and then simulated it
like it looked like he was driving it
they're like oh no no we want him to
beat like like look like it for him to
look like he's in the virtual reality
and make him drive a car at the same
time really he's the one experiencing
this the most but just they wanted to
overcome this hurdle and see if they
could do it and they did it so check out
both of those videos that is amazing I
love this titanium Charles changing back
and forth between the real world and
like you can see exactly what he's doing
in the virtual yeah there oh man oh the
cool we'll never be able to do this
because we don't drive so there you go
anyway so go check that out good job
Castro yeah that's that's pretty amazing
I love that story also now I know what
it would be like if anybody ever
strapped on oculus rift and try to use
it while driving which seems like the
worst idea two months 17 months all
right
don't do that okay last story I'll make
it quick this comes from a German ad
agency called gutes webbing and service
plan and it's called the trade typer and
if you've ever been to you get a
fast-food on you your little food tray
you don't want to get your smartphone
you want to get a bunch of grease all
over your phone that's alright because
they have these paper trays that have
bluetooth capability built into the
paper so that you can have a little
keyboard in your paper tray what what in
the world yeah they're calling it tray
typer there it is you all you have to do
is you activate the tray and then you
enter a password to connect it to your
phone and then as you're eating you can
go ahead and type on your little type on
a little tray and it'll type on your
phone and you can post the social you
can do all sorts of stuff yeah super
weird but also one of those things
up you know how when you saw it kind of
old oh yeah that was the other thing
they said a hundred percent of people
who got these at during the promotional
time they gave these out in Germany at
KFC's everybody took them home they're
like I'm gonna take this thing thank you
yeah free technology you're kidding me
free Bluetooth keyboard
I guess the grease on the actual paper
probably didn't matter to them cuz you
know sometimes there's like it looks
slightly plasticky a little bit yeah
does it look full well I said there were
paper paper liners but they probably
they probably had sort of a middle layer
oh it's so bad like this is so weird no
it's so bad because it's like we want
people to stop eating fast food and we
also want people to like get their nose
out of technology and like actually
experience these guys and this place is
like yo get fat get big technology yeah
yeah you can do both the keyboard is 0.4
millimeters thick so it's not thick at
all and it's super cool the ad agency
said it was a huge success
yeah here success we they did some
geolocation I kind of research I'm like
where people you they said that social
went way up at these locations of these
KFC locations where they have the paper
tray so it was a very big success you
can imagine though going into a KFC and
then everybody's eating all their food
I'm doing this like well I guess right
now they're treating our food and
they're doing this like they're looking
at their phone while they're eating so
yeah but a lot of the times I have to
put my phone down and just like wow
whatever I'll just look around and oh
hey that you know this no there's a
giant elephant over there no now you can
walk an elephant right through a KFC and
nobody will notice
that's true how's a true story on yeah
so Trey typer so weird but also really
cool and I kind of am Lima cool I want
to check it out like I wish we have that
here in the states I think that would be
pretty rare and you definitely steal it
I would definitely take it home it's
it's a souvenir it's a great souvenir
you take it home you're like look at
this crazy piece of technology I would
bring it on the show if I could if you
live in Germany and you have one send it
to us and we'll send it back but like
let us borrow it because I want to do
stole it we're gonna steal it to
Fahrenheit so that's our headlines we're
gonna take a quick break but before we
go you guys have to see this video it's
an art installation you know how they
always say like tinder is kind of a meat
market
okay then dating apps kind of a meat
market well they had these
these art students actually made IP a
stake a raw steak that swipes right on
tinder so check out the scrap
welcome back to the show we've returned
because we didn't have a show on Monday
I decided maybe we should do back there
Hackett today so do you wanna hear about
something fun
yes hey do it okay so some complaints
about drones is that they're really
fragile uh they are easy to like if they
crash usually like you could have some
real big problems um and this is the
sprite drone this is called the sprite
drum and they're saying this is a really
rugged it's kind of weird-looking it's a
really rugged powerful easy to use and
and prosumer esque like has kind of
prosumers gear on it and it's a drone so
it's about the size of a thermos like a
large thermos so it's not huge but it is
bigger than I thought when I had seen it
by itself floating in the sky I'm like
oh this looks like it's the size of
Ganga snow it's a little bigger than
that so yeah I can see how big that is
right there they compared to the size of
the guys arm and it's got remote
controls it has follow mode so you can
tell it to follow you you can put you
know tell it to tell to follow you
there's the following you and then
there's also a detailed app where you
can program exactly you know where
points of interest you can tell it oh I
want you to make this route on a map
which is kind of neat and yeah it's
really durable so when it falls in the
ground you just go pick it up and use it
again it's got two axis gimbal on it
they want you to be able to add
accessories to it as they build things
for it so they want you to be able to
unscrew it in half and then add an
accessory into the middle as like a
middle ring accessory nice and then they
have already
fortunately met their goal this is part
of the app that we're looking at right
now that says like okay the here's where
I want you to go this is what I want to
check out the camera on it's good it's a
1080p camera they were saying they want
professional like they're they consider
this a tool not a toy they're like you
don't need to bring you know if you
don't want to bring a remote control you
can just use you can program what you
want it to do and you can switch out the
batteries really easily and all this
other stuff so here's that's this is the
meet of the product itself it's got a
camera on there and it takes nice
footage I would say just from what I've
seen the footage is not as stable as the
DJI phantom 3 the one that we saw on
into it Mike's Phantom right
but but I would imagine that's because
it the Phantom has it's a 3 axis gimbal
so there's the accessory thing you can
screw on in the middle so they're saying
as time goes on we want to be able to
add these accessories they have already
met their $200,000 goal they've already
met it there they've crossed it by about
$13,000 they've got about 213 k 17 days
left in the kickstarter campaign and how
much would you pay for this
oh I consider the cost of a drone like
the the DJI phantom 3 is starts at $9.99
$700 oh you're so close good yes $7.99
okay that's you it gets you sprite it
comes with a free software but no RC
transmitter so if you want one with an
RC if the remote to the transmitter yeah
you have to pay nine forty nine which is
only $50 less than the phantom right so
but this one's durable very rugged it's
really good for it seems very outdoor
like outdoorsman people who are hiking
and doing sort of adventurous things but
I thought it was really impressive that
they sort of put this together and it
seems like they're really making
something different which I like you're
like different I'm cool with a
competitive drone market yeah everybody
everyone wins when drones get
competitive not with each other in the
violent sense but business-wise
everybody wins
I I'm sorry for your not clarifying that
up front okay um but yeah so sprite room
that's what it's called would you back
it I mean yeah sure I really don't have
any investment in the whole drone world
like I died first of all I don't have
the disposable income to have thing to
fly around and shoot video for me I
that's that's not a bit super amazing
but if you did with my dish so would you
get a like like a phantom or a more
traditional the phantom won't follow you
to have you tell to high that I'm not
sure of but there are ones that do have
follow modes okay I'd probably do this
one Fargo especially if they could get
one that like you could periscope on two
so you could like go hiking and like
have people follow you or you like that
walk around a convention and it flies
and follows you around or something so
wise so yeah that's really clever and I
think you just changed my mind I was
gonna say no but I think that if they
can work out an accessory
that would allow you to livestream I
think I would do I need a camera anymore
just you and your little sprite yeah you
get around you can live streaming
YouTube on um you can lash her into
YouTube on the phantom like that so you
can send videos oh so that's a head so
yeah but I I think this is right I think
that if you like drones and you're kind
of an outdoorsy person who worries about
crashing your drone and breaking it and
making and spending a thousand dollars
and they get completely inoperable with
one you know minor crash maybe this is
the drone I I think it's I think this is
a useful drone because there's different
drones for different reasons
affectionate right now so like the
Phantom is gonna get your beautiful
sweeping city shots and your coastlines
and this one's gonna be like let's go
hooking I think you mean fall one
hundred forty seven hours away but are
487 hours and you're caught it's just
floating there catching footage and it
well then the whole hours I say then the
whole movies already done you just sell
the rights to your footage and then all
of a sudden you have a blockbuster
oscar-winning film there you go problem
solved guys problem soft unless you in
fact die I would in the middle of desert
which would be bad somebody would
definitely take your footage and get
rich off of it so I guess it's a win I
don't know um but yeah sprite drone
that's what it's called has about to a
little over two weeks left so if you are
so inclined you have the extra cash in
your pocket
go for it pretty good okay we got to
talk about go talk about cheaters got to
talk about all right yesterday okay yeah
all right let's hear about your user
feedback
so yesterday we asked really going on on
the YouTube so I'm gonna get that one
while you I pulled some from YouTube oh
did you get okay yet for tomorrow too
because because we're gonna be a I oh
where did you cheat me today you're
gonna die oh because yeah okay we're
gonna do cheaters for two days so
today's today's user feedback comes from
Tony we asked you guys to say what
should cheaters do to get back in the
good graces or should they be let back
in and Tony says they should be made to
do the Ghost Pepper challenge I like
that
make him suffer too easy little too easy
too easy okay
Dustin Roden said cheaters that repent
should be let back in the game with
stats reduced to beginner level for a
clean slate oh they wouldn't do it then
yeah I feel like they wouldn't do it cuz
that's the same as buying a new account
yeah I new cap yeah um and then uh I
can't I'm gonna push your name and I'm
really sorry cuz I think it is a lovely
name written down remet remedies
remedies remedies
I'm guessing says I agree with Kayla but
they should also have and I am a cheat
by their gamertag they should get like a
scarlet letter next there I like that
actually that's pretty good yeah like
that one
I like that cuz then it's like you kind
of know maybe something's up with the
sky yeah but then you know it's like
we're it's like you know those parents
so punish their kids put them Megan put
on a sandwich sign this like I did this
bad thing or those weird blogs that
people are like the dogs confessing to
terrible things they've done like this
like that it's like that but with people
I like that you guys have really good
ones we have more tomorrow we're like
four more tomorrow I pulled some from
YouTube I braved the nippy canals of
YouTube and I grabbed some comments
first but it's better it's been a real
muck fest over there it's well lately
but there's some good ones in there are
some really I'm saying it's like when I
find those people I'm like I will pull
you from the muck come with me
okay to take you away from this place um
so yeah you guys had really good ones
will do cheats again tomorrow and then
we'll do the eco cap and tomorrow's
hashtag of the day on Monday
um but with that being said we got to
talk about our very last PC user
feedback which is always our phone tog
refer the day
aditya wrote us and said that they took
this picture with their galaxy note 4

in a Runa shawl pradesh india so that's
better walk that bridge tell me in the
story it says he didn't say I said I
hope you guys both like it you guys are
rock you better if you ever watch that

like to think that he walked across to
take the picture and then to how to go
