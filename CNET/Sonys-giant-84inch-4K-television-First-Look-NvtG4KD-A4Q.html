i'm here with sony's first 4k television
it's called the xbr 84 x 900 and it's
going to be available in stores this
year sometime we don't have pricing as
yet but that's going to be announced in
eight days at cedia what we're looking
at as far as europe's concerned it's
around the 25 thousand euro mark so
expecting something very similar here so
what 4k is it's a new consumer format
it's based on what you see inside the
cinemas what you get is 3840 pixels
along here and 2160 pixels down here now
at the moment there isn't much 4k format
material available what you have is a 4k
channel on YouTube and you also have one
movie that's been released on hard drive
which you can buy as well but no
consumer format yet although that is
supposedly coming now this is an
edge-lit set which means that the LEDs
are along the side and it's also a 3d
passive television which means you use a
set of passive glasses and it reduces
the resolution 24 K 1 K which is also a
new format this is a stereo TV so you
have two speaker sets either side it's a
10 driver system and what makes this a
4k television is it actually has an
upscale ur inside called the x-reality
pro 4k which upscales normal content for
example HD which is 1920 x 1080 content
to 2k which is a little bit higher than
has another upscaler to upscale left to
4k so look out for more details on cnet
com on this new television very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
