a first look at Samsung's milk music
that is a new streaming music service
that works on samsung devices it's free
doesn't require login you just download
it and you start playing
it's a radio style service kind of like
Pandora or iTunes radio it's got 200
curated stations with 13 million songs
the back end is actually from slacker an
existing radio service but the interface
and how you interact with it is all-new
and all Samsung and that's what makes it
a little bit unique it starts with this
gigantic jog wheel over here and you can
move your finger along the outside of
the jog wheel and very quickly jump
between the 200 stations then if you put
your finger on the inside of the jog
wheel you get a much more sort of
fine-tuned control where you can just go
station by station like this along the
outer wheel here you can have up to 9
genres at a time you can actually adjust
that by going into the menu here and you
go to customize dial and then I can say
I don't want country on my dial but I
want you know Latin and then if you go
back then you'll see that the the wheel
itself has changed and you get access to
these stations instead if you want a
quick review this little pull down here
and you can go through all the different
stations that are available on your jog
wheel you know jazz has like nine
stations but rock is like 20 so like
siriusXM for example you're going to
find you know deeper selections of music
in some genres rather than others of
course I never find exactly what I'm
looking for so I went and created the
station for instance there was no bossa
nova station so I went and created one
by entering a couple of names I can edit
it here and add more artists to my
station and then we'll create a station
that's that based on that kind of like
Pandora does when you enter a song or an
artist or genre here you can do artists
and songs but not genres by default it
names my station after the first artist
I picked I went in and edited that and
just turn it into a bossa nova station
and we can find that by going up here to
my stations and you'll find it right
there it is so each station lets you do
six skips per hour and that's per
station so if you run out of skips on
one station you can skip to another and
you get another six and the first one
resets after an hour and each station
has a series of controls for it those
are right down here you swipe up from
the bottom of the screen so one fader
will switch between more popular songs
and less popular songs you want more
sort of like album cuts versus hot
singles and I don't adjust the mix newer
songs versus older ones the sliders just
called new but it really means newer
songs here older songs here and of
course favorites if you pick a song to
favorite and you can tag any songs you
hear as favorites you'll hear them
either more often or less often
obviously you have to pick a bunch of
favorites in order for that slider to
have a lot to do so the positives for
the unusually named milk music where you
can get around this big genre wheel does
jog wheel very quickly that's kind of
cool and access a lot of music fast it's
free to use and there's no ad to get an
occasional promo spot for slacker but
that's really about it
the catch is it's only four people have
certain Samsung devices like the galaxy
for the upcoming Galaxy five the note
three the note for the s4 mini basically
any of the current Samsung devices this
will work on you download it through the
Google Play Store but if you have
another kind of phone you just going to
have to use another music service so I'm
Dan Akron and that is milk music from
Samsung</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
