paying customers on a flight around the
moon in late 2018 but they won't exactly
be Neil Armstrong because they are gonna
set foot on the lunar surface his plan
is to send the two private citizens on
the crew Dragon spacecraft it will
launch from Earth with a falcon heavy
rocket the launch will take place along
the same path as Apollo 8 and from the
same launch pad at the Kennedy Space
Center almost 50 years later must
compare the two mystery citizens to the
Apollo astronauts before they launched
the unnamed space tourists will go
through some initial health and fitness
tests and then their training will begin
later this year the names have yet to be
disclosed but they have already put down
a quote of significance deposits we
don't know how much they paid or how
much the overall cost of the trip will
be and must also said that this will be
the first but probably not the last time
that SpaceX will send regular people
into space
others have already shown interest in
the proposal recently SpaceX has had a
few setbacks including trouble docking
at the International Space Station and a
September 2016 rocket explosion on a
launch pad hopefully with space tourists
Houston won't have a problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
