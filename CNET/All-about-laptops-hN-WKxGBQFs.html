Cena live at CES we're here on our scene
at stage in the South Hall right above
the Starbucks if you're watching this
live on your phone somewhere in Vegas
get over here we have a great audience
out here and I'm very excited because
right now we have Dan Ackerman and Scott
Stein on stage for what we're now
calling the laptop talk show are now
annual our second Adam yes our second
annual laptop talk show and the best
thing about this is that the drool
factor on our stage right now is extreme
every kind of cool sexy gorgeous
Ultrabook that you've been hearing about
being announced at the show in blog form
is here live on the stage you guys are
basically just gonna run through them
emcee and we'll see what sticks I feel
like that will just take the sort of
Ultrabook approach right yes this is a
great Ultrabook showdown book shootout
so let's talk a little bit about that
category for the few people who don't
know there may be people watching at
home who having kind of I mean it's
actually slightly it's hard it's hard to
explain and getting harder to explain
right what an ultrabook is yeah the
categories have blurred a bit so before
it was you know you it was like a
MacBook Air you know you've got the
flash storage it's thin 13-inch laptop
but then you have 11 inches and now you
have 14 and 15 inches and some of those
have full hard drives no longer SSDs
some of optical drives some have
graphics what's the difference a lot of
them are thinner and sexier
kind of cooler they're gonna be running
those new processors later in the year
eventually time to Windows 8 so the
revolution of laptops really well the
real question for me is why ultrabooks
why do you think Intel decide because
Intel decided right let's create this
category let's give it a name let's
everybody get just behind a set of
general principles cuz they got to
create fads and the last kind of fad
that they were behind was sort of the
netbook we're gonna have those Intel
Atom netbooks those sold well for a
while but then they kind of tapered off
they gotta come up with something else
and you know the term ultra doesn't
really mean anything it means like super
thin they could have made me come up
with something more descriptive but if
they can get a fan going behind it
everyone goes I want a MacBook Air but I
wanted to run Windows then everybody
gets behind it and makes it you know you
can't buy a thick laptop anymore which
is actually actually I don't know
anybody who did
get the memo I have one manufacturer in
mind but it seems like you know we're
seeing announcements or at least
promises from almost anybody anyone
who's not getting the memo about some
people are a little later than others
Dell for example has their first ultra
book here this week even though everyone
else has had them for a couple of months
now at least we're getting into it I was
in their booth yesterday thinking
particularly Reagan Square yeah so is it
about design what's that or what is the
single most important factor in terms of
the the product the value proposition
for me the buyer what is it that makes
an ultrabook something I need I think
we're so spoiled by carrying things that
are thin and light and easy to take with
you to work to home to the coffee shop I
think that's the key differentiator and
maybe you want to look at price too
because one of the things that you
unless you're do something really super
cool and you're gonna beat something
like the MacBook Air if you can get a
little under that price and offer
something where you say wow for $8.99
I'm I'm beating it out on specs and
there's some like that I think it's
another thing to look to that was that
was one of the problems of the first
ultrabooks is that they were $12.99
$13.99 same times the MacBook Air we've
it a little bit less but you can't make
something that's just about as good as a
MacBook Air and just about as extensive
the thing for me to that I think has the
most promise for consumers is the
solid-state drives
I think you know not everyone has had
that it's that life-changing experience
of realizing that when you open your
laptop lid it wakes right up and you can
start doing things immediately I feel
like when people see that happen they
realize that it means you can just have
a laptop anywhere in the house open it
up start going I mean I think there's a
huge benefit while it's hard to make it
more reliable you have let's movie parts
the breakdown but Scott always points
out that I like having a lot of storage
and maybe I'm old-fashioned but you know
sometimes you under store a lot of stuff
so I appreciate the movement now that
you see a lot of these ultra books that
are going to the old-fashioned magnetic
hard drives you're getting up to 500
gigabytes maybe even a terabyte
I know it's maybe not waiting anymore so
waiting i bridged a little bit SSD a
little faster starting but yeah if you
can if you can deal with the 128 or you
want to pay for the 256 but yeah a lot
of people can get a lot of stuff done on
those and keep things on how long is it
gonna be before those solid state drives
start to come up and
at affordable prices we'd like that
should be happening waiting a couple
years we were like a law about that
working of Moore's law now I know maybe
I feel like next year should be this
year seems like 128 I'm hoping that next
year will be maybe a 256 and this year
you can get a 128 for like $7.99 one of
these 13 Ultrabook
right that's a pretty good price well
and let's be honest you can get like a
an external terabyte for sure 70 bucks
these days you know or even not storage
for a hundred bucks for its paradise the
heck of I have been I've been okay with
that and my little backup exactly yeah
all right let's enough enough chatting
enough philosophizing let's get to the
pogroms and stuff let's get to the
gadget porn all right what do we have
we're gonna go kind of in order it looks
like you've got three and Scott's got
three I'm gonna start with the Dell XPS
13 now Dell was of course a little late
to the Ultrabook party they took their
time but they've got a 13-inch system
right here that's part of that high-end
XPS live you know it's super thin it's
not quite as super fancy of some of the
other ones but that's because it sort of
meant to be that consumer business
hybrid crossover system where you can
get it and take it home but you can also
ask your IT department together because
they have an IT version with like a TPM
chip and other stuff like that and it's
got the rubberized bottom if you feel
bad that's kind of cool yeah that's nice
and it's super thin and what I like is
the footprint is a little bit smaller
than some of the other 13-inch
ultrabooks it's closer to what you'd
find a 12-inch screen system in so so
it's a little bit it's a little bit more
petite and still super thin I gotta say
- right off the back I am really struck
by the similarity to the MacBook Air
they're just really they're not even
pretending not to be making a MacBook
Air clone it really looks like it and
frankly I consider that a plus I think
everyone stopped pretending and then the
last couple my kinda - okay fine here it
is it's you know it's the perfect size
it's the perfect shape get it done nice
machine and then we have something a
little bit more extravagant yeah now
something that does not look like a
MacBook Air per se but no better timing
with all the Gorilla Glass talked yes
this is the HP Envy Spectre 14 and it is
covered in glass this gorilla glass on
the front it's on the back also on the
palm rest and on the trackpad and it has
a very I phone for type look on that
profile on the lid and it's you see it's
heavier it's heavier it's thicker it's
heavy it's a 14-inch and so that's the
beginning of the blurring of the line
it's thinner than other envies though
and it has the Beats Audio in that
little audio analog wheel on the side
like on the new envy revisions that came
out in December and now a nice screen
turn that back to the keyboard and it's
expensive this is one of those top-end
ones is $13.99 it's coming out February
8th and so this is kind of in that
beginning to blur that line in the
Ultrabook category
it looks sleek I mean I've heard some
people ask about the glass what's gonna
happen if you are confident having glass
on the back of your laptop layer I don't
know if someone came out with a lance or
something like a sharp object but I mean
if you drop it that happens right he has
an exciting life home joust a lot of
jousting if I mean if I dropped it I'd
be worried but honestly if you dropped
any laptop there would be problems so I
didn't know I haven't gone through like
dropping laptops on the floor to find
out but I mean it feels nice and sturdy
and sleek and it's very different than
the HP photo 13 there other ultrabook
which is in that small business type
category it's kind of the no-nonsense
sensible one it's and it's also like
$8.99 so it's right in that sort of you
know a lot of specs for your for your
bang for your buck category and this is
that sleeker kind of a design I think
it's a probably the single best looking
laptop I figure this week it's really it
comes with cotton gloves there you go
it's gonna support NFC to action but
yeah I know cool all right
that's beautiful you mentioned our
friends over at Toshiba I did it's like
ready ready to buy just yet this is a 14
inch ultrabook prototype that they have
so you'll see this later in the year
hopefully and hopefully they'll look
just like this and again it's got the
bigger screen it's still pretty thin
it's not as soon as those 13 inches but
what they're trying to do is they're
trying to say we can take that 13 inch
Ultrabook and give it a 14 inch screen
later almost even 15 inch screens and
those become machines that you can use
it were called a a 13 inch great for
traveling great for that you know couple
hours of the coffee shop airport lounge
whatever but all day every day you're
not gonna use a 13 you need a 14 or a 15
so once you get up to this size then you
have something that's almost as thin and
light that you
actually just use as your full-time
machine and that's what ultrabooks up
until now I think our degree you have
not been able to do I feel like I'm
skeptical of that though the idea that
you have to have a 14 or 15 inch machine
to work on because oh then you got to
get like a docking station and plug
stuff in yes that's true I agree it's
clunky it's a clunkier solution but
it'll at least for me it allows me to
have a tiny laptop that I don't know if
it's I don't know necessarily where it's
going to slide I'm left to see I think
right now there's not also it maybe just
go - everybody knows what the MacBook
Air is doing and it's just as simple as
that Apple doesn't have a type of
product the moment that fits into that
category so oh wait I don't you know
what is that exactly and there
definitely are people who want the
keyboard I think is it probably that is
in that reel this is a very Toshiba
design sensibility that seems to be what
they you know you have the
differentiating cues right the HP Envy
line very design century machines always
have been really beautiful Toshiba it
really does this brushed aluminum we've
seen that on some of their tablets and
some of their other laptops and then of
course Dell just looking like a MacBook
Air no one's one of the bigger older
books and we also have one of the heavy
smaller ultra books right here to go in
the complete opposite direction yeah so
the Acer Aspire
s5 which had made a lot of waves 1011
flame a sir upped its game with this
this says I mean I feel like with the
samsung series nine last year this is
kind of like inheriting that direction
as opposed to the s3 that was last year
that was a you know a little more in
that grayish silver not a sexy this is I
mean we're much more razor thin design
15 millimeters onyx black and it's got
that this is the sports car feature of
the show okay I love is that this is the
magic flip port or you press the button
here and it it's like a spoiler that
comes up automatically pops up it
reminds me of a DeLorean or something
and then you have access to all the
ports on the back including Thunderbolt
this is going to be one of those next
gen ultrabooks so so does that mean
it seems like there's weird K genus
around Ivy Bridge right didn't you say
okay so it has Thunderbolt which means
it must have Intel's Ivy Bridge right
and then what happens um nobody wants to
talk about it you say there's an Ivy
Bridge laptop right in the gun is the
chip we dare not speak its name right
socially awkward they just walk away but
it's a clear end up here it's a good
thing I mean it's going I think the more
you have thunderbolt in devices we talk
about thunderbolt on on you know Apple
products and how many peripherals you
have but if it shows up across a ton of
laptops I think you'll start seeing
Thunderbolt peripherals that are kind of
interesting yeah I love this sort of the
curve and very samsung series 9 that's
kind of curved closure there this is it
feels good this little motorized thing
here and that's how they get it so thin
by hiding the ports and make it another
mechanical part yeah that you know is
they could get some continent or could
read the more moving parts you had the
more I get worried but Antony looks
really cool yeah can you make it come
down when the laptop is resting oh it
does it brings it just sort of like
apparently you see what happens I I've
actually haven't seen this it's like
this sport shocks Porsche Cayenne rising
he'll raise it up you get a little
clearance on your laptop there I don't
know if everybody wants rear ports but
maybe I'm wondering that's in the future
for something like a dock I'm just
guessing yeah but I you know some people
do like to tuck that so we have a nice
close up here it's totally not gonna do
that with that but that's one of the one
away not gonna be out until later in the
year
maybe with Windows 8 I don't know
obviously with whatever the current
generation at the time of Intel chips so
a lot of the ultrabooks that we're
seeing are things you won't be able to
get right away they're gonna like second
half of the year but not really a
specified release date and some of them
are right now which leads to Scott's
excellent point that you know which
altra books are the ultra books and and
what exactly do you find the define them
is I mean I think you've got the first
generation and I think you're also
seeing some of these laptops are a
continuation of that first generation
but it seems like by the end of the year
you're already gonna get that second
generation right so you're it's gonna
kind of be a bleeding edge and some of
the ones we're seeing here are kind of
like first gen plus and other ones or
second gen that everyone's not telling
the full details something that's coming
out soon but you know that ivory between
Windows 8 are coming right out of date
in six months yeah and yeah it's kind of
the days like February 8th and then some
of them are like towards the end of the
year and now Microsoft tried to mitigate
mitigate that a little bit at least if
they're keynote they sent all of these
devices that you see here are gonna be
upgradeable to Windows they would nobody
really right Intel though I felt like at
least in their press conference they
were helping nobody out they were just
like everything good is happening at the
end of 2012 maybe later
yeah if you trailer if you're Dell right
and you've got this coming out near the
HP you're thinking like thanks a lot
solution for you the problem is answered
just by one now and then also by one
later right they would like you to do
stuff you know are they're gonna
redesign some of the ultra books in the
future to be a little more touch
compliant gesture-based is that gonna
manifest and will change designs a
little bit touch ultra books yeah if
only we had one here had one right here
and this is probably one of the more
buzz about products of the show this is
the Lenovo IdeaPad yoga and of course
idea pad is Lenovo's consumer product
line and they actually do some really
interesting creative stuff there you may
be used to like think pants which are
very kind of button-down and sort of
businesslike but I really like the idea
pads and as you can see this guy's
already we're running Windows 8 right
and there's a kind of funny type system
that we have here looks like a laptop ok
and you know what we've seen convertible
laptops they turn into tablets the
screen swivels around and folds down
this guy you take the screen you fold it
bad
you keep folding you keep folding you
keep all is hard to watch right because
you just think you see that hinge
breaking but it's the first time you
open its ok and there it is right ok now
I've got myself into fruit and engine I
don't know how that happened but you can
hold it like this like a tablet and then
you if you're worried about the keyboard
when you fold it in the keyboard the
activates so you're not gonna hit any of
these by doing that you just get all the
on-screen stuff here give that a feel ok
that's heavy also so that's your
touchscreen that T I'm gonna no this is
too distracting I don't want to play but
that's not it can also do it can have
other configurations I don't know why
you would ever do this yeah yeah if you
have like a little like narrow edge of
your table you want to display like
photos or something I don't know
I'll nd I know exactly why recipes in
the kitchen yes or this kind of like
this mode this sort of what makes it
like an all-in-one where you can kind of
stand it up like that
that's nice to either of them yards for
you
keyboard and sort of set it up like that
that is very nice you're right yeah I
mean convertible laptops always come off
a bit gimmick you know although this one
definitely seems to have potential for a
variety of situations that center hinge
that rotates it's like a weak point so
here you just have to regular hinges so
it's not gonna wobble back and forth and
the thing that I think is probably the
most interesting sort of design element
is if you look right here there's a
little bit of a leathery cover here over
the palm rest it's just ever so slightly
higher than the keys so when you put it
down like this the keys don't actually
touch the surface they're not gonna get
scratched out they're not gonna get
scuffed and they're I can accidentally
get hit
this is another one of the ultra books
that's not gonna be out too later in the
year as you can tell it has Windows 8 on
it so we're gonna have to wait for that
but and how confident are you in this
one because we've seen some IdeaPad
issues this this feels awfully sad I
believe this I mean yeah this feels you
know very functional yeah those are
functional feels very real from looking
at it as far as whether this type of
idea takes off that's a question but it
seems like Windows 8 if it's ever going
to be a time to have that convertible
tablet laptop that we keep seeing I feel
like for years maybe Windows 8 and that
and that UI that's finally more touch
friendly like it's time to go we've been
testing in their viewing windows tablets
for years before the iPad came out and
nobody was ever really able to make them
work right now the windows interface
just wasn't built for it now with
Windows 8 at least I have the
possibility that they have kind of a
touch friendly interface that people
will be able to get into and the
hardware will work with now I am a
believer in touchscreen laptops and I
would be surprised if these ultrabooks
and Windows 8 ended up leapfrogging
Apple in that department what do you
think they're gonna do see a touchscreen
laptop coming from them anytime soon
that's a good point I don't know the
answer is continually no but the answer
has been no on them on many fronts for
products I am something a lot like iOS
or certainly can it feels like they're
moving in a direction where they could
get there they already had that
multi-touch interface and gesture
interface built in and they keep
experimenting I feel with bridging the
gap between that and the language of the
iPad they're different but I I feel like
it's it seems like it's on but we beyond
way to happen now my touch pads have
been training people to use gestures in
touch for years right and they just have
to take that indoctrination they've been
doing and transfer it up here I was
using a MacBook Pro a couple weeks ago
and I use my iPad a lot and I found
myself absent mindedly just reaching up
and trying to spoil my fingers I was
like wait a minute
that doesn't work like that my son does
it all the time he's you know he's super
attune to the iPad usage and every time
he comes to my laptop he just starts
pushing the but it that has become sort
of a natural human interface motion
especially with a small laptop you don't
have the gorilla arm problem right like
it's got a fuse at some point I mean it
just seems like iOS and OS 10 are
getting to that point maybe it's OS 11
you know is that juncture point and I
feel like Windows 8 is already seeing
that and see you know saying like let's
just start getting that fusion going
because the devices are gonna start
bleeding hi it's surprising that they
might get there first considering the
Apple push behind touch screens yeah so
it's interesting that we didn't plan it
this way but all the laptops on our
laptop talkshow are ultrabooks
and that shows you that I think this is
getting to be the super mainstream and I
think by the end of the year if your
laptop is not this thin you're just not
gonna be in the game you're gonna be
miserable is what you're gonna be like
why am I the only one here with a
backache you know we talked about the
most important trend among ultra books
which is the rise of the dusty pink
color that's clear an orange red rose
gold ultrabooks I noticed the ACE is so
predictable x20 Wyman they and I feel
like I'm Samsung Series nine has one
that's all bejeweled as well they have
but they also have that kind of yes Lee
that is very elegant I really like that
a lot and that's when they came out a
couple months ago it's never anything
new about it except for the color but
right that counts for a lot
Oh see that's like too far it looks
flesh colored there I don't like that
looks flesh colored yeah I look at their
skin under there I don't know it puts
the new flesh but the rose gold on the
back is really pretty I like that yeah
ooh I got better all right so this is an
existing product that has now been
renewed color if you will well these are
silver maybe that's the next step you
get all candy colored Ultrabook you know
our editor-in-chief Lindsay Turrentine
actually has been saying that that she
is hoping that we will actually see a
little bit more
on the floor that that's an area of
customizations a lot of conservatism is
a lot of you know right now people do it
with cases and black everything else is
like shades of gunmetal I know
Rosa is really standing out all right
guys thank you very much for the parade
of laptops we will of course be back
next year with another edition of the
laptop talk show and I'm pretty excited
stay right here though because coming up
Brian Cooley is taking the stage to talk
in depth with a buyer that is a big part
of this show that we often don't talk
about that that electronics buyers come
here to make long-term purchases for
their stores so we have one of those
buyers on stage I think it's going to be
a really interesting conversation a lot
of times we only frame CES in terms of
what the media is interested in but this
is going to be a great look at in fact
what what the other function basically
of CES the other function that show
floor that's coming up fitty cent is
gonna be on our stage at two o'clock and
then we're continuing the celebrity
parade with our women and tech panel at
five o'clock we have Marissa Meyer from
Google Padma warrior from Cisco and then
we also have Caterina fake who is the
co-founder of Flickr and a founder of
plunge it's going to be a jam-packed day
right here at the stage don't go
anywhere
either on the live stream or you know
keep your butt's on our comfy seats
we'll see a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
