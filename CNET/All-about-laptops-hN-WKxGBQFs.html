to Cena live at CES we're here on our
cnet stage in the South Hall right above
the starbucks if you're watching this
live on your phone somewhere in Vegas
get over here we have a great audience
out here and I'm very excited because
right now we have dan ackerman and scott
stein on stage for what we're now
calling the laptop okay the laptop talk
show are now annual our second daddy yes
our second annual laptop talk show and
the best thing about this is that the
drool factor on our stage right now is
extreme every kind of cool sexy gorgeous
ultrabook that you've been hearing about
being announced at the show in blog form
is here live on the stage you guys are
basically just going to run through them
and Sue and we'll see what sticks I feel
like that will just take that sort of
ultrabook approach right yes is a great
ultrabook showdown two laptops around
yeah this is yeah ultrabook shootout so
let's talk a little bit about that
category for the few people who don't
know there may be people watching at
home will haven't kind of I mean it's
actually slightly it's hard it's hard to
explain and getting harder to explain
right what an ultrabook is the
categories of blurred a bit so before it
was you know you it was like a macbook
air you know you've got the flash
storage it's thin 13-inch laptop and you
have 11 inches and now you're 14 and 15
inches and some of those have full hard
drives no longer SSD some of optical
drives some of graphics what's the
difference a lot of them are thinner and
sexier kind of cool they're gonna be
running those new processors later in
the year eventually time to Windows 8 so
so the revolution of laptops really the
real question for me is why ultrabooks
why do you think Intel decide because
Intel decided right let's great this
category let's give it a name let's
everybody get just behind a set of
general principles because you got to
create fads and the last kind of sad
that they were behind was sort of the
netbook we're gonna have those Intel
Atom netbooks those sold well for a
while but then they kind of tapered off
they got to come up with something else
and you know the term ultra doesn't
really mean anything it means like super
thin they could have made me come up
with something more descriptive but if
they can get a fan going behind it
everyone goes I want to MacBook Air but
I wanted to run Windows then everybody
gets behind it and makes aleinu you
can't buy a thick laptop anymore right
which is actually is actually I don't ya
know anybody who didn't get them
I have one manufacturer in mind but it
seems like you know we're seeing
announcements or at least promises from
almost anybody anyone who's not getting
the memo about some people are a little
later than others Adele for example has
their first ultrabook here this week
even though everyone else has had them
for a couple months now at least we're
getting into it seems like everyone has
got forward with something yeah I got a
deer hello or vista chino perfect i'm a
good as i was in their booth yesterday
thinking arby's laptop securely Reagan
square yeah so is it about design what's
the or what is the single most important
factor in terms of the the value
proposition for me the buyer what is it
that makes an ultrabook something I need
I think we're so spoiled by carrying
things that are thin and light and easy
to take with you to work to home to the
coffee shop I think that's the key
differentiator right that's the idea and
for maybe you want to look at price too
because one of the things that you
unless you're do something really super
cool and you're going to beat something
like the macbook air if you can get a
little under that price and off or
something where you say wife right 99
I'm beating it out on specs and there's
some like that I think it's another
thing to look to that was that was one
of the problems of the first ultrabook
so that they were 1299 1399 same times
the macbook air we've it a little bit
less but you can't make something that's
just about as good as a macbook air and
just about as extensive the thing for me
to that i think has the most promise for
consumers is the solid state drives I
think everyone has have that it's that
life-changing experience of realizing
that when you open your laptop lid it
wakes right up and you can start doing
things immediately I feel like when
people see that happen they realize that
it means you can just have a laptop
anywhere in the house open it up start
going I mean I think there's a huge
benefit while it's hot to make it more
reliable you have let's movie parts to
break down but Scott o is points out
that I like having a lot of storage and
maybe I'm old-fashioned but you know
sometimes you go to store a lot of stuff
so I appreciate the movement now that
you see a lot of these ultrabooks
they're going to the old fashioned
magnetic hard drives you're getting up
to 500 gigabytes maybe even a terabyte I
know it's maybe not waiting anymore so
waiting I Briggs a little bit SSD a
little faster starting but yeah if you
can if you can deal with the 128 or you
want to pay for the 256 but yeah a lot
of people can get a lot of stuff done on
those and keep things on how long is it
going to be before those solid state
drives start to come up and
at affordable prices wait like that
should be happening right good way to
get healthy years we're like a law about
that yes I know you working of Moore's
law now I know maybe I feel like next
year should be this year seems like 128
I'm hoping that next year will be maybe
a 256 and this year you can get a 128
for like seven ninety-nine one of these
13 years older books right that's a
pretty good price well and let's be
honest you can get like it an external
terabyte for oh sure 70 bucks these guys
you know or even know garage storage for
a hundred bucks for it terrifies the
heck of AI have been I've been okay with
that and my little backup exactly yeah
all right let's enough enough chatting
enough philosophizing let's get to the
polkas and stuff let's get to the gadget
porn all right what do we have we're
going to go kind of in order looks like
you've got three in scotts got 3 i'm
going to start a copy with the dell XPS
13 now del was of course a little late
to the Ultrabook party they took their
time but they've got a 13-inch system
right here that's part of that high-end
XPS live you know it's super thin it's
not quite as super fancy of some of the
other ones but that's because it sort of
meant to be that consumer business
hybrid crossover system where you can
get it and take it home but you can also
ask your IT department together because
they have an IT version with like a TPM
chip and other stuff like that and it's
got the rubberized bottom if you feel
bad that's kind of cool that's nice and
it's super thin and what I like is the
footprint it's a little bit smaller than
some of the other 13 inch ultrabook it's
closer to what you'd find a 12 inch
screen system in so so it's a little bit
it's a little bit more petite and still
super thick I gotta say too right off
the back I am really struck by the
similarity to the macbook air they're
just really they're not even pretending
not to be making a macbook air clone it
really looks like it and frankly I
consider that a plus I think everyone
stop pretending in the last couple Mike
attitude okay fine here it is I don't
want they did I mean it's you know it's
the perfect size of the perfect shape
get it done nice machine and then we
have something a little bit more
extravagant yeah now something that does
not look like a macbook air per se but
no better timing with all the gorilla
glass talked yes this is the HP envy
spectre 14 and it is covered in glasses
gorilla glass on the front it's on the
back also on the palm rest and on the
trackpad and it has a very iphone 4 type
look on that
side profile on the lid and its beauty
its heavier it's heavier it's thicker
it's heavy it's a 14 inch and so that's
the beginning of the blurring of the
line it's thinner than other envies
though and it has the Beats Audio in
that little audio analog wheel on the
side like on the new env revisions that
came out December and now nice screen
that back to the keyboard and it's
expensive this is one of those top end
ones is 1399 it's coming out februari 8
and so this is kind of in that beginning
to blur that line in the Ultrabook
category it looks sleek I mean I've
heard some people asked about the glass
what's going to happen if you are
confident having glance on the back of
your laptop later I don't know if
someone came out with a lance or
something like a sharp object but I mean
if you drop it that happens right he has
an exciting life home joust a lot of
jousting if I mean if I dropped it I be
worried but honestly if you dropped any
laptop there would be problems so I
didn't know I haven't gone through like
dropping laptops on the floor to find
out but I mean it feels nice and sturdy
and sleek and it's very different than
the HP photo 13 their other ultrabook
which is in that small business type
category it's kind of the no-nonsense
sensible one it's and it's also like 899
so it's right in that sort of you know a
lot of specs for your for your bang for
your buck category and this is that
sleeker kind of a design I think it's a
probably the single best looking laptop
I jigar this week that's really a very
beautiful correctly a lot of finger
prints are ready it comes with cotton
gloves there you go there you go it's
gonna support NFC tune we have don't run
action but yeah I know cool all right
that's beautiful you mentioned our
friends over at toshiba I did yeah it's
like I've already ready to buy just yet
this is a 14-inch ultrabook prototype
that they have so you'll see this later
in the year hopefully and hopefully
they'll look just like this and again
it's got the bigger screen it's still
pretty thin it's not as soon as those 13
inches but what they're trying to do is
they're trying to say we can take that
13 inch ultrabook give it a 14 inch
screen later almost leaves in 15 inch
screens and those become machines that
you can use it work all day a 13-inch
great for traveling rate for that you
know a couple hours of the coffee shop
airport lounge whatever but all day
every day you're not going to use a 13
you need a 14 or 15 so once you get up
to this size then you have something
that's almost a thin and light that
you can actually just use as your full
time machine and that's what ultrabooks
up until now I think Scott would agree
you have not been able to do I feel like
I'm skeptical of that though the idea
that you have to have a 14 or 15 inch
machine to work on because it adjustable
auditor and a keyboard oh then you got
to get like a docking station and plug
stuff in yes that's true I agree it's
clunky it's a clunkier solution but
it'll at least for me it allows me to
have a tiny laptop that is true I don't
know if it's I don't know necessarily
where it's going to slide am left to see
I think right now there's not also it
may be just go to everybody knows what
the macbook air is doing and it's just
as simple as that apple doesn't have a
type of product the moment that fits
into that category so go wait I don't
you know what is that exactly and there
definitely are people who want the
keyboard i think is it probably that is
hardly having nothing real at times yes
and that real this is a very toshiba
design sensibility that seems to be what
they you know you have the
differentiating Q's right the HP Envy
line Barry design centric machines
always have been really beautiful
toshiba it really does this brushed
aluminum we've seen that on some of
their tablets and some of their other
laptops and then of course dell just
looking like a macbook air now why is
one of the bigger ultrabooks and we also
have what I'm having smaller ultrabooks
right here to go in the complete
opposite direction yeah so the acer
aspire s5 which had made a lot of waves
and 11th one acer upped its game with
this this says I mean I feel like with
the samsung series 9 last year this is
kind of like inheriting that direction
as opposed to the s3 that was last year
that was a you know a little more in
that greyish silver not a sexy this is I
mean we're much more razor thin design
15 millimeters onyx black and it's got
that spit this is the sports car feature
of the show ok I love this watch this
this is the magic flip port or you press
the button here in it it's like a
spoiler that comes up automatically hops
up it reminds me of a DeLorean or
something and then you have access to
all the ports on the back including
Thunderbolt this is going to be one of
those next-gen ultrabooks so so does
that mean it seems like there's weird k
genus around Ivy Bridge right didn't you
say ok so it has thunderbolt which means
it must have Intel's Ivy Bridge right
and then what happens um nobody wants to
talk about it you say this is an Ivy
Bridge laptop right and they go
the chip we dare not speak its name
right it's so socially awkward they just
walk away but it's a clear interfere
it's a good thing I mean it's going i
think the more you have thunder bolt in
devices we talk about Thunder ball gun
on you know apple products and how many
peripherals you have but if it shows up
across a ton of laptops i think you'll
start seeing thunderbolt peripherals
that are kind of interesting yeah i love
this sort of the curve and very samsung
series 9 this kind of curved closure
there this is it feels good my only good
yeah this little motorized thing here
that's how they get it so thin by hiding
the ports and make a deal is another
mechanical part that you know is it they
could get some continent or if i did the
more moving parts you have the more I
get worried but enginee looks really
cool yeah can you make it come down when
the laptop is resting oh it does it
brings then it just sort of like
apparently ya see what happens i I've
actually haven't seen this it's like
this sport shocks porsche cayenne look
at that catalog little rising he'll
raise it up you get a little clearance
on your laptop there I don't know if
everybody wants rear ports but maybe I'm
wondering that's in the future for
something like a doc I'm just guessing
yeah but I you know some people do like
to tuck that stuff out of the net but we
have a nice close up here there you go
that's hot it's totally not going to do
that with that but that's one of the 10
way not going to be out until later in
the year maybe with Windows 8 I don't
know obviously with whatever the current
generation at the time of Intel chips so
a lot of the ultrabooks that we're
seeing are things won't be able to get
right away they're gonna like second
half of the year but not really a
specified release date and some of them
are right now which leads to scotts
excellent point that yeah which altra
books are the ultrabooks and and what
exactly do you find the define them as I
mean I think you've got the first
generation and I think you're also
seeing some of these laptops or a
continuation of that first generation
but it seems like by the end of the year
you're already going to get that second
generation right so you're it's going to
kind of be a bleeding edge and some of
the ones we're seeing here are kind of
like first gemplus and other ones or 2nd
gen that everyone's not telling the full
details something that's coming up soon
but you know that I verbiage in Windows
8 are coming baby out of date in six
months and that's kind of the day is
like februari eighth and then some of
them are like towards the end of the
year and now Microsoft tried to mitigate
mitigate that a little bit at least if
their keynote they sent all of these
devices that you see here are going to
be upgradeable to windows 8 would know
but
I know really right Intel though I felt
like at least in their press conference
they were helping nobody out they were
just like everything good is happening
at the end of 2012 maybe later yeah it
was a me a few trailer if your dell
right you've got this coming out near
the HP you're thinking like look thanks
a lot of attention for you the problem
is entered just buy one now and then
also buy one later you sleep in a bed of
money right hey you got it after they
were like you to do stuff you know are
they gonna redesign some of the
ultrabooks in the future to be a little
more touch compliant gesture-based is
that going to manifest and will change
designs a little bit right touch
ultrabooks yeah I'm engineered by the
idea what time if only we had one here
had one right here and this is probably
one of the more buzz about products of
the show this is the lenovo ideapad yoga
and of course ideapad is Lenovo's
consumer product line and they actually
do some really interesting creative
stuff there you may be used to like
think pants which are very kind of
button down and sort of business like
but i really like the idea pet and as
you can see this guy is already we're
running windows 8 right and this kind of
prototype system that we have here looks
like a laptop okay and you know what
we've seen convertible laptops that turn
into tablets the screen swivels around
and folds down this guy you take the
screen you fold it back you keep folding
you keep falling you keep falling hard
to watch right because you just think
you see that hinge breaking but it's the
first time you open it's like a and
there it is frags like like okay I've
got myself into fruit and engine I don't
know how that happened but you can hold
it like this like a tablet and then you
if you're worried about the keyboard
when you fold it in the keyword the
activates so you're not going to hit any
DS by doing that you just get all the
on-screen stuff here give that a feel
okay that's heavy also so that's your
touchscreen that t i'm going to know
this is too distracting I don't want to
play but that's not it can also do it
can have other configurations right
different way okay kind of cold light it
looks like the 10 I just think I don't
put like that I would know I don't know
why you would ever do this yeah if you
have like a little like narrow edge of
your table you want to display like
photos or something let us know I'll
Andy I know exactly why recipes in the
kitchen yes or this kind of like this
mode the sort of what makes it like an
all in one week a kind of stand it up
like that that's nice to either of those
look at yours for you
kitchen computer kind of expert ick
youth keyboard and sort of set it up
like that that is very nice you're right
yeah I mean convertible laptops always
come off a bit gimmicky although this
one definitely seems to have potential
for a variety of situations that center
hinge that rotates it like a weak point
so here you just have to regular hinges
so it's not going to wobble back and
forth and the thing that I think is
probably the most interesting sort of
design element is if you look right here
there's a little bit of a leathery cover
here over the palm rest so when you lay
it down it's not going to get it's just
ever so slightly higher than the keys
when you put it down like this the keys
don't actually touch the surface they're
not going to get scratched out they're
not going to get scuffed and then I can
accidentally get hit at Santa detail
this is another one of the ultra books
that's not going to be out to later in
the year as you can tell it has windows
8 on it so we're gonna have to wait for
that but I'm very excited by and how
confident are you in this one because
we've seen some ideapad ones i mean i
meant of issues this feels awfully sad i
believe this idea this feels you know
very functional yeah those are
functional feels very real from looking
at it as far as whether this type of
idea takes off that's a question but it
seems like Windows 8 if it's ever going
to be a time to have that convertible
tablet laptop that we keep seeing I feel
like for years maybe windows 8 and that
and that you I that's finally or touch
friendly like the time ago we've been
testing in their viewing windows tablets
for years before the ipad came out and
nobody was ever really able to make him
work right now the windows interface
just wasn't built for it now with
windows 8 at least have the possibility
that they have kind of a touch friendly
interface the key will be able to get
into and the hardware will work with now
I am a believer in touchscreen laptops
and I would be surprised if these
ultrabooks and windows 8 ended up
leapfrogging Apple in that department
what do you think they're good do see a
touchscreen laptop coming from them
anytime soon that is a good question i
don't know the answer is continually no
but the answer has been no on them on
many fronts for products i am something
a lot like iOS or certainly can it feels
like they're moving in a direction where
they could get there they already have
that multi-touch interface and gesture
interface built in and they keep
experimenting i feel with bridging the
gap between that and the language of the
ipad they're different but I I feel like
it's it seems like it's on but we be on
the
way to happen a lot of touch pads have
been training people to use gestures in
touch for years right and they just have
to take that indoctrination they've been
doing and transfer it up here I was
using a macbook pro a couple weeks ago
and I using my iPad a lot and I found
myself absentmindedly just reaching up
and trying to scroll down I do not like
fingers I'm like wait a minute that
doesn't work like that my son does it
all the time you know he's super attune
to the ipad usage and every time he
comes to my laptop you just starts
pushing the but it that has become sort
of a natural human interface motion
feeling especially with a small laptop
you don't have the gorilla arm problems
like it's got a fuse at some point I
mean it just seems like iOS and OS tenor
are getting to that point maybe it's OS
11 you know is that juncture point and I
feel like Windows 8 is already seeing
that and see you know saying like we'll
just start getting that fusion going
because the devices are going to start
bleeding hi it's surprising that they
might get there first considering the
Apple push behind touch screens yeah so
it's interesting that we didn't plan it
this way but all the laptops on our
laptop talk show our ultrabooks and that
shows you that I think this is getting
to be the super mainstream and I think
by the end of the year if your laptop is
not this thin you're just not going to
be in the game you're gonna be miserable
is what you're going to be like why am I
the only one here with a backache you
know we need to talk about the most
important trend among ultrabooks which
is the rise of the dusty pink color
that's clear round orange red rose gold
ultrabooks I noticed the ASA so
predictable x20 wyman they the NFL like
up samsung series 9 has one that's all
bejeweled as well they have a big
Jasmine but they also have that kind of
rose gold look which is yes Lee that is
jewelry elegant I really like that a lot
and that's when they came out a couple
months ago it's not really anything new
about it except for the color but right
that counts for a lot oh right now that
see that's like too far it looks flesh
colored there i don't like that looks
flesh colored yeah i looked at their
skin under there I don't know so bored
it puts the lotion on its skin long live
the new flesh but I thought their of the
rose gold on the back is really pretty I
like that I like that better all right
so this is an existing product that has
now been really good color if you will
well these are silver maybe that's the
next step you get all candy colored
ultrabooks you know our editor in chief
Lynn
Turrentine actually has been saying that
that she is hoping that we will actually
see a little bit more color on the floor
that that's an area of customizations a
lot of conservatism is a lot of you know
right now people do with cases if I got
but yeah these no but a one left and
black everything else is like shades of
gunmetal I know Roosevelt is really
standing out all right guys thank you
very much for the parade of laptops we
will of course be back next year with
another edition of the laptop talk show
and I'm pretty excited stay right here
though because coming up Brian Cooley is
taking the stage to talk in depth with a
buyer that is a big part of this show
that we often don't talk about that that
electronics buyers come here to make
long-term purchases for their stores so
we have one of those buyers on stage I
think is going to be a really
interesting conversation a lot of times
we only frame CES in terms of what the
media is interested in but this is going
to be a great look at in fact what what
the other function basically of CES the
other function that show floor that's
coming up fitty cent is going to be on
our stage at two o'clock and then we're
continuing the celebrity parade with our
women in tech panel at five o'clock we
have Marissa Meyer from google Padma
warrior from Cisco and then we also have
Katarina fake who is the co-founder of
Flickr and a founder of punch it's going
to be a jam-packed day right here at the
stage don't go anywhere either on the
live stream or you know keep your butts
on our comfy seats we'll see a little
bit
