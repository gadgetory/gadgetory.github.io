appliances here with the GE Profile
slide in gas range model number PGS 920
SE FSS so right off the bat you'll
notice that this model looks a lot more
premium than the mid-price models we've
been reviewing recently the most obvious
difference is its front control panel
that you see here I really like the way
this touchpad looks but it is really
really frustrating to use so some of
these buttons are really responsive some
of the other buttons actually have a
weird delay that I can't quite explain
so I might press the start button it'll
take 1 or 2 seconds to react and then it
will start a cooking cycle I find this
very very annoying mostly because you
can't tell if it's working properly half
the time a lot of the models we've been
testing in the 1500 to 2000 price range
have advanced features like bread proof
dehydrate defrost and favorite settings
this one which costs over a thousand
dollars more than a lot of those models
doesn't have any of those options in
fact the only advanced feature it has is
a thermometer probe with a related probe
mode so that you can cook any meat to
temperature and moving on to performance
it didn't do much better there either i
boiled a bunch of water I baked a ton of
biscuits I made a chicken and I broiled
a bunch of burgers and while some test
is better than others none of them
exceeded expectations it only did ok in
the large burner boil test even though
it has a higher BTU rating on the other
models we've reviewed so far and as far
as the small burner boil test goes it
actually did the worst out of any of the
gas models yet so if you're looking for
a model that looks nice but is more
well-rounded I would suggest samsung
nx500 5700 it's over $1,000 less and is
a lot better in general thanks so much
for watching this review of GE spgs 920
