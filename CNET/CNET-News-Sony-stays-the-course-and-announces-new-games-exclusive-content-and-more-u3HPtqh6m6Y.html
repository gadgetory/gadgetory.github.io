it's all about the games while there was
some exclusive announcements there was a
lot of talk about exclusive content on
multi-platform games I'll try and cut
through all that as I break down there
jam-packed press conference so while
everything we saw wasn't exclusively
available on PlayStation 4 a lot of
these games have exclusive early access
content for example you'll be able to
play an early beta of destiny and you'll
have access to exclusive content on far
cry 4 dead island to battlefield
hardline and other games
alright so here are the traditional
console exclusives sony showed off the
order
LittleBigPlanet 3 downloadable content
for infamous second son
bloodborne let it die
a game called ABS ooh and a whole slew
of independent gaming titles highlighted
by something called entwined which is
available right now the course is 9
unique lifetimes you'll have to bring
these characters together it was
interesting certainly used a lot of
fuzzy language like console debut and
exclusive debut not everything under
those terms are going to be available
only on PlayStation 4 for example grand
theft auto 5 while it's coming to
PlayStation 4 there's no mention of
exclusively being available to
PlayStation 4 so it's interesting why
Microsoft wouldn't bring that up we've
got to assume that's also going to come
to Xbox one as well nevertheless Sony
definitely made a compelling case why
you should own a ps4 while there's no
pricing just yet PlayStation now is
coming in beta in July and it will be
available on playstation 4 and have the
ability to stream a hundred ps3 games
sony also made some hardware
announcements PlayStation TV is coming
this fall for ninety nine dollars and
will let you stream ps4 games in your
home network as well as play all the
games on PlayStation now so those are
just some of the highlights from Sony's
jam pack III press conference keep it
here at cnet com for all the latest from
e3 2014 I'm Jeff Beck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
