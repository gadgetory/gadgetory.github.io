time listening to music whether you're a
vinyl collector or use services like
tidal it's worth buying a good set of
speakers thousand Wilkins 805 d3 are a
good set of speakers like really
freaking good yes they are expensive at
six thousand dollars us but they also
look the part
these figures are beautifully finished
in the UK and are so different from the
previous series that they might as well
be a whole new speaking the Bowers and
Wilkins attention to detail and sound
quality isn't for naught thousand
Wilkins 800 diamond series speakers are
used in studios around the world
including the former home of the Beatles
Abbey Road apart from the gorgeous wood
finish two things stand out about this
speaker firstly they feature the new
continuum driver instead of the yellow
Kevlar the brand is known for BMW
developed this driver in-house and it
consists of a woven fiber sandwich with
a foam core which is designed to enhance
stiffness and performance the second
standout is the diamond tweeter which
BMW grows specifically into a spherical
shape this tweet is responsible for the
really clean treble sound of the 805 d3
when paired with a good amplifier the
805 is capable of performance which is
unheard of even at this lofty price
dynamics detail and CinemaScope sized
vistas are what you can expect
whether you like punk rock or violin
concertos the BMW's will render them
with more detail than you've ever heard
before but never become nasty sounding
cheaper speakers can accentuate the
treble to imitate detail but also sound
terrible with the wrong music despite a
definite treble boost the BMWs are
otherwise neutral and forgiving speakers
they can make almost any music sound
good one thing the arrow files won't
really do is produce deep bass but what
basis there is punchy and fully formed
while these loudspeakers are definitely
an investment and will require dedicated
amplification they are so far above
anything else both cheaper and more
expensive that they have become our new
high-end benchmark CNET if you can
afford the BMW 805 d3s
they are highly and enthusiastically
recommend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
