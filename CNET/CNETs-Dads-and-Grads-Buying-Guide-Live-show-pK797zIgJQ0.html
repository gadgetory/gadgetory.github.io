of the show to receive something special
a bit of a surprise shall we say for
various legal reasons we can't tell you
what it is so you gotta hope it's not
crap but I can assure you it's not in
fact it might be something on this table
so watch the show carefully as the next
hour unfolds and you may be spotting
what you might win in that little
giveaway okay let's get to our actual
picks now in a really important category
this is gifts under $100 this is a real
sweet spot because you can give someone
a great gift without going broke and one
of the places where you got a start is a
great Bluetooth speaker here's a blue
Bluetooth speaker we like this one
because it sounds great first of all as
you can probably tell this is the JBL
flip floor it's a little hard to see but
at the end here are these little piston
subwoofers they give it a little bit of
physical drama when there's bass coming
out of this guy you see these go back
and forth so it's got some visual pop
and most importantly for summer it's
waterproof let's prove it right now it's
playing this is not some fake piece of
audio and I'm gonna dunk it in the
fishbowl as you can tell we haven't done
this before so let's see if it actually
works and we go wow thundering bass
through the fishbowl nice work by JBL
that is a waterproof thumping little
speaker and I Rick you've got one that
is a little different doesn't go
swimming with you I have another great
option here it's actually even a little
bit less money than that one and I just
want to show you the Box first because
it looks like it's already ready to gift
it doesn't even move doesn't even need
wrapping so this is the owl scroll which
comes from the good folks our good
friends at daily steals and it is as you
probably guessed by now kind of a tube
shaped speaker and stuck in the box
because because it's live there we go
and as you can see it's
beautifully wrapped in leather so it
looks really luxe and it'd be nice to
put on your desk on your table or
whatever and you just kind of peel back
that way and just sort of rest that way
so it's really kind of stylish looking
this kind of says dad to me but the
thing is though is that a smart speaker
it's smart buy bucks we have it
exclusively for it
for $65.99 with promo code cheap dad and
you'll find all the promo codes on the
product page on the giveaway page and at
cnet.com / - be excellent
now speaking of all things smart one of
the picks under $100 under $50 even is
the Google home mini now this does
pretty much everything that your regular
Google home does in a much smaller form
factor the only thing that you're really
missing out on is that 3.5 millimeter
auxiliary input but you can pair to
another speaker by a bluetooth so check
the weather ask for directions all of
that stuff plus some of the new features
that Google is constantly rolling out
including one of the fun ones which is
Google routines you can essentially set
a command to say hey Google good morning
and it will start a chain of things like
setting off maybe a coffee maker on your
smart plug or checking the weather then
getting into the ETA to work all sorts
of things like that if you give $39 now
but Google fluctuates with the price so
much it can be even cheaper but it's
usually about 39 to 40 dollars so it's a
great pick for under 50 first speaker
that is so hot because it's the least
expensive way to get someone into smart
speaker behavior which is still foreign
to a lot of people you know our people
do not use one of these yet they may
know about it but not use it and the
price is great and it's tied into Google
it's not like it's some you know fringe
thing this is the one that's been giving
Amazon and Apple fits because it's just
such a great device exactly and speaking
of Amazon if you want to get into the
Alexa ecosystem then maybe the Amazon
fire HD 8 is the tablet for you now this
one is actually on special now Amazon's
doing a bit of a deal for Father's Day
it's $80
you know it's sorry $60 actually it's a
regular $80 and
$20 off you got an 8-inch screen you've
got some great Dolby Atmos sound there
plus you have obviously if you're an
Amazon Prime subscriber you have all of
the benefits of all of those TV's movies
and so on and the big thing that a lot
of people forget about tablets is that
once you've got a tablet you're not
usually upgrading that often the good
thing about this one is that it has
micro SD storage so it's expandable so
you're not just stuck with the baseline
storage that you buy it for you can add
in micro SD card in and add all the
media that you want essentially yep
totally vital to have upgradable storage
in a tablet because it's not something
you're gonna upgrade very often these
things are great because they last
forever they're not like your phone
where you always replace it every year
or two you're gonna have yours for years
I'm guessing so make sure you can
upgrade it okay folks next up or as
we're getting rolling here laptops and
phones are getting right into the sweet
spot of what everybody wants headphones
going that category as well but first
we're going to mix things up a little
bit and give you a little retro sneak
peek back at how Father's Day looked in
1978 check this out
sunday is Father's Day and Jules got the
perfect way to let that know you care
plan his favorite meal featuring fine
foods from jewel like meaty tender beef
rump roast through Saturday it's only at
dollar 59 a pound and don't forget this
dad's day treat farm stand watermelon
through Saturday it's only 12 cents a
pound yes you can make dad feel like
king for a day with special help from
jewel
okay we're coming back to the scene
that's live dads and grads Gift Guide
and deals show clearly as we just saw
you always want to go safe and give dad
some kaopectate as well now let's talk
about some back to business stuff here
laptops great gifts for high school
grads especially they're heading off to
college we're having a computer it needs
to be a really good machine high power
very durable you know not necessarily a
starter laptop or a loaner Chromebook
anymore
I've got one of CNET's favorites here on
the windows side now this is a Lenovo
yoga 9 20 what we're looking at here is
obviously a Ultrabook in its first form
where you've got a fan and light laptop
really good build quality I mean I'm not
I'm not kidding here that hinge is like
a door hinge at your house you cannot
flex this thing watch it snap in half
just cuz I'm doing it right right right
now this is a portrait test now because
it's a yoga it does different things you
can flip it around like yay and now
you've got this tablet form factor so
this is it's a little bit of a horsie
tablet cuz it's got two panels but this
is nice on a plane when you've got one
of those crappy economy seats and no
room to open your machine conventionally
or the other yoga trick is this you go
into what's called 10th or card mode and
this is gonna give you the ability to
set up basically an easel which can also
soothe some different sorts of media
consumption creative use or screen
sharing modes this is a great machine
around 1,300 bucks depending on
configuration and the latest model has a
pin for input as well now if you're on
the window I've run the Mac side of
course the Apple MacBook the
straight-ahead MacBook is just a sweet
spot among their machines this is one
that is a 12 inch screen but they push
the monitor out so much it really takes
over the entire lid it's got this
dramatic look it has this rather
controversial still one USB C port is
it's only connectivity aside from power
and you're going to have to get a
breakout device I think which could be a
nice gift to include with it but this is
such an incredibly well built super
light high performance machine doesn't
have the very latest Intel processors
but it's got enough and man people look
at that and just say this is the coolest
gift I've ever received so that's a real
sweetheart right there
if you want to go the other way not
super thin and lights look at this new
guy from HP this is the NV 17 t touch
and as you can see it is a full-on
desktop replacement it is it replaced me
at this desktop
it's got banging olsen speakers it's got
an optical drive it's got some it's kind
of terabyte SSD inside it that's how
much horsepower that's all that's right
and so we are actually running an
exclusive with HP just for seeing that
users you can get 25% off any HP Envy
any pavilion a bunch of different SKUs
from HP 25% off anything that's priced
$1200 or above so you have a lot of
options there so go check out the latest
HP's okay and the cord for that one was
seen at 18 PC if you want to go check
that one out actually it has seen that
PC 18 okay now I'm going to switch gears
and talk about phones dads need them
grads practically live on them so if you
want the flagship phone right now you
have a couple of choices galaxy s 9 and
s 9 plus obviously the top-of-the-line
Samsung right now wireless charging
beautiful screens there too and the big
feature on the s9 and the s9 plus is of
that variable aperture camera so if
you're into photography or even if
you're not into photography that lens is
actually gonna change the aperture
between two settings it's kind of like
the iris in your eye it closes down and
opens up depending on the light and you
don't need to know anything about
photography to understand that it's
gonna just give you some much better
photos in low light but if you are a
photographer you've got some nice manual
controls there in the default app - so
that's the galaxy s 9 and s 9 plus also
if you have a spare thousand dollars
lying around because I know what we all
do the iPhone 10 obviously is the
flagship Apple device same sort of
things as the S
and s night plus wireless charging of
course that beautiful screen the dual
cameras you get all the sorts of effects
like portrait mode and so on and face ID
and face unlock with that biometric face
screening thanks to that front facing
camera and of course the notch I know
that that's a somewhat contentious and
I'm some people I don't really mind at
all they're not she's it is what it is
alternatively if that is too much money
for you and you still want a flagship
phone with the same sorts of performance
as you're getting out of the s9 and the
iPhone 10 the one plus six is also a
great buy this is uh we know around the
five hundred and thirty dollar mark very
similar kind of feature sets there we
have you know the dual cameras the
fingerprint sensor the beautiful edge to
edge screen of course the knotch to
there is facial unlock to it is not
quite the same level as it is on the
iPhone but it's still there for the
biometric enthusiasts out there and it's
it's a much better deal if you're
looking for all of that kind of
performance in a flagship handset
without the big-ticket item price so
speaking of all this we've got the
premium Apple phone the premium Samsung
phone and the premium Challenger phone
Rick deals on phones scare people
because they think they have to go
through an activation and a carrier
contract that's the old holdover logic
at least in the American market how do
you get a deal on a phone for someone
yeah so I'm happy to say these are not
cheapskate approved but it is actually
possible now to get a really solid phone
for a lot less in fact I would advise
people to look kind of at the latest
models from Motorola like their new g6
which I think comes in at around 300 or
maybe even less Amazon carries it and
they often run deals on it that is a
fairly powerful phone and you buy it
unlocked it worked its carrier agnostic
so it can work with with just about any
carrier and for literally a third of the
price of what you might pay for the
latest some Samsung or from Apple you
can get a really sweet phone so don't be
afraid so the two things for someone to
know about gifting a phone is unlocked
whether you understand it or not you
want it to be unlocked and secondly you
want it to have these two networks that
supports GSM and CDMA you just have to
remember those those three a queer
unlock gsm cdma if you do that like the
phone that Rick's talking about that
does all those things there's not going
to be a problem whoever you're gifting
it to whether they want to get new
service for it or use it on their
current plan it's going to work and
that's the key it's not as hard as it
basically looks and if you do need a
phone we also have the giveaway as well
yes we do
let's talk again about the iPhone eight
which we are giving away courtesy of us
mobile it comes with three months free
service and you can enter that giveaway
at cnet.com slash
the seventeenth excellent well let's
check in on the questions on SEANET live
the hashtag on Twitter we have a lot of
questions and we'd love to hear your
thoughts here so first one from Richard
what is the best sounding sub $50
Bluetooth speaker it's a tough one sub
fifty all right so this is my category
of course so if you can rich it if you
can scrape together another 16 bucks or
so the alley speaker that I mentioned
just a little while ago at 65 99 is
actually a really great choice but if
that's a little too high I would say
check out the cheapskate block which I
write daily at cnet-dot-com-slash-loaded
speaker deals there routinely some would
say too much and you'll find lots of
great options for $50 and lasts
sometimes a lot less we showed a few
minutes ago a little bit further out of
the price range at $80 but frankly that
is at the lower end as well along with
all of our top rated Bluetooth speakers
you can always find those on CNET
because that's how seen that's always
laid out you've always found a list of
best products in any category that we've
got and our best Bluetooth speakers for
2018 is no exception you can find a lot
of price ranges there as well so let's
grab another question this is from a
Chidambaram
I'm sorry if I didn't pronounce your
name correctly any deals or gift ideas
for a non tech friendly dad living
overseas so something like perhaps the
digital photo frame something like that
so you could deliver photos via Dropbox
or a service like that the last time I
I'm just not gonna not gonna go there I
know actually no we have something
coming up here very shortly that I think
would make a great overseas gift for a
dad so if we want to stay tuned we can
get to that and also be aware of things
that stream because you've got a lot of
different international roadblocks in
terms of content rights on any of the
streaming media devices music or video
to be honest but especially video may
not work if you were to ship it to them
you specially if it's a gray market
export you're shipping a US product to
someone so it'll work it uses the same
kind of power it may not have the rights
to pull the video absolutely and so Paul
a simple question Amazon firestick or
Roku stick that's the question but we
are going to be talking about all things
TVs streaming and so on coming up so
stay tuned for that yeah and we also
have a question for a best deal on dash
cams that I know you that answer later
stay tuned because sure yeah okay all
right so that's one of the smart picks
we've got coming up dash cams are so hot
sit tight for those and many other
things great favorite dads and grads
gifts all will also be including
headphones coming up in our next section
and you can spend a little or you can
spend a lot I know what Rick direct what
direction Rick wants to go I go the
other way so we're gonna see who's gonna
win that tug-of-war in the meantime
here's Oprah speaking to Jay School
graduates at USC a few weeks ago you
will become the new editorial
gatekeepers an ambitious army of truth
seekers who will arm yourselves with the
intelligence with the insight and the
facts necessary to strike down deceit to
take everything you've learned here and
use what you've learned to challenge the
left to challenge the right and the
center when you see something you say
something and you say it with the facts
and the reporting to back it up
okay
all right folks lots of commencement
speeches going on this time of year were
peppering those around just keep things
in the feel and the flavor of what's
going on as well as what's going on with
grads as well we have a few more
inspirational Clips coming up but first
we're talking headphones these inspire a
lot of people as well because they sound
great and they're really part of your
look these days right headphones are a
great go-to gift there's almost no one
is not going to use these whatever
you've got is gonna want to put out its
audio through a headphone so Lexi we've
got some pics start us off lots of pics
okay sorry for the Apple user in your
life obvious the obvious choice is the
Apple earpods
so if you do have an Apple device they
pair incredibly quickly thanks to that
w1 chip all you need to do is
essentially just bring it close to your
device and it will just bring up a
prompt and you pair it like so the call
quality is pretty good if you are using
it's kind of for that primary purpose as
a Bluetooth headset and you can control
with just a simple DoubleTap and also if
you're listening on something like Apple
music unfortunately Apple products that
seem to get the preference when it comes
to Apple products who would have thought
if you are using Apple music you can
pull one ear pod out and then
essentially it will just pause the music
put it back in and the airport starts to
play again and and the wireless charging
case that has been long thought of and
rumored should hopefully be coming soon
alongside with the Apple air power
charging pad so this will charge your
phone the airport's and also the Apple
watch that's coming soon but if you do
have Apple devices and these are the way
to go but they don't fit necessarily
very well in some people's ears and for
me I have strange you know strange
shaped ears and they don't seem to fit
that well so definitely do try before
you buy if you do have that problem the
other alternative is the Bose sound
sport free now this is the completely
wireless option to the both sound sport
Wireless they are those corded sports
headphones they sit really nicely in
your ear and you also do have the option
of getting different sized wingtips so
you can adjust it exactly now these do
closed in the sound a little bit more so
it's a little bit more enclosed and so
you get deeper bass generally all those
sound is very subjective I prefer the
sound of the Bose to the air pods and
they just give you that a little bit
more secure of a free
especially if you're being active
running around they're water resistant
the case is a little bit larger but the
downside is they do stick out of your
ears a little bit more so if you don't
want to be running around with something
very big in your ear and maybe no me not
the ones for you maybe try the airports
and but if you do want to go for an over
the ear headphone and you're looking for
noise cancelling as I know many people
are then you really have two options you
have the Sony's or the Bose QuietComfort
and this is can be kind of a tough call
to make
I really like the Sony's with the WH
1000 XM - it's kind of a bit of a
mouthful of a name to say I'm excellent
sound and isolation noise cancelling
they have really good battery life just
some ears I guess it can sound better
than the Burroughs our headphone guru
David Connor actually prefers the sound
of the Sony's to the Bose but the really
cool thing about these Sony's is that
they have a feature you know if you're
on a plane you know you do a lot of
traveling Brian and a flight attendant
comes up to you and asks if you want to
drink or whatever it might be and you do
that awkward lip-reading game you're
like I don't want to take the headphone
on so like it's a mad lib happening in
real time exactly exactly so these
ironies have a cool feature you can just
cup your hand to the right earphone and
then essentially it kind of turns off
the noise cancelling it pauses your
music and muscles it and then you can
actually have a bit of a conversation
without taking off the headset exactly
so that's pretty useful there for noise
canceling fans and I know it's like dad
my dad in particular loves noise
cancelling headphones yeah I'm going off
the off the script here the Jabra elite
65 T's have also been very much talked
about almost constantly in the same
breath with the air pods lately they're
a great alternative to those they kind
of come in a similar case they kinda
have a similar looked about a hundred
fifty bucks their car annoy loves those
as well this David Carr Noi sort of
measurement is one of the great ways to
know if you've got a great headphone or
not yeah and so if you'll excuse me I'm
out here for just a minute this is
obviously a deal that we're gonna be
talking about but I'm not gonna give you
the deal right now you're gonna have to
stick around and find out what that is
but I'm just gonna fly it because what
could possibly go wrong
that was totally live not pre-recorded
we're gonna get you a little purchase
and deal information on that coming up
that's a little teaser right there okay
next up dad's do-it grads do it I'm not
going there
gaming we got all our topics coming up
as well and more discounts from Rick but
first continuing our celebration of dads
here's an incredible one no that way why
would they change math math everything
is great
he's in excellent health is freaky
okay folks it's time to talk gaming and
game accessories this is a one of those
sort of Pam populist hits that is lots
of fun
some gives you a little more utilitarian
this is definitely not utilitarian we're
talking about total fun here some of the
greatest time wasters in the world that
everyone's gonna love on this man elects
a year a big gamer I am a non gamer
alright so there's lots of different
options for gamers out there I want to
talk about a couple different things at
all different price points for all
different sorts of gamers first up is
the Xbox one X Microsoft's flagship
console it's got the most powerful
graphics you can imagine it does HDR it
does 4k the thing is though with the
Xbox one X even if you don't have a 4k
TV it's gonna be down sampling so you
get the best possible image even if you
just have a regular 1080p screen and
also because it's III now there are a
lot of different games that have been
announced especially yesterday at
Microsoft's press conference so many
more games being announced exclusives
including Halo infinity sorry halo
infinite Gears of War
cuphead there's so many more games out
there for the console and it's now
actually a bit of a discounted price for
four hundred and fifty dollars and so
rumors have it that maybe the price will
drop even further just because Microsoft
dared to say that there is a new console
on the way but in a couple of years time
no time frame there anyway if you're not
a console gamer maybe you like kind of
an all-in-one headset and you like
virtual reality you want to get a bit of
a taste of it the oculus go now this is
Facebook's oculus it's their all-in-one
headset so previous you know VI headsets
like the gear VR you needed the phone to
slip in there this is all-in-one you
don't need the phone at all to run this
except for as the initial installation
and putting any extra apps on like so
it's actually pretty comfortable and
it's not very heavy if you're using it
for extended periods of time you have
all of the apps and the games on the
oculus store the field of view is pretty
good too and it doesn't get too hot it's
got some some integrated speakers that
kind of like give you that
all-encompassing sound it's actually
very impressive I put it on I thought
and the sounds not going to be very good
it's actually very decent you can also
plug in headphones too and it comes with
a little controller too obviously so you
can play it or your games on
navigate like that definitely if you get
the chance
try the rollercoaster in VR demo a that
comes with that yes it's a lot of fun I
really highly recommend okay and if
you're a retro gamer and you love your
retro games like me you grew up maybe
with your Nintendo consoles SNES classic
like you can't go past this look look
how adorable this is adorable everybody
you don't need cartridges anymore it
just comes with all the games built-in
Mario Kart
anyone who wants to take me on I will
definitely take you on I am the queen of
Mario Kart self-proclaimed Donkey Kong
Country Super Mario World a bunch of
different games plus the unreleased star
fox 2 game was never actually released
it was teased a lot at the time when the
SNES was actually out in the big forum
back in the 90s but you can actually
play it for real on this it's still
really hard to get your hands on though
I have to say still hard to find don't
have to find $80 so when you do see it
pick it up and you'll just have to just
get lucky hopefully and find it when it
does get a release although I do hear
the extra shipments are being made at
the end of June if you do find one it's
like wow where did you find one that's a
nice little extra punch for the game
absolutely and all things Nintendo as
well you can't go past the Nintendo
switch obviously this has kind of really
changed the way that we game on the go
it gives you the flexibility of plugging
into a TV but the most exciting thing is
that it has the the classic updates to
the Nintendo games if you are a Mario
fan Super Mario Odyssey if you want to
play Zelda this is the console for you
and you can plug into a TV a plug on the
go I play on the go the controllers

you so desire it's just a lot of fun to

the Senate Live hashtag don't forget if

surprise we will stay tuned for that
let's go to some of the questions from
David a low cost equivalent to the
airports that actually stay on my ears
you did mention this earlier the
Jaybirds that's a good alternative there
and they're probably around the same
price as a street price off of 170 list
so that's kind of the price point theory
this is this is a nice pair of earbuds
but a really strong alternative to air
pods absolutely and we have from Kathy
any drone deals for dad stay tuned you
want to stay tuned and from Jeff which
Roku stick is the best value for money
right now we're going to get into that
you know the Roku sticks are all pretty
good good value I think it's a solid
they're all pretty good value the 49 so
what's the $49 one I always forget the
name of that one but they change your
name for they do always change the names
and then they have the similar
functionalities and they're called
something similar except with an extra
feature on the end of the okay something
like that I think we're looking at the
Roku streaming stick that's the one
that's the one I recommend that one's a
really good valley there that's the
that's the sweet spot right now and pull
it up yeah $55 Street I think a $70 list
but you won't need to pay that and
recollect you're proud of me that's 4k
4k TV absolutely we'll keep your
questions coming on the same net live
hashtag let us
no and stay tuned for the surprise okay
we got smart-home coming up next this is
kind of fun because especially for a dad
gift because it's something that the
whole family can enjoy so we're gonna go
to CNET's smart-home in Kentucky in
Louisville for that but first continuing
our salute to 18 grads everywhere
here's actor chadwick boseman the Black
Panther himself back at his alma mater
back at Howard here's what he had to say
now this is your time the light of new
realization shines on you today
how his legacy is not wrapped up in the
money that you will make but the
challenges that you choose to confront
as you commit to your past press on with
pride and press on with purpose god
bless you I love you Howard
power forever
okay folks welcome back to CNET's dads
and grads live show we are here to give
you the best deals the best picks and
the best deals cuz the deal is no good
if it's not the right product we're
trying to go you thread the needle there
on what the best things are in each
category and give you some great prices
as well I'm Brian Cooley joined by Lexus
Vitas and CNET's deals guru The
Cheapskate himself Rick broidy here in
person quite a treat we're hoping to
find you the best tech products here now
speaking of great deals we want to thank
our sponsor Daley Steel's comm aka the
folks known for the squirrel not
entirely sure why but I'm glad they are
cuz the squirrel is really cool okay
next up is smart home CNET actually has
a smart home here in San Francisco it's
our newest smart home not our first we
have a smart home in Louisville Kentucky
we have a smart apartment right downtown
it's actually kiddy corner from the
Louisville Slugger Museum slash factory
so if you're in Louisville make sure you
check it out there and we want to get a
take from our smart home team from rich
brown and Andrew Gabbard here's what
they would recommend for you yeah hey
everyone I'm rich brown we're here in
the CNET smart home in Louisville
Kentucky I'm here with my colleague
Andrew Gebhardt hello and we've got a
whole assortment of appliances and smart
home gadgets we think would be good
gifts for dads and/or grads coming up
here so Andrew once you kick it off
what's this thing sitting next to you
it's an air fryer so if you like deep
fried snacks but maybe not all of the
negative health aspects of deep fried
snacks this thing is essentially like a
convection oven but it can sit on your
countertop and its really good for
quickly making stuff like mozzarella
sticks pizza rolls
so it'd be anything to have in a college
dorm room if you just graduated from
high school and your dorm would be
pretty popular if you were turning out
snacks like that for beds it's a good
fit for a basement bar and this one in
particular because it's 70 bucks and it
performs just as well as the ones that
cost you 300 bucks
all right on the other end of the price
scale we have this Breville precision
coffee maker so this is a $300 coffee
maker aimed really at the people who are
most passionate about coffee out there
what's great about this one it has a
nice big 12 cup reservoir but also it's
super precise in terms of the controls
for the for the water temperature as
the timing of the brew so you can take
pretty much any grounds throw it into
this thing and it will just make some of
the best coffee you've ever had all on
your countertop again it's 300 bucks so
someone has to really like coffee to
want this thing but this is the one that
we like best in terms of high-end right
now
all right so onto the smart home
products we have sort of an assortment
of devices here Andrew what is that
thing that's sitting right in front
either it's a doorbell you know it
specifically doorbell so this thing
hangs up on your doorframe
and they would hit this button just like
they would on a normal and you'd be able
to see their face on your phone and you
can talk to whoever's at your door
without getting up or if you're out and
about you can see who's at the door the
cool thing about this one so we've seen
lots of smart doorbells the other thing
about this one is that it has facial
recognition so if it's that annoying
neighbor again you will know and your
phone can give you that notification and
it'll even send an alert to if you have
a Google home smart speaker mm-hmm it'll
send an alert to the Google home smart
speaker so smart doorbell and it's a
good right in this cost I think just
over $200 so it's a little bit of an
investment all right in front we've got
these two little boxes these are all
basically the same product though this
is the Chamberlain Mike you garage door
opener so this is the product that is
actually the door opener you install it
onto an existing electric opener in your
garage and through your phone you can
use it to open and close the garage door
remotely you can also check garage door
status which is kind of handy at the end
of the day gonna make sure you close the
garage door this piece is a little bit
extra this one costs 80 this one cost 70
so this gets the device working with
homekit Apple's smart home platform so
with this thing you can actually use
Siri to control your garage door with
your voice this one supports Alexa and
Google assistant out of the box with
this you can use Siri so that's a nice
probably more aimed at a dad than a grad
unless maybe you're living in a garage
grad in investment in garage
just seems like a good opportunity good
you know but for a dad that seems like a
great weekend project and also has some
handy utility all right big guy in the
middle Andrew this is the source one
it's a smart speakers so and Amazon
echoes the smart speaker a Google home
is a smart speaker this does roughly the
same thing you can give it voice
commands and control your smart home
gadgets play music control your TV when
you're playing music this one sounds
great it sounds better than the Amazon
echo it sounds better than the Google
home and the cool thing about this one
is so the digital assistant in the echo
is named Alexa Alexa is built-in here
and the digital assistant in the Google
home is named Google assistant and
that's coming to this speaker as well so
you're gonna get the best of all the
different worlds and a smart speaker
that sounds really good and it's $200 so
it's more than the Google home and it's
more than the Amazon echo but it's
significantly less than the premium
smart speakers like the Google home Max
and the Apple home pod so a really nice
well-balanced smart speaker and I really
like it's smart speakers awaiting it
started in the smart home because it's
fun and it can do a whole bunch of stuff
yeah so right now this is arguably the
smart home speaker to beat all right we
also like for getting started in the
smart home smart plugs so this is one of
the better examples out there and what's
great about this one is it's cheap it's
only about thirty bucks
you're probably gonna find it for less
so this is tp-link Casa smart Wi-Fi plug
mini you get all that you get all that
it's kind of a mouthful so basically you
plug this into any outlet and then you
plug in and say a lamp or a desk fan in
there in here and all of a sudden you
can control that thing from your phone
this is nice because it works with Alexa
and Google assistant so you get those
voice controls in here and it has a
really good app so if you want to do
things like scheduling or getting it to
work in conjunction with other smart
home products if you want to say set a
scene of a whole bunch of devices to
work at once tp-link does a pretty good
job of making that easy to set up and
again it only cost 30 bucks and it's a
just sort of a pretty convenient device
to add some basic smarts to your house
all right so I think that's about all
we've got here in the smart home that we
think is good for a data grad and we'll
kick it back to you guys great thank you
thanks rich
they say I do great stuff there that by
the way is the scene that smart home in
Louisville pretty Lux right an
interesting sub point they were making
their about some of these devices you
know smart homes interesting because it
requires a lot of devices to really make
a home smart so when you're buying smart
home devices especially if there are
things that are multiples like outlets
or lightbulbs consider buying like a
three pack they're typically sold that
way by the manufacturer at a much
discounted price and that's nice because
otherwise if you give someone a smart
light bulb or a smart outlet it's like
oh great you got got me a shoe no these
come in pairs or in threes it's really
nice we then they can completely smart
apply at least one room in many cases
and you've got a nice deal because you
bought a package discount as well now
Rick's got some smart deals on smart
home I do in fact this thing has got dad
written all over it and I know because
I'm a dad and I'm the guy who's in
charge of the sprinklers my house and so
like when it's raining outside and I got
a run down in the middle of the night to
turn the sprinklers off no no no come on
let's smarten up that we smarten up the
home let's smarten up the yard and we're
gonna do that with the the Rocchi o3
which is a smart sprinkler controller
and as you might expect it pairs with
your phone and you can set it up with
all kinds of fancy timing but it's smart
enough to know based on the local
weather forecast it's raining and so
turn off the sprinklers don't water so
it's just you know simple thing but man
oh man is that useful and I'm gonna just
kind of put this in my bag I think I
have this right you have all the parts
we have on this desk that's the only one
that I have that's cool II approved I
had that exact unit and CNET editors buy
everything with their own money we don't
get any freebies we don't keep review
units it all has to go back someone we
have tech in our houses we spent our own
money to get it I'm a big fan of that
one it really works well it's Riddler's
it's stable which is one of the most
important things in a smart home smart
home that doesn't always work right is a
nightmare
this is rock-solid well I hate to ruin
this for you because the viewers are
gonna get this for less than what you
paid for it
oh no well you're here so I know that's
the key yeah so the Rochester is
normally 229 but you can get it for 179
and yeah bucks often I paid with code
Cena dad
I'll make sure I get that right seeing
that Dad fifty and there you go
smarten up your yard okay this guy's a
big boy here yeah II Kovacs d-bots 900
yeah look at that so first of all first
of all d-bots best name ever for a robot
yep and it's a smart vacuum cleaner so I
think for a grad who is moving maybe
into their first home or apartment or
whatever and is still a slob yeah a
vacuum cleaner that will automatically
just drive around and this is the thing
with me I was very anti robot vacuum
cleaners for a very long time and then I
inherited one and it changed my life
like I did not realize how useful this
was going to be until I actually had it
running around because you don't have to
worry about vacuuming you just let it go
you clean if you live in an apartment or
a small space it's an excellent
investment if you have a low pile carpet
yeah or if you have just a wooden floor
and just need to just get like crumbs
and dirt off the floor easily it's so
much better than having to pull out the
vacuum and you know throw your back out
that can use a boar I don't care what if
you have one of those battery-operated
cool Dyson sticks you still never use it
to walk around the house and get stuff
off the floor robot vacuums are so great
because it takes something that you had
to do and make some mix into something
you don't have to do anymore that's the
real gift of smart oh absolutely it's a
time saver it's a pain in the butt saver
it's a that's a vacuum you got a deal on
this yes I did so Eco packs actually has
a bunch of different models and this is
the their newest one so the important
feature to know about this one is that
you can actually program zones so that
it won't go into rooms where you don't
want it to go so you can set up cuddle
to keep some of your house dirty you can
set up virtual walls basically without
any kind of extra gear so normally this
guy is 399 but it's on sale for 329
through the well bots website and again
we'll have that link and code up on the
site so everybody can get that deal 329
pretty awesome that's actually great to
have that room exclusion all kidding
aside that's a great way to say don't go
to certain rooms then maybe your pets
use as their safe zone so they don't get
freaked out by this thing because
sometimes it will drive your pets nuts
when it's there when it's new in the
home
or they'll start writing it because they
love it you never know right but this
way you can tell you that yes and then
you be on YouTube you get your ten
million hits but this is nice to say
some rooms just stay out of so the dog
or cat can go there and no they're not
gonna have this thing following them
everywhere okay so there's one more here
the Y's cam yeah so Y scan was kind of
like the breakout story of smart home
gear from late 2017 their first model
was just a little guy which is called
the wise camp and it looked like this
cute little Pixar thing and what was
amazing about it it's a it's a smart
home camera it's a Wi-Fi camera streams
video to you on your phone or your
tablet so the new one is the wise camp
and what was remarkable about the
previous one it was 20 bucks 20 bucks
for a really capable very good smart
camera so this guy is the wise camp anis
you can see it looks a little more
traditional its taller and it can
actually pivot and it has a smart eye so
you can actually pan around the room
it's not just ya fixed so what what
would you pay for a camera like has that
electromechanical stuff to be a lot more
expensive because getting all those
little servos and the smarts to know
where to look is not trivial I'm gonna
say this is well you know well into the
three figures $30 what $30 yeah nobody
can believe it and you don't need a code
for that that is just the
come-as-you-are everybody gets this
price that's really cheap you don't have
to pay for shipping too but it's really
cheap anything motorized and it has all
the things I mean it has two way audio
it has a night vision it has alerts it
will crummy looking thing it actually
looks nice and clean and kind of a
squared cylinder that's an amazing price
for any kind of a network camera that
actually has the ability to pan and tilt
or to tilt and pan and look around like
that that's impressive I didn't know
about that one okay wow we got a lot in
smart home there I hope those are some
good ideas for you I know a lot of this
at category is still new to a lot of
people we have a lot more coming
including TVs and streaming devices to
connect to the data grads existing TV
but first let's go back in time again
another retro dad ad for a little bit of
fun we'll be back right after this yes
the kitchen for a snack without waking
you have to press Daddy's alarm clock
really wake up that's great don't wake
dad he hit the wild turkey hard last
night that's so cool
anyway we're back with the live dads and
grads gift show that's a mouthful right
there it's coulis with Lexi Sabinas and
the sea net cheapskate himself Rick
beretta imported directly from Michigan
I think I stole a Chrysler tagline right
there so I have to pay the rights okay
so next up now TVs and streaming devices
let's talk about these uh I'm a big Roku
guy as are a whole lot of people out
there as are the scene that editors
generally it tends to be our highest
rated device over time the Roku
streaming stick plus is great because
Roku is at least at at this point in
history they've remained pretty agnostic
they bring everybody into their platform
their interface is outstanding now
they're starting to become a little more
of a channel aggregator and they may
start to compete in a more competitive
way with Amazon and Apple and say no we
do this and you don't but they've tended
to be wide open which is what you want
in a streaming device you want
everything to be available there and
let's see the price on that guy that we
just took that one up it was a $54.99 is
the best price we see on our site right
now off of I think a $70 MSRP it's a
good price and if you want Roku
technology and believe me you do
consider getting it in a TV this is a
relatively new trend in the last two
years but it really heated up in the
last year since CES in January the TCL s
305 is a Roku TV so it's a nice flat
panel TV of 32 to 49 inches varying
prices of course but it's got the Roku
tech built in there is nothing else to
add to it now you may not know TCL or
Hisense I believes the other brain
right now that's offering TVs with
built-in roku technology it's super
slick it's fully integrated there's no
other thing to deal with so if you're
buying a TV I would recommend looking at
one of the manufacturers who make Roku
TV is like TCL or if you're giving a
gift to someone who's got a great TV
give them a Roku stick to to go in there
as well and of course the amazon firetv
cube is new this is I don't think even
available for shipping until later this
month but this is the latest thing from
Amazon that is going to combine the
streaming of a fire TV stick with the
smart home integration technology and
Alexa built in so if you want to have
streaming and smart home put into one
place which frankly are usually
different constituencies here you get it
blended together in a really smart way I
think that's a definite one to look at
but know that it's not ready until later
in June depending when you're watching
this particular show it's great for
grads because if you're in a dorm room
or a situation where you have a Wi-Fi
network that you need to add another
layer of authentication to like I mean
you need to face essentially like that
you can do that with the Roku sticks
really easily there's a special setup
mode so you don't need to worry about
being on a home Wi-Fi network where
essentially what you need to do is enter
the password if you do need to make that
second layer of authentication it's
actually really useful for grads there
and I'm just checking out I'm checking
on though June 21 by the way is the date
of ship if I have it right or order
fulfillment for the Amazon TV cube we
have some questions coming out on the
Twitter so yes we have lots of different
questions first up we have a smart power
tool recommendation for dads that love
woodworking or a handyman what can you
suggest I know this is an area of your
incredibly interesting we don't
necessarily have a lot of specific
reviews on here but I'm a big fan of
this thermal pocket camera normally
thermal cameras are something you find
and like you know war war machinery and
aircraft and that kind of thing this is
a FLIR c2 it is a little tiny camera as
you can see it's kind of the size of a
small smartphone and it's gonna be as
you see 449 I'm finding it in the mid to
high 300s
if you shop discount on the street what
this is it allows you to look at
different things in the home and tell if
there's hot or cold going on it's a
great way to find our trace
certain pipes if it's a cold or hot
water pipe or to see where you might
have a leak or where you might have
something going on with a broken part of
an appliance if you've got a dad or a
grad who's really into fixing things
around the house I guarantee you they
don't have this and they would like to
have it now it's not cheap but it's a
really cool serious piece of gear if you
want something's gonna be a little more
inexpensive I mean really inexpensive
but on the more visual side as well like
that look at any number of these and
there's a lot of money Amazon in
different places this is a flexible
camera at the end of a long conduit with
a little tiny camera at the tip of it
and you hook it up to any smartphone
that's the key here on Android phone and
Apple phone what have you you hook this
up you run a piece of free downloadable
software and which is the viewer and now
you have this long snake cam that is
live showing you what's at the other end
of it and 16 feet long I mean you can
check out almost any pipe in there you
can do your own colonoscopy - no I
didn't recommend that don't tweet that
and what is this thing
$20 I've got a couple of these the image
quality is okay it's not fantastic but
it's super handy when you're trying to
look under an engine for a lost part
this is a way to snake down there down a
wall to see if you're about to drill
into something this is this is really
cool and dirt cheap Jamie how long did
it take you Rick to fly that drone and
learn how to fly it because you did a
really good job so it's nice what a
compliment they're not a question well
really just how long I took you to fly
that excellent okay and we have what is
the best point-and-shoot camera on a
budget from Isaac this is a tough one
yeah okay he's my recommendation so if
you're not gonna be using your phone I
highly recommend that you pick up a
either an older model really good
all-in-one point-and-shoot that it's
kind of got more manual features
something like a Sony rx1 so there's a
one inch sensor it's gone through a
number of iterations I think they're up
to like version six now or something so
you should be able to find one of the
earlier generations fairly cheaply so
this is great because you can just use
it in automatic mode and just use it as
a point-and-shoot if you want but if you
do want to step up and get a little bit
more flexible with your photography it
has the full manual controls it's got
video recording and so on so it's gonna
be a really good image quality if you
find an older generation that's my
advice don't go and buy like that cheap
you know
for $40 Casio that you get at your
duty-free or something don't get that
got a good one but in older generation I
totally agree cuz a few years ago they
made really great pocket cameras there's
been less of an emphasis lately so
either an older model it's still made
now or older model that may not be made
now and go find the thing on eBay okay
Wow still to come we've got a lot of
great stuff coming up my picks in the
automotive category both cars and
accessories it isn't strictly gonna be
top dollar stuff and Lexi's gonna have
some wearable tech gifts coming up for
us as well and more deals from Rick
around all these areas but first we
salute all those fathers or father
figures like rocket in guardians of the
galaxy to now a peek back what I just
said that's the button will kill
everyone try again nobody has any tape
not a single person has paid you have an
atomic bomb in your bag if anybody's
gonna
that's a really bad sign
okay so a lot of things we're talking
about here are dads and grads we try to
segment it for dad or grad it's kind of
a natural way to go here and our dads
and grads gift guide show this year but
there are some that are totally
universal and wearables are one of them
dads and grads and mom and siblings
everybody should have an appetite for
knowing more about how they are doing
how they're thriving how active they are
you've got some pics Lexi absolutely and
on that note the ones that I'm going to
talk about are all good at that but
they're also just good as just regular
smartwatches if you just really use
something as something to get
notifications or find out if you missed
a message all of these can do that first
up is obviously if you're in the Apple
ecosystem it's kind of awkward to hold
it up and when you're wearing it but
this is the Apple watch series 3 with
cellular built in obviously does all of
the fitness tracking that you would
expect it has built-in LTE and so you if
you want to be out and leave your phone
behind say for example when you go on a
run you can do that you can stream music
on the go you can also make calls if you
find yourself say you get to the end of
a round like me and you're kind of too
tired to run all the way back home maybe
you could load up an app and get a card
to take you home so that's the sort of
thing you can do with that watch o s5
which was just announced last week at
WWDC as well it's going to give a lot
more of the fitness tracking features be
able to track different types of fitness
workouts like yoga and so on and it's
also going to be able to automatically
detect when you start a workout which
sometimes you know you're really in the
zone you're going for a great workout a
great run and you go half way through I
forgot to start my watch and so it's
gonna actually just be able to
automatically track that and turn it on
so that's great if you're looking for
something outside of the Apple ecosystem
maybe you have an iPhone but you don't
want an Apple watch or you have an
Android phone of course something like
the Fitbit Versa is is a great pick
there you're going to be able to get a
lot of the same sort of functionality in
terms of workout tracking and so on the
one thing is you don't get GPS in this
guy so if you do want to actually go and
track your runs and things like that
you're going to have to take your phone
with you otherwise it uses your stride
length in order to determine kind of
like your route and things like that to
kind of give you an idea of how you're
progressing but what I do love about the
Versa
is that it has this really cool coach
feature so it's like workouts without
needing to actually have another screen
you can just go hey I'm gonna follow the
workout and it's gonna guide you through
step by step dude tents are Jung's do
the 15 push-ups things like that so it's
a great tool to have on your wrists
without needing to bring say your phone
to the gym or wherever you're gonna be
more than that yeah exactly shoot and
battery life this is the one to get if
you want four days of battery life great
absolutely exactly and but if you are
someone who likes the more traditional
watch face look so a circle rather than
a square which I know a lot of people do
then the Garmin vivo
is one to consider it looks like a watch
it has an LED panel so essentially it's
gonna give you notifications and but it
just turns off and just looks like a
regular analog watch which is really
good if you just want to kind of be a
little bit more incognito you get those
traditional features like heartrate
obviously that HR and the name gives you
a hint
sleep tracking step count works on
Android and iOS is water-resistant to up
to 50 meters and it gives you
notifications too so if you do want to
use it as a SmartWatch it's got
everything you need right there in one
unit so that's another option if you
want to be a bit more platform agnostic
too yes Wow some good choices there and
this is an area that as you mentioned
we're seeing a lot of cannibalization or
you could call it merging of the fitness
role and the communications a
notification role a lot of its coming
together in one place so increasingly
people are thinking watch when they
think fitness but there are still a
number of great fitness bands out there
as well Rick what do you got for deals
yeah so I had to stop myself from
laughing when you said it has a four day
battery because I'm gonna say hi to your
four day battery I want to talk about
the Amaze Fitbit and this comes from a
Chinese company called John John me I
hope I'm saying that right and the Amaze
Fitbit is amazing because it packs it
looks a lot like an Apple watch as you
can see and it has a lot of the same
features but it's also kind of got some
pebble features as well so it has GPS it
has a heart rate monitor
it has Fitness speed
of course it does notifications all that
good stuff is has an always-on color
screen it's really and actually on let's
let's be honest it doesn't look quite
that bright I'll take a little sticker
off but it's really it's really a
stylish little watch kind of looks like
like my Apple watch a little thinner a
little lighter I'm real close the
lawyers on this but would you like to
take a stab at what the battery life is
on this guy
well I'm blown away by four days okay
from there on yeah so the battery is
actually good for up to thirty days
charge okay and now real-world use I've
used it myself more like twenty to
twenty five depending on the features
you use if you use the GPS if you get a
lot of notifications yeah it's gonna be
a little lower but if you can get three
weeks out of your watch yeah so that is
pretty good and that's actually one of
my favorite products of this year yeah
because it's such an amazing deal at a
hundred dollars but you don't have to
pay a hundred dollars no sir with the
amazement website and use promo code
cheapskate this baby is seventy bucks
that's amazing now if that's too much
okay you're looking for a gift for Dad
for your grad you just can't quite swing
the the seventy bucks let's talk about
the jarv
run fit pro which is obviously styled a
little bit more like a traditional
fitness tracker this guy does heart rate
monitoring and even blood pressure if
you can believe that plus it'll do
notifications and all the other fitness
II kind of things as well and I don't
quite recall what the battery life is on
this guy but I can tell you it's forty
to forty bucks which is already a killer
deal but is part of our show if you put
in the code that you can see on your
screen and find on the website it's only
thirty bucks so for a full-blown fitness
tracker with heartrate and all of it for
thirty bucks come on and that's good
because you can't lose at that price and
this is a good proviso if you're gonna
give one of these know that the
abandonment rate on fitness bands can be
rather high people either love them or
they don't they don't know until they
try them so this is a really great place
to use Rick's deal to get one that's a
nice looking product they'll never know
you paid thirty bucks for I believe I'm
looking at it right now and yet if they
don't use it forever and put it in a
desk drawer after a few months you're
not gonna like why I wasted so much
money thank you very great great picks
there now we've got
last category coming up and it's a big
one literally and financially cars and
car accessories don't get apoplectic yet
I've got a lot to say about some car
picks and Rick's got some great new
deals as well plus the coupon code for
the Star Wars drones but first here's a
clip from NYU's recent commencement we
can see it all around us there's a
peculiar fascination with dystopia in
our culture today you see it everywhere
on film and TV but the truth is that
unbalanced we have the good fortune to
live in a time of tremendous possibility
and potential a time when it is within
our grasp to eliminate extreme poverty
to end terrible diseases like malaria
and TB and to offer a real chance at an
education to everyone on this planet
okay folks time to hyperventilate as we
talk about our dads and grads gift guide
show Brian Cooley Lexi savita's and Rick
Brewer to the CNET cheapskate
hyperventilate cause here where we
actually say with a straight face
consider giving a car and people go okay
yeah okay money boy we're gonna get
people a car I think of dad a car I
regret a car well now think this through
because the way you can do financing and
Leasing today especially if you're
looking at a grad who you want to have a
safe car with the latest safety and
driver assist technologies and then
maybe you seller to get away from the
lease after their period away at school
it might not be as luxe as it sounds so
here are two picks out of many it's very
hard to tell you what kind of car you
want to get somebody but two that are
sort of odds on go twos include the
Mazda mx-5 known as the Miata the
current version is just a home run we
absolutely love this guy in either soft
top form or it's also got the RF model
which has a hard top but this is such a
sweetie you want to check out our video
on this we have so much fun whenever a
Miata comes in you can get into these
for as little as twenty seven thousand
dollars which is again a lot of money I
get it but if you do want to nose around
this idea you will get a grin from ear
to ear on that grads face and it won't
go away immediately it's gonna last for
years because this car is fun every day
you drive it the other total home run I
want to mention here would be a Jeep the
Jeep Wrangler this is the other sort of
hottest car in the world right now under
$50,000 it's just a total cultural
phenomenon a Jeep Wrangler you can get
into for the for the mid-20s and here
you're looking at a vehicle that of
course has incredible off-road ability
but it's also got this great social
status and style trend this is just one
of those things it's almost like part of
the social zeitgeist right now again
both these cars in the in the high 20s
base and modern vehicles with great
technology great safety systems in them
and of course dead reliable which you're
not always gonna get even with the most
well-researched $5,000 well-preserved
beater on Craigslist you just got to be
wary of those so learning a lot here
live on the show some I didn't want to
happen in public but it's good to know
all right let's
about some accessories yes you talked
about safety and I think you know one of
the hot categories right now is dash
cams which is actually a great safety
feature so you can keep tabs on what's
happening in front of you and in some
cases behind you so the model I have
here is the van true and 2 pro and as
you can see it's not only a front-facing
dashcam but also a rear-facing one so it
has two cameras you get to record
everything that's going on in front and
then of course your carpool karaoke
sessions you can record those as well
it's got all the bells and whistles
it'll do everything that a dashcam can
do and then some and it's very compact
and it just mounts up on your dash very
nicely yeah normally this guy is 200
bucks which is what you pay for a
high-end dash cam as part of our show
today with promo code
CNET show you can get this for 140 so we
just did a video on dash cams and that
was one of our favorites because it has
that really high-res going in both
directions at once it'll do 1080p both
ways at once in the car and looking
forward and this is just a really nicely
designed one and if that's a little too
rich for your blood there are lower and
less expensive dash cams like this one
from Aki this is the dr0 one and as you
can see it's very small it's very simple
to use you just mount it up on your dash
and it'll automatically start recording
and it just gives you the basic features
that you want from a dash cam but it's
starting prices 58 bucks and you can get
it for forty seven dollars with code
CNET for dad and that's the number four
so you have a lot of options when it
comes to dash cams and this is a
particularly great deal on one so we
remember just in case you're not clear
on the dash cam idea this is a camera
that looks outside your windshield and
records all the time it's just that
simple so whatever happens you don't
have to say gee I wish I was recording
it was recording and the number of hours
or days it can record is based on how
big a card you put inside of it so
always if you gift one of these make
sure it has a card and if not buying a
card to go with it make that the whole
kit so your recipient can use it right
away and get a big card they're so cheap
these days that way they can get a
number of days before it starts to
rewrite video yeah great points so next
I want to talk about a safety item that
really every driver
have yeah so this is from Gullu and this
is a this is a portable jump starter so
if you people don't believe it when they
see it that that can start a car
oh absolutely so if you're like me you
live in Michigan someplace where the
winters are bad you don't want to wake
up to a strand you know be stranded
somewhere with the dead battery so keep
this guy in the car it comes in a nice
little zippered case and it will
jumpstart your engine for you it even
has a USB port so that you can
jump-start your dead phone it's all it's
all that matters to you more in life so
if you have to call a tow truck at least
you can so normally this guy is 70 bucks
but we have a promo code that will get
it for you for forty five forty nine so
again it's just it's a quotation so
smart dad a grad a mom I drop out
anybody I definitely recommend every
driver have one of these if you've got a
dad who drives the Porsche let me tell
you this is a particularly good gift
because a lot of Porsches have the
battery in the front and they also have
a power trunk release so when the
battery dies and you go to get to the
battery to charge it you can't because
electricity is not there to open the
trunk to get to the battery and it's
just crazy catch-22 have one having one
of these somewhere other than the front
trunk where the battery is allows you to
then jumpstart the hood to then jump
start the car is the Porsche thing and
believe me Porsche owners could really
appreciate that so if you got a
well-heeled dad on your list you just
talking about of buying a Porsche
it's a weird little Achilles yeah so for
the tinkerer the guy who likes to get
under the hood or the or the gal or
anybody who likes to get under the hood
we have this Foxwell ODB am I gonna get
it right Oh blue beanie dude whoo
scanner which plugs into that mysterious
port underneath your dashboard and it
has a color screen and it will basically
give you all kinds of Diagnostics about
your car so if there's a check engine
light you want to know what's going on
or you want to get that light turned off
this is how you can do that and this one
again it's made by Fox well it is
normally $44
so a great gift item at that price for
anybody who likes to tinker yeah whoever
it may be in the family and those are
neat because you can also tell what's
going on with your car in more detail
before you take it in to get it fixed as
well as clear
in codes to make sure the code really
does come back sometimes during a code
maybe all you need to do is it happens
it's been known to happen
and we have a lot of videos that that I
have done on how to use obd2 readers at
least a couple of them out there are
this so you can find those if you just
go on CNET search obd2 they'll pop right
up and you can get some tips on how to
get the most out of these the last one
is the one that everybody can use yeah
so I'm on a crusade here I want the
every a car owner and phone owner to
have some kind of a car mount for their
phone because when your phone is down by
your in your lap or in the cupholder or
whatever you're taking your eyes off the
road even if it's just for a second and
that's no good your car needs to be up
and your phone needs to be up near eye
level so you can just glance at it if a
notification comes in you're changing
your music or whatever so there are many
different kinds of mounts available but
one I have to share with you today as
far as the deal goes is the jar of
premium Universal flexible air vent
mount and it goes inside your air vents
and then it gives you a universal cradle
that works with just about any phone
okay it's normally twelve bucks I think
we have it for seven seventy seven with
the coating is more yeah it's crazy
cheap and well if it's not this mount
than another somebody gets your phone up
at eye level please please please be
safe and the key thing about these vent
mount città becoming very popular of
late and some of them are magnetic some
are friction like this a lot of ways to
do it is when you're on the vent you're
especially safe because the vents tend
to be high but not up on the windshield
with a suction mount which in many
states a lot of folks don't remember is
illegal and you're also kind of going
against the grain here because you're
blocking some of your view where the
device is supposed to make driving safer
so getting away from the windshield
suction mount is kind of a good idea but
keeping it high with a vent mount like
Rick says it's a great way to split the
difference and do everything right and
not take any sort of steps backwards
okay Rick it's time for the big reveal
on the Star Wars drone deal we love you
fly this thing with exceptional skill
yeah I just want to keep flying it I
don't want to talk about the deal let me
just have my fun with this thing so yeah
the propel Star Wars battle quads you
know they debuted last year they were a
hundred and eighty bucks apiece there's
three different models there's the TIE
fighter which I this is Darth Vader's
TIE fighter and there's an x-wing and
then there's the speeder bike from
the Jedi of course and these are just
great fun drones but like I said they
were a hundred eighty bucks apiece it's
like only the most affluent

180 bucks apiece barely a year ago the

be C NSW 2018 but wait there's more if
