cnet.com today we're going to take a
look at the Lenovo idea center B 320 so
this is a 950 dollar 21 and a half inch
all-in-one it has a touchscreen there's
also a few basic touch applications
lenovo has this suite here with us you
navigate through music and other content
as well as a few other kind of minor
touch apps they're not really
fundamental to how you use this PC
though essentially the system is
designed for basic performance and a
little bit of media consumption it's
actually one of the faster sub
thousand-dollar all in ones we've seen
thanks to its core i5 CPU competitively
speaking there are other long ones out
there that have larger displays for the
same price there's also a one HP system
in particular the Omni 220 that has a 23
inch screen a blu-ray drive and even
faster performance for only about $50
more that makes the system kind of hard
to recommend the touchscreen is one
thing and probably the one other feature
that we really like is the 2 terabyte
hard drive those are hard to find at
this price and that actually is sort of
a selling point if you're a meteor
hoarder otherwise need a lot of storage
otherwise though this PC is pretty
unremarkable it has a DVD player not
blu-ray not really interesting
connectivity and there's nothing really
else special about it
so you see here on its left side it's
got a couple USB ports on an SD card
reader so those basic analog audio outs
and on the back you'll find a couple
more USB ports Ethernet and a TV tuner
that's I guess kind of interesting and
really that's about it we would like to
see USB 3 or HDMI input would be even
better but unfortunately lenovo has gone
with kind of a pared down approach for
this PC that kind of makes it hard to
recommend so it has pretty good
performance the real selling point for
this PC is is large 2 terabyte hard
drive if you really need that storage
this is probably a decent purchase
otherwise you can find a more
competitive on one out there for about
the same price
sorry much Brown this is the lenovo idea
