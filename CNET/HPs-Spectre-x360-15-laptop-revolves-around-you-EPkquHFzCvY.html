15 the company's general purpose premium
convertible laptop doesn't get a
complete design overhaul like the 2016
model did but the company is streamlined
the design concentrating on the premium
aspect of it and of course brought its
insides up to date the x360 nails it as
a jack-of-all-trades it performs well
and silently for its class about the
same as the rest of Spectre line movies
and TV look really nice and the Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen certified audio system sounds
full-bodied with good surround the
keyboard lets me pound on it and the
glass trackpad feels big and comfy and
at 360 s pretty well with sufficient
tension in the hinge to prop it up in
the gymnastic fashion of a hybrid this
year's model only comes in the swankier
Brown and copper version and only a 4k
uhd display like every one HP has
reduced the bezel width and that allowed
the company to shave about 20
millimeters off the systems with
keyboard was also redesigned with square
keys and less of a well around it I
think it looks a lot classier it has a
bigger more powerful battery to keep the
4k display from killing it and it lasted
almost 10 hours on our streaming video
test significantly better than the
previous model but that also makes it a
little thicker and heavier this one tips
the scales at just under four and a half
pounds it's not overburdened with ports
but it has an HDMI connection into USB C
plus a full size USB because all your
old accessories
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
