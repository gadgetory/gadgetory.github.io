show that covers everything to do with
alphabet alphabet happens to own lots of
companies like loon X way Moe and Google
I'm your guide I as act heart and you
are the delightful audience today we're
talking about fiber childish gambino and
your comments but first up it's time to
talk about the s10 again on to galaxy
gateway the galaxy s10 event is coming
up on the 20th of February but even more
details keep leaking this time there's
an image of a pair of headphones
charging using the Galaxy S 10 take a
look hey rich can you zoom in on the
green dots showing the power flowing
also anybody else seeing a very angry
looking face in the headphones Sam
mobile says the feature is called power
share oh and these galaxy buds may be a
pre-order gift according to one leaker
also images of the s10 wound up online
again the budget version the s10 II
looks like it'll be available in yellow
snazzy on Weibo there are images of what
looks to be the s10 II here they are
then there's the s10 in red it's the
bee's knees kids oh and then there's
this picture on Twitter that shows what
looks like a Samsung poster yep that
says pre-orders would start on the 22nd
of February and lastly Samsung put out a
new teaser video for its unpacked event
with the title the future unfolds so
that clearly means we're gonna see that
folding phone again right on to Uptown
updates
Google seems to be looking into
wearables it had a job listing up for a
vice president of hardware engineering
for wearables Android police has a
screenshot of the listing which has
since been taken down the qualified
applicant needed to have 15 years of
experience in developing consumer
electronic products and experience
delivering products that ship in the
hundreds of millions of units good luck
with that Google guys if you have the
pixel three you can now bring in an
augmented reality version of childish
gambino in your pictures google says
he'll even react to your facial
expressions in real-time so if you
didn't have a reason to buy a pixel 3
before you got one now if that doesn't
do it for you a Motorola introduced the
new g7 series there are three models
headed to North America and all three
use the same processor there's the g7
play which costs just $199 then there's
a g7 power which costs $249 if you were
expecting the power to be super-powerful
with lots of RAM and lots of storage
because of the name you're dead wrong
the power name refers to a huge 5,000
milliamp hour battery the g7 is the
flagship with a $2.99 price tag I got to
try them out for a bit and they felt
very responsive it had really good build
quality Google is giving up on fiber in
Louisville Kentucky the company told
users that on April 15th service will
end
Google tried a new experimental method
in construction to get fiber wired up in
the city trenches were dug the fiber was
laid in and then the trenches were
filled up the fiber cable ended up
popping out of the trenches oh did I
mention that those trenches were only 2
inches deep yep Google told seeing that
that it'll learn from this and improve
its deployment in other cities let's go
to comment code
this is the part of the show where we
shine a spotlight at the most amazing
audience in the world that's you guys

bloke 26 says officially it is euro for
both single and plural according to the
European Central Bank so I'll guess I'll
say both from now on I don't know
