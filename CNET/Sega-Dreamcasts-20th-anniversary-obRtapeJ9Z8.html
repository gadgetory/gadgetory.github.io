crazy taxi
I uh noticed I loaned the Japanese
Dreamcast and a US Dreamcast so I would
sneak into my brother's friends room and
just try to get away with an hour I
never did on a Dreamcast
I liked the idea of it but a friend of
mine had one so I just played on his I I
had ordered one and I paid way over at
the actual retail price to get one
imported to the US I don't regret doing
that at all I was the biggest Sega pin
it and to have they had two games in
that system when I ordered it when I
bought it
they had Virtua Fighter 3 TB and pimping
try salon and pimping try salon is still
a horrible day it was being presented as
the bold future and me as a Genesis
owner thinking of Sonic in a 3d space
just that idea and seeing that in action
was absolutely mind-blowing you know in
retrospect it kind of looks like trash
but at the time it looked like the best
thing I'd ever seen
favorite game would be fighting Vipers -
that was the one that I would go over in
my friends place and we play all the
time it's hard to argue against
Soulcalibur that's kind of the best game
on the system that was the most polished
game it was the most feature-rich game
it was most graphically impressive game
still I feel like throughout the
Dreamcast entire lifespan no game ever
looked better than that Crazy Taxi was
our generations
Grand Theft Auto Dreamcast was I think
the first system that had built in
online capabilities like it came with a
56k modem I had no idea the Dreamcast
could connect to the internet
I think we're of the age where our
parents would put severe restrictions on
things like lag was terrible connections
were terrible nothing is stable it was
amazing that we put up with it then I
remember playing with of some friends
from Chicago I was out in San Francisco
and
I'm original for my friends in Chicago
were playing like I could get to play
without so that was awesome that wasn't
I was a great experience we want you to
enter the world of ultimate Network game
we want to give you the experience of
traveling to distant planets and
communicating in real time yeah that was
nothing of bugs name because they had
these little like Tamagotchi little
things you could plug into the
controller well the thing about this
little screen is a memory card - right I
can't exactly remember it's the dumb
memory device trying to figure out like
if it was the second screen for the game
like are you gonna have to like mount it
on your glasses and be able to look at
it while you're playing the game at the
same time 2k1
it was it was a your play screen
I think in Sonic Adventure that you
could download some of the the pets and
you could kind of feed your pets on this
little system and take it with yourself
I think it's it actually feels alright I
can barely fit this in my hands now how
did tiny ten-year-old katlyn fit this in
her hands oh geez it has been a while
yeah my wait you oh sure
I accidentally crashed into her area
let's do this
the handling of the car is really kind
of funny there's no like sort of the
centripetal force involved it's just on
Rails almost as you turn yeah oh it's in
San Francisco I forgot it was in San
Francisco dis cannot be read please
check the disk for scratches but it's
still playing that doesn't make sense
maxi he was a cheap character he was
kind of that eddy gordo if you know
Tekken he's kind of eddy gordo of the
game like people just mash on buttons
and they end up beating even though they
sucked
oh it's intend no controls great so the
a isn't the actual a the a is down here
instead of being over there
fantastic the audio is kind of trashed
though so you can definitely tell
there's been a lot of progress on that
point
okay here we go
so cool
it's awesome
Soul Calibur ironically really because
it led to the demise of Sega as a
hardware developer well this was kind of
Sega in my pain at their best parts of
it long wheel D parts of it for weird
the memory cart would you know you could
take your child with you
parts of it were really done but it was
unique if I like goes me with love as
opposed to being that I don't know focus
group because they have to capture the
18 to 34 mountain do audience I think
you know it was sort of this small it
was the small player and I think
everyone had a sense of that you know
people really I know that the people who
had it really really loved it element is
still one of my favorite systems of all
time okay I really wish it could have
been more successful but his copy was
this bootleg copy that he had gotten
somehow from Japan and it was on a disc
you know and then you know I had writing
on the disc and whatever the nightmare
of Shem Noah which I never actually
played I've only heard nightmares if I
want to run errands so play read dead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
