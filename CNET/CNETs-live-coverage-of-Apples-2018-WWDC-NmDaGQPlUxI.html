you
good morning and welcome to CNET live
our coverage of Apple's WWDC 2018 it's
so great to have your company I'm Alexis
Avedis and because CNET is a big family
of lots of very talented people we're
gonna make this show a lot about them
and about us here in the studio but
before I start the introductions I want
to say that this show is also about you
too so we want to know everything that
you think is gonna happen today at WWDC
you can tweet us live at the hashtag
CNET live we'd love to hear your
questions and also vote in our poll two
more on that later but let's get to the
intros in the studio joining me I have
the wonderful mystery and shirt hey
everybody the fantastic mr. Patrick
Collins tis I the man with the magic mr.
Stephen Bates up y'all
yo I'm joining us live on the line for
commentary throughout the show we have
from Cena smart home team in Louisville
Kentucky
they're amazing Miz Megan woloson hello
hi Megan and all the way from New York
we have the one and only mr. Jeff
Bakalar hello thank you for having me
good very very early on 12 p.m. wake
time thank you for waking up earlier
than thank you for waking up early for
us Jeff we appreciate okay so the K
night starts in around an hour's time 10
a.m. Pacific 1 p.m. Eastern Time
it's happening down around 50 miles
south of where we are here in San
Francisco it is down in the sand Jose
Convention Center so you can see a live
shot here this is what it looks like
outside throng of developers collection
of developers what are we calling our
collective term of devs they're lining
up I think we go for a package of
developers I'm
zip file developer an apk or do we
mention a github of very nice okay sorry
this is normally an event obviously for
developers we see a bunch of software
announcements we see updates to
platforms iOS watch OS mac OS n' and
more sometimes there's some hardware
announced so in previous years we've
seen the home part we've seen some mac
books although the rumors are pointing
towards less of that this year
very little hardware updates if the
rumors are to be believed and it's a
real focus on software and refinements
we're gonna dive deep into that in a
little bit but before we get started
let's chat about our wish list so i have
a very long very extensive laundry list
of things that i would like to see from
today the WWDC if you want to join me
and write down your list of things you
want to see hashtags seen it live but
let's go around and kind of discuss what
we hope to say from today the things
we're looking for and maybe some of like
the real outside kind of events though
what are we thinking in stop list so I
mean I certainly am a big complainer
about the iOS buggy problem I think that
I've been I have an iPhone 10 which I
paid for myself and my biggest complaint
about it is that the software has been
so unreliable since it came out yeah
I've actually had I've been on the betas
just hoping every time a new update
comes out that it's better and that it's
actually stable and it every time it's
just bad so we need to see Apple fix
their software problems it's just this
is ridiculous and by the way I'm not
alone Scott Stein has also been talking
about this and how buggy it is so I
would really love to see that the other
thing is multi-user you know it one of
the things that I am increasingly doing
cuz I'm a dad is I've got my kid playing
with our iPad and he needs to be able to
use it in a way that makes sense
and with all the different apps I have
on there and all the different things
that can do it's really hard for him it
would be really nice if I could have
just one screen for him you know all the
apps he uses he doesn't have to fish for
them it's really nice so that
what I would like to see that's what do
you say the thing about the beta though
I'm on the beta too and I haven't
noticed that many oh I mean now I say
this you know what's gonna happen
I've just cursed myself anyway Patrick
what do you want to say today well
there's a couple of things real quick
once it's the tenth anniversary the App
Store which last year we celebrated a
lot the original iPhone blow some
candles so I'm sure we'll get some
acknowledgement that and where it is and
I'm interested to see if there's any
like improvements the way the people who
work for Apple the developers and the
people who are outside Apple who
developed their own apps if there's any
difference in compensation or how things
have grown in the past ten years they
address any of that or this dividend the
other thing for me is surprises there
have been some rumors but there's not
been a lot of rumors so I don't know I'm
so excited to go in pretty clean and not
know what's gonna be revealed there if
there's like a magic piece of hardware
or a new killer piece of software right
now exactly we don't know that made that
sound I would buy that the last thing is
I probably won't be there but I'm a huge
fan of the iPhone se and if there was an
iPhone se 2 that had updated cameras
that would be the form factor I just
love I have a giant hands and I do you
like the pluses but I just that small
form factor fits in the pocket it's just
been a little internally out of date for
about a year or so now but it's a great
phone still for a lot of people but the
update of the cameras yep the other
software was something a little more
powerful on that I could be on and I
have a bunch of friends who were not
techies who loved the iPhone se it's a
great way to have a somewhat modern
phone with for not that much money and
if they don't care about having enough
flashy iPhone 10 or even an 8 it's
perfect for them the form Factory is
it's that classic form factor I have to
admit it is eighties really nice to hold
there's there's rumors are these are old
rumors but there's rumors that there
might have a larger display that's not
kind of like the iPhone 10 to optimize
space so that would be cool too
not sure but that's probably a long shot
but that'd be my home
oh good wish list okay bitchin what
about you what's on that list
I just want Syria to get smarter because
you know I asked Syria a lot of
questions and she doesn't have the
answer she says here's what I found for
you and it drives me crazy and I always
have to go deeper into my phone and open
up Google or something or Google
assistant and Google assist in always
has the answer but I just wish Siri was
was faster and easier and smarter so I
don't have to go deeper into my phone to
ask questions you know so true look the
Siri question is such a big one and AI
like Apple really has to make a big push
in AI in this announcement I feel Siri
has to get better Siri has to get
smarter we saw you know the Google
duplex demo that kind of like blew
everyone's minds series probably not
gonna do something like that any time
soon at least not in this demo but
that's kind of the level at which you
know Apple has to step up to everyone
saying Syria's behind Siri is behind and
you know we see Alexa we see the
assistant and it's just serious just not
good enough right now for me do you
think that Apple is going to launch a a
I assistant that can work for barber
shops and restaurants that will
robotically answer the call for group
Google duplex calls very very very silly
video called an infinite loop where I
got all of the assists I got the echo
dot I got the home pod and I got the
Google home talking to each other and
just like it was just an endless
ridiculous this is what's gonna happen
is that in like a thousand years when
we're all dead and human civilization is
gone
the aliens are gonna finally come over
and they're gonna see these things
talking to each other that's what's
gonna happen it's gonna be Siri being
well it's 11:00 a.m. available and
Google goes no how about 10:30 and then
the other one goes yeah it's just gonna
be ridiculous like this is where we're
heading I can't wait for that battery
technology though there's good old
battery here's our infinite loop just
for so people can have us oh yeah take a
look at the hey Siri read my reminders I
found only one reminder okay Google
what's on my calendar on Sunday on
Sunday there's only one thing on your
calendar it starts on the 18th
2:55 p.m. and the title is Alexa what's
on my to-do list you have one item on
your to-do list you get the point Ali
died a couple of times
yeah and that was just because of some
connectivity issues and sometimes the
speaker's didn't hear each other and so
on and so forth so you could have made a
cryptocurrency rig but instead you have
anyway there's a how-to if you want to
do that you can search on on youtube or
unseen it you can find out how to do
that yourself if you really want to it's
actually kind of fun cuz I'm a geek and
I love doing things like that
so enjoy anyway I want to chat over to
to Megan and I want to hear what you
want to think what you want to hear from
today's WWDC announcements maybe some
home pod updates maybe like home kit
what the heck is going on with home
create yeah that would be awesome but I
completely agree with Beecham I would
love to see some improvements to Siri
but specifically for the home pod so for
instance it doesn't have voice training
so I can't tell the difference between
my voice or your voice which would be a
huge improvement something that Alexa
and the Google assistant already offer
also controlling the Apple TV
you can't currently say hey Siri play
this thing on Netflix you can't do
anything like that for entertainment
crossover which is is a huge missin my
point and and also calling you can't
currently place or receive calls from
the home pod speaker so you're limited
to using it kind of as a speakerphone
you pass the call over from I'm your
iPhone to the home pod which works but
it's kind of clunky and could be a lot
better and homekit also could really use
an update in terms of incorporating
Android users I know that probably won't
happen but Android folks can't currently
access the home app so you don't have
access to home kit at all which is super
limiting and something that I would love
to see added but is kind of a wishlist
item that I don't expect to see I'm
sorry what's this Android that you speak
of
haven't heard of this before wild and
crazy I know but it wouldn't that be so
great because it automatically alienates
so many folks and also related to that
Apple music right I mean it's completely
closed off on the home pod you can't you
Siri to pull up Spotify or YouTube or
Pandora or any other third party music
it's limited specifically to Apple's
music services which I I get that's what
Apple's thing but it would be amazing if
they open that up and made it more
approachable to other folks because
that's a huge market out there for
people that use Spotify and YouTube and
other other things and right now you
can't do that with Siri so right and
that's that's so annoying to see to me
I'm I'm a Spotify user and it's just the
the lack of integration I mean the Apple
ecosystem is so frustrating it drives me
up the wall I mean I've listened to the
home part I think the sound is amazing
it's like the best sounding smart
speaker right now but I don't use Apple
music and I kind of refuse to use Apple
music just because everything I've got
is in Spotify I don't want to migrate
everything again so the fact that I
can't listen natively on the home pod
it's just even if I have an iPhone even
if I have everything else in the Apple
ecosystem I can't listen to Spotify
that's a big bug there of mine and
Spotify on the Apple watch - oh my
goodness I could go on for days you
could I have this thing with music and
Apple and and it's not called Apple
music it's cold it's getting my songs
from elsewhere anyway thanks I'm Megan
[Laughter]
what's on your Apple WWDC wish list well
I don't have any things that I'm super
looking forward to because I have an
Android phone so I already have
everything I need
if there was one thing I'd want to see
I'm committing was addiction to their
products that's kind of like a no
chewing off sort of thing I'm really
genuine how they're going to helpful
stop using our stuff to me that seems
like you wouldn't want to do because you
want to make money so I'm very happy
it's been
a u.s. mop for an addict stuff do you
need to go to some sort of rehab is this
a problem for you something like that I
just used my phone I want to see
apparently is it
that's an interesting Nate so and that's
that's definitely on the list for for
one of the potential announcements in
iOS 12 later today anyway we are gonna
cross live right now we are gonna go to
the the San Jose Convention Center and
we are gonna check in with our senior
editor
Vanessa hand Oriana who is outside the
Convention Center hello Vanessa
happening I just want you to say hi to
some developers over here I'm going to
switch you over say hi just reminding
everybody this conference is about them
not us so well yeah and in that terms
I've been talking to a few of the
developers on the line and just to see
what they're excited about cuz you know
we can ask for a few things but it's
really them who are developing the
things that we're gonna be using so what
they're most excited about our Siri
updates overhaul of Siri I think that's
probably relates to everybody not just
developers I think we're expecting that
as well or hoping for that as well also
another thing that I found interesting
that they wanted was the kind of some
kind of marriage between Mac OS and iOS
which we've been kind of hearing rumors
about we haven't gotten quite yet but
that's something these developers want
to see to help them develop for both
platforms and in terms I asked them kind
of what their favorite products from
Apple had been in the recent years and
surprisingly at least for me
surprisingly was air pods like a lot of
them said the air pods
what do they want what do they want they
want you once they won the wireless
charging case like we know they love the
airport I just love them they just love
the air pods that's why there are
favorite products from Apple in the
recent years which I thought they were
gonna say you know MacBooks or the
iPhone 10 or something air pods I was
just it kind of shocked me a little bit
that that was whether their favorite
products in the recent years the other
thing that they told me which was kind
of cool was that there are some clues
hidden in the agenda of the Developers
Conference and now I'm not allowed to
say who told me I don't you guys don't
didn't hear this from me but there is an
AR room so it means that we I don't know
if it's just a Ark it related I'm hoping
to see some hardware but it may it may
be a clue into the the fact that we
might see some hardware in terms of that
they are mixed reality headset that
we've been hearing about but don't get
your hopes up I'm just telling you what
the clues are somebody else told me that
if you now ask Siri about those the air
power mat that Siri actually now gives
you a list of Apple stores so really I
think that's another yeah okay try and
try it Harry tell me about the air power
mat able to answer that question and
more except it sort of dictated all of
the other stuff have been checking and
the fact that she now says something
about the air power mat means that it's
coming that's what they're that's what
they're saying I'm just I'm just
repeating oh I like word on the street
word on the street love it thank you for
chatting to those developers so what's
that what's the vibe like people are
obviously excited right they're very
excited it's kind of been coming in
waves we're now seeing another wave of
developers coming in I'll show you I'll
switch off the camera again
there was a time when there was nobody
in line but it's pretty full yeah I've
been here for a while guys bear with me
but it's yeah people are excited it's
it's kind of tame because there's you
know it's pretty orderly it's Apple and
there's not a lot of groupies here yet
groupies or what a Tim Cook groupies
like
but you know something groupie related
they are handing out these really cool
denims dark denim jackets they've been
handing out to developers I asked for
one myself and they said no
unfortunately wanting anyone yeah but
they're these really cool black Levi's
denim jackets with Kim's kind of like
the the Android Kings from Mobile World
Congress I don't know if you remember
apparently they did this last year as
well so there's some pretty cool cool
swag over here from the Developers
Conference that I'm hoping to snatch up
maybe if you are if you wait for a
little bit I might get somebody to oh
wait look we have somebody wearing one
of the Oh muddle muddle what's your name
ask him what his name is
is he put your name your name sorry Matt
Dallas where are you from oh he's from
Brazil oh really oh can he be can you
get into the latest rap for us can he do
a little toe music form
it's kind of like a little catwalk
they're kind of they got doing a little
slow time you know Irene I know what he
was wearing
he was wearing the air bottle artist I
notice that is a common thing there I
mean you kind of had a place you got you
know you got your babies well we had to
do that for Skype purposes that jacket
wasn't like the jacquard that don't go
around feeling people's out I haven't
told you what I'm excited for what I
want to see here which obviously I think
we all we all want to see Siri updates I
bet if I just screamed out Siri updates
people would cheer but I'm interested to
see you what watch OS tells us about the
next Apple watch I'm hoping around
interface I don't think we're gonna get
that but I'm interested in seeing watch
OS updates I don't think anybody else
has said that yet clearly I'm not a
developer but maybe some women's health
tracking features that might be a little
more realistic than the round interface
but you know that's that's what I'm here
for
yeah i think i think you and i we're
we're very interested in that especially
off two feet pants rolled out some of
the women's health tracking stuff let's
see if Apple is gonna do the same I mean
there are some something yeah represent
represent the ladies well you're doing a
great job representing us they're down
in San Jose thanks Vanessa a lot of us
stay strong stay strong you and me we
got this we got this we got this thanks
Vanessa have a great time talk to you
later thanks Vanessa joining us live
from the San Jose Convention Center that
was Vanessa live on CNN and we are of
course taking your questions your
comments over on the sea net live
hashtag on Twitter and let's let's start
talking about some of the things that we
kind of expect that we want to say I
want to kick things off with iOS 12
obviously the big update is is coming we
pretty much know that is for certain
today some of the things that we are
expected to see less bugs so we don't
think that this is gonna be a really big
overhaul of the interface of
functionality believe that's kind of
gonna be pushed back a little bit just
because you know there's been a lot of
pushback from people on the issues and
the bugs around iOS 11 especially so iOS
12 is really gonna start to refine all
these to make sure they're there are
fewer bugs that there is no huge changes
really but if we want to talk about some
of the things that we want to see
improved in iOS in iOS 12 there's a
couple things that I like the room is a
pointing to things like in you NFC
functionality so rather than just using
NFC to do something like Apple pay which
is the only function right now is to
integrate and I've seen to be able to do
things like say open our hotel door or I
use it every day it would make life so
much nicer I hate having you at my bus
pass I know that's like the most nerdy
terrible thing to say but I am waiting
for the day I get to get rid of my
wallet altogether that would be awesome
I agree I mean like Apple pay itself it
just is so you know when you find a
place that has a contactless terminal
there's no point pulling out your wallet
I am almost ready to get rid of my
wallet altogether I just need a little
bit more of that support in contactless
payments and if you know there was gonna
be a feature to put a bunch of different
NFC options on the phone as well I'm
there for that like that to me it's a
really useful useful addition and also
new an emoji isn't one of the things on
on the agenda potentially you send an
emoji regularly okay so I have a 10 and
I I don't really say that word very
regularly you're excited for it to
possibly use it someday look I do use it
this is what happens you get an iPhone
10 you go oh an emoji and then you use
it for maybe like three or four messages
you go this is so cute this is so cool
and then you never use it again and
people who get the an emojis who are not
using a 10 there are another platform
they're like okay well you know whatever
you know don't really don't really can
one of the rizzo that anime who might be
in face time so like Anna FaceTime face
moji but I mean the idea of if you to
facetiming then you could actually put
on these animal tees I'm not sure that
would be fun maybe for kids or families
but or just weirdos works anytime for
anything okay
any time what I like what I what I like
about an emoji though is it does point
to a lot of potentially you could use
those cameras on the iPhone 10 for
besides just putting silly cartoon faces
making your face but I just wish they
could open that up to developers more so
they could take control and maybe
there's part of that got to be released
this week or something if they're gonna
launch it out into something like it's
time that could be cool as a feature
it's definitely like a headline thing
that you like ooh this looks neat and
then you kind of get tired of but if
they did roll it up developers that
might open for lots of more useful
things right and that's a really good
point is that kind of like this you know
there's really interesting technology
and then it's just being kind of
softened with this really cutesy
application so people kind of get really
used to it they get used to having their
face you know moving around and you know
it really kind of humanizes it in a way
that maybe you know people who wouldn't
really get excited about face unlock or
facial recognition or anything like that
they're just gonna go oh oh okay this is
kind of cute
this is a cute application I like this
see that's one of the things Apple does
really well is they find a way to
feature these really really things that
are full of advanced technology in a
very simple way so when you see an emoji
if you show it to somebody I'm sure you
have you take your Tanel at someone who
doesn't have one try it their eyes this
led up they get it right away you don't
have to explain that it's like scanning
your face and all that stuff it just
works when an emoji karaoke was probably
one of the best ads I'd ever seen I know
it started on Twitter initially an apple
picked it up but that was just so fun
and I think it really kind of spoke to
exactly what you're talking about how
how amazing this technology can be and
how fun it can be instead of just being
this nerdy oh it's you know checking
your face and all that cares right it's
fun and that goes against sweet Samsung
had their phones come out with a are
emoji which was a horrific horrible
experience on a beautiful phone
otherwise they just had this really kind
of like the kind of like the knockoff
version of an emoji didn't work quite as
well but so it would be interesting to
see because I was obviously again the
thing that gets a lot of attention the
thing that we're all gonna write about
is if there's an update to it but I
think that might be just more of a
signal for more things to come right
exactly and over on the scene at live
hashtag we have a question from Alpha
Rex he says do you think that iOS 12
will have any changes to the design
whatsoever the design is getting a
little boring especially the icons yeah
agreed I mean that flat design was a
kind of a love it or hate it when it
first came out and I don't think iOS 12
is gonna give us the big visual wow that
we perhaps would like at least that's
not what we we think you know it could
it could be surprises there I just don't
think we're gonna see a huge visual
overhaul unfortunately but you know
let's see we've gotta wait and see we
think of these new iOS is they're not
only running on the new phones are
running on really older phones I think
right now iOS 11 can run as far back as
the iPhone 5s which is a very different
form factor and engine driving all that
so I think that's one of the challenges
when you want to do a big visual
overhauls how will all that back support
go on phones that are for 4.5 years old
we look on Android I think on Google
they've only promised the pixel to be
supported for three years for their
software it's not a long time long
enough but uh it just goes to show that
Apple's definitely has a commitment to
doing that but also leads to like ian
was talking about those bugs that we
experienced and then you have different
interfaces for the iPhone 10 that you
have for the 5s blah blah blah head
blowing up in frustrations right well
fragmentation I guess you're saying it's
for Android it's a huge huge issue I
mean at least for but iOS it's much more
contained and keeping it in that kind of
container is a lot easier with only a
select number of platforms that you can
actually have iOS on so yeah I uh Chazz
I want to say a nice new whiz-bang iOS
12 in terms of the looks and I think
we're gonna get it but the other thing
I'm kind of excited about this is a
really gues mundane addition it is
horizontal support for face ID and face
on look like this is a this is a big
deal
me I often have issues with face ID do
you do any of you gents number one issue
with face ID is the morning when I'm
trying to unlock from my bed I don't
know why yes but for some reason the
iPhone 10 doesn't like me to be in bed
when I'm trying to unlock it and so I
always try to or three times and I give
up and enter the passcode so whatever it
takes horizontal turn it upside down
right you know wave it over my head I
don't care it just make it work please
I'll do it whatever you want me to do
just make it work and I'm like I'm like
to use case where it's always works even
if I'm doing it and I'm half awake in my
eyes like this it'll just pop and I'm
not sure what's it that speak because I
think you do have cases of both where
people are just really frustrated by it
not being consistent and yet at the same
time I wouldn't want them to do anything
that would make it less secure because
we see versions again of have face
unlocks on Android phones that are super
fast like ridiculously fast but then
they're like oh you can't use this for
banking because it's not secure enough
just basically like having a screen door
and for your main door of your house
whereas apples is still very secure and
the couple times it has hiccup it hasn't
been too bad but the horizontal would be
killer because it's just like gonna make
me twist my wrist this way like that
this is a thing with the horizontal to
it it's also hinting at iPad so we you
know although we might not see the iPad
update refresh today a pro or you know
any of the other models even though we
did have the the new iPad at Chicago
event in March it's not gonna be that it
might be pro but probably not today at
least a horizontal face ID and look kind
of gives us the potential for that face
ID module to be integrated into the new
iPad 2 and going back to it ian was
talking about with users how cool it
would be for you to have your own face
idea unlock your user and then your son
or daughter to have that and unlock
their this is like pet peeve Monday here
[Laughter]
personalities of many faces my wife for
example we sometimes grab my phone when
I'm driving and she has AG always has to
try it a couple of times and then get
the passcode having more than one face
would be great this fingerprint sensor
you could put multiple ones in there but
people had some trouble with even using
maybe they're fit thumb or index finger
though tip you'd always tell them is
just do a second one like that yeah
because then it would trigger so being
able to have like even multiple versions
of your own face in there might make it
be more reliable in that sense but even
especially if you have multiple users
exactly on the iPhone maybe the iPad it
seems like a smarter and it's if you're
a Russian spy who just finished the
Americans and you need to unlock your
phone that's how the show ended they
couldn't unlock their phone it was
really happy get my phone unlocked well
I think also the other thing with iOS 12
is regardless of what happens we're
going to get a real big hint at what's
coming in the future
iPhones and iPads as well so whether
that's you know a face ID module or what
have you it's oh it's gonna be a real
indicator what's to come um split-screen
I want that on on the iPhone I really I
really would like that like on the iPad
I would like that functionality on the
iPhone black on Android as well I hope
there's something about that and
notifications some sort of grouping
please something to clean up the mess
something to clean up the mess please
just because it's just unwieldy like my
homescreen it's just getting messy I go
to the stage where I'm actually actively
turning off notifications right right
it's just too many even if it was just
an option to group them by like similar
types that would just solve so many
things there and that's something I do
enjoy about Androids I'm operating
systems to set simpleness of it but then
you come to you the nightmare of vomit
of vomit we're gonna talk about my
two-year-old so your two-year-old
basically is the inspiration behind the
the lock screen of my iPhone right now
because I go to it there's just so many
notifications and it's dissing I don't
even I'm exhausted just looking at the
screen trying to figure which one I
should unlock exactly back on the the
multi screen multi app thing my biggest
problem with the iPad pro it's like 90%
where I needed to be but I have I use
Evernote right it's despite the fact
that I have a very love hate
relationship with that company right
anyway
I I can only have one note open at a
time and it's it's really tough when I'm
writing I like to have my notes open and
the thing I'm writing in and I can't do
that with the iPad pro and I can't do
that with most apps in the iPad pro but
of course I can do that in the Mac and
so making it so that I could have I saw
one rumor of multiple instances of an
app that would make life so much better
cuz then I could finally have my notes
and my thing open at the same time and I
think that mean that I just try to be
the nerd here but I think some of that
might also have to do with security
especially if multiple windows open I'm
not sure why it works so easily on a
Macintosh but I could think of you'd
want to have more than one Safari when
it would just be a very simple thing to
do right very simple and just like I
want an improved Safari the iPad please
that would be Chrome and Firefox really
honestly run on it right
stop requiring that we only use safaris
web and web reader right like that's one
of the problem is that both Chrome and
Firefox after use safaris technology
when they're running in the iPad and the
iPhone and actually allowing them to be
them would be awesome right there's a
lot of stuff like that like letting
Google Voice take over the dialer or
letting you know setting defaults that
aren't just the default Apple programs
would be so nice but let's be realistic
that's well we can we can wish do you
guys want to take a question from the
chat room and say we get a bunch of we
got our spur D I believe can the iPhone
5s support iOS 12 I guess we're gonna
find that out today we know it does 11
and it's basically a very clean version
of 11 that's why I can run on that but
it'll be interesting if they are able to
do that it's
she is predominantly background fixes
but if they did things like multiple
windows and stuff I don't think you're
gonna get that at the 5s see people want
the small phone maybe I totally
underestimated I like a bigger fire I
mean I totally understand now you're
gonna you're gonna make me want this new
SAE and it's not gonna come and then I'm
gonna be disappointed and I'm gonna have
to wait until September that's what's
gonna happen you know you're setting me
up for disappointment well then I'll
send you messages and just clawed your
home screen with notifications lots of
different questions on the CNET live
hashtag on twitter as well one from
Hamza excited but nervous for iOS 12
must compete with Android he needs new
features and not just stability that's
interesting I disagree I want stability
just give me stability I would be very
happy there are new features I would
like we've talked about them but let's
just make it reliable and he says like
not just a building I think that would
anything with the Android P was it was a
lot of stability stuff there's also
stuff like digital wellness and so many
gestures and of course the infamous not
support for Android phones but as far as
like bringing some of that to iOS I
think the thing that we see also in our
feed is from applesauce says how about a
dark mode I think that would be clever
right yeah that is something that I love
on Android is be able to go into a dark
mode on like the 1 + 6 or so I'm like
that it's just I mean it seems like such
an easy answer I've never understood all
of the excitement around dark mode like
it seems like something so easy to do
but this is where I'm not a developer so
I probably sound like a moron
it seems super easy like when Twitter
did it it was like a revelation in the
tech industry and it was like you know
suddenly the the tablets had come down
from Mount Sinai you have dark mode oh
okay sure great okay this is from back
in my coining days when I was coding it
late at night I wanted a doc mode for
everything because it was just too
blaringly bright this is before all of
the blue life filters and everything I
was like give me a doc mode on
everything so developers I hear I won
the doc married - I'm not creating at
night anymore
but if I was I would want that so I he
oh man when I was doing theater
directing we'd be in a dark Theater for
tech rehearsal
everyone has their screen flipped into
like accessibility mode to invert colors
which is kind of like a poor man's dark
mode but it's still not the same yeah I
think that would be very useful anyway
let's jump across back to Kentucky and
we're gonna be joined by Andrew get hot
from seeing it how you go in Andrew
what's happening I'm doing well yeah
excited about Apple I'm hoping they give
us some Smart Home goodness something to
chew on they they seem to be falling
behind quite a bit between Alexa and
Google and so some additional
integrations would be nice to catch up a
little bit and give us something to make
us excited about home Kate again yeah so
I mean like oh wait where does home kids
stand in comparison to the competition
like give us a kind of competitive
outline of the landscape here so hope
gets way behind and it didn't it wasn't
like that for ages because home kid was
actually out before Amazon echo before
Google home before all this stuff and
home kit launched with you could
organize stuff into rooms which was cool
they were unifying all these third-party
products you could command everything at
once with scenes all that stuff was
really cool so home kit was kind of on
the cutting edge and now you can of
course do all that with your Amazon echo
with your Google home and Amazon echo
and Google home have way more
integrations so recently Apple did away
with this requirement that devices have
this MFI chip that helps them secure
their devices and Apple did this really
quietly so now it's just a matter of
software verification for these devices
to work with home kit so in theory the
barrier to entry for third parties to
work with home kit is a lot smaller now
so it could be a really easy win for
them to say hey we got a bunch of new
smart home stuff here you go guys right
and so I've been like well you know
there's been features like google
routines alexa blueprints kind of like
making a very customized way to interact
with your virtual assistant your smart
home devices do you think that Apple is
gonna do something similar
I mean they could but here's the thing
again homekit used to be this thing that
was innovating right because you talked
about google routines and alexa has
something also called routines
technically they're mimicking to an
extent what Apple did with scenes years
ago so but now Google's routines and
alexis routines can do a lot more in
addition to controlling a bunch of smart
home devices by saying something like
you know hey Google good morning it can
also play podcasts play your favorite
news feed play music and control a bunch
of smart home devices and by the way I'm
sorry if I just tripped a bunch of
people's smart speakers you know and
still seems for home kid the only thing
you can do is control smart home devices
so that would be pretty simple thing to
have customizable scenes that were a
little bit more robust than what they
were years ago but you know at this
point Alexa and Google assistant work
with things like large appliances air
purifiers coffee makers just a whole
bunch of neat smart home devices that
are kind of cool that you can control
them with your voice and it would be
nice if Siri would catch up that's great
well we're gonna be watching with bated
breath and I know you will be watching
the keynote with bated breath for all of
the home care stuff and you're gonna
stay on the line and join us if there's
anything exciting in that realm all
because we want to talk to you about
this stuff you know man it's just on top
of this all the time sorry stick around
and thanks for your thoughts now Andrea
we'll talk to you soon
well hey thanks talk to you soon I'll be
right here alright stay tuned
feel free to pipe in to your mics yeah
yes if you want to just jump in and
interrupt us if we say yeah all right
let's uh let's also jump back over to
Jeff I want to say hi so I'm gonna wake
em up alright it's a you know it's what
12:40 p.m. yep it's almost lunch so you
know we really gotta move it
oh I know I know even tail lunchtime you
know that cannery going Apple very
inconsiderate doing the so I mean this
is the the part where I kind of want to
talk a little bit more about that
digital addiction stuff that you were
mentioning obviously we saw Google have
a lot of those tools in the Google i/o
keynote there's a lot of third-party
apps that also have kind of tools to
help you reduce usage of your phone but
what do you want Apple to do like how do
you see them basically making you less
wanting to use your phone less when
essentially you know they want you to
buy more hardware that's kind of and I
want you to use the software that's kind
of their revenue model like what is the
balance see this is gonna be tricky to
do I don't know how they're gonna do it
other than you know the only thing I
could think up is like how you have a
fitness tracker says get up you sitting
for six hours go walk around something
like that if it did maybe that you're
looking at your phone for that big thing
in tender with I think the European
being you're playing two hours but just
like go out there's fresh air you could
see the world they might do imagine so
much happening with the new Iowa and the
addicted me personally i a couple Apple
Apple before K I got for free
motion of an iPad when I see two big
incorporate
unless you prefer like myself I feel
like I can obviously have an apple can't
really have
haha like that I just more sorry
heartily totally hear those totally
because the thing is with the with these
like these kind of prompts like I hear
on this this front I promise to kind of
like get off you're fine the Cayenne
Apple has the ho with Apple watch if you
have especially you know you have the
the breathe function you have like the
standing things really annoys the heck
out of me and it actually doesn't make
me more inclined it would makes me more
stubborn and I go well no I'm not gonna
I'm not gonna breathe I'm gonna get
really tense so I mean it's gonna it's
gonna be interesting to see how they do
this on on you know your device because
a lot of people just just gonna ignore
especially if it's a little notification
you just gonna go sweep just like you do
with a message unless it's gonna be full
screen your whole device is on lockdown
I'm sorry you have to go outside and I'm
gonna know because you have a location
services turned on and you're gonna have
to go for a little walk before you get
access back to your device
my wife listens to those rings all the
time and she like she constantly
comments to me I didn't close my rings
oh it's telling me I should take a walk
like those things work with her so there
it may be just a weird type a crazy
people in this room and that we're like
no don't tell me how to feel but but
that it actually works with some people
because I mean it's really surprising to
me sometimes how often I hear people
remark about how these things are
helping them that's like it's a little
bit of it like having a pack of
cigarettes to tell you not to smoke it's
kind of because when you've reached that
point phone is like a cigarette well
it's some people compared to say it's
addictive at least people obsess about
how they use it and they have obsessive
behavior with it and I'm not sure if
that's always the point yes that would
be nice to have even something like one
of my favorite things is one plus six
has a reading mode so you could actually
program different apps to go in black
and white but that's kind of a gimmick
some people try to use to not be like
teased by the
candy colors of your phone and wanting
to go back into that so there could be
little useful things like that that
might help but I also feel like by the
time you get to your phone expecting the
thing that you're obsessing about to
tell you not to obsess about it or to
turn it off or put it down I don't know
how effective that would be just not
sure yeah I'm not sure either anyway it
is time to check in on yeah okay well
we're trying to call Scott Stein who is
actually in the San Jose Convention
Center anyway well could we'll check
back in with him when he is on the line
um but let's let's keep going about
watch os you know this is this is an
interesting one because I know Vanessa
alluded to it earlier when we cross to
her there is a lot of stuff that I want
to see what os5 improve upon now I know
a lot of people talk about sleep
monitoring and it's being built in
natively now I don't really like I don't
sleep with a watch on to me that's not
that useful I don't know about you guys
is that a feature that you know would be
of use to you I take off my watch every
night I mean I
until the SmartWatch thing I wasn't
wearing a watch so I feel like it's kind
of not helpful to me but I'm also it's
not that person what are you taking it
off to charge your watch
I'm taking off both to charge it and
also to feel more comfortable like I you
know I take off my wedding ring when I
get home because it's just kind of how I
relax and it's like you know I get into
my sweatpants and I put on my little
sweater and I take a like I take the
jewelry off right and so for me that's
just kind of how I do things and I
probably not alone right I think a lot
of people just kind of want to relax and
this is a little inciting too big where
there's routine right because I feel
like we all have different routines we
have and for some people it's not gonna
be comfortable to keep it on and then
but let's actually go to what it would
do right if it would track your sleep
and we have other things that kind of do
that right and really what they're doing
is they're looking at your heartrate and
they're looking for signs of movement so
depending on what kind of sleeper you
are that's gonna judge that but then
what do you do that information you know
what do you do go like oh I have 3.5
hours
deep sleep like Eric and I were testing
these bands and it would tell us that
we're like is that good or bad I don't
know yeah and how do I increase my deep
sleep to get higher height like four
hours or five right and that's the thing
and that's that's the really difficult
is the analysis you keep the nail on the
head there it's like how do you analyze
all this data I mean I know when I'm
wearing the Apple watch it's there's so
many different apps and ways that you
can kind of see that raw data you can go
yes I took X many steps and I burnt
supposedly X many calories but you know
what do I do with this what's the next
like how do I use this to improve like
am i doing well what's the is this is a
good baseline like there's none of that
it's just very raw at the moment and I
would love to see a better way to kind
of integrate that into into the digital
discussion and let's cross live now to
Scott Stein speaking on all things Apple
watch mister is Apple watch mr. potts
mr. everything Apple Scott Stein on the
ground at WWDC and San Jose come in can
you hear us Scott and you hear us I've
been seeing Twitter remarks about how
bad the Wi-Fi is there yes do you think
that's the we're expecting too much from
the Apple watch maybe would there be
would you guys welcome something that
simplifies like the the interface a
little bit and simplifies what we're
trying to get out of the Apple watch for
me absolutely I would love to see a
simplification I would like to see a lot
of improvements to kind of just like the
cool functionality so like at the moment
to me it just kind of it's a great way
to be notified of what's happening on my
phone when my friends not with me
because when I go into the actual watch
itself and I'm flicking through
everything I can't do enough on the
watch and we've seen like a whole bunch
of third-party apps like get off the
Apple watch essentially like stop
developing apps I think this is this
WWDC is gonna be a great time for Apple
to actually take stock and say you know
what third-party developers we're gonna
want you to come back cuz we've got all
of these other ways to do things and
we're gonna make it simpler and we're
gonna make it
more effective way to see your data that
to me is what I want to say I really
want to see it more like turn into a tap
my shoulder type thing like I don't like
the whole idea of a full app on my watch
to me isn't that valuable I do
understand the idea of Spotify on the
watch I'll get behind that but otherwise
like what's really interesting is how
actually not that awesome it is at just
knowing when to get my attention right
like if I if I'm if I'm emailing and
whatever and I get a slack message and I
don't know he came through it'd be
really nice at the watch somehow knew to
tap my shoulder hey did you see this
this is important it's actually that the
maps is perfect at this right like when
I'm driving down the street it starts
tapping my wrist as I'm driving down a
it's about time to turn and doing more
of that type of stuff and just you know
lightly nudging me through the day I
think would be fantastic yeah and I
think there's like there's him so Apple
can do some of that already like if you
ever have multiple Apple devices or
pairing the air pots the first time or
carrying a Wi-Fi network those are all
make neat little prompts and they just
seem to work and I think it being more
intelligent about the things you want or
maybe even having a preferences that you
go through and and have a respond to
that I think you'd actually get a lot
more people interested in the Apple
watch and if it helped the battery life
which is better than it has been when it
was first released or was for the first
release but it'd still be better yeah
especially especially on the LT 8 if
you're using LTE I'm sorry
yeah just you're just really gonna have
trouble alright Scott Steiner nice on
the line but you are joining us
literally just on the line not actually
in a video form I'm sad I can't see your
face but we can talk to you and that's
for me I'm happy to hear so how are you
Scott what's happening inside the
convention center I'm gonna create a
picture with audio Thanks we have yeah I
could hear you we have really poor
connectivity here no Wi-Fi right now and
maybe that'll fix itself
so everything cellular and what I'm
doing is I'm sitting down we're looking
at a giant wall of apps and app icons we
can as we get ready for the keynote
excellent and what have you seen in
terms of like the the mood walking in
have you seen any hints of like what
might be coming today from
announcements like do what are we
expecting from will be seeing any ARV
our stuff on the way in no I'm not
seeing any Holograms yeah nothing
nothing popping out and to grab me but
you know those those images at the front
you've seen which kind of look like on
the invitation kind of like 3d widget II
things a lot of very excited developers
who we're also excited to see some of
the press marques Brownlee got a lot of
cheers I did not get any cheers good job
and just keeping your head down but
organized yeah very humble but very
organized we don't know what we're gonna
expect exactly because it's been pretty
quiet
maybe maybe no hardware and if that's
the case you know iOS 12 is supposed to
be a it seems like a quiet up gate to
where they're made its be a lot of bug
fixes I maybe Apple to catch up to some
things that Google was discussing at
Google IO multiplayer and maybe Google
lens like features where he could use
the camera and the watch I think needs a
lot of updates I would like to see sleep
tracking watch me after work I want to
see the iPad finally get a lot better
at being a real work device for four
people yeah absolutely I mean it's
interesting because we were just talking
about we were just talking about sleep
monitoring and the consensus ease is
kind of like we know that excited about
it I mean Patrick I think it's a little
more excited about it than the rest of
us but to you that's interesting I know
you are mister augmented reality virtual
reality I if Apple is gonna make some
sort of announcement today
it probably won't be that headset that
we we heard about but what else you know
a Ark it developments like are we going
to see anything out of what in terms of
a arcade are we gonna say to you things
why should Apple you know it made a big
move last year was was was taking the
drivers fee for a R and now they need to
continue that and show how people are
going to want to use it more beyond just
a gimmick you know the AR is fascinating
but it's kind of like a few minutes of
it I'm and then you know what you really
need it for so bringing more people to
use it again multiplayer multi-user
because right now it's a single
experience it's really just kind of a
layer you put in stuff could it be more
than that and like Google said before
can we finally start having some tools
where your camera acts as a smart tool
with AR to bring up things in the real
world or interact with things we're
again interactive versus just having a
dinosaur walk around after that I'm just
sir will walk you around now how we need
to figure out what to do with the
dinosaur that's walking around maybe the
dinosaurs are showing you where to go in
your Maps kind of like the Fox well on
Google Maps right I mean I don't know I
like kind of like just the dinosaur just
hanging out in real space but it's it's
like we were saying before about and
emojis you know having something that is
kind of fun that's kind of relatable it
makes it it humanizes a day and then
because I ought to a lot of people it's
like what is this it's it's a little bit
intimidating and then to have something
a dinosaur I'm both for the dinosaurs
seriously it's a bit like the early days
of like the iOS App Store right got a
lots of apps that did fart sounds and
how that evolved from just being very
funny it's stupid apps to things that
were more useful and I mean things like
Spotify weren't even
ten years ago right and if you think
about a are just as it another interface
to use in their phone and I mean as
excited as it would be to see an AR VR
headset I think Apple is onto something
by keeping it very simple making it work
on the phone and if you could have that
as a shared experience that would be
pretty cool
yeah well Scott I know the keynote is
starting really soon we're gonna let you
get settled we're gonna be following you
on the live blog thanks for joining us
and we're excited to see what happens
four minutes to Godspeed and good luck
Scott thank you for joining us that was
Scott Stein there joining us from the
San Jose Convention Center in the middle
of WWDC which is gonna start in
approximately three minutes time I feel
like the talking clock oh three minutes
time the conference will start you have
that tone you got that ton I could I was
once told I could be the new voice of
Siri so I consider this an audition
sound you tell me that you know they
can't understand what I'm saying I'm
gonna look in continues searching on
Safari I'm sorry Patrick I can't
understand I'm gonna continue searching
on Safari
you got it you got the part yeah thank
you thank you writing as a guy stop it
let's jump in take another question on
there seeing it live hashtag we got lots
and lots of questions here so excited to
have you all contributed to this show
okay so your poll what about the poll
all the pomp oh well okay I totally
forgot about my poll all right let's go
check in an on um up whole everybody
let's try and pull this up so I did a
little bit of a hop poll on that on
Twitter this morning and I did ask what
is the one thing that you would like to
see you from WWDC today so I had four
options Twitter and unless you have full
options on a poll like seriously that's
not enough for me anyway I said better
Siri new hardware Mac and iOS
integration or one more thing and I'm
gonna try and place my vote yea vote
please is that what I said better Siri I
just want to see what people all right
okay all right all right
Oh
okay so we have one more thing leading
the pack what's your favorite part of
the meal like the meal the salad or the
desserts like anyway so with like new
hardware people are still keen on a new
MacBook a new macro this is the thing I
want to say never gonna happen
or at least if it does if it does maybe
I'll eat my hat as they say you're not
wearing it I know I'll find a hat and I
will eat it i 13-inch MacBook Air with
retina this is if you've watched any of
the seen out lives in the past you'll
know that I say this every single Apple
shirt and it never happens and they I
know they're doing it to spite me
because that's the one thing that I want
and unless it won't happen today either
but Apple has a real problem the MacBook
Air is one of the best laptops ever made
and so everything they try to do to make
it better has not gone that well right
there's people complaining about the
MacBook Pro keyboard and the MacBook
keyboard and the MacBook just doesn't
have as many features and look I'm still
on an air right like it's it's obvious
that they really need to just double
down on the air more as they're trying
to figure out what's next for laptops
exactly and you know let's jump to the
listener to the scene at live hashtag
questions okay so we got a couple a lot
of questions here okay still waiting for
Apple pay cash here in the UK
hopefully iOS 12 will bring that over
here yes okay this is a big this is a
big big deal because Apple pay cash is
us only right now this is that
peer-to-peer payment system with an
iMessage within iOS that you can send
cash to your friends it's kind of like
the ven Murray the Pay Pal Bozell
whatever what-have-you of of the Apple
ecosystem Apple pay cash like have you
guys use this have you are you impressed
by it
Apple pay cash Apple pay cash no I have
not used it sits there and it kind of
makes fun of me for being a zero all the
time like feed me money because I even
have money my itunes account but it
doesn't work with Apple Kay cash so I
just haven't either
with their different things they're
different like it's nice it's a
different account well the thing and I
have used it a couple times especially
when you're going out and someone wants
to foot the bill it's this easy to text
summary message them write the cash and
it's really neat you don't have to go
into the mo or in another app that's
always a conversation like what what do
you have you have chase do you have vin
mode if you're an apple great you can
send you can send Apple pay cash in the
US but if you don't exactly you don't
you're kind of screwed Google pay send
works on Android and iOS and it's faster
than Apple fake cash anyway sorry I
that's a that's another option no you
should show us you should send me money
right now another question will the
airport series to be coming out this
WWDC much what would series to look like
that's what I'm curious about like the
air pods are 90% perfect as they are
they could last a little long
the wireless charging sure but that's
just a case you know I think the one
thing I want is that they actually they
actually read my mind and know when I
need them to connect to a certain device
like if they can invent read
mind-reading technology and actually
know like no I'm looking at my iPad
right now why are you connected to my
iPhone that'd be awesome
but other than that they're perfect
different colors okay the keener the
keynote has actually started everybody
sorry
so it's an opening video so here's how
this is gonna work we cannot play the
keynotes live for you we are gonna talk
to it play-by-play we have the CNET live
look now there is a bunch of scene it is
on this we have a shower tip can we have
Scott's time we have James Martin doing
photos and Connie and they're all gonna
be tweeting and writing updates and
posting photos generally what happens is
that the live book is actually faster
than the stream yes sir it's usually
like at least a minute or two faster so
we'll find out things like you will get
your news here before you get it there
uh-huh
I love that can you make that a jingle
beach
yeah so we'll be talking through it
play-by-play we're gonna have a bit of
analysis we're gonna have you know our
thoughts on things so we'd love for you
to stick around if you do want to watch
the keynote itself you can do that maybe
in another winter and keep us open in
another one and jump in with you
questions on seeing it live we're gonna
take them all throughout the show so
keep it locked here you can also watch
the keynote as well but like even
believe it on us cuz we want to chat to
you too and we can have some fun stuff
so please stay tuned anyway so we've
seen a video that started off the
keynotes it looks like they're just
playing a little jerky video about how
hibernating developers attend WWDC look
at that widescreen aspect ratio very
like cinematic like it's such a such a
photo geek I love it it's amazing it's
apparently very loud in the keynote it
sounds like they're at a rock concert
and there's a little jokes happening
Terius nocturnal cave dwelling creatures
must meet daylight that's one of the
little captions in the video that's
happening that's kind of fun I think
last year's intro video it was like apps
disappearing from the fluorine screen
what would a world look like without
apps that was a great way to like bring
them in and it was a neat shift for
Apple like as a storytelling and it was
definitely targeted for their audience
which is developers isn't that basically
what the home parties anyway so the
video is still going um we see now
actually there's a huge applause tab on
stage everybody Tim Cook is on waving we
have the WWDC iconography though is kind
of like raised 3d icons HBO's Silicon
Valley opening credits okay oh my
goodness oh maybe that's a little a
little much if you have my judge came
out to be like way too started way to go
out
I love it alright well this is gonna be
interesting what is gonna be the first
thing that our Tim Cook is gonna come
and talk about is it gonna be iOS is it
gonna be privacy is it be security is it
gonna be security yes it's gonna be all
the phones that we bought that the media
underestimated so horribly or is it
gonna be something about the developers
which is that I think yes I think so
because it's sighs I'm gonna guess I'm
interrupting your bad mood against the
app store it's the 10th anniversary they
remind us like how many absolutely oh
cool 77 country is represented more than
ever but that's the attendees it's
always the call-out in the beginning
it's interesting I was looking on app
shopper I don't know if you all use it
but it's a it's a really good way to
kind of figure out what apps are on the
App Store sometimes it's run by Mac
rumors and there I found out there are
over a million and a half apps in the
App Store at this point they don't put
out a number of these days but that's a
big number right now that it's down just
below a million and a half but I think
what's interesting about that is to is
like that's one of the things we're
hearing a little bit from developers of
stuff is being found and doing that and
you look on the App Store actually on
your phone it has got an overhaul feels
a little bit more like almost like a
website or a new site with different
apps being featured and cartoon like
these really cool illustrations we don't
see that on the Mac App Store quite yet
that would be an addition or pretty miss
how to find these apps how to find that
one in a million
probably even harder to find than a
needle in a haystack I think and we just
saw some balloons so again we are
getting my my birthday wish for you have
to birth the app store like are insanely
successful like I've heard from some
developers that they've seen a huge pop
way more than it used to be just getting
like a little ad bar at the top of the
App Store though when they do like this
these what you know marketing stories
about these developers they do really
well so I think Apple stumbled upon
something with that and definitely the
Mac App Store could use
right and you know yesterday Tim Cook
tweeted this video that was about like
some of the younger staff developers and
some of the students that were you know
working on these interesting apps - oh
happy birthday
our unis are you gonna sing clattering
happy birthday app store happy happy
birthday baritone voice that makes me
feel things that's fine hashtag giant
check is what we're saying billion
dollars so that's the money that
developers have earned through the App
Store will now top a hundred billion
dollars what's the current do you does
anyone remember the current split
between Apple and develop 17:30 daddy
still okay yes sorry a hundred billion
that's uh someone do the math well in
the thing I think about too is like with
that split that was again a split that's
been around for ten years and it's
worked really well but on the flip side
it's also we see recently we saw the
game developers team kind of run up
against that too so it's curious to see
if they're gonna keep going on with
after gonna make exceptions with some of
these bigger developers well tell you
they had they found a way around it
before and I wrote about this back vote
and my previous job at the Wall Street
Journal that those home screen of the
app store things that is worth a ton of
money in marketing and so Apple and
Google both would actually try to get
developers huge developers like EA
Activision whoever to give them an
exclusive for four months by giving them
that prominent placement and they said
this is worth that much money right and
so and it usually worked and so you know
it's interesting I think Apple may be
able to keep that 70/30 split because
the homepage of the App Store is so
effective and they can use it as a tool
to pay people essentially extra money
and I think when we hear about that not
working well with somebody picker
developers those are definitely deaf
more one-off cases but they're really
big one of cases I mean the big one for
years was Amazon right yes being able to
just get through Prime subscription but
it can't buy through Apple well notice
those that fight is still the worst
fight in the world the fact that you
can't buy books through the Kindle app
is just it's so petty to Silicon Valley
Bowl you know it's so frustrating it's
just it's just what it is and I don't
know if it's gonna change too much today
anyway Apple is changing this is a quote
from - Corey Tim Cook Apple changing the
world and making it a better place is
what it's all about for us we aim to put
the customer at the center of everything
that we do and today is all about
software no surprises there
iOS Mac OS watch OS and TV OS and iOS is
up first
right now I'm again talking about the
customer being the center of everything
that we design scott says well in that
case then that's maybe there's this new
iPad pro given that it's uh it's gonna
be all about the software
unfortunately so yeah it's a it's a
shame that we're not gonna say anything
else no but we officially see that there
is as we thought a name for it called
iOS 12 it came to number like federighi
is on stage
aka hear Force One yeah cap apples
software teeth look at that look at that
coin that beautiful hair well you know
just a little perfect there's an AR yeah
there's there's apples AR use case right
there they could actually a are pick
favor use their onto yourself alright
and it's a free update yes as if it
wouldn't be a update to iOS 12 and then
saying an iOS I need the approach of
getting you free updates
I need it I mean well if you think about
we we think back 10 years ago you would
have to pay for your updates to the
Windows machine music or to the the Mac
software was it free well no so the
iPhone software was always free compared
to other people yeah I mean you look at
I think it was Windows 10 was the first
time that it was free for PC users and
it continues to be which is really
interesting and a bunch of other people
have followed suit absolutely you know
also Apple actually had to go through
with the IRS like specific changes the
way that stuff is counted just to make
it free for like iPod touch users and
iPad users but now it's free for
everyone I passed speaking of that
where's you know we're talking about iOS
supporting devices going back to 2013
including the iPhone 5s but yet like how
does it is it you know good experience
on the 5 there's an article that never
got to finish running actually Ian came
with idea where I actually used the
iPhone 5s with iOS 11 and it was
brilliant it was great it wasn't buggy
but it's also very stripped-down from
what you had on like an iPhone 10 what
was missing like animations any
animation well it was so pared down but
also it's a smaller screen and it's I
didn't have it didn't affect battery
life whatsoever compared to like running
it that's good to know well good to know
now is that iOS 12 will work on all the
same devices as iOS 11 that's gonna be
faster and more responsive I am curious
to see whether the developer betas are
gonna be that because first developer
Vedas are always slow as molasses it's
not gonna be a great experience you know
I'm just interested to see I'm I can't
wait to see how i OS 12 runs Patrick is
the man for that job
I think I'm gonna be updating that story
yeah I want to read that story right now
okay so they're focusing on on oldest
devices
and then there's a wide applause for iOS
whole being supported on a bunch of old
devices - and saying that it's the
largest space that iOS has ever
supported an apple couldn't help but
knock the competition there's something
on Twitter about how the install base
for iOS 11s 81% but Android has 6% of
the most reason and the quote is if you
look at our competition it's hard to say
that they really have a software update
model yeah I mean that's a chondroitin
is such a complicated one because it's
so you know it's it's like a couple
prongs there's the carriers it's the
manufacturers it's okay it's gonna go
through this like really intense process
to kind of get the latest Android out
and you know a lot of Android uses you
know I still running like the same is
stock you know OS that they were running
when they first bought the phone and
that could be I don't know like KitKat
well something like well I think the
searching because when Android P was
announced they actually showed a lot of
support for third-party well I guess
they're all third-party handsets other
than Google like oneplus was on there I
want to say HTC so we could actually put
Android P beta on those newer Android
phones now that certainly leaves out a
lot of existing Android phone when
Google wants this to be fixed right they
they have had I mean I can't even count
how many initiatives they've had now to
make sure the software is up-to-date for
all the phones and it's just it's so
hard to get done that doesn't make it
okay
yeah but they did it obviously is way
harder than us just saying do it right
the fragmentation is such a huge huge
question there for Android and I think a
big part of that too is gonna be like if
their own phones that they make are only
being promised to be supported on the
next three operating systems and apples
going back to the iPhone 5s that just
tells you that's a big that's a big
appeal for a lot of reasons people stick
with Apple is that it's going to work
and they can download and get some of
the new features if not all of them on a
really old phone definitely well they're
promising some speed boosts for the six
plus users and and there Craig federighi
says that they'd put iOS through a lot
of stress tests I want to know what the
stress test saw their big big
improvements
of optimized iOS 12 with apples chip
team and sir they it's gonna be able to
know how to ramp up performance and even
when you're scrolling through so let me
interesting to see how this actually
works I'm so that's the updates on the
performance side of things and augmented
reality is up next
AR time which is really interesting
Pixar Disney and Apple have a very
interesting relationship because of
Steve Jobs but still it's gonna be
interesting to see exactly what they're
trying to do they're obviously the
characters from Pixar really popular and
Google when after who was it that they
had in one of their AR efforts they
wasn't it the Monsters Inc people at one
point so you know Pixar seems clearly
willing to get involved here right and
see it's an interesting in the state
let's say oh this Pixar and Apple have
developed a file format called us DZ
this is getting nerdy folks ok US
dollars tag dollars in files Safari
messages mail you can place 3d objects
in the real world which we already know
it's something like a are quick look um
and so we're working with the leading
companies for 3d tools 3d library is to
bring their support for users what the
world really needs is more file format
so let me tell you I was thinking that
when I got in here I was like please
let's add more complexity to my file yes
make my life even more hard all these
proprietary formats that I can't open in
other places yes please
ah an adobe is coming on stage next
interesting here see so he's all about
usually used as well derby CTO is used
as friendly um it's saying it's actually
a pretty big deal there's now a way to
deliver a are experiences across the
entire iOS experience there's a lot of
experience I think experiences the
buzzword of today yeah I do have to give
Apple some credit Swift it was really
like everyone kind of was like
or whatever Apple and they become a big
thing right it is very popular it's
pretty widely used I hear about it all
the time when I talk to developers and
so maybe this is something that's gonna
be a big deal even though we're gonna
all be saying very long time it might
actually become something it's gonna be
interesting yeah I mean I tried to teach
myself a little bit of Swift and it's
pretty easy yeah it's you you cut on -
yes I did them - that's why you tuned
into the st. out and livestream is for
jokes but I like relinquish my crown to
Ian over here who is a genius at this
okay
sorry native support coming to Adobe
Creative Cloud which is interesting and
they'll be able to use familiy acts they
love to create a our content and bring
it easily in what does that stand for
you u.s. that was actually an acronym
for something I don't I I don't you as
dink sir universe sorry Universal scene
description I don't know what the Z
stands for three so we'll get back to
you on that one we're gonna check in on
that one a little bit later so we can
use Photoshop to make some of this AR
content and then convert into that
format and a new iOS Apple that people
make the AR experiences and so err Apple
is they're trying to encourage a our
creativity and Scott says it reminds him
of what Microsoft was promising with
Windows 10 years ago I'm gonna show off
some of those immersive designs there's
a measuring app which means there's like
a whole section of the AR app store that
just got destroyed we're doing cute
measurement apps with even I think
Android the first thing they all do
measure things you're like I don't need
to measure things
oMG no more tape no more measuring tape
I'm done I can just play my phone at one
part of the room and then another it
isn't that exciting I mean actually it
is kind of nerdy and cool but you know
I guess we're apples aside we're beyond
that point as a society and we no longer
need those acts right I'm sorry I mean
maybe you're a golfer you can like kind
of like how long you can you can have
that idea the golf I mean do you
remember I remember using tango on like
the Lenovo fab two a Fab Lab - yes and I
was like whoa this is so cool and now
it's just so commonplace that you're
like measuring up and they needed
special cameras and special right and
then all of a sudden it's like oh we're
just going to kill tango in the meantime
this measure app is going to
automatically detect your photo
dimensions so frame shopping can be
easier everybody so you take your print
in yeah you take your print and you
point it at it I guess right just be
like hey go over to that part of the
story you can this all tiny thing you
know way long ago
it's a prince yes it's after we were
chiseling into rock but before the
phones it's really interesting
oh as interesting is again going back to
tango there was actually a tango app
that did something like that for like
here it was yellows and what I could do
is you could actually go at the wall and
then pick points and actually it could
put posters and artwork on the wall
that's kind of preview what it would
look like there was and also the lorries
also had a really interesting
integration you could take your phone
around and it would show you like a path
to where you wanted an item you'd go oh
I need some Phillips head screwdrivers
on it multiple em and then you would
just go okay I'll forward it would lead
you that without yeah that was a cool
use case I like that a lot I mean I was
kind of sad when Tengger died because I
was like but I'm looking at this image
and it's pretty neat outputs the
measurements around the box I mean this
would be great for people shipping stuff
just like a coffee table in your house
great point
it's gonna change things for me cuz I
hate getting a tape measure out of the
tool and it's exciting is Dennis
your games an AR sees me air games are I
think this is kind of utility finding
more ways for it to be more of a more of
a tool that you just have just like you
have a keyboard and deciding camera that
you have AR that could either give you
more information or they can help figure
things out something like that would be
great
ApS FedEx lookout well it's also worth
pointing out that having good
measurements is the next step toward
making all the stuff work better in the
real world like what this really is
about is showing developers we can map
the world around you pretty well so that
you can do some really interesting
things and you know Apple is doing it at
a very consumer e-way look at how we can
figure out this box's dimensions but I'm
sure a lot of developers are sitting
there being like oh my god I can put
anything in the world I know exactly
where it needs to go it's gonna be able
to map inside a room those things are
really interesting and I mean that also
we're talking about Google ends a little
earlier worried and we have the big
speed kind of does something similar on
Samsung where you know she showed an
object and recognizes oh it's a bottle
of wine or give you more info about that
so I'm curious to see if we're gonna see
anything like that right here yeah well
I mean it's officially a our key to and
we get improved face tracking and
realistic rendering support a 3d object
detection assistant experiences so this
is like when you start a game around a
physical object like a toy and shared
experiences so the shared experience is
something that we saw at Google i/o
showing like a cross-platform way to
play a game on iOS and Android using a
are using object persistent objects as
well it looks like it's something
they're at least working on it cool and
they have an app right now or an AR app
right now for yeah they do
in fact I think I have to say one of the
best apps is there's an MBA app that
allows you to put like a basketball goal
wherever you want and you can basically
shoot it kind of reminds me of the old
like toss it app for the paper toss
where you like throw a lot of paper in
the trash can but this is basketball but
the thing that's lacking of it is like
if I wanted to challenge you to an
office game of a our basketball having
you be let's see the what I'm seeing and
our scores register and compete that
would be so cool I'm down for that
I mean I'm intrigued about this
image that we have on screen victory
playing some sort of demo what he's
playing Jenga like he's like knocked a
whole bunch of bricks over in like
different you know our cylinders and
stuff I was like what's the name of that
shape it's been a while since I sir
assembly square is one of the Lego
creative sets 3d object detection we can
recognize our models and bring them to
life oh I went crazy over here this is
this is like amazing this is Lego
brought to life I love like so much you
know I I want to be able to I'm kind of
just like having a little sneak peek ya
know that's right now like little Lego
men move around and they interact and
the fact they even have like little Lego
like comedy shtick where like the guy's
slips on an oil patch and a lego man
Falls and gets up and so yeah look you
could see actually the worlds being
created behind ya that's so neat this is
kind of like what reminds me of the
Minecraft demo remember the Microsoft
event and you know everyone was just
like wow I mean this is not as
mind-blowing but it's leg or and Lego is
such a big get and that's exciting it's
not mind blowing cuz we've seen
Minecraft do this a lot already right
I'm not knocking Lego and trust me my
son eventually will be living the Lego
life I get it but I think that's why
you're not so shocked anymore is that
like you know Microsoft did a really
good job marketing what a are equivalent
of Minecraft was and now we're like
after three years of seeing it like okay
cool the differences I can't hurt my
foot stepping on a our Lego piece
where's here that's right that's right I
think it's not a challenge it's just a
challenge for AR in general is look at
all the space they have to have lego
city like you're gonna have to have a
lot of like flat space to play some of
these things an empty space - that's one
of the biggest challenges for AR I
remember when I got a Kinect for the
first time he was really upset with my
room because I'm in a San Francisco
apartment and it's like you don't have
enough space so I'm like tell me about
it man
and so that was always a big problem and
I'm curious if they've made this
technology a lot better than that but
yeah and maybe you stumbled on the next
brilliant the other thing is San
Francisco apartment AR where it's like
oh this efficiency is now a four bedroom
[Laughter]
putting wall but this is like the our
version now it's using a place for my
stuff
that's all I care about virtually
virtually what's um over there I don't
have to think about it we're seeing some
like dollhouse exploding walls revealing
the and it's inside a ballerina a
drummer and looks like to be the Joker
yeah Batman Lego Batman's meet you I
mean I would not be surprised right that
movie is probably one of the most
popular of the lego movie haven't seen
it what it is so much better than the
lego movie in every way shape and form
that was a flash lego movie is it okay
they've destructed that vibe of like
comedy and entertainment I think really
well I thought the thing about the the
Batman one no spoilers is that is that
there's a lot of references to older
Batman stuff even the 60s Batman yeah
and there's a lot of jokes that if
you've been watching Batman forever like
some of us you you appreciate the
unintended yes exactly
from this demo kids play this well
eventually he might buy these two years
old yes definitely would you buy an iPad
I have I have an iPad I hope it works
because it's what I've had gonna buy a
new iPad for this no I mean I hope to
test it out first and maybe you know
maybe we need that noise from from let's
make a deal though actually Scott brings
up do you need to buy the Lego kits
together
absolutely
money well the old lego app you did not
have to buy the Lego kits but it worked
better if you had Lego kids it would be
cool if it actually I didn't hear
everything that was being said obviously
but it would be cool to see if you could
actually interact with existing Lego
kits I think that's where the real magic
would happen you could actually bring
your kits to life versus you have a are
Lego kits and real ones that don't
interact well that was a mistake with
with the toys to life stuff that like
Disney infinity and Activision with
Spyro right in the what was it called
Lego and so the problem was like when
you saw that you're like oh I have
special and so making this stuff
actually work just with anyway go
possible that is the future like that is
the promise that will make anyone happy
about it right but it has to work right
yeah ok we're on to iOS 12 photos it's
starting with search don't screw up my
photos sharing my biggest problem
categorization is also a facial
recognition has got a lot better it's
really actually pretty good it
recognizes my baby photos as separate
from my son's baby photos and that's
really impressive because we look very
soon no it's also impressive you have
baby photos on your iPhone yes we found
like a cash box of old family photos and
I sent them off to be scanned and I
ingested them into my Photos app and
it's great it's so cool that's cool what
I'm interested to see if they're gonna
talk more about like yeah I and how it's
gonna help with search and machine
learning or gonna be like the buzz terms
we hear a lot that yeah Google almost
overdid it there yeah everything's
machine learning exactly so you can
search or even a broad category like
museum this is exactly like Google
photos you can just search what I term
it you can actually search for an emoji
in Google photos yeah I don't know if
you will be able to do these I in Apple
photos I should hurt sir I mean given
the emoji support is 100 sit there so
you can have it there's a whole new tab
called for you and you know which boots
on this day which everyone loves those
yeah-oh highlighted photos all of this
stuff that you did in previous years has
suggestions on having approve your
photos like hey he's a looping the live
butter and it I let some shared album
active they have some sharing stuff here
so when you share a photo yet their
phones gonna look for a photo from the
same event and suggest sharing them with
you which I think again you know we had
my son's second birthday sorry I'm kind
of obsessed with myself and my
mother-in-law came out to visit for it
which was great from Maryland and she we
had to set up a special shared photo
album to get the photos back and forth
and it was a little complex right and
making it super easy would be really fun
I that's I look if Apple can nail the
sharing thing they have me for life I am
I am gonna be on board and then self
well this is all apparently done with
own device machine learning so not
through the cloud which is a privacy
conversation I was getting back into
that conversation yes come on they've
always been a leader with that too I
mean that's the thing that we've invest
in Apple but also some people wonder if
that's also what's kind of made it hard
for things like Siri to compete with
Google assistant right now right right
exactly yeah
so we moving on to Siri now which is by
far the world's most used digital
assistant accidentally by the way the
thank you feature in Google and Amazon
is genius it is so smart to do that just
when I saw that it got a big smile
across my face I think we're talking
we're joking about an emoji and there's
other features like this and I think
series one where if you try for a while
and it doesn't do what you hope it does
then what do you do you turn it off so I
think if you are like kind of bolstering
Siri to be better and hopefully that's
we're gonna hear a little bit more about
that might encourage you to turn it back
on and try it and hopefully if it works
like it's supposed to keep it on because
right now I feel like that's a common
experience I have a lot my friends and
family have to where's they just turn
off because it just doesn't work well
they actually turn on
they don't know how to control it very
easily right and one of the big things
for me was third-party app integrations
with Siri which so limited and Sirikit
was so limited in it it looks like now
there's a new feature called shortcut so
any app can expose a quick action to
Siri so if you have something like the
tile app because you're losing your keys
you can add a shortcut to Syria like hey
Syria lost my keys and then when you say
it hey sorry I lost my keys
who me yes when you say it Siri will
automatically activate tile and start
ringing your keys that's useful it is
but I think this is gonna get down to
the big problem which is that it's still
gonna require a certain syntax and a
certain like knowing how to talk to Siri
to make it work and look I know that
this is asking way too much of any tech
company but it needs to become seamless
and light and actually intuitive to the
point that I don't need to know these
things any I'm gonna have to set that up
too right I'm have to go through exactly
that and I think even if it's not
exactly seamless as long as it feels
like it's seamless
right it's not and I think that's
something I wrote about last year was
this Siri feels like different Siri is
on my phone that it is on the TV and is
in your car that's on my watch right and
at least making it seem like they know
who I am and they're interconnected even
if they're really not I think that that
will be interesting yeah and something
like about Siri predictions as well so
Siri was also very bad predictions
especially when it came to things like
hey you have a meeting and you're in one
location but your meetings in another
location I'm probably not gonna make it
to that meeting so maybe series
shouldn't tell me that the meeting is
happening then so it looks like say you
order a coffee at Bill's every morning
Siri will suggest it to you on your lock
screen so it's like buying like a belt
on Amazon and then having for months on
end advertisement for belts I'm like no
I bought one I don't know another
although I will say the turnoff be do
not disturb when I leave is smart like I
turn it on like I have do not disturb on
right now in here and I'm gonna I often
forget to turn it back off
off when I leave and having that be
smart would be pretty cool
yeah and that's interesting and then
you'll be able to make the shortcuts
yourself with the shortcuts app and it
will give you like say if you want to
look a shortcut create a stroke up a
surf time it's saying once you you know
activate that it will show you the
weather the ETA to the beach reminded to
put on sunscreen
oh that sounds I don't want to I don't
want to parents I just wanted a little
useful assistant I mean I hope it's not
gonna be that kind of didactic way you
need to put on sunscreen have you been
eating your vegetables the Sun and
burning my skin's burning up oh think on
my phone reminding I didn't so this is a
new show cuz this comes I think
ultimately dad like what do we want
these AI assistants to do you know do
want them to be assistants we want them
to be an interface for getting things
done do we want them to be making things
seem easier which is what I think most
people really want um the idea of like
searching through Syria so you don't
have to type on your phone something by
the way somebody I did see is you can
either type and and to talk to Siri now
well that you could do that on the map
you can accept Siri on the Mac it's just
in the wrong position
I always activate it when I don't want
to well there's a keyboard shortcut
somewhere because I never use Siri on
the Mac how about that right how about
it knowing your behaviors to if I'm on
the Mac maybe I don't want to be
interacting with Siri when I'm heads
down writing an article but when I'm on
my phone on the go maybe that's when it
becoming a little more aware of when I'm
using right do I want it to let me know
I need to get Phil's coffee I could
probably figure that out yeah I think
know if it wants to put like a coffee
order in for me and have it waiting but
I will say like the automatic there's a
picture we have here in the life
tell Ari I'm running late or call into
the shortcuts planning meeting I'm on a
daily call with the editors each morning
and I always have to look through my
phone to get the right passcode and
everything having that stuff be
automated would be really cool and this
gets into the whole problem with these
voice assistants is that we want them to
read our hair our brains and know when
we don't want them but also know when we
do want them and it's it's incredibly
tough and I'm not saying Apple has an
easy job here but this is what it always
comes down to am I gonna be annoyed or
am I gonna be helped and it's different
for every different thing and I think
and I think of this as a more of a
marathon race with these digital
assistants but we're only like a few
steps into the race and yet like Oh
Google's like one step ahead of us or
two steps but there's still miles to go
before we really get to where they
really are whoa I think we're just what
we see in science fiction movies like
Hal or we see robots and movies where it
just seems human and understands you
again knows your preferences and isn't
interrupting you or causing you
inconvenience of being annoying
exactly I would love to nari I mean
obviously because we're not watching it
like with audio if there is some kind of
acknowledgment that yes Siri is gonna
learn
Siri is gonna kind of narrow and you
know to IANS point it's it's not gonna
predict something when you actually
don't want to do that like if you're not
in the meeting or in a location near the
meeting and it probably looks like you
know for all intents and purposes you're
not gonna make time meaning don't send a
text message to the organizer saying I'm
running late if you're in New York and
the meeting is in San Francisco because
unless you have the Hyperloop you're
probably not going to make that meeting
in the next like 25 minutes right well
and I like that's one feature I like
currently on the phone this is like hey
it takes it's gonna take you this long
to get to work today because there's
traffic or leave now to be on time I
don't like that doesn't work for me but
are you driving or are you on a bus
because that is where like if you're
into the suburbs I think this feature is
fantastic but if you're on the bus and
there's like sorry San Francisco
unreliable bus schedule right then it's
actually not that great exactly okay so
now they're talking about apps so
stop Apple news now this is an
interesting one because Apple news there
was a lot of rumors about its coming to
Mac OS and there was a there was a leak
with the dark mode and Apple News as an
icon and a possibility there I don't
know I I don't use Apple news enough for
it to be able to give me relevant
content so I opened it up just like two
days ago and I'm gonna just like find
what it tried to give me a leg or face
ID doesn't work there we go there we go
I got it open
um there's my little internal monologue
just opening my phone every day so
opening up Apple news it just gives me
stuff that I just don't want to read
like Prince Harry interrupted his
honeymoon to make a huge announcement
like oh wait I want to hear more about
let me point out to you and I I Facebook
has this problem too the trending tab
has way too many Kardashian stories for
me and I was really frustrated about it
and I used to complain about it all the
time but this is the problem Facebook
knows me they know that I am hovering
over those Kardashian stories and
sometimes I actually read about
the Kardashians and I just don't want to
admit it to myself that's right that's
the problem two mirror to me it's like
saying I want broccoli but I'm actually
eating candy this is what's happening to
you and I think somebody's nursing is
they're saying that our top stars are
handpicked by Apple News editorial team
which we're hearing they will do
something similar so it's kind of our
Tisdale news where it's like we're gonna
pick the the news that's just for you
are you guys at all Flipboard users I
have but I've always I'm like one of
those weirdos who've always I live on an
iPad that's my main device I know I'm
not supposed to be able to but it's been
working for two and a half years as my
device and I love Flipboard but the
thing with that is the more preferences
you put in the more I use it the more it
gets to know me and there's this
recommendation to become more useful
since you're not at using Apple news I'm
guessing this part of the world's
hottest grandmother says new contender
will have to fight for the title
interesting okay stocks coming to the
speaking of stocks Apple stock is up 1.1
3% so far thank you did you check on the
stock I actually checked it out on
Safari looks like we're getting also an
update on iBooks will now be called
Apple books so someone who has a book on
on that store I'm excited I'm sure it
won't the actual app you mean yeah
completely rebuilt voice members yes
thank you so voice memos is so clunky I
use it all the time and it just it needs
a good scrubbing feature because you
can't you skip and it goes like five
minutes in the future and I don't want
that I want to go back and I want to get
some granularity there it's really yeah
it's difficult also phone calls during
voice memos worst thing ever
because it automatically pauses the
voice memo I'm sorry Siri you should
know better I don't want a phone call
while I'm recording yes you really
should and it's coming to the iPad which
would be useful to definitely yeah I
mean I don't know I'm not a big apple
books user I actually have to say I
think I use it one time for like a NASA
like picture book I read the Steve Jobs
[Laughter]
significant news was as being geared
toward education right we were trying to
have teachers make their like mini books
or something like that for their
students that they could download and
have but uh yeah it seems like it's kind
of like not been like very successful in
that world but it's also not and
successful to replace the Kindle right I
know and there's a so carplay is getting
a mention here we have a smart and safe
way to use your apps in the car already
supports third party audio messaging
voice calling but what you might not
know her
is that with iOS 12 carplay will also
support third-party navigation ways in
google man work on the watch I'll be so
much good this is an unusual step I
didn't I didn't think we would see I
agree no carplay getting better is a
really good move and that's an
understand it's a really understated I
feel like because the only time I
interface with Cal play is when I get a
rental car or I'm driving someone's car
calm playing it like it's it's far and
few between so uh but when you do have
it yeah
having not to use Apple Maps I mean I
know Apple Maps has improved a lot but
ways in Google Maps still have my heart
so it's good to have that option and
okay so now we're talking about the
phone addiction sections warning time
has dropped off the line by the way okay
well we're gonna come back to Jeff a
little bit cuz I know he has some
thoughts on this he actually dropped up
the lines between okay so we're
announcing a comprehensive set of
built-in features to help you limit
distraction and focus so Do Not Disturb
is next there x me don't want to be
disturbed like at night Walter
sorry like sometimes you wake up to
check the time and you're confronted
with a barrage of notifications I mean
just don't look at your phone and just
get a clock like it's such a life
changer I did that and I banned the
phone from my bed me too as well not in
the bedroom big difference I have a
old-school alarm clock it's a really
like dinky little like Boop and it has
is it a bra you guys are speaking
another language
the phone not being nearing I don't I
don't understand its this opens up a
whole world in your head and it's
amazing yeah it's great it just gives
you them clarity so you don't wake up
and you have that panic when you look at
your phone and you see all the
notifications sorry do not disturb but
maybe maybe that's just all the
notifications or wake up check the phone
if you like in and you have it next to
you almost surgically implanted then you
won't get disturbed by the notifications
if you have BND on just go you know I
think we should do is we should be
sending in text messages how's your
sleep tracking okay no there's more
control over notifications this is
basically Apple going oh what's come
what are you complaining about lately
let's fix it doesn't usually acknowledge
they give us something that perhaps we
don't necessarily thought we haven't
thought about we don't necessarily want
but it's actually like key day to day
use cases that we want addressed I'm not
usually addressed know the last few
years have been to step forward one step
back to step forward one step back
absolutely but it is neat that we see
that and you know there are people who
want to claim it was first done here
it's like that's great and we claim that
but on the flip side it's welcomed I'm
so excited about it at the end of it if
it's not the platform that you're using
I mean big deal yeah doesn't matter does
it
using the one that you're not using yeah
so you know but it's it gonna be
interesting to see like how it like how
it performs compared to Android because
the group notifications on Android
especially on pee I'm not 100%
I mean I know sue Bader at the moment so
I currently like judge it just yet not
quite sure if I like how the grouping
works it's called I'm sorry yes
obviously if you have a stack of text
messages they're gonna be stacked all
together instead of listed individually
you know what's gonna bother me about
this is that it's not gonna know exactly
the one text message I want to read on
top yes exactly
read my brain in my mind we're also
seeing app limits as well that looks
pretty exciting here letting you know
about helping you spend less time in
certain app and screen time is the new
tool that will reveal how much you're
using your iPhone all right Patrick Lexi
what are you gonna put put your applet
on first Twitter you know I probably
would put it on my Facebook I use I use
Facebook oh and I think actually if I
looked in the usage data right now it
would probably be like number three or
four I disabled my account a long time a
good figure that's someone finally
you've had me down like oh you're not
Facebook more success been like a year
yeah and they're like oh I'm like it's a
treat test though it is amazing like you
don't miss it it's like a clarity thing
to like yeah I found myself just
mindlessly scrolling through out there
you don't have kids kids are a thing
that pull you back into Facebook a lot
I'm sure just for me it did take up a
lot of my time and I was looking a lots
of people's kids pictures which are
adorable but then I'm like why am i
spend my time right and on the topic of
kids they're now moving to something
about balancing screen time for kids so
you can as a parent we can get a report
on the queue this is great this is great
I'm not there yet but it's great that
they're gonna have this type of stuff in
their downtime which is when you want
your kids to unplug completely and this
is like so Apple had this family
find a set of tools I had a website that
was all about this and so I think this
is like the next logical step
yeah
I'm plugged completely yeah sorry you
can limit the access to movies apps and
websites that you deem age-appropriate
this is a great story for parents not so
much for a you know once without kids
I'm a big fan of like setting timers on
apps like YouTube kids or whatever I set
a timer for them and then it goes off
and they get upset it's a great idea but
then you can't do it in the bathroom you
can but my problem is they still haven't
answered the one thing I want which is
having a different iPad screen for my
kid than my son than myself you know I
really want to be able to control these
types of things and right now Apple's
still playing the game of he has to have
a different device tonight well and do
you think they're able to do that though
because I wonder if of course they do
Mac OS has different users easily yeah
but that's was you know that's been in
the foundation since oh man decade like
a long time ago right before I even iOS
10 I believe but I also wonder like if
because I've been thinking about this I
obviously have is it like okay these
apps you can have different users like
you could have a different user for male
kind of like think of like email almost
or you could have a different user for
I'm Instagram I sure do but I understand
what you're saying yeah I think what the
dream is is to log in and see just like
you have on Netflix or on your Mac you
have the different users and then you'd
again face ID unlocks it for you or your
son I don't getting you're too old I'm
not sure why he would need face I'm
trying to think ahead for him is what
make life better you say now but you
haven't tested it okay I haven't tested
it okay is it gonna give Roger Cheng a
man bun that's the question that when
Roger Chang our our executive editor on
the East Coast tried out Samsung's thing
it gave him a man but didn't he look
outstanding with that man
he was offended look look I mean when
and when Jessica dokgo it he had tested
it out it couldn't deal with her curly
hair yes yes I mean because he's bit
emoji at all yeah I mean it does
I enjoy bitmoji a lot of all of them
even though it's not animated yeah
exactly and I want there's that step to
that direction all right now this is I'm
going to say this will probably one of
those stories that we hear a lot about
even though it's probably this a a fun
feature you might just try once I don't
know I don't know I don't know if it
works so to be fair I thought that
bitmoji was gonna be kind of like
something that I use once and then I
don't use again but I use it all the
time it's it's a great way to kind of
express something in a cute graphic and
also the thing about bitmoji is that it
updates so quickly
so like when remember Yanni and Laurel
yeah I don't know why I said oh my god
that's how I said it yeah when as soon
as that happened bitmoji was on it they
had luck within 24 hours they had
bitmoji that was about that that was
timely alright so there's some demo is
happening now and it's got referencing
law selected mochi and Samsung emoji all
right it should be working very similar
that would be exciting that that way
also again maybe that might also be like
you could have a bit mochi for you and
your kid and have a different set or not
bit much because you called me Mowgli's
that's the thing it's gonna be
interesting to see like how accurate
these look and also the question is do
we want it to look accurate I mean
obviously the Samsung they are emojis
weren't so out there that they didn't
look anything like us at all but maybe
there's a middle ground we don't want it
to look identical to us because you know
there's all aspects about you know our
faces that we love and we don't love and
so maybe we don't want that reflected
accurately do we want a representation
of us that we're happy with it's
somewhere between that kind of like
crazy ridiculous over-the-top
emoji kind of look and then reality well
the other thing too is imagine if you're
doing like a FaceTime call and you were
just not looking like you should be your
me emoji is like Wow me emoji cartoon
Patrick looks great today he's got his
tie on and he has bono glass
like I don't know I want to hold you to
like we have a conversation about this
I'm not the guy to talk about it but I
do know where the limits are okay sorry
we we're seeing the demo exactly know
what the demo is can I point out while
we're thinking about this women on stage
so if I've counted two women yes pretty
good it's pretty good representation
from Apple 5050 5050 so now the actual
screen we say this cheating in Turin we
sing is an I call it know that coming I
size or the world of warcraft' let's
let's have some fun as well so there's a
lot of customization there it's very
much like Nintendo means yeah yeah which
that's another good use of one yeah did
a great job with that
I like this yeah so what I'm interested
to say it's like how accurate it is when
it first captures the face and then how
you can build onto that is it giving you
a representation of what you look like
oh actually we can see the little demo
working right now so you take it looks
like you take a selfie in the special
new mode in the camera app and then
looks like it's gonna do some filters on
your face not entirely sure what's going
on all right this looks very oh no this
I think this is a different demo this is
the messages camera I think cuz this
doesn't look like creating yeah this
definitely doesn't look like reading
anyway well what if it's gonna be like
bit emoji where I could use it across
different apps to I think that would be
the big thing except in Android app ouch
I mean let's be honest right at was not
gonna make this stuff all work with
everything other than iMessage no but
the same time like
if it was like in the keyboard or
something like that like bitmoji is now
where you can have it and pop it into a
text message or a whatsapp or Facebook
that would be really right that would be
neat it would but I agree I don't here's
a dog yeah and having a bunch of
different hats and and the creepy thing
is he'd only makes the face and it
doesn't actually make the body so you
it's kind of cool that's cool huh it's
just real close not creepy on her try it
on real people
exactly oh I mean I'm okay so when an
emoji came out ah I go it a little
broasted because people were like I was
like this is you know it's it's an
exciting way people out probably gonna
you know buy it buy a phone because of
this this feature I don't know if I was
right necessarily but I was excited to
see it and then I never used to it was
really somebody have any of you guys in
this room ever sent in an emoji but just
to test it done like once of friends and
they are so tickled and excited but then
if they don't have a 10 right 9 human
with me emoji head is my new name okay
so FaceTime Thanksgiving dinner he's
just got a lot more interesting there
was a study I read a long time ago that
you will most people right only want to
video chat with five people out of their
lives at any doing that's about it
everyone else it's way not comfortable
so 32 is a lot more than five I'm
curious to see how far it will go but do
you think as mean different people get
their hands on technology and children
are growing up with this that some of
that's just our us adapting to it and
versus growing into and having it always
be available it's like well yeah just
video chat you yeah maybe more common
think about like you know apps like
snapchat which I you know very commonly
used by a younger generation everyone
god I sound so old saying that but you
know it's you know group group video
chatting is is a huge deal there and
it's it isn't such a big deal like us
you know we don't necessarily want to
talk to 32 people but I could imagine
you know snapchat demographic definitely
would want to talk to absolute 32 people
at it that's impressive though and again
what's the scream look like with 32
people a parent I can't wait until next
year I can't wait til the bosses come to
me and say hey we need 32 people on face
but it looks like you know when someone
who's talking they're actively like come
out so the times are gonna move around
can you swipe someone away like flick
them out yes I can't wait to do that to
Aunt Betty I mean everyone's like
smiling faces in this demo right now
they're all happy I don't look that
happy when I'm on FaceTime definitely
because it's that awkward thing about
FaceTime is that when you're in the same
as Skype same with anything else you are
on the call and you're looking at the
other person but then you're kind of
looking at what you look like and you're
like oh no or not could this also be
more of an business use to where you
think of like Google Hangouts get to
sign in and it's that they rarely works
flawlessly but it works pretty reliably
that a lot of businesses you knew that
hey a lot of people have iPhones and to
have a meeting with five or ten other
people now seems like that would be a
very easy I think the business use would
work inside Apple I mean let's be honest
right then the percentage of iPhones out
there and Macs
it doesn't make sense to me I mean maybe
it will right Apple promised when
FaceTime first came out to make it what
are you pointing at
you know it's funny in there live in a
live stream but it says sorry--but emoji
it was fun while it lasts it's like
anyway I am I think you guys have just
pointed out that maybe I'm wrong about
saying that people aren't gonna I put
the extra effort in I get excited about
cartoon representations of me
I really do I do it on every platform
Facebook spaces bitmoji Samsung AR emoji
I just want to get them all together and
mummy I like all together now it's gonna
be that well that's gonna be a right is
your is your emoji you like
cross-platform your next conversation
and yet it's the back end of that is
just gotta be mind-blowing to be not
only let's sharing live video but then
putting a cartoon head on you connecting
with up to 31 other people and then
showing their cartoon heads as well I
think that's mine but don't forget that
Apple originally said they were gonna
open source FaceTime and they never did
and don't even get yeah and so but
that's the thing right like if they done
that how much how pervasive would
FaceTime be if they made that an
opportunity but do you think that was
even like a possibility they said it out
loud
well sing something out loud as we know
an emerging section was a very pleasing
to me happy I forget about it now yes
not check stock right now on the
announcement here you can't type snap
into the tiny type the dollar and snap
maybe yeah oh you can in Google I mean
cuz it's snap Inc is that what it is yes
thank you
sup tanking tanking
sorry yeah you're right here is we are
not stock analysts all right so we're
talking Apple watch being number one I
would just hope that the rest of the
Apple Keynote would just be done in me
emoji just want to say that would be yes
did we see a Craig federighi
I am emoji I didn't see it yeah I'm sure
they made they're sure they're me emojis
we're pretty looking good right okay so
by the way the Apple watch just getting
into that one of my favorite stats about
the Apple watch cuz a lot of people like
to malign it and whatnot and look I've
got one okay I'll admit but what
fascinates me is how successful it's
been and how under the radar that is
like there was a stat that came out a
couple months ago Apple outsold the
entire Swiss watch industry well that is
insane that is insane a hundred year old
companies and Apple smoking them and so
you know it's really interesting to see
where they're gonna push this because
they're already positioned to be taking
over this industry yeah but on the flip
side uh I know I still have what I watch
that I got for my grandfather and I
don't think you're gonna be handing down
your Apple watch you're wearing right
now your child and hopefully he'll have
that that's the thing they're becoming
disposable right they're not jewelry
pieces anymore unless you have the
addition the ceramic no more addition
they got rid of it and I did get a
Milanese loop although I admit that it
was an Amazon but the thing is
definitely they they are like definitely
these things are becoming less of
beautiful timepieces and more functional
pieces of my life which is I mean look I
didn't have a watch
or the Apple watch I mean I have one as
a kid and then I stopped wearing it no I
just I didn't necessary right and then
and then over time like then the then
the pebble came out and I got in on
board and I've been on board ever since
okay so watch OS 5 is is up and they're
gonna start with health and fitness
which is something we were talking about
something that I have a lot of issues
with in terms of tracking fine but then
what do I do with that data and I want
to know like how is it actually gonna
help me I don't want to just close my
rings to me like I I don't know
closing rings to me is not as big of an
achievement as knowing that my
performance in say running is improving
and so I have to then Tony should be
able to do that right they should be
able to do that they should be able to
go your baseline performance was this
you know over time you are trending
faster so I have to use third-party apps
and you know that's fine third-party
apps are totally fine but I don't know
why it doesn't do it natively
okay so activity tracker now has daily
coaching challenges goals activity
sharing etc Tiffany always has a
seven-day competition yes
seven-day competition oh I don't know do
I like competitions we get that I work
right we get we have those like internal
things where it's like we're gonna have
a 30-day competition and the idea is you
sign you are are using virgin for those
who don't know balls and yeah it Tracy
push us but but does it work I don't I
don't I mean the competition is I can't
yeah I do because I think if you can
start incentivizing it is the way for me
to accept a challenge as a motivator and
Tiffany telling you too is not enough I
don't
there's a dollar bill I take a walk down
to the like to the grid to the grocery
store or the drugstore and I'll turn on
the little tracker because I want to get
points in our
in our corporate app right so my wife is
friends with me on the Apple watch
she gets an alert when I finish a
workout workout right she'll turn to me
and she's like really you track that
walk to the grocery store was it that
hard count that's right hey madam they
met a new mutt yoga my progress updates
hiking married heart rate elevation
yeah this is it this is interesting
because I mean like tracking hiking is
different from tracking a run yes and
sorry you know that breakdown has never
been really been easy to do when I was
hiking in Uganda and it was not it was
one of the hardest hike I've ever done
in my entire life it's like vertical
uphill through my it was insane but one
of the things I used the watch through
it and it got in knew where I was in my
GPS he knew how slow I was because this
was not right and you know I'm not that
that active a person but it did not have
stuff like elevation right those things
right I didn't know over time what I was
doing so I don't get any credit with
Apple for having walked through vertical
mud before I like the little humble brag
when I was hiking and I got through it
all my wife would not tell you there was
anything to brag about my performance to
share the pace the pace was depressing
you see you would now like if you if you
did that hike again now you could see
how much better you work that's rights
to progress updates now okay go back to
you gun and climb up that right oh this
is interesting okay so runners will get
a cadence to show current steps a minute
there you go this is what I'm asking for
this is good this is good
and then automatic workout detection oh
so I'm interested to know like if I do
Pilates versus yoga will it no it's a
Pilates workout oh no it's a yeah it
depends on the music
[Laughter]
but I will say the Apple watch is
surprisingly bad at identifying with the
Rings like when you've closed your
activity ring because like it gets the
step ring well and the standing ring but
there are times when my wife will try to
get the egg back whatever it is the
activity ring closed and she'll go for
like a long walk but because it wasn't
hard enough of a walk it doesn't count
toward the active minute yeah I've
always found that the activity ring has
been pretty good evening I'm just
literally walking to and from like my
desk still tracks that for some reason I
do rolling treadmill I'd run back and
forth to my desk but ya know the step
one works sustaining Windows it works
but the activity one never does
identifying this stuff a little better
would make her a happy customer
exactly all right now they talking about
enables you to remain in the moment
while connected to the people you care
about and staying connected with people
you love is a function we're back to
[Laughter]
real-time voice but with the spontaneity
of messaging my favorite part about the
walkie-talkie function and sprint nextel
was that they charged a different amount
for the minute they did didn't they for
the walkie-talkie you are a lucky lucky
person yeah it's so you knew that you
were standing next to someone who worked
for like a like worked in construction
or whatever cuz those were the people
who had the walkie-talkie function on
their phone and it was it was basically
a phone call but it was like for some
reason it worked like a walkie talkie I
never understood it myself but they
charged a different price for it it just
likes imagine getting a phone call
without ringing just would pick up
except she would go be beep
yeah and they made a legally silly I saw
I used to work for a production company
would make like sets for museums or
fashion show stages and we would load
them in and the Teamsters would have
those little
beep beeps and the idea would be like
Phil could be over here and tell Ian hey
could bring the rug for the stage and as
opposed to calling him a text anyway it
would speak beep beep and it would just
say what I said live I think it may be
recorded it I don't think you could
actually conversation right back and
forth yeah I mean you can record back
and then it would beep beep and say what
he said
where's up say pee pee pee we sound like
the roadrunner day of weird noises for
Apple it is but Mike to be fair these
are actually useful interesting updates
no and I would use walkie talkie if I
knew someone had an Apple watch I would
probably use it to prank people cuz it's
funny this is definitely the day of
Apple answering all of our complaints my
one complaint they won't like maybe your
son having an Apple watch and him
playing and doing a walkie talkie like
time to come in or where are you or I
you know look I I enjoy the part of the
dad experience where I yell out the back
door so woodwork is well over the over
the watch I go okay sorry there's not
talking about this Siri watch face the
right information at the right time
which I use this watch face a lot by the
way I like it
although it's not perfect at all I tried
it it's way better than the other ones
I don't know I tried it and I got really
frustrated by it because it will just
wasn't predicting off it wasn't accurate
enough so what was it missing um it was
I don't know it just just didn't I just
think you mean didn't let me customize
it to show what I actually wanted to
just sharp so um you know it would show
me my like my steps and you know the
rings and I didn't want that I wanted to
just take that away and not necessarily
see that I wanted to see like you know
my next meeting and you know the time
and all that other stuff like I just
wanted a more customization I don't
think that we're gonna get that what it
looks like now it's going to harass you
to start walking again so I also really
wanted was just like a persistent like
I'm always on time just so it's like a
regular watch you know
don't have to leave my took that away
they also take away the date and the
date on there too so like I have to like
yeah but I mean I agree with you the
persistent time would be nice and it's
an OLED screen so it shouldn't be that
hard to do it I agree with you right you
know it's also I'm a little more
forgiving of that like when I see the
Android watches that's six of them that
are out there that have the persistent
time on them I'm like time so we're
about 75 minutes into our keynote here
which is long the time has flown
oh sorry if you have questions if you're
watching please jump on this CNET life
watch we will have your watching and
during the I'm sorry happy dad joke
connoisseur and King over here stay and
share everyone thank you very much okay
so it looks like now you don't have to
say hey Siri when you raise your wrist
it just is going to be listening Siri is
very hard to use on the Apple watch
really I don't know why I don't
understand it doesn't listen
no and I'll start it and then it will
like stop listening to me yes I don't
get that on the phone now for me too
because the phone at least is used to
you not holding down the button but I
think the trick and I've had never
watched since day one and I think the
trick is that you hold down the button
but I still can't get it - in my head
correctly yeah so I don't do it that's
annoying it's super annoying it's really
fresh I have the same thing like I'm
dictating something any just stops yeah
and he just doesn't listen anyway
podcasts that's comedy coming to the
Apple watch that's pretty that's
something that a lot of people are
really excited about and a lot of people
really into you can listen to cereal
while you're on your run I just want
Spotify on LTE so I can listen to
Spotify maybe Spotify will make a
podcast of their Spotify service
okay well look like a lot of people will
be very happy with the podcast app
natively coming to the Apple watch sir
I'm very happy for these people these
losers who are described I do I have one
about parenting in tact with a lot of
dad jokes and then we also have the 349
right which every day we 359 sorry but
you know every day that ones like number
60 and technology for the podcasts
overall and then mine is called status
update if you ever want to listen to me
and my about my kid and as I was setting
up for a shameless plug also the idea
that you could mister control these and
listen to them on the go be great yeah
but then I would love because what
happens when I get to her listen to
podcast how much pitch my music every
day exactly okay there's an exercise
black on stage right now there's a demo
this is not why not this is this
competition time is this tiffany tiffany
stop stop try to make better than me
well you know the Jim Kipp thing is
really interesting I am NOT and no I'm
not a gym rat at all so I don't I don't
but the idea that making this stuff easy
to track when I was a gym rat back in my
20s would have been awesome I would have
had so much fun cuz I was one of those
guys with like a little pad of paper and
writing it all down and it was really I
mean you know one of those guys I'm a
nerd okay but you know even back then
the quantified self won't go in paper
how the idea that you can do it now with
Jim kid is actually really cool how
would you like to be the Apple employee
be like yeah we want you to do the
keynote oh my god I'm so excited if
you're gonna work out the entire time oh
really
okay Lululemon's in front of everybody
in front of everybody there and being
broadcast around the world oh I don't
know if I want to do it now at least
you're not making him do yoga
there's our dog
making them talking wild on the trip I
think a very interesting presentation
showing biking on stage before an apple
the first time anyway I think the Jim
Kay as you're saying like I yeah used to
be a member of a gym and because I moved
there's no gym anyway long story short
now I'm a runner and like if I was still
at the gym gym I would definitely use
this feature however I'm gonna be
interested to see I like the platforms
which that gym kit supports because I
think at the moment it's a fairly
limited to a couple of different
exercise initial peloton one of the
biggest are part of it yes but probably
don't until they upgrade too right
exactly so you can yeah hopefully you're
gonna have to go to you know you're
gonna have to be going to one of these
gyms that has Billy new equipment
otherwise you're still gonna be manually
tracking this is why my yoga fan right
there is no gym kit for yoga your you're
just doing stuff on a mat yeah way
easier I I guarantee if someone's gonna
figure a way to put bluetooth on that
mat they probably have like haptic
feedback to vibrate if you're doing the
move I want to yell at my kids I don't
want to walk near my stuff's I can have
notifications
I have many layers I do I do when I go
to the gym and I see people with all
their apps and they spend more time
doing the app than working out you know
it's like feel like dude just just work
out like why are you gonna be a busy
with your phone and see you didn't like
me back then Ian sucks
guys really busy not working out right
you think the walkie-talkie while she's
on the - she's so glad that's all we've
been choking for five minutes
to do a good 40 minutes to get a decent
bike they've had rehearsals - it's like
alright we can do that again Oh Tiffany
we're so sorry the whole section again
it's about the timing thing to keep
going well Tiffany's just learning what
it takes to be better than us that's
what it comes down and then challenging
us to a challenge but she knows she'll
win that's right so it's like what's the
what's the Fred Astaire line and Ginger
Rogers that Ginger Rogers did all the
dance because Fred Astaire could do but
backwards it's like that's right the
female whatever name is doing all the
presentation like Fred Fergie and Tim
Cook while working out he's been he is
up early every day there's a there's
some really good profiles of him out
there about it he's up every day early
he's in the gym early early early and
then he's to work so if anybody should
be on that on that bike it should be Tim
Cook to people well and you're joking
but I could see these but I could
totally see it going that way all right
like your competition might record me my
stuff in my little Modi's going it's you
kind of like when you play an antenna
they have like the ghost version of like
Mario yeah erase the gross version of
myself well you could erase the ghost
version of like me if I'm running at you
if we're in a challenge or Ian yeah this
is not a real thing but it could work
right so I again Apple you just take
mine go enjoy our livestream here we
have Gabriel saying work out and doing a
keynote pay that woman extra Wow yes
tweet and like him oh you got a retweet
and like from me I mean like Gabriel
jump on this seen it live hashtag on
Twitter we'd love to hear your thoughts
okay so it looks like there are some
more functionality to the watch like you
can extend your popping on the meter I
mean I guess that's useful I actually am
a parking person with USF Park here in
the city they have NFC little readers in
the parking things and they've never
worked
I don't know what they were designed for
but if they can make that stuff work I'd
rather that than having to remember the
stupid number I thought it was illegal
it's a like feed your meter right and
you're supposed to move or something I
don't know you're not supposed to
continuously if you're like me and
you're trying to save 6 cents because
that's what you are then you know like
oh I'm not gonna do the full two hours
I'll do 30 minutes and they're like oh
man that the the USPS line is bigger
than I thought you have to extend it way
even where are you parking that it cost
6 cents I'll take $6 ok all right so we
have a new pride watch face which we
already knew about actually and it is
five months it is Pride Month so yeah
isn't it now a rainbow band as well
available today uh and that's that's it
for watch OS 5 you can add student ID
cards to the wallet on Apple watch
that's cool give me my clipper card on
the watch and I'm gonna be all for it
get rid of my wallet next step next step
alright sorry we have next up what's
coming up we have TV whoa okay so this
is interesting this is something a lot
that we want to do on Apple TV dolby
atmos fix the remote what do I have to
all be Atmos at home Lexie oh yes that's
it's coming like it's part of my whole
yeah I've said this it's on the roadmap
supposedly it's just that we haven't had
any kind of idea of when it's gonna come
at all so it's I I don't know I I am I
have transitioned so much to being a
headphones and iPad watcher that you may
hang out I I don't know if I am I also
look I get to go to some of the movie
screenings like at Lucasfilm or at
Dolby's headquarters and so I now don't
like going to normal theaters I'm so
spoiled so you know the idea of atmos at
home too
it's like I got the kid it's it's a
small screen I'd rather just the iPad
okay well I have two people like me who
like sound you love sound quality but
you you have a specific set of
circumstances true I am a big audiophile
for me like when I listen to to audio I
want it to sound the best whether it's
on my laptop whether it's on my you know
my phone wherever I mean I'm not
listening to stuff in like flak audio
like let's be let's be honest I'm a
realist but like you when it comes to
like you know TV I want Dolby Atmos
things that made XE happy has gotten
bigger thunderous audio demo made the
theater resonates I don't know if that
means everyone was clapping or it was
just a or an earthquake but it obviously
resonated with the crowd well with me
particularly thank you that's nice it
finally happened oh good okay so it
sought it was on the roadmap and it
actually I will say Atmos is a pretty
cool technology like when I first got to
see it the idea of they showed me um it
was the the chase scene in The
Incredibles right and they had like the
things flying around and it was amazing
to hear that I was like this sounds
really cool I don't know if it's
actually gonna change my life but it's
super cool
it's amazing how well how much it's
taken on and like how much people like
it but I think that's the point of it
too it's like it's it's does so well and
you don't think about it yeah does it
just makes it more immersive yeah
exactly
and I think that's ultimately when we
talk about stuff like AR BR that's kind
of oh the future VR has to have
immersive all right i mean that's where
dolby atmos just can actually matter but
now that we have this Tucson a living
room set TV
I'm excited about that right I would
upgrade to that I know I mean like have
you heard at Mawson like the huawei mate
book for example I have not it's
literally just a little strip just the
speaker strip it sounds crazy like the
sound is coming from all around you and
you're like this it looks like it's
gonna be tinnies terrible sounding
speaker when you just look at it and you
listen to it and you go okay that's
weird to see phones now like with the
razor phone last year when I got to I
got a kick out red hydrogen one phone
doesn't have at most but has a 4d way of
tracking moving sound and it was
definitely louder than the razor phone
this is a prototype I should say but I
thought that was cool that these phones
are now the more high-end ones are
getting into that because we still don't
have great real audio in our iPhones or
even some of the other smart phones on
Android that raise our phone I think is
one where it's like we want to give you
the best experience for that yeah make
you see more of that I'm just I'm just
intrigued like you know at most an Apple
TV you know next iPhone but it's a that
would be say that the super high-end
audio stuff I don't know how many people
like are truly into it to the point
where they'll pay more um one of my best
well one and Lexie absolutely I'll give
you that but there's this 3d headphone
startup you may have heard of called
Asik right they had a Kickstarter they
were super aggressive especially with
reporters sending us non-stop emails
about their Kickstarter it failed the
company collapsed because they just
couldn't get enough people interested
yeah and I think that that's that's
something as well and that was supposed
to be cheap affordable good 3d audio
headphones boom right so I you know
maybe it's really cool if it's
integrated and it's part of the price
but making me pay extra I'm not sure
right and like you know take a look at
like you know the Neil Young digital
music service and that and that Riya
triangle yeah it's you know it died you
know no one no one bought it but on the
flip side like pushing the innovation
that way then allowed adoption more mass
adoption your son he's gonna have an
iPad that's gonna have Dolby Atmos at
some point maybe not this year but it
will happen right okay be called Dolby
infinity or whatever is becoming a thing
of the past
sorry talking about a bunch of different
partners and and you apps on channels on
Apple TV sorry there are now in France
and working with it now Plus which is a
we've been on CNET has been used for
them many times they use program they're
really nice people but they are like one
of the biggest out there in France
and then you can use Apple TV to access
more than 100 live channels in the u.s.
charter spectrum will be coming to Apple
TV later this year up to 50 million
homes will be able to choose Apple TV
signing sign-on so you race on Odin
that sounds awesome yeah a single
sign-on thing like it's 90% effective
for me like it's cast right Xfinity I
don't have cable otherwise where we've
been court cutters since 2007 but we
have HBO now and so vlogging sometimes
HBO app cuts out doesn't work on the
iPad it automatically signs in every
time now but on my Apple TV it doesn't
always work so you know the promise is
there but I've always thought to myself
it knows I'm a Comcast I'm on the
Comcast network right now it also knows
it's my IP address why can't it just
work right so I'm sure that's what
they're doing is that they're getting a
lot better if and if they made it like
kind of like that the handoff feature a
little bit when you again pairing like
your ear pods or assigning the Wi-Fi
that would be just remarkable we're just
pops up and it just goes it doesn't seem
like it should be that complex but as we
have talked about much over the last
couple hours this stuff is way harder
than we think it is which is why it's
taken so long for a lot of this stuff
that are common-sense things to come out
and they might not be like the flashiest
features but I would take some of these
conveniences and polishes over a big
flashy update yeah I mean the
interesting thing is I mean so charter
spectrum it's gonna be the first to
support this zero sign-on so it's I mean
this is like while the idea sounds great
again as you're saying it's gonna take
these providers to come on board to
actually make this a thing I mean and
how many people have like how old is the
cable box in your house or your parents
house Miami I think my dad's had a box
it's like seven or eight years old right
so I mean you could take it those
lifespans of cycling through those to
catch up to I thought Stein wants an
Apple TV remote finder app you're here
at Scott just needs it needs a ability
to ping it put a tile on it or something
but it's so small the tile would just
would be so annoying on yeah
uh okay so on the iPhone it will
automatically be installed in a control
center so a way to control the Apple TV
which I have it running on my control
center already yeah I've controlled my
Apple TV that way and it works pretty
well we have we have a harmony remote at
home which my wife hates how many is
great because it's there like six things
that have to turn on and she hates that
you know they all have their own weird
intricacies right like sometimes the tv
turns on correctly sometimes the stereo
which is connected to the TV because the
TV speakers are terrible doesn't turn on
correctly or it doesn't move to the
right input and so even if you have it
all set in one action it's yes really it
doesn't always get it okay and so that's
part of the problem right it works like
pretty well but when it doesn't work
it's terrible and so she gets really
frustrated with it and I totally respect
her concern or frustration right better
than eight different remotes to do you
know but she wants is the old days of
one TV it works right yeah and the Apple
TV almost is there but we also have a
stereo right these screen savers for the
Apple TV the backgrounds I mean they the
Apple TV screen savers were always like
some of the best stuff out there right
super high-end really nice right they
the camera panning through London was
beautiful and it was so popular some
people tried to hack it to work on the
Mac which I thought was a pretty good
indication people liked it right that's
a great idea so there's now an earth
image we choose but it's missing
Christopher Reeve okay they're doing a
nice it's a lot of time on this the
screen savers I mean they are beautiful
but and that's to say we are past an
hour-and-a-half mark for thank you
Patrick thank you very much because
there's so many things we want them to
talk about and address and yeah it's
also been like wow we are already an
hour to half into this I know and
considering a week you know we're gonna
have a two-hour caner and we have a two
and a half out at Cana really
we've only got 25 minutes well we
haven't even talked about Mac OS yet let
alone if there's things that are gonna
be developer stuff to go between I think
we may want to get out our camping
equipment and just be okay all right
well it looks like Tim Cook is back up
on stage according to the live blog the
stream is a little bit behind but
speaking of which next up is the Mac
okay this is good all right sorry I want
to take a little bit of a vote on the
name right so is it gonna be called high
high sierra is it gonna be called mojave
it's the Koya Sonoma Ventura like
they've taken out a bunch I'm riding
Mojave because if you looked at the
leaked image I toss and I miss I miss
the cats I'm gonna be honest no there's
plenty of cats you can't go for house
cat names next yeah like little house
cat Mac OS tabby sounds great
I do not getting off that train yeah I
think I think a lot of people miss the
cat so I'm gonna say in I'm good with
the Californian landmarks because
California's awesome this is a lot of
stuff in California I mean when they
exhaust you know what else doing for
cats all right Craig federighi back on
the stage anyway more free software
updates right the mac free update was a
big deal I remember paying mm-hmm 129
dollars to get what was it leopard
probably Snow Leopard or leopard Leopard
yeah no Snow Leopard I think was the
first but that was a 29 or 30 9.30 all
right or whatever yeah but I remember
it's like paying actual money for these
updates and it kept people from updating
obviously which was a huge
garetty problem but it's really good
that they do that right okay here we go
here we go the name is gonna be revealed
as you may be aware I'm naming Mack
releases L hi Capitan hi ok here we go
here's the big reveal
it's coming this suspense is killing me
yes is there a Western is there what
north side that comes out what if they
totally change it all together nope nope
mahogany hobby it's in the lake was
there with the dock mode - it was good
to have well now we know how future
versions could be called Sequoia Sonoma
winter because those are the other
things that they trade for that's right
possibly possibly possibly all right
Oh interesting that talking about dock
right now I think because beautiful in
the day and beautiful at night just like
your Mac Mojave like say it's a Mojave
again Mojave she does say it a little
different how do you say Mojave Mojave
actually I said originally I think
Mojave bhave the salt returns of us
enough of the cow behind it CK a
fragrance of a smell like the desert and
live in your dark mode or night mode
were they calling it my mother I have to
see the image is pretty cool sand dune
is pretty nice okay as you can see it's
not just the dock in the menubar it's
the windows by the content of the
windows it makes photographic content
pop off the screen I have to say true
because if you think about Lightroom we
think about Photoshop all that word
natively now and it does really help
with image editing it really does same
on iOS - if you look at that and even
like Microsoft Office has like a little
kind of dark skin
for when you're reading you know reading
mode on like a document or like a
PowerPoint yeah I haven't used office in
a long time Google Docs
maybe I'm sure you met Pages and Numbers
and Keynote right yes yes yeah I use
them all the time that we can use here
is it or a message isn't I that's I
that's gonna look sick on your on your
laptop you have a Space Gray laptop it
looks like Space Gray
let's dark mode on iTunes yeah it's all
over
do you notice the words iTunes and
awesome in the same sentence well it
looks like iTunes still lives for those
people it's literally a coat of paint
talk about that could be a whole like
use the Xcode little demo that we saw
from that leak oh yeah I hope you can
decide what's dark mode and what isn't
because the mail app does not appeal to
me in dark mode this is just my first
reaction but no but even like hey for
these apps I want this app to open a
dark dark road every time like if I'm in
final cut or I'm in maybe like a photos
app but maybe I want my browser to be
not in dark mode right email not to be
or message I think they're 20 years too
late like email already passed email
already passed it says emo emo sorry emo
emo goth so maybe we'll have like maybe
night modal be the new you know 90s
about guys I'm sorry to tell you in the
fashion 90s back huge thing right now
movie called Jurassic world coming out a
little maybe started in the nineties yes
I saw the wu-tang clan last night
starred in the ladies let's not go
sleeveless that's all I'm saying
okay let's let's not go there No thank
God
- the photos up because I know yes I'm
going to do it in ultimate dark mode
this is an interesting thing in our
thing she says you could scrub your
stacks
I hope there's some more context oh the
stacks of like category stacks yeah so
you can put everything that's on your
desktop this is super so for someone
like me my desktop is such a mess and
it's full of a bunch of different like
screen captures video files like random
things and so to having them like all
stacked in one place that looks really
useful I would use that absolutely I
think for also people that make it worse
because Siri can be like could you
please clean up your desk program where
it's like hoarders for your digital
hoarders like Oh your digital desktop
was clean do you really need this
receipt from 2014
I always has an activation code for this
app I might use now I was joking a
little bit this some of you haven't
heard today it all was a little bit of
their content we hear lots of stories
about Apple producing content and gonna
be launching shows but I didn't I did
they did say that they're like they're
capturing everything in 4k for Apple TV
like a bunch of old movies they
mentioned that during the game which is
kind of cool you haven't sort of seen
because you know always the Apple is
making a big push into original content
yeah where's my Apple TV shows besides
the karaoke apps don't have a new
competing show from Netflix to compete
with Netflix called Apple is the new
black okay that was a bit with the other
Netflix joke I love choice from Sesame
Street by the way if you didn't know
Sesame Street
a lot of joke cover stuff parodies so
they had one called orange is the new
snack back into the 90s heartily okay so
it looks like there's a new gallery View
mode
yeah so eat somewhere close back cover
flow Oh see I never was a fan of cup of
was you know iTunes a colorful this
looks like cover flow but I'm seeing
like some information on the sidelines
yeah that is useful but I mean I'm so
used to just pressing like what command
I I mean okay cool
it is weird like these these little
nitpicky things that really make or
don't make certain things because Mac OS
have been around for over a decade like
great like since 1999 so like 15 or 19
almost two decades yeah Winston's been
around for a while but the point being
like it's been refined refined refined
mostly pretty well but yeah some of
these look pretty good yeah definitely
alright um markup tools and watermark
PDF we're in watermark documents when
you click on uh yeah so I mean this is
also something that happened in Google
i/o that I was kind of really interested
in a lot of these kind of now first
party integrations killing off a bunch
of third party apps that know if they
made their bread and butter doing these
things which is a common conversation
about in the most recent years but it
used to be that WWDC was the the death
watch for apps I remember when they
started doing different screens right
when you had different desktops and
there was a really popular desktop app
out there that was like got kilt and
they were so sad about it but you know
well I'm doing like one of my favorite
things in preview is adding digitally
signing my name with that signature so
some of these again small features
coming from other things like the
watermark thing is definitely you get
that in Photoshop or Adobe products just
need to see them being integrated or a
few
permission slip right now yeah well this
is now talking about screenshots and in
mocking up so this is kind of like what
we saw in iOS pretty much you know the
annotations with that like how many guys
for the iPhone tens here
how many axonal screenshots do you have
50 another problem is there not a
problem actually
you take the accidental screenshot but
you don't save it because you know maybe
how many do you accidentally take very
rare I take quite a bit yeah I don't
have that problem I see the thing is I
found with a case this case in
particular is much better at risk
limiting the number of accidental
screenshots when I go naked without the
case it's not sounds kind of weird when
I don't have the phone the case this
naked eye it is much like more likely
for me to do accidental screenshots
especially from gripping up and I think
you know that I prefer not having cases
on phones I mean living wild and free in
the world with my phone so maybe I
should put a case I mean but I would do
that I would do that in a heartbeat yeah
searching up to like our live stream a
bit too yeah I mean it just looks like
this some more annotation stuff
happening and screen capturing for video
inside screenshotting oh I like this is
really useful it's right now you have to
go into QuickTime yes the screen record
yes you do and you have to like plug
your phone in and if you want to do that
it's it's a long convoluted process re
if you're doing it on your phone if
you're doing it on the unjust desktop
yes what QuickTime you go into the
screen recording mode and it is
convoluted yeah this is looks like it's
much more efficient way to do it and the
number of times that I need to capture
my screen he's a lot more than I ever
thought it would be yeah especially it
working here exactly well there's a lot
of like useful tools in there and I like
reshape and resize and one thing I
really like talk about we haven't really
talked about the touch bar but I'm
curious to see if they do address some
of that and these updates anything is
more developers but well my favorite
things is when you are doing screen
recording it's be able to toggle them on
and off in the touch bar I think that
it's like one of the times I'm like this
is useful it is useful but like that one
time
time like 50-50 predictability of like
working out when I'm in the app and then
if I'm in a quick time doing a recording
at the same time sometimes the touch
bird doesn't have what I want it to have
on it at the time so I kind of forget
that I'm doing a screen recording and
then I end up just stopping it in there
in the menu bar anyway so I want to see
how this new this new screen capture for
video works it looks really useful so it
looks like continuity is next up talking
about the way that your devices are
talking to each other how you can you
know basically pick up um you know doing
something on your iPhone on your MacBook
and vice versa so there's now a
continuity camera so in the Keener out
saying there's a space for a perder
they've got a photo of Craig federighi
up here uh you can click on it and then
it lights up your phone so you can take
the photo and it instantly drops it into
that presentation that's pretty sweet
yeah that is pretty cool and it works
with scanning documents too um so you
can take photos still doesn't even
capture video again goodbye to those
party apps that that do that sort of for
you and that's the same thing happen at
i/o - I remember going oh well bye to
all those scanning apps leaves all those
people to develop new apps that true I
think also one thing there were some
rumors about maybe more iOS and Mac OS
integration and whether that was on the
developer end or on the consumer end
wasn't very clear yeah but one thing
I've always appreciate it as a consumer
is stuff like continuity or even this
morning I had posted something maybe to
Instagram and I wanted to have it on my
Twitter but the Twitter is on my
computer so I just copied it and then
it's in the clipboard on my computer
like stuff like that I love I absolutely
love like the hammer always forget about
that feature thank you for reminding me
because I constantly go oh and then I
end up like sending myself a message and
then I go oh I actually forgot I'm
signing to the same Apple ID I don't
actually cut and paste that's the thing
like it's these right there there I just
you actually have to involve them like
every day into your routine for you to
remember them Apple new is coming to the
Mac Obama and stocks stocks there we go
um so I don't know you would be consumer
of news like you know like would you do
in a dedicated app see I quite like the
act of going to individual sites or an
Agra
like Google News which is I mean exactly
what this is just in and out I don't
know if I wanted it up it's like I feel
sometimes we are the same person I'm the
same way I've been like a news at Google
calm person forever and I just love the
way I don't know just I really
appreciate ways kind of selected for me
as well as just it's there and I can go
away from it's not always trying to get
my attention like Apple news really
wants my attention but maybe there's
ways to control that and maybe it's
something where I would have in a
separate window now I'd have to try it
out and I feel like the more I kind of
go down the Apple news hole I'm like yep
because it is getting really good
predictions for me the more you use it
but then now I have an Apple news one
have a Google News one with their new
app I have Flipboard since I still use
so it's kind of like one of these is
gonna win out I don't know which one yet
I don't know I don't know if it will be
Apple news for me but we'll see
voice memories though coming to the Mac
this is good I use this so much I mean
journalists generally do use voice
memories or know whatever voice
recording app quite a lot and sorry
seeing it integrated into the Mac is a
good thing um and that's that's that's
it you know voice memories it's just
it's there it's good it should have been
there and a lot earlier on it should
have been a lot better earlier on it's
such an easy thing to fix I bet you can
scrub with that touch bar but that's
gonna happen well I do love doing that
it's really good I like it a lot okay
sir security and privacy is up and there
was just a little a little nod to the
home app coming to the Mac you have to
control smart home devices I think Megan
and Andrew from Kentucky will be very
keen to hear that yeah ed liked how
Andrew kind of phrased at how they were
in front of everybody but then other
people caught up in front and it's
similar I could be said about Siri -
yeah it was really better before its
time and the other people gotta cut up
so usually Apple's not first and usually
a Tweaker an adapter of something that
has been out for a while and yet in
those two categories Syrian home they
were mostly first at least on that scale
right so I'm really excited to see what
they do and
if they're able to make it as flawless
as it is between your Apple devices as
using other connected devices and
appliances and stuff like that I'm
excited too you're right and you're
making think of it yeah sure absolutely
it's a great point and now obviously the
privacy and security I'm kind of
interested that Apple didn't lead with
this because normally that's kind of
like one of the things like front and
center up top
so obviously reiterating again on you
know today to our usage remaining
private Apple the sort of Apple devices
checking in with you to basically before
you grant permissions that's we know
that and what better way to do that than
putting it about two hours into your
presentation and so now on Mojave we're
extending protections to include your
camera and microphone as well as
protecting sensitive parts of your
filesystem and this is protected by
default according to right battery keys
on stage and I think that's good it's
gonna be a conversation we're always
gonna be having yeah the privacy and the
fact that it just does it for you and
people I think people are concerned with
it I don't know if there is concern with
this journalists are on how it is using
my data and stuff like that they just
want things to work
Facebook's a great example of that but
on the flip side I think as they're able
to push the technology of stuff that
needs your data like Siri or home or
searches and stuff like that and compete
with those companies that don't feel
like they're protecting data as much to
sacrifice that Venus that would be
pretty cool definitely that's that's the
kind of better thing apples we're making
right yeah and so in Safari now I'm
dramatic tracking detection was last
year because last year they said
tracking now there's dramatic traumatic
tracks dramatic tracks so wait you look
at a product on one side and it follows
you wherever you go
sorry hey we just you want a one sign of
fall do where you go that's good or bad
that's like it's we're shutting I saw I
haven't I haven't come across this
because I don't yeah
okay oh that's smart okay okay so that
is being shut down okay okay shut it
down shut it down
all right sorry we the Mohave we're
making it much hot if the track is to
create an unique fingerprint so
basically following you around wherever
you go um so that's that's interesting
and now if you click on it looks like
the kind of thing what char is saying
here is if you comment fields share
buttons can be used to track you if you
don't click on them but if you do click
on one now you'll get a pop-up asking if
you do want to give it mission which is
just another granular way to kind of get
get you across that that's cool bow
that's pretty neat yeah well we're gonna
just get so many pop-ups I mean it's
gonna be asked for my location okay's
you know yeah but I mean the thing is
that once he grant it once to an app it
should be it's fine from there on in I
thought it was only for location it's
only 24 hours so you you can so you can
also go into the settings and make it
and give it always access all the time
so there's three layers there's like
never and there's only when using the
app and then always sorry there's there
always to do that so it's a constantly
either in the background or always just
you know I don't know what I may have
time to do that cuz I'm still working my
way through the gdpr emails have that
add that to the list of going through
all my websites to given permissions
yeah another woman on stage which is
great um and he who's the marketing
manager for the app store so we're
talking about the Mac App Store so I
think last year WWC we had a huge
overhaul to the iOS App Store and that
was you know a big dramatic change a lot
of people didn't like how there was just
one big app front and center as soon as
you open it and then below the fold
there was all the other content and so
that caused a lot of a lot of debate I
quite like the new design for the app
store I'm very used to it now I know at
the time a lot of people didn't like it
maybe I didn't like it at the time
either I don't remember what I like to
hear it was different it was different
and I think it depends how you've used
the app store before but what's neat now
is they've definitely built a case that
it's helping apps and as Ian was talking
about I don't know two and a half hours
ago yeah
like natural that would come to the yeah
I'm curious who's the people writing
that's because there's people must be
are authoring that and right they have a
team of writers they've hired and I've
run across a couple of them in my
travels okay and so they definitely like
they're hiring ex journalists they're
hiring PR people and they're writing
like real writers it's pretty crazy when
you think about like how much effort is
going into editorial efforts at Apple
when you know they're making a devices
company well because services is now
such and I'm sorry let me to talk over
but I was to say I think part of it too
is we see that happening with already
with Google and Facebook where they
don't call themselves media companies
but if anything else they're advertising
companies with our media Flair and I
think that's also seeing that with Apple
news like as they're pivoting more
towards that being editorial and the app
stores definitely with that so if it's
curious because now these are the people
who are now kind of filtering the things
that will come to me news wise and media
wise and and the thing I always bring up
whenever that conversation carrot turns
that way is are these two people we want
to trust to do that I do they have
serious journalism training I mean I
hate to sound like such a such a like
pedantic person about it but like have
they worked in a real newsroom do they
understand how journalism works do they
understand the process and what it takes
to get stuff verified and all of that
and how do they decide because they're
at a weird intersection right I have to
worry about CNET as an editor they have
to worry about everybody and so how do
they make these kind of calls it's I
believe that's hard for Apple news their
editor-in-chief they actually have
issues called it energy came from New
York Magazine though they're definitely
pulling some people from the blower yeah
but the criticisms that came to Facebook
for the trending tab right and how they
hired contractors who a lot of them were
straight out of school and it's like how
are you how what gives you the right to
make these types of decisions it's very
weird and maybe it was very I mean I
would think it's fair to say well that
was very
naive a Facebook because I don't maybe
they didn't think the future would get
that much traction and yet it's become
the center of so many controversies here
in the US and abroad which is why they
killed it up yep alright back to the Mac
App Store looks like a couple of changes
this and the Mac App Store has been one
of those sad sorry states I mean like I
go there and I'm not interested nothing
here for me and I know a lot of
developers felt the same you know it was
sort of not really a place where they
could feel like you know their app was
gonna get surfaced and and there was
enough positive content around that so
now there's like video previews um they
autoplay which is strange so I thought
you just be able to go okay well just
want to see what it's like anyway the
new this new discover tab this ratings
and reviews upfront you can browse by
category and there's even tutorials too
sorry
office 365 is coming to the new Mac App
Store later this year it was like my
room CT that's pretty exciting I would
do I mean unless you're already paying
for a white room well that's a curious
thing is would it be a subscription like
rumors that like a still making no I
don't think I think what probably is
going to happen is that they're doing
subscriptions through the app store just
like for Netflix okay so now looks like
we're talking a little bit of gaming
metal okay if it's the 90s coming back
I'm gonna save that for the an emoji
isn't there a sequel coming out for Bill
and Ted now the 90s are back aligned the
planets sadly George Carlin's Omar with
us
why not I would get CJ Carlo would be
awesome or they could or they could
probably do a voice imprint I mean he
did so many episodes of Thomas the Tank
Engine that they probably have his voice
I think that in his every year he
basically had a new stand-up special to
the literally hours of him why we are in
the weeds I'm okay bringing up George
okay so they're running through a demo
of a Unity game walking through a forest
all rendered live on a macbook running
an external GPU so that it's now support
for that they also showed some
benchmarking scores before I totally
missed I because I got that in the weeds
which I was asked to do I think you guys
play games on your Mac I know I honestly
I mean occasionally steam games become
an Xbox and Playstation person switch as
well this Ricker's as much as we want to
integrate all of our devices do
everything I still like going to a
Playstation or to switch for games or I
used to do see them I haven't done
steaming or gotten pages either I mean
that's like that's to show you how
little I game on the Mac which is but I
think that we are not representative of
the gaming world seem is very much a big
thing nowadays
I mean PC PC is we talk a look at metal
and developing games for Mac what that
where that audience does it maybe it's
an audience that is waiting for
something to happen I think it's
absolutely it's waiting for that I
remember getting like my first like
Macintosh color classic for college to
play mist on yeah and the thing and then
you had no other games really I mean
like actual games maybe like an early
version of like Tomb Raider or something
like that I've imported over but yeah
games has always been kind of a weak
point on Macs yeah and it's not for lack
of the hardware I don't think no its
DirectX is the big problem
DirectX is so good from Microsoft
that you know people tried to get it
better on the Mac they had OpenGL and
all these other things while this turned
nerdy second but you know that but it
was I mean that really made a difference
for a lot of people but the external
GPUs might make a big difference I mean
yeah that could that could at least give
them the power and then the question is
do they have the right technology to
back up these games and also make it
easy for them to port right oh yeah you
build a game for the Xbox right now it
basically runs on a PC right you build a
game for a net for the Xbox you have to
put a lot of work in to make you work on
a Mac and we've saw earlier and earlier
this year they were talking about the
professional ends coming out we had iMac
Pro a little we hadn't seen anything yet
for the Mac Pro but acknowledgement that
a new Mac Pro would come out twenty nine
twenty nineteen yeah that could be maybe
a year and a half even if they did it
like December 30th well they do that two
more days before the year you're
promised it would be exactly ok so
there's some machine learning stuff so
some in terms of improvements in
acceleration with metal in machine
learning um and uh how we come to the
question that we've all been asking the
fact that Mac and iOS they're very
similar and share a lot of elements are
you merging Mac OS and iOS I'm waiting
for the I think they're gonna do it for
developers but not for consumer so yeah
I think being able to develop on the Mac
unlike the iPad pro is probably gonna be
a big deal I'm bringing Xcode on right
but doesn't mean I'm gonna be playing my
iPad app on my Mac as a makes sense it
makes sense to keep them separate I
think for right now I don't really do do
you think oh I don't know I mean to me
like the iPad the functionality would be
vastly improved if I had access to I I
can understand
I do it I totally understand why they do
it but the iPad and the Mac Pro to me
and so another mic right there and the
MacBook is heard like interchangeable I
could use one in place of the other and
I would want same functionality carried
across like a like a clamshell iPad is
really what we're talking about with a
keyboard which is basically what the
iPad pro yeah it is that's what it
doesn't happen to have a dedicated him
really a sport or a trackpad
yeah okay so now they're gonna give us a
little bit of a sneak peak of a
multi-year project we have going on I
think this might be accidentally falling
into there's a lot of rumors that Apple
is going to switch away from Intel just
like they did away from PowerPC back in
two thousand five and six and start
using their own chip well you've got to
think that in their hidden rooms there
we have these computers running here on
ARM chips but yeah I'm sure yeah and
they master okay a sneak peek at this so
this multi-year project is for Mac
tapping into iOS yeah we think that some
of the apps are gonna be great on the
Mac that's Craig federighi speaking
so he's not gonna merge mac OS and iOS
he's just gonna make the apps
interchangeable which is what kind of
was expected people are kind of hoping
yeah or at least again building that
yeah and to your point both of you guys
you know porting an app from one to the
other shouldn't be as as difficult as it
is and sorry I mean this is this is
really for the developers right now
want to make it much easier so like the
frameworks being brought over to the Mac
yep there we go there we go that's what
it is what it is but yes to see what
it'll look like
Xcode on the iPad part yeah that would
be I mean
expert on the iPad pro would be really
killer and probably not that hard I mean
yeah I mean it depends if you want the
runtime on the iPad as well well that
would be the point
right I mean I'm sure it has absolutely
I mean in a way in a weird way if I'm
programming it's almost it's not like
this but the equivalent would be kind of
like I'm copying and pasting it into a
Mac side or an iOS side in it I'm not
having to rewrite it entirely for other
one that would be yeah exactly
okay so it's coming to developers next
year so you can bring iOS app apps to
Mac's next year being maybe but two days
before WWDC 2019 saying the news app for
example was one of the things where they
tested this idea bringing it from iOS to
Mac OS apparently that is going to be
originally iOS app that they made work
on the Mac the way I see I say well I
mean I'm interested to try out news on
the Mac I don't think I'm gonna be a
frequent user
Patrick and I were just talking about
this but but I'm definitely I'm I want
to say is it gonna learn better about me
is it he's gonna be something I use or
am I just gonna be browser-based knees
soon yeah I don't know I think it's
something interesting too that we've
seen Apple do this a lot in the past
year is kind of giving a preview of
what's to come which traditionally they
don't talk about the future at all right
but also to go away hey these are some
projects were working on this is some
software stuff for workouts pretty
exciting but when it comes to big moves
they have Telegraph like the Intel
announcement they they announced as six
months beforehand and so they and
actually the Apple TV was shown six
months before it was released or three
months four months oh and the B for that
matter B iPhone in the iPad but they do
do it sometimes but you know it's
usually when they want to get a lot of
attention for it and they want to kind
of bring up some interest right that's a
big key thing I feel like at least it's
coming a little more towards consumer
things to chance of like consumers are
understanding it and also I think
there's that balance again there's a
whole industry of room
reporting on rumors and speculation
about like what the new iPhone is or
what this is and able to heck keep some
less surprises because so far we have
heard some things that we were hoping
for but there wasn't a lot that we knew
they were definitely going to announce
today yeah it looks like team coups back
on the stage now it looks like he's
wrapping up me merging me emerging me
emoji so developer betas are gonna go
live off to the caner that's pretty
standard practice oh I don't know let us
know if if you're a developer and you're
gonna want to put two betas on I want to
know hit us up on the scene at live
hashtag are you brave enough are you
gonna do it I mean a Developer Preview
generally I mean I've never put a
developer you want to put the public
betas on a relatively stable relatively
stable you've been pretty ok it's gonna
be interesting to see whether or not
again like they're marketing this as
faster and more reliable will it be
faster and more reliable in the betas
and traditionally the final versions of
cold masters come out the fall so they
do have like a good four or five months
to do that absolutely
I'm but interesting though they're just
making a short video now but I like do
we really think that we have like a real
kind of representation any kind of hints
about future products like because iOS
12 normally gives us a little bit of an
indicator of what is gonna come in
future iPhones
I don't know necessarily if we saw that
much today that is uh that is that I
don't I can't think of anything right
now I'm off the top of my head after
this I'm gonna go back and watch the
keynote again I'm sorry I didn't I
didn't say anything into Tila that would
kind of give a hint to that well I think
that's fun too because usually when
these get released it's usually a month
in or something like that and developers
find like the the infamous knotch
design for iPhone was found in one of
the api's way late in till it was found
but ahead of time so I'm sure there's
there might be stuff like that I have a
feeling that being said with all that
happening last year they might be a
little more
and I would say double down but they
would definitely be making sure that we
try and make sure that wouldn't happen
again right so it looks like they're
wrapping up now this is just a video
concluding everything talking to
developers and that's that's kind of in
our one more thing did we well at this
point it's like two hours and twelve
minutes into it do we want one more
thing as was anticipated I'm actually
kind of surprised that there wasn't even
just like a little concession kind of
like I'm less expensive or hard or
something that was like a beats branded
home pod or yeah beats branded speaker
with Siri integrated especially since
Siri was kind of one of the big topics
but really there was very little on on
like the home front on on home kid I was
the home app on Mac I know we want to we
want to speak to to Andrew you have hot
when he has a second Oh Megan saw in the
shot right Oh Megan's on great X Megan
to be better maybe if she's on yeah I
thought Andrew wasn't but it's Megan
amazing welcome back sir thanks what did
you think about the announcements today
like the home stuff there was very
little I mean apart from that the home
app on Mac right yeah I'm a little
disappointed you know we were watching
it for two-plus hours and there wasn't
much on the smart home front but we did
see two things that caught her eye
for shortcuts that will actually include
the sort of iOS 12 when that comes
around you'll actually be able to Duke
us and you can say you know stuff like I
lost my keys which was an example they
gave but also smart home stuff like set
my thermostat my thermostat to 68
degrees or lock my door stuff like that
so integrations with the smart home
devices that are already part of home
kit so even though they didn't announce
new home kit devices or integrations it
does sound like shortcuts will kind of
incorporate home kit and the home app in
some way which is at least something and
it should would make I don't know people
that aren't familiar with home kit or
the home app shortcuts might actually be
the bridge for them into it they already
use Siri to control stuff like tile to
find their keys maybe they can also you
it for their home connected home devices
also related to that with Mac OS Mohave
the home app is actually coming to the
Mac so instead of just having that stuff
limited to your iOS devices or the home
pod you can now sort of manage your
stuff monitor and control it with Siri
on your Mac so that's all stuff we're
looking forward to testing out but again
we were yeah we were really hoping for
that less expensive home pod I mean at
349 bucks it's pretty cost prohibitive
especially when you think about the $50
alternatives from Amazon and Google but
still we'll have to settle for shortcuts
and Mojave and test them out and see how
well they fare so where do you think
that today's announces kind of leave
Apple in comparison to like be the
Amazons and the Google's like are we any
any closer or is it just a totally
different race all together I'd say
Apple is still so so so far behind again
you know they started out in 2014 they
announced homekit first before Amazon
had had their smart speaker before
Google had any of their stuff and and
they're just you know four years later
and we're still kind of waiting for them
to make that big announcement that'll
set them ahead of the pack because they
had that momentum such momentum early on
and and they're really not even
struggling to keep up I'm not sure
they're prioritizing it you know when
they introduced the home pod they
specifically said they were focusing on
sound quality they wanted to compete
with you know more high-end speakers
like the Google home max which isn't the
first device someone goes to when
they're thinking about investing in the
smart home they might start with
something again like this the $50 Amazon
echo dot or the Google home mini
something that is a nice sort of entry
point into the smart home because people
that are buying those might be more
interested in just controlling select
smart home devices rather than setting
up you know a nice stereo sound in their
home so I think they're kind of limiting
themselves in that regard because how
many people are gonna spend 700 bucks on
to home pods to put those side-by-side
in a room they do finally allow that
functionality since iOS 11.4 was
announced last week in addition to
multi-room audio but again those
features are already available through
and Google's so yeah we're really far
behind and we didn't see anything
anything else in terms of adding new
device partners you know we were hoping
that they would say oh yes we've opened
this up and now we'll have this
Developer Kit that might allow third
parties to make it really really simple
not just getting rid of that MFI chip
that Andrew mentioned earlier but really
really opening it up so that anyone who
wants to can add those smart home
integrations we didn't see any of that
today like with the lack of hardware
announcements today we usually have an
event the fall for the iPhone but we
used to have events in or August late
the summer I wonder if there they could
foreshadow an event where they are
announcing something like a more
affordable home pod or announcing
something that's just around the smart
home and just over on that platform and
what do you think about that yeah I mean
that would be awesome whenever it can
happen we're ready for it you know we
have our space out here in Kentucky
where we're testing all of those smart
integrations and it wouldn't be amazing
to see something like that that's
definitely something we'll be looking
for in the coming months and and
hopefully they can do that quick to kind
of stay competitive because you know
Amazon and have six seven eight smart
speakers at this point as well as
integrating into third-party devices
like smart thermostats like the Eco
before stuff like that so yeah we're
we're excited for that possibility but
I'm not gonna hold my breath cuz uh it
took about six years to get the home pot
out so so who knows yeah well let's hope
we know what waiting another six years
for for other stuff thanks so much Megan
appreciate your insights and looking
forward to seeing you coverage from
today thanks again Thanks
okay also on the line we have Vanessa
and Arianna who is standing outside the
Convention Center in San Jose where WWDC
has just wrapped up Vanessa what did you
think about the announcements today well
before I get to that Lexi I just kind of
want to show you what's going on in here
because it's the first bit of excitement
we've seen in Oahu people are starting
to file out it's been totally empty for
the last two hours now that all the
attendees are starting to file out of
the San Jose can sorry the McHenry
convention center here in
and they're actually making their way to
the food where I would be as well did
you did you do a little bit of a sneaky
ever caught reconnaissance mission to
find out what the food was you know what
I will have to get back to you on that
because I was watching the keynote just
so that I could have a something to
report back so I haven't yet but I will
get back to you I promise and I will
even sample some of the goodwill so stay
tuned I'm looking forward to the food
coverage because that's that's important
but I know they said about the
conference report back sound sounds good
I'm sorry what did you think in the
announcements I know there were a couple
things in there that you mentioned
before you alluded to watch OS 5 I feel
like we've got a lot of things today you
know and watch I was bad I think our
watch OS 5 prayers were half answered we
got a lot of what we wanted I think the
third party integration
sorry third party app integration is is
very welcome addition I think it's
becoming more of a companion the Apple
watch now than ever before
okay II didn't kind of mentioned this
about having the the tap to remind you
about the important things I think we
might see that with this theory
shortcuts especially because they're
customizable now on the Apple watch I
like a lot of the Fitness features that
they added the yoga track II and the
hiking not just like being able to tag
that as a workout remember Alexi that we
were able to tag it out to work out now
it actually factors in it factors in
your your cadence and your heart rate
and the altitude in terms of what
activity you're doing and it factors it
into the rest of your day and which is
which is a nice nice welcome feature as
well as a lot of the running features
that I liked in terms of just being able
to tap you when you're going below your
pace it would be incredibly helpful
during a race I can see that how that
would be helpful during a race and the
actionable notification so a lot on
watch OS 5 but I'm sorry that I think it
was Patrick that wanted the sleep
tracking he didn't get that sorry I mean
I'd sleep checking to me wasn't a huge
deal at all so I'm on behind my guys you
were saying I'm really I'm really
interested in to like to see how these
actual features work you know tracking
my progress over time
and dragging different types of workouts
I think that was a real weakness of
Apple watching so now I'm really
interested to see how that works I
didn't get the women's tracking I know I
know we didn't we go to wait maybe
that's gonna be that gonna slide that in
there somewhere I like secretly a new
Apple watch it was the group FaceTime I
think I don't know if I'm the only one
back I know we had a moment we are
excited about you had a moment with you
with the memories you know what I'm
talking about face time with multiple
members of your family across different
countries oh we were so yeah we were
sitting we were saying that you could
probably even feel like a business thing
with that like I suppose using Google
hangout to have like a meeting but
everyone could have me emoji faces no I
just know she was how they presented the
features to like shut your phone off and
to to the the forget what they we're
calling up at the parental controls and
the screen time controls that was it and
then they were saying oh yeah so that
you you know you're not using your phone
as much and then they're like and wait
mimmo GPS use your phone and message
everybody with your emoji of yourself
so the cigarette packs of cigarettes the
morning yeah well look I think you know
what exactly the one thing we can take
away from this is it's gonna turn us
into a lot of narcissists we're gonna
look it outta me more so than we already
know we're using a far too much we're
gonna have to go and then like do
something in the real world like look at
ourselves in the mirror maybe I don't
know is that we do we know never Apple
here with our me emojis exactly
Vanessa is there a hands-on area or
anything like you guys are gonna be able
to play with it so I hear there's a demo
area where we're gonna see a lot of
these things in action so I'm gonna go
scout that out after I get food and
sample it so I'm not sure what exactly
they're gonna have because there was no
hardware announced
today but I'm assuming maybe they'll
have the latest OS the their devices
running the latest operating systems are
wicked update eight so I'll go Scout it
out and hopefully report back with some
some cool new on hands-on demos of all
these things that we were just talking
about I hope you get to see the the Lego
hands-on and I want it I want to play
that this was like a lot of fun and the
measure tool is gonna be really helpful
alright so yeah a bunch of good
third-party we were talking about this
during the live show a bunch of
third-party absent now sadly closing
their doors because this is something of
the pad but so now it's now it's native
now its first party so you know five by
third party apps but it's it's useful
I'm excited to say okay well we'll let
you go get some food and checking with
the developers and give us the inside
scoop there once you're inside and get
hands-on with the demos and thanks for
joining us will do guys thanks Vanessa
standing outside the San Jose Convention
Center that's a hot gig you know
standing for two hours outside you know
watchin alright that's happening inside
what's the temperature like today down
there it's gonna be warm yeah when we
were in Chicago was kind of the office
it was kind of freezing outside being
attacked this is this is a long event
and it was a lotta even though they
weren't like I know what do you think
there was a one big thing that people
are gonna grab on to but it felt like
there was lots of little things yeah
lots of little things and lots of
updates that I feel who are actually
useful rather significant significant
and things that we were actually asking
for but the other interesting thing
though for me it felt like a lot of
these updates were geared towards
consumers rather than developers because
there wasn't really that much in the
keynote at least from what we saw in the
live blog and the images that was kind
of like developer first apart from the
Mac and iOS you know the app
integrations like that for me it was
always very much like a consuming yet
cater it and I would love to hear what
developers are actually thinking are
they feeling like they're kind of like a
little bit left out given that there
wasn't that much kind of in terms of you
can develop XYZ for the platforms in
certain ways it was very much like here
are the new features
that we have and and that's Conover but
oftentimes Apple does this in Google to
where it's a very consumer focused event
but it's showing you where they're
headed right and what they're thinking
and in some ways it's almost like trying
to show the industry like here's what
we're thinking right here's what we're
here's where we're pushing things and
also by the way there's this whole other
part of the week where you know they
have these intensive sessions that where
they go into the super duper nerdy stuff
that was even nerdier than this
last two and a half hours of our lives
so there is a lot of that - I'd say one
of my favorite things is when they have
this the keynote slide of like iOS 12
there's like the ten but then there's
like the 40 things kind of like what
does that feature do that so I'm sure
we'll hear a lot more about that this
week but also the first day has become a
lot more publicized we're covering it
live lots of media are covering the
event even though it's really geared
toward developers so I think you have a
lot more consumer interest in this well
and you have to be able to come away
like oh yeah me emoji and be able to
group FaceTime stuff like that or up
there could be an update to your Apple
watch
I think that's easier to grab on to them
like oh there's these new API is that
the developers are gonna make that's
gonna make your Apple watch be able to
order a pizza for your something like
that quickly to the CNET live hashtag on
Twitter all right couple questions
MacBook Murray this is from Amiri
MacBook Pro where it was any update I
was expecting I agree I I mean you know
we knew there wasn't really gonna be any
hardware at least I was hoping there was
gonna be something about we've improved
the touch bonus Siri on the mountain
blah blah blah something at least to
kind of improve the functionality even
if it wasn't necessarily a new hardware
I was also hoping for that too
unfortunately this is not the event for
that we're gonna have to wait possibly
until I mean I don't know are they gonna
lump it all into the phone Amman in
September and maybe they will new
hardware maybe or maybe they have I feel
like it's kind of like it's just there's
so much to talk about discuss and a
highlight into cram
as much fun as I would have been to see
a new MacBook or a MacBook Air with a
Retina screen or an iPhone as see to
that I don't know where they would have
fit that in and had time to give it like
its its time and its weight to really
sell it because there's so much really
important things I did hit on and we're
talking like over well over 2 hours I'm
sure they had probably four hours of
material that you're gonna hear at
throughout the week as developers go
through some of these intensive seminars
absolutely and then Gabriel camera and
microphone protection by default on
Mojave on iOS 12 great now I can take
the tape of my camera you know it's
funny originally I used to think it was
kind of silly that people would cover
their cue their cameras and then I saw
the Mark Zuckerberg has his camera
covered on his Mac I was like oh well
maybe there is something to this after
all and it's very funny because it
speaks very much to how little people
trust their devices and how afraid of
hacking they are and I've even seen
covers they saw on Amazon for the
cameras on your phone and so it'll be
interesting to see you know there's this
pervasive belief that Facebook's
listening in through your microphone all
the yeah and I'll tell you I know people
who actually have disabled Facebook's
access to their photos and their phones
just to make sure that that doesn't
happen and I don't know I got to answer
these types of concerns somehow well and
they're definitely concerns maybe not
entirely logical ones are based on facts
but the fact that if you're scared of
your camera spying on you because you
saw like mr. robot and they did it on
that show it definitely already saw the
60 minutes where a guy hacked it live I
don't know how many people trying to
hack my camera and and I'm not
challenging anyone to but I would be
curious to see like I want to have more
control to that if that comes in a
hardware solution like that clever
huawei laptop which has yeah the pop-up
key for the selfie camera like that's
kind of cool because you definitely have
a open and closed idea but make sure
that it's defaulted off I think that's
such an Apple thing to do absolutely one
last one on saying that life from a same
where is iPhone se to Wow sorry it was
it was not today
was not today alas the foreign event in
September is the next big Apple event
and we know of so well we don't know of
it's not guaranteed but it's pretty
pretty likely right there's pretty
likely sorry
maybe iPhone se 2 will be there yeah do
you think there could be like an like an
iPhone se 2 or maybe like a smaller
iPhone 10 an iPhone 10 an iPhone 10 plus
or whatever would be called the 11 yeah
I mean I feel like it's it's good I mean
a lot of people saying they - 10 is
gonna be discontinued effectively for
the next generation I feel like I don't
know are they gonna discount the iPhone
10 or are they just gonna basically go
you know what NAR we're just gonna end
it and then I'm gonna have the 11 or
whatever it's gonna be cold it's gonna
have it's gonna be the next iteration
that's gonna be at that premium price
point as well repackage it like the 5c
where they just ate the components and
well yeah in a different way anything I
don't know I maybe they'll they'll keep
the iPhone 10 and use those cat names
for it you can buy the iPhone Leopard
it's hard to tell when they're how
they're gonna sell these things
sometimes you know I think a lot of
people were surprised by the iPhone
getting more expensive when they for
when the rumors first started and look
obviously Apple says that the iPhone
tone sounds really well so they are not
gonna give up a $999 price point right
it's just what we call way yeah and I
mean and to be a fair like you know
Samsung phone there's nine hundred and
fifty dollars so it's not quite a
thousand but there's a lot of funds up
in the upper upper range that we see but
also we're seeing there's a lot of
really good phones the on the Android
side that are two or three hundred
dollars for those people who are really
looking for a budget picks that do all
the things you could ever hope a phone
could do but don't I could buy three or
four of them for the price of one I
thought they don't do an emoji exactly
me emoji one last one comment from Hamza
iOS 11 public beta was twenty sixth of
June 2017 so thinking similar date iOS
12 good cool okay finally before we wrap
up favorite feature from today's keynote
hmm Wenger first I would have to say
dark mode I mean oh yeah are you talking
my god dark mode
we got dark mode on everything helps my
eyes I don't like to get blinded by a
bright screen so yeah dark modes cool
yeah I love it Patrick I have to say I
think that FaceTime group chat thing is
where tough for me honestly I could
imagine like my relatives and family are
spread all over the u.s. us all having
that call and it being five or six of us
not quite 32 but that was pretty
exciting and if it works as seamlessly
as iMessage and FaceTime has already
that's even better how about you Anne
I'm all about the bug fixes I think if
we can make these things just more
reliable and more stable I am a super
happy guy also the notifications thing
if they did find a way to make it better
amen exactly okay for me I think Apple
TV and Dolby Atmos was a huge deal that
was really big I also really like the
emphasis was placed on watch OS I feel
like watch OS for a long time is kind of
like very very incremental not that
useful I feel like this is kind of the
OS that Watchers been waiting for for
such a long time so to me did you did
you catch is that dolby atmos update is
that a software thing or is it gonna be
a hardware like I know I think it's a
software I think it's I think don't
quote me on that I need to and some of
Dolby stuff is hardware some of it is
software so I think it depends on what
Apple already had in there yeah we need
to double check on that and that might
be a good segue to say like we have a
lot of coverage that today absolutely
there is so much stuff on cnet.com if
you want to catch up on absolutely
everything there you can go there and if
