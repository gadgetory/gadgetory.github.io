episode 331 of the 359 podcast I'm BVG
and your host today are Joanie Sol's
Minh and Ben Fox Ruben hello hello
thanks for coming on yeah so we're gonna
be talking about net neutrality yet
again this will be in the run-up for the
Thursday vote from the FCC which is the
expected repeal if net neutrality there
have been a couple of protest efforts
this week which will run through also on
the gadget side we'll talk about the
review of the Google home max and also
talk about Apple again with the purchase
of Shazam which was confirmed and
announced yesterday so I think that's
about it let's get to the podcast send
in your questions and comments BVG we'll
get to as many as you can at the end of
the show and let's get started there
will be plenty to talk about there
certainly will be alright everybody
stick around here comes four minutes
ahead lines for you starting in three
two
welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox ribbon
I'm Joni Salzmann the FCC is scheduled
to vote on repealing net neutrality
rules this Thursday but many prominent
internet players are protesting the move
activists and websites Mozilla Pinterest
Reddit github Etsy and BitTorrent are
campaigning today against the decision
plus a handful of internet pioneers
posted an open letter on tumblr tumblr
sorry to call for the vote to be
cancelled problem is Joan do you think
any of this is actually going to matter
it seems like generally this is like a
juggernaut that cannot be stopped that
the FCC is gonna hold this vote and we
know how the votes gonna go and so the
questions that remain are what happens
next after that vote happen right
exactly which is do you have any
predictions as far as what could
actually happen I mean net neutrality
has only been around since 2015 this
incarnation of it yeah so well right
after the vote nothing's gonna change
immediately there's a process that it
has to go into effect where it has to
become official and that takes
but the worry is that that will change
how Internet Service Providers
approach the traffic that you are trying
to access through their services the
other thing that people are expecting
definitely to happen is lawsuits to be
filed so even if the VOC does go the way
that we expect it to go on Thursday
we're still chances in the courts to
change things that way which will
definitely slow things down even more in
the meantime
obviously consumers are definitely
concerned that cost of their internet
could actually go up some of their
websites could get slowed down so it's
obviously understandable that all these
protests are happening I mean while I
agree it's still a very big question
mark as far as what might actually
happen after this vote goes through next
up Google is now selling a four hundred
dollar smart speaker with really good
audio called the Google home max it will
compete against the Sonos one and apples
home pod which is delayed to next year
would you buy a $400 smart speaker I
wouldn't but I'm curious what kind of
consumer you know what kind of person
does this make sense for do you know I
mean like we always mentioned like for
something this expensive for a smart
speaker especially because it can pair
together so you wouldn't just buy one
for $400 maybe you buy two for $800
obviously this is somebody that is like
really into music and audio file and I
don't know like for me I'd prefer to
spend $30.00 I think I'm an echo dot or
a Google home Mini and that's why those
products also exist well I'm curious if
you think that the difference kind of
tactics going for the very cheap
mass-market thing versus that very
high-end what's the strategy of having
both of those why I have that high-end
just like try to sell as much stuff as
possible for sure and I think the very
cheap has obviously shown to be working
as best as possible the echo dot is
Amazon's best-selling echo and that's
why the Google home Mini exists the big
question to would be is Apple gonna get
into that game and start selling is
super cheap
smart speaker I ate like goes against
everything we know about Apple yeah I
think people would be really excited if
they had some like really cute slick
looking smart speaker the whole
Hyde jr. something I don't know last
speaking of Apple Apple agreed to buy
Shazam the music recognition app why
would they need Shazam why why did this
purchase go through well they haven't
said exactly the reason why Apple was
always hush-hush about its takeovers and
this one was unique in that they
actually acknowledged that they bought
it but they did say that they're excited
to start integrating Shazam into Apple
music their streaming service that's
very similar to Spotify some of the
reasons could be obviously that kind of
music recognition Shazam has lots of
users doing lots of music recognition
over many years and so they have a lot
of data about what people like and what
they don't like and that can help Apple
music with recommendations yeah so
customers can look forward to that and
see more of that in Apple music if you
want to read more about these stories
check us out on CNET I'm Ben Fox ribbon
I'm Joanie Saltzman thanks for listening
alright everybody thanks for joining us
for the podcast recording portion I'm
gonna go ahead and delve into the chat
dig out any of your best questions and
comments to keep the conversation going
here on the 3:59 podcast even though
they're well well past 3 minutes and 59
seconds what we did like maybe 20
seconds over I'm counting that we had
started with a pre-show and then there's
a show ok Joe and this little
four-minute audio podcast has gotten way
way way too complicated
our long podcast yes this is taken over
my life ok I want to ask Joan a quick
question related to the Shazam ok ok so
if all Apple is doing is integrating
Shazam service into Apple music and like
a lot of people already have the
standalone app so what's the point you
know you're you're and and couldn't they
have just done a partnership job they
have done partnerships azam like Siri
you can already ask Siri - Shazam
something you don't have to open the
Shazam app yourself you can ask Siri to
do it for you so they've already done
partnerships like that so it's
definitely not just for their technology
this takeover because they can as Shazam
has been willing to let them use their
technology natively inside thing
like Siri before I think it really is
about having all that data having so
many users it still has lots of active
users
people are always damning stuff what was
what was the number that you mentioned a
number that I saw yesterday was
something like 160 million monthly
active users a lot that was two years
ago but no matter what that's that's a
lot even though it was a little a couple
years ago I'm it's hard to say where
it's gone from there that's still a lot
of people using a service and it's a lot
of people telling sending signals about
what they like and what they don't like
with music you know music discovery is
the thing that really differentiates
these services from one another is that
they can give you music that you're
gonna like without very much effort and
so in that way it's a competitive move
against Spotify do you think that this
is a way for Apple to try to I don't
know compete more effectively against
Spotify because maybe they're losing
against them I don't actually know I'm
assuming that Spotify is the more
popular service but I modified by far
has more subscribers than Apple music
and Spotify by far has more users
because unlike Apple music Spotify has
that free option where you can listen
with listen with ads instead of having
to pay directly Apple music doesn't have
that so but in terms of like an apples
to apples comparison Spotify has a lot
more in terms of an apples to apples
comparison of Apple to Spotify pure
subscribers Apple has I think the last
count that I saw Apple has like 30
million and Spotify has like 60 million
they're both growing apples definitely
assembly like a two horse race in terms
of subscription music services Apple and
Spotify are the biggest and they're
definitely both growing well
but Spotify is bigger and I think
growing at a at a bigger pace yeah I'm
pretty sure a lot of people tuned in to
hear our conversation also about net
neutrality so maybe we should get to
those questions sure let's go ahead and
start off with the question from our old
friend Matthew - are the - on the chat
what happens in a post net neutrality
world if we use a VPN to access the
Internet how will that be impacted well
I don't know exactly change I don't
think that would real
and they would they be able to put into
effect some effort to try to police that
though to police why don't you can use a
VPN a lot of people use VPN for less
than admirable reasons to try to or for
business reasons very true and that's
interactive uses VPNs all the time for
protective business purposes as well
very true but that's totally accurate
I'm sure would be able to further
regulate it though and set some kind of
precedent who are using it to cover try
one of the things about the net
neutrality proposal is that the FCC
wants to offload the responsibility of
this kind of regulation to the Federal
Trade Commission right and so if it's a
matter of asking whether there could be
new regulation over VPNs it sounds like
as you would imagine from a Republican
administration the general principle is
like we don't want more regulation we
were less yeah so in terms of in
practice what is peace would do around
VPNs I don't really know because it's
not the main concern about a net
neutrality a change in net neutrality
regulation right a bigger the I I agree
with everything you said the bigger
issues related to net neutrality as far
as I can tell are are there going to be
fast lanes are they gonna our ISPs going
to be picking and choosing winners on
the internet and that would affect
traffic that's going over a VPN as much
as it would people that don't bother to
use a VPN so it would affect people
using VPNs and people not it's a higher
level of control over the bits and bytes
that are coming to your computers yes
the apples to apples so let's get a bit
of a counter argument as by and large a
lot of people are in favor of net
neutrality at least present company
included John Doe is pushing a bit of it
a conspiracy do you really think it's
like conspiracy theories but this sparks
a really great conversation so do you
really think and think think it's a
coincidence at the largest companies in
the world are pushing for net neutrality
when they're the ones who benefit from
free streaming they can't charge for
data if people had to pay for 4k
streaming they wouldn't I don't know if
that's necessarily true anymore at least
in the coming years
as 4kb comes to north it's not a
conspiracy that's totally delicious the
first part was like do you really think
they're not behind this kind of anyway
Netflix wants everyone to pay a flat
rate in order to subsidize their own
service I I don't see anything wrong I
didn't say there's anything wrong with a
said it sparked a good conversation and
is a little bit counter to the to the
norm of the conversation we're having no
totally and I feel like I've made a very
similar argument on this podcast several
times related to that I think that
Google Netflix have a vested interest in
maintaining net neutrality to preserve
their bottom line and push those costs
onto the backs of ISPs these are all
multi-billion dollar companies so I
guess I shouldn't feel bad for anybody
yeah but at the same time it is a matter
of fairness and if Netflix is getting
away with not having to pay for this
infrastructure and forcing it on
somebody else is that is that
appropriate and do the ISPs actually
have a legitimate argument I don't think
anybody generally agrees with that
position except for John Doe I'd that's
okay and it's it's an interesting
conversation to have certainly I think a
lot of people are concerned that this is
going to have vast changes for the
internet but as you said before Joan
anything that does change is probably
going to be very slow particularly if
there are going to be lawsuits what's
interesting to see is just how much
people are fired up about this topic
considering it can be hard to understand
and it's I mean it's hard to understand
so in terms of the technical aspects of
it but also the regulatory aspect so
it's interesting to see that people are
really fired up about this subject
matter and that definitely I think
guarantees that it's something that's
not going to be it's not gonna go well
however this vote goes it's not gonna be
going down without a fight yeah I and I
think a lot of this is the reason it got
so heated is because it got directly
connected to how the Internet is
structured and obviously a lot of people
have a very vested interest in making
sure the internet stays open and and
available to people they don't want to
have ala carte services for the Internet
where it gets sliced and diced and
divvied up they don't want their their
costs going up and then beyond that
there have been a lot of arguments about
that
this is a threat to democracy that it
could cause internet censorship I
obviously understand every single one of
those points but at the same time does
that mean that this regulatory regime is
the best one for the Internet and
obviously the current FCC doesn't think
that it is and the other ones that are
in power to decide that well I think if
anything is getting approval right now
is that nobody really knows absolutely
100% what is the best solution for this
anomaly that is the Internet we've seen
it but in the past with FM radio is
supplanting supplanting AM radio we've
seen cable TV kind of take a nosedive
nobody really knows how to properly
distribute information and data they're
going to continue to throw stuff at the
wall until something sticks and in the
meantime we're alone for the ride I
think the one that I take I think a lot
of these distribution platforms have
been really they've been sticking pretty
well when they're the dominant one
I mean lie the nature of 90% of the
American population has cable TV like
that's that's not true
yeah Wow but but cord cutting is on the
rise yeah like it's not it's now like 88
percent instead of like 90 percent which
is because it's the entire country
that's saying we've completely 180 down
the entire thing but I think that what
I'm trying to enforce here is that with
with media and consumption and the way
it's supposed to kind of follow and
shape the world all at the same time
there is no absolute solution it's going
to continue to change that is the nature
and I think that's what we need to be
ready for is it's safe to say good
prices change with the repeal and net
neutrality yeah will they we don't know
right but I think something is going to
change the status quo is going to shift
some how we need to be ready we need to
be on our toes because this is a big
thing for those of us working in the
media from the perspective of the FCC I
think a lot of the arguments really get
get pushed toward proponents of net
neutrality just to kind of take a
talking point from a GPI the chairman of
the FCC he argues that from from a
position of censorship
he claims that Twitter is a bigger issue
for censor on the Internet then
potentially you change in regulations
I never I never thought I'd agree with
him but I do to an extent he his
argument is also somewhat political in
nature where he said that Twitter has an
agenda it's it's I'm I can't remember
exactly yeah essentially a left-leaning
agenda and you know goes against you
know other positions that don't actually
follow that agenda
sure but Twitter's also riding on the
coattails of his boss yeah that's that's
another that's another point I think the
other issue there to go against what IG
PI head said is that Twitter is one
private company whereas you know the
idea of regulation from the government
is is a much broader issue okay
back into the questions let's start a
new conversation MP Cody my opinion is
that the US should repeal net neutrality
but allow each state to make their own
laws on it I think that's largely what
we're going to see happen I think that's
kind of the goal of the conservative
movement
some areas may not be affected by it but
some will expanding on that all the
cellphone carriers already charged extra
for HD and some don't even allow 4k and
the ones that do charge for honestly net
neutrality is an unenforced joke the way
it is now mmm harsh words but there's
definitely points to be had there I
don't know what that would actually do
if you push net neutrality back to the
states and it would be like
state-by-state internet I don't know I
just think that's that even look like I
mean I think that's a sentiment that is
shared amongst the Republican Party that
that's the way things should be run as a
state to state regulation or lack
thereof however that works I mean isn't
that kind of like the mo of the
Republican Party with some some things
but then with other things not yeah and
going back to like a point that Roger
continually makes about you know the
Republican versus Democrat
administrations if if and when a
Democrat ends up taking over the White
House and therefore can appoint FCC
commissioners does that just mean that
that net neutrality is gonna get you
know brought back pink which is back and
forth which is like a crazy and
certainly problematic situation start
wonder if maybe Congress should step in
and actually do something yeah and so
the story that I wrote yesterday about
this like group about 20 internet
pioneers you send an open letter that's
what they're doing is they're writing to
Congress to lawmakers and saying like
specifically here you need to step in
and tell the FCC not to have this vote
or specifically they were talking
specifically around this vote that's
coming up but generally that's the idea
is that you know we haven't had
legislation about how the internet works
in a really long time and then it's
changed a lot in that period so I don't
know and then but if you're putting your
hopes on Congress getting anything done
especially something so complicated then
I I totally agree yeah yeah that's
that's in in some ways they would
probably prefer you know unelected
bureaucrats I have to yeah wrench wrench
with this whole situation then have to
go back to their constituency and say
like I made I took this position or that
position so there's a lot of politics
involved in this and it'll probably
continue to be that case I just want to
shout out to Doug Murray yes the
microphones are sitting on my old
8-track tapes from a personal collection
from Doc Stevenson yeah Jones is a polka
beer festival oh how appropriate
I married a Polish man so so just just
to lighten things up for a little bit
I'll themed meanwhile question for Joan
from Michael Brown yes when could we
expect the net neutrality effects to
actually go like this actually happen so
the answer is I don't know if you want
so meg Maggie Reardon is Marguerite
Reardon as her byline goes she is our
go-to person on all things net
neutrality she has a lot of coverage on
CNET and she's also she's been covering
this really well for like decades she's
a real she's a legit expert on it so my
first recommendation is go to seen it
and see some of Maggie stories but from
what I've read of her stories is a lot
of it depends on how companies once the
dust settles in terms of the regulations
are put in place the boat's done
regulations are put in place lawsuits
bring up whatever once that kind of dust
settles it depends on what ISPs want to
do like when the in 2015 when they made
that when the previous FTC made
change to the current regulations there
was a lot of hue and cry about how this
would stifle innovation and love a lot
but what I've heard from Maggie is that
there actually hasn't been like that
much change or burden on companies and
they haven't like there's no evidence
that investment in innovation has been
decreased in any way or whatever so a
lot of it kind of depends on what those
monolithic companies that deliver your
Internet to you decide they want to do
because they have the ability to play
around with more tools on your traffic
if there's less regulation on them
yeah different regulation and from an
infrastructure perspective that kind of
thing moves very slow yeah that's true
but from a like if they're innovating in
terms of services that they can provide
people like if they like the there's a
issue of paid prioritization I don't
think it takes very much for them to say
Netflix you have to pay us some money if
you want your yeah do go in a fast lane
I don't I think that that kind of
innovation where they're innovating on
how they charge people I think that can
happen pretty quickly they decide that's
what they want to go but they have to
deal with what consumers I mean
obviously consumers are very riled up
about this issue they have to deal with
the fact that consumers might vote with
their wallet and be like that's the
other problem is that you know I would
they go where do you go your I usually
there's only one or maybe two if you're
lucky
from games in town so you cover Netflix
from your perspective Netflix very you
know routinely increases their
subscription prices do you think that
their next subscription increase they
could blame on the audience I mean they
could they they might but ultimately if
it's the same when when there was the
debate around that neutrality and 2015
Netflix was very outspoken about it less
so this time but one of the reasons that
I remember when they were talking about
when we're talking about that round of
net neutrality discussions they raised
that process wonder how it could raise
prices for your content but ultimately
like the reason your Netflix
subscription is getting marks message
because nothing suspending like a big
billions of dollars on content yeah not
because they might get um pennies in
comparison increase and getting it
delivered to you which I
think is very important context ya know
and like there's a lot of noise that's
being directed at consumers from all
these companies they all want to present
themselves as being on the side of the
consumer and hopefully what we can do
here very small extent is to at least
educate people and provide them with a
little bit more information as far as
what's going on all right we are running
super low on time and there are a ton of
really good questions and fantastic
conversation happening in the chat as
always we should do a lightning round
lightning round
so for Pele and Scott Maya how is net
neutrality going to affect people in
Europe as well as other places in the
world there are a lot of social media
and streaming services from the US what
impact we're gonna see globally that's
that's a really hard one to say I've
mentioned in previous podcasts that
because the the u.s. is the u.s.
oftentimes their regulatory position is
taken up or considered by other
countries so that could you know end up
having an impact on Europe in that case
I don't actually know if Facebook or
YouTube are impacted by net neutrality
in some ways it would how that would
impact European consumers because some
of those videos are based in servers in
Europe so yeah that's under a different
regimes it's a hard questioning I think
in this case net neutrality is a pretty
localized effect because your ISP I mean
it's very localized getting your traffic
it comes to a server near you and then
goes to your house and ultimately Retton
it net neutrality regulations are on
those people that are providing it right
in your neighborhood but there could be
like you said kind of like echo effects
on like how does that affect Netflix and
then how does that affect what Netflix
invests in and how does that affect what
Netflix can send to Europe and
distribute there you know it could have
echo effects but I don't think directly
Europeans will be more people in other
countries would be affected by the vote
all right moving on Michael Brown let's
change directions here do you think the
Shazam acquisition by Apple has
something to do with the pixel twos a
music recognition built in also Michael
aren't you at the spa why are you
watching this she is at the spa Cheers
cheers to you
your soon birthday I think sorry I saw
that on Twitter I'm not super creepy
okay guys well maybe just remember just
remember self not creepy if you watch
this show then we'll find you we follow
each other on Twitter why did I say that
out loud anyway
happy birthday I think Michael and thank
you for the question as always the
question the question was do you think
this am acquisition will have it has
anything to do with pixel twos music
recognition being built in that's a
really good that's a really good process
I had yeah it's really good insight I
hadn't thought about that but staying I
mean the iPhone is the golden ticket for
Apple still it's a thing where they can
make all their money so anything that
makes their iPhone more competitive
against an upsurge in competitor surging
rival it's definitely tantamount and Tim
Cook's mine absolutely and the last
question for the day because we are
clean out of time Danny Green is there
anything in Shazam that can boost Siri
ie sound detection to help you find
music or movies that you might like that
would be a neat thought yeah sure the
possibility I mean well you know we
talked about on the podcast itself about
how Siri a pelant Siri have already
partnered with Shazam so that you can
directly ask Siri to Shazam something
and hear it but if you have if it's not
a partnership if it's just kind of like
UNIX like in xsplit not inexplicably in
extract ibly if they're all connected
strictly inextricably intertwined then
feasibly that means it could work better
oh man I want to say those words five
times fast inextricably op offline when
the mics are no longer on we won't make
you say tongue twisters of weird words
so we are at a time but we do want to
remind folks that this is our last
regular broadcast week of 2017 final
show being on Thursday and this coming
Thursday well we will be going live just
a little bit early to make way for
another live scene that show that day so
we'll probably be on somewhere around
10:00 10:15 a.m. Eastern Standard Time
this coming Thursday the
thank you yeah and then we'll have a
couple of filler shows up on YouTube
live stream as well as audio podcasts to
kind of get you through the holiday
season and then we'll be back in January
starting at CES mm-hmm and then Rees
general regular resume schedule TBD but
stay tuned on Twitter asterisk as net
neutrality will allow we are out of time
now wants to bring us home I'll do it
I think the 359 podcast is available on
iTunes tune in stitcher feedburner
google play music the Amazon echo and of
course Sienna comm thanks everybody for
watching great questions we'll see you
again tomorrow see you tomorrow
