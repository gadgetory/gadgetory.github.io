news and more coming up hey everyone
welcome to the net pics don't let the
name fool you this is the show where we
let you know the newest stuff to watch
online not just netflix today we're
going to talk about what's hitting
amazon prime in august all eight seasons
of Larry Davis Curb Your Enthusiasm will
be available on Amazon Prime starting on
august sixth it's a ridiculously funny
show they can get a bit grating at times
I'm not sure any human being is capable
of marathon and curb without a break or
two however if you run through all of
Curb Your Enthusiasm and you want even
more discussions of the little things in
life don't forget all of Seinfeld's
available right now on hulu movie fans
check out Unforgiven starting August
fourth the movie was directed by and
stars Clint Eastwood the film won
Academy Awards in four of the nine
categories in which it was nominated
including best picture and best director
you can also catch more Clint Eastwood
in the movie in the line of fire
starting august six The Adventures of
Sharkboy and Lavagirl comes to Amazon
Prime in August twentieth this one's an
oddball movies directed by robert
rodriguez however the story for the film
came from the seven year old son that
would explain the title also being added
to Primus 2014's Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles produced by Michael Bay I've
seen this movie more than once don't ask
if you're paying for prime to get two
day shipping and you hardly use prime
for movies this would be one of those
times you should go to prime to see this
version of TMNT because it's already
paid for otherwise you could probably
skip this movie for the rest of your
life and you'd be just fine I now
realize most of what i just said
probably applies to Sharkboy and
Lavagirl too anyway how about some
feedback from you last time we asked if
there were other services you'd like us
to cover on net picks Callum Paterson
asked what about now TV for the UK we've
gotten lots of requests to cover non-us
services and we're still trying to
figure out the best way to handle them
zhu jia says I like the streaming news
included the end apologies if I
mispronounce your name thanks for the
feedback how about some more streaming
news right now HBO now the online
version of HBO that was locked down to
Apple and cablevision has made its way
to Android devices Android phones and
tablets can now get HBO now as an app
the app launch without chromecast
support so you can't send it to your TV
yet but HBO says they're working on it
also the wall street journal reports
that who lose
a version of hulu without ads internally

for no ads hulu pricing could be between
12 and 14 dollars whoo-hoo currently
costs eight bucks a month and that's
what adds what do you guys think is an
ad-free who lose something you're
