true HD IPS display and 4G LTE speeds
LG's flagship phone of the season is
finally here hello everybody it's Lynn
la here wit cnet bringing you guys the
lg optimus G with AT&amp;amp;T now the optimus G
has been branded by LG as its new super
phone mainly because it hosts a Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 pro quad-core processor
which means it's impressively fast not
only were simple tasks like unlocking
the device or launching the camera at
snap but the handset executed more
complex things like running a graphic
intense game like Riptide GP smoothly as
well the phone also hosts an impressive
4.7 inch true HD IPS display that uses
touch hybrid display technology to keep
it slim and as you can see pictures are
bright text is crisp and colors are true
to form it's made out of corning gorilla
glass 2 point 0 which just so happens to
be what the back plate is made out of
two in addition to the 1.3 megapixel
front-facing camera ATM tease Optimus G
has an 8-megapixel camera in the back
and while the camera operated quite
swiftly the pictures didn't really
astound us don't get us wrong they're
perfectly adequate pictures but they
don't wow this in any particular way
other goodies include LG's note-taking
feature quick memo a CPU optimizer NFC
capabilities pinch zooming for recorded
video customizable icons from LG Optimus
3.0 you I &amp;amp; Q slide which lets you
multitask and access other apps while
playing a video in the background
unfortunately LG has told us that there
are no pricing or release date
information just yet but we do know that
Sprint will also offer the device with a
13 megapixel camera instead and a few
other tweaks now we know that LG has
been struggling with his competitors
especially against Samsung and while the
optimus G may not blow all other
flagship phones out of the water like
those galaxy s3 or the iphone 5 we
really really like this device a lot and
we think it's the best line of phones LG
has ever offered again I'm Lynn and this
has been a
LG optimus G</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
