just walked out of the apple event where
we saw a lot of new products Apple
definitely delivered on a lot of
promises that they've been making for
the past year or so biggest of the new
unveilings would be the new apple iphone
6 and the six plus two different sizes
for the first time of a new device 4.7
inch a 5.5 inch they're definitely
targeting the more professional user and
the phablet user we've seen a lot of the
Android devices getting bigger and
bigger an apples following suit finally
which is great also thinner devices with
more battery life will make them very
popular I think people have been waiting
to upgrade their phones I think we'll
see a lot of people making upgrades the
question will be whether they go for the
six or the six plus six plus is going to
be hundred dollars more but a bigger
display and much more battery life too
so I definitely think we'll see people
going for that choice over the six we'll
see about inventory and how much Apple
can provide in stores when they release
on sep tember 19th of course it was also
the Apple watch we were expecting it to
be called I watched it's called Apple
watch instead but it still looks like a
great device that was the product that
we didn't really see a lot leaked about
before the event and what we did see
today looked very good in terms of
functionality it's not all that much
different than what we've seen before
from other smart watch manufacturers but
the interface is very clean very
polished we've also got some nice
tactile controls in the side as well
there's a crown that you can use to
scroll through menus and use as a home
button as well which makes it a lot
easier to use then try and use a tiny
little touch screen where your fingers
blocking everything that you're trying
to do unfortunately the apple watch will
not be releasing until sometime early
next year and it is going to be on the
more expensive side starting at three
hundred and forty nine dollars and then
going way up from there Apple actually
showed an 18 carat gold version that we
presume is going to be quite a bit more
expensive the interim model but they've
got partnerships with Nike with Fitbit
and with other companies as well that'll
make it a very popular choice we think
when it releases early next year the
other big announcement was Apple pay
which is basically their solution for
getting rid of your credit cards
sometime in the future the new iPhones
and the apple watch will also have and
if see in it wireless communications are
will allow you to make secure payments
through your devices and basically you
load your credit card into your phone at
that point you can use your credit card
just by tapping it at a point of sale
terminal at a retailer now obviously not
all retailers support this right now
Apple did go through a long list like
Whole Foods and Bloomingdale's and
things like that but we've got a long
I'm before every retailer everywhere
support</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
