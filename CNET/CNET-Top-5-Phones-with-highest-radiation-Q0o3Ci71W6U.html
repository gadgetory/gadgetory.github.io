some say it's harmless others say well
let's just say the Internet has no
shortage of hysterical medical theories
one way or the other the FCC says that
all cellphones sold in the United States
must be tested for their specific
absorption rate for SAR if the rate at
which radiation from the phone is
absorbed into your body and the maximum
allowed by the FCC is 1.6 watts per
kilogram of flesh I'm Donnell Bell and
in this top 5 I'll be counting down
these cellphones that get me closest to
that maximum legal radiation level
starting off at number 5 the Huawei
Victoria with an SAR rating of one point
four nine entry-level Android phone
available on metro pcs for 130 dollars
prepaid seems like a screaming deal for
an LTE compatible Android phone the only
catch is it might be slowly sterilizing
you from your pocket then again maybe
it's giving your junk some kind of
superpower
maybe that tingling sensation is just
your spidey sense at number four the
Alcatel OneTouch evolve a 2.5 star
rating from us so don't say we didn't
warn you if you have this phone there's
only one reason you bought it the price
$99 all in other than that the screen is
blurry the Android is stale the
processor is slow and there's no 4G
support on the plus side the name
implies that any mutation you might be
getting it's going to be more of an
evolution than a horrible deformity at
number three with a SAR rating of 1.5
the motorola moto e one of the best
budget phones out there with a price of
$140 and some well rounded specs now for
just a little bit more though the Moto G
is a much better phone has the
distinction of not being on this list
but the Moto e ESM benefits you get
Android KitKat a 4.3 inch screen a gig
of ram and a water-resistant coating
that protects it from spills or rain or
a sudden and unexpected loss of bladder
control coming in at number two the
Motorola Droid ultra with an SAR rating
of 1.5 for now we know what that ultra
was for it since
Ultra dose of radiation for your gonads
and on a premium phone - around $500 off
contract I was beginning to think this
is all just a conspiracy - array D 8
turns out it's just a conspiracy to
radiate Android users finally the number
one phone that can double as a pocket
warmer the Motorola Droid Maxx a 1.5 for
SAR rating and a 15 hour battery life
that will keep that barely legal level
of radiation blasting your lower body
all day long now make no mistake the max
is a 4.5 star rating from Cena and an
editor's choice it is an outstanding
phone that raises the bar on performance
battery life and potential tumor growth
now I just kidding it's probably fine
probably so there you go
5 phones that you may want to avoid if
you're a hypochondriac for more help
finding phones that are right for you as
well as a list of phones for Peter Lewis
