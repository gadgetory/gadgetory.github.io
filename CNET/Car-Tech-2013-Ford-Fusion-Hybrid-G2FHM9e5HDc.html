when all the official cars of middle
America offer one look at Accord camry
malibu Sonata and Ford Fusion this may
be the most interesting of the pack
however let's drive the 2013 Ford Fusion
Hybrid this one's an SE and check the
tech now in that world of Accords and
Camrys in Malibu some sonatas this one
wins on one count before you even turn
the key and that is to my eye looks
that's a $50,000 face folks and it
continues very nicely through the
greenhouse only getting a little
unfortunate back here where things end
kind of vocally now the first thing I
like about the interface and the Ford
Fusion is not the interface but where
it's nestled here it's in a flat plane
on the console this is very different
than some other Ford's we've driven
lately where you've got an eyebrow two
cheeks and a chin around it these big
protrusions that look kind of cool but
they impede you getting to these key
four corners which is where you really
drive what mode you're in on this system
this is much more usable the downside is
this flat face also opens up to lots of
glare are you telling me I have a flat
face as you can hear this Ford Fusion
also has Ford's rather eerie text
message support it can speak messages to
you as they come in and you can reply
with one of several canned responses and
also set up your own custom canned
replies yes like this screw you now in
general you've seen my Ford touch 100
times I'm not going to detail every
feature nothing really made you're new
here but it still suffers from two key
things first is third time's the charm
touch response that's not good I mean
sometimes it'll get it right away other
times you got to hit it twice or three
times secondly the system can still be
too complicated
they've boiled down some screens like
the phone screen here not bad the audio
screens have always been pretty clear
but
then you go to some other areas like the
internet settings I think my wireless
router is easier to deal with than that
oh by the way the navigation of the
Fusion Hybrid is a really good system
right now this is for its latest
iteration couple things you'll look for
these nice clear street signs that show
up on city streets are very good you're
also getting some local traffic
conditions as you can see called out
nicely with a glow around the street as
opposed to a changing line color this to
me is much more digestible than changing
Street Line colors also note that as of
today we're shooting in February of 2013
Ford's appaling a big collection of apps
does not work with myford touch this
multi LCD interface it's a weird split
in their technology right now and
they're working on it but for now no app
link here that means Ford's app support
is trapped on the earlier generation one
version of sync its LCD base but very
different than this or even on the non
LCD cars like we've seen in the Ford
Fiesta but not here on the most modern
head unit I'd like to see Ford pull it
all together get all their app support
with their new open developer platform
and their best three LCD interface and
solve the lag and complication here and
get that done by the end of 2013
time's a-wastin
okay here in the engine bay of our
Fusion Hybrid you've got fairly
garden-variety stuff as hybrids go two
litre inline-four engine sitting
transverse front-wheel drive only on the
hybrid by the way it's a lean burn
Atkinson cycle engine connected of
course to an electric motor and lithium
ion battery 188 horsepower 141 of those
are from the gas engine 47 contributed
by the electric motor torque Ford's not
giving a number zero to 60s around the
low 88.4 according to Edmunds for a car
that weighs a little over 3,600 pounds
delivering 4747 as its mpg in addition
to being all-wheel-drive only on the
hybrid is also only one choice of
transmission
it's a continuously variable gearbox as
is common with these power trains and
you cannot tow anything with a hybrid by
the way bear that in mind
now the Fusion Hybrid I'm not being
unkind here but it doesn't drive like it
looks this car looks like you bought a
poor-man's Aston Martin Rapide but it
drives like a very efficient focused car
you notice there are no paddle shifters
available for this CVT there's no
shiftable gate there's no rocker for
shifting to synthetic gears on that
transmission you can't shift it there's
no sport mode nothing here is about
performance it's a comfortable everyday
car with an efficiency message and
that's rare these days most cars have
multiple personalities or at least try
to power is sufficient there's more than
enough here but it doesn't ever come on
in an exhilarating fashion the car is
very well modulated in the way that it's
engineered from a last line of code to
the balance of power from its engine and
motor now that said you also feel the
battery in this car not just as a motive
force but as a weight force it's a
little wallowy in corners again there's
no sports suspension here anything like
that but it's also got a nicely planted
rye which I also attribute somewhat to
the extra weight I'm guessing there's a
couple hundred pounds on the hoof here
of additional weight through the
electric motor on the
my own battery pack as well it's a nice
comfortable riding car they've done a
good job getting a good bias but it's
not one that is a real treat to toss in
and out of corners Ford let's the
computer access the electric power
steering in this car to get you back in
line rather than using some kind of yaw
braking like a lot of other cars do Ford
has a little smoothing work to do on the
braking on this car sometimes you get
less than you expect sometimes quite a
bit more apparently depending on how the
regen circuit and the service brakes
work together okay pricing the Fusion
Hybrid se is kind of funny because my
first advice is don't get an se at all
because to get the cool tech you've got
to option this guy up with a bunch of
luxury packages that enable you to get
the cool tech by then you basically got
a titanium so start with the titanium
model at about 33 grand then you've got
to add a handful of features to go seen
that style including navigation with the
voice command 800 bucks
the driver assist package blind spot and
lane departure that's a grand adaptive
cruise about a thousand all in CNET
style on a limited hybrid to around 37
and a half roughly 2200 bucks more gonna
similarly teched-out non-hybrid fusion
titanium with the EcoBoost motor a cool
little turbo motor with that in mind you
got to look at both very carefully think
about how long you're going to keep this
car as well there's a two two and a
quarter year pay off cycle if you're an
average driver to make up for this
hybrid premium I think going with the
EcoBoost engine might give you more of a
fun driving dynamic but over the long
haul this might be more economical</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
