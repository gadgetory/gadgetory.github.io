and a pleasant summer day don't be
fooled at 6,000 288 feet it's the
highest mountain in the northeastern US
and home to some of the world's most
extreme weather
that's Tom padam one of the weather
watchers at the Mount Washington
observatory wins on that brutal November
today we're gusting up to 105 miles per
hour with a wind show of minus 40
Fahrenheit think that's crazy
the summit of Mount Washington in April
1934 recorded a gust of 231 miles per
hour setting a world record that's been
topped only once since then so why is
the weather here so extreme for one
thing we're veiling winds at 6,000 feet
haven't had any obstacles slowed them
down for a thousand miles or more and
when those winds reach New Hampshire
they hit a wall of mountains and that
wall forms a funnel with a focal point
right at Mount Washington on top of that
three major storm tracks converge there
all of which makes for some seriously
dangerous weather all year round here
are some more extremes mountain averages
97 inches of rain and 281 inches of snow
every year hurricane-force winds are a
regular presence during the extended
winter season monitor mile-per-hour
winds whipped through basically once a
week I wanted to see what it's like to
actually work there the privately funded
Mount Washington observatory has two
crews each with three weather observers
and one two three interns each crew
rotates in every Wednesday for a
week-long stay at the summit there are
weather instruments to monitor recording
things like temperature wind speed and
barometric pressure people have been
doing that at the observatory since 1932
and that's produced of a remarkable
historical record of weather patterns
and climate behavior the Observatory
website updates throughout the day and
there's a twice daily higher summits
forecast that's vital information for
hikers and skiers and tourists in the
immediate vicinity and it helps a lot
with regional forecast as well so we're
going out a minimum of at least once an
hour to take weather observation
readings so we're taking temperature
making sure our instruments are free as
well as looking at sky condition
visibility and any type of precip that
might be falling from the sky
kind of putting that all together for a
meet our that we submit once an hour
around the clock even in extreme weather
the meteorologists go outside to make
observations that twirly contraption
it's a sling psychrometer which they
used to gauge dewpoint and relative
humidity when they're snow or rain
someone's got to go out to fetch the
precipitation bucket and it gets worse
it's really frightening winter weather
they constantly have to deep ice the
instruments and that can be hazardous
the highest winds I've ever experienced
while working here is 158 miles per hour
the winds were from the Northwest that
night and I was outside de-icing the
instrumentation and when I came back in
the building was actually shaking and
which is kind of an impressive feat
given that it's a solid concrete
building with about two to three feet
walls we're seeing heavy freezing rain
with winds gusting to 110 miles an hour
it was building up six inches per hour
of clear solid glazed ice I was knocking
off basically four foot by two and a
half foot or so thick blocks of ice that
way to good 150 pounds in a hundred mile
an hour winds so that was pretty scary
actually as scary as all that may sound
it's just the daily routine for the crew
they even have fun with it like doing
science experiments with eggs and
boiling water you should be sure to
check out their YouTube channel in
better weather there were actually a lot
of tourists who come to visit about
350,000 a year they can hike up drive a
car ride the old fashioned cog railway
however they get there there's usually
aligned for photos at the summit marker
I couldn't resist if you visit just
don't push your luck especially in
winter
