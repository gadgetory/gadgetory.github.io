on one pcs on Dan Ackerman this is the
Lenovo yoga home 900 Lenovo used to call
this series the horizon line and
essentially their big-screen all-in-one
PCs but with a battery built-in and
unique kickstand so we would call them
tabletop because you use them like this
keyboard and mouse come included and
then when you want to lay it down you
just push down on the hinge and it folds
back gently like this you can actually
stop anywhere along the way when you go
all the way down it becomes a tabletop
PC and it actually launches its own
custom UI that lets you access some
games and apps and photos and you can
you know manipulate them here very kind
of sci-fi style on on this kind of table
top style desktop or of course you can
just go back to the traditional Windows
desktop and if you switch into Windows
tens tablet mode that's actually a great
way to interact with a computer that's
sitting kind of you know flat on a table
or a desk or coffee table and pointing
up at you as well and when you're done
using it as a tabletop you just lift it
up there's a latch in the back that you
press down and then the hinge comes out
and you set it up like this again and
you can even unplug for about three
hours but when you're using it like this
it's meant to you know kind of stay
plugged into the wall you're going to
find Intel fifth generation Core i5
processors in here it's got a big
27-inch 1920 by 1080 display with a very
nice matte anti-glare finish to it you
can even get so it's a very mid-level
current gen Nvidia graphics so you're
going to find this in Best Buy stores
and also at Lenovo starting at $15.99
I'm Dan Ackman that's the Lenovo yoga
home 900</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
