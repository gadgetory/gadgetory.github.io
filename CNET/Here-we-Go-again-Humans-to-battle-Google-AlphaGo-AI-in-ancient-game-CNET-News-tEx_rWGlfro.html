artificial intelligence in the ancient
Chinese board game of go but during the
first faceoff things didn't go so well
for Team human last year in March
google's alphago AI computer beat one of
the greatest go players winning four to
five games it was a close game at the
end but now the top go player in the
world wants a shot at taking down the
computer Chinese champion qiji will play
three games against the machine in
person but he did play the machine twice
already online and lost the challenge
will take place May 23rd through the
27th during a five-day festival of go at
the games motherland China experts have
said this alphago machine is encouraging
players to think differently about their
strategies and styles and play with more
creativity alphago is the creation of
the google deepmind team and go is a
great way to show off advanced machine
learning skills because this 3000 year
old game of black and white stones is
crazy complicated it is not possible to
program a computer to play out every
possible combination of moves like you
can't for chess instead the computer
learns the rules and has to improvise
I'm Bridget Carey to keep score of how
robots are busting humans and our
continuing quest to build computers that
could destroy your own species head to
