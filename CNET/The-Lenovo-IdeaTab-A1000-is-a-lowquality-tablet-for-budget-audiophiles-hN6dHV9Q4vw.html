Lenovo idea Tab a 1000 this 7-inch
tablet has a pretty simple design with
two front-facing speakers and a front
facing camera the back is smooth with a
matte finish and no rear camera the top
edge of the tablet is home to the power
button headphone jack and microUSB port
with a microSD slot and volume rocker
around the corner on the right edge the
idea tab a 1000 ships with Android 4.1.2
and the most impressive thing about it
is the Dolby Digital Plus audio
enhancement feature it has an equalizer
with presets for everything ranging from
podcasts to variety shows but is only
functional when using headphones the
equalizer significantly optimizes a
fuller sound that's more enjoyable to
listen to but it's a shame that the same
benefits can't be reaped by the tablet 2
front facing speaker the tablet has an
unfashionably low res 1024 by 600 pixel
resolution screen that provides an
underwhelming viewing experience with
washed out colors and bad viewing angles
HD content loses any sharp detail or
vibrant color saturation resulting in
dull videos and images performance wise
the tablet leaves a lot to be desired
the idea to have a 1000 suffers from
occasional lagging when navigating
between different screens and apps and
sometimes responds slowly to swipe when
it comes to gaming this tablet is
definitely a noob simple mobile games
ran smoothly but it crashed every time
it ran 3dmark benchmark testing a gaming
device this is not the tablet also had
significant trouble loading Netflix
video as in it couldn't however it was
able to load videos from different apps
easily the Talbot's retail price starts
at 159 but with a variety of other
budget tablets on the market with
similar qualities and better execution
the idea tab a 1000 is hardly compelling
for seeing it I'm Xiomara Blanco and
this has been the Lenovo idea Tab a 1000
