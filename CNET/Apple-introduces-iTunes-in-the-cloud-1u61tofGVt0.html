car well the first thing we've done
again is for the songs you've already
bought we've added a purchase button
that shows you your entire purchase
history of all the iTunes songs you
bought on any device you can look at it
by all songs or recent songs or you can
look at it by artist so I'm going to
pick Bob Dylan here and I can download
any of these albums that I've bought on
iTunes to this device just by pushing
that cloud download button or I could go
in to one of them and just download
whatever songs I want to this device so
anything I bought I can now download to
any of my devices at no additional
charge which is great and for the future
I flick one switch to on and now any
song I buy on any device again will
automatically be downloaded to all my
devices so when I want to buy a song in
this case an Adele song it will push it
to all of my devices so to give us a
demo of that again I'd like to invite
idiot thanks Steve let's see what
happens when I purchase a new song and
if we can bring up my iPad I'm gonna go
ahead and launch our new music player in
iOS 5 and on my iPhone I'm gonna go back
to the iTunes store I want to buy a new
song and I want to look at the Bruno
Mars's new album
that's definitely it now I'm gonna buy
it but before I do notice on my iPad I
don't have any Bruno Mars songs at all
so we're gonna go and buy and it's now
downloading to my iPhone and in addition
there's the Bruno Mars song and of
course let's play so now when I buy a
song on one of my devices it
automatically downloads to all of my
devices without having to sync or do any
work at all and that's iTunes in the
cloud</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
