to go I'm hungry it's going to get dark
soon
that was that's a deaf right
last time we tried a road trip in an
electric car it went very wrong so
naturally we thought let's try this
again but over a thousand miles and
under intense time pressure that
pressure will come courtesy of Mobile
World Congress a huge tech show we
absolutely must not miss the shows in
Barcelona a thousand miles from where we
work in London and we're planning to
drive the distance in an electric car
stopping at six charge points along the
way with an overnight stop in the French
town of a wrong that's a lot of driving
but we're not attempting this in just
any electric car Oh No meet the Tesla
Model S and all-electric luxury saloon
Tesla's loaned us the Model S 9 TD which
packs all-wheel-drive auto-steer
features cost nearly 100 grand and whips
up to 60 in just 4.7 more importantly
for us it's got a maximum range of 340
miles and can suck up to 170 miles with
the power in a half hours charge we'll
be using every trick of the car sleeve
and learning more about the state of
electric driving today let's roll our
journey begins in rain-filled London
with a night drive down to our first
milestone the Channel Tunnel this feat
of engineering connects the UK to France
fire an undersea railway that took over
five years to build and was opened in
1994 our cars going over on the
Eurotunnel shuttle which moves an
average of 30,000 customers in their
vehicles across the sea every day
welcome mr. Hoyle
ticket acquired the cars parked up and
Andy's promised to slap up breakfast in
the convenient nearby cafe is it open
Andy it doesn't open until 6:00 what
time is it now five when what time did
you insist on picking me up Andy I want
you to look into the camera when you say
it three not a great start but it's not
long to wait until we're driving the
model ass up onto the shuttle and
enjoying the novelty of being in a car
on a train that headed under the sea
you ever gone there you're a tunnel when
you were a kid I think I did once yeah I
went on a school a school trip and that
was and that was really exciting
did you appreciate the feats of
engineering that it is when you were
that age no no I just appreciated that I
was on a train and that was it but now
the idea that I've driven onto a train
and it goes under the sea is just
mind-blowing five minutes later we're in
France now our attention switches to the
cars dwindling battery so Andy we're out
the tunnel what are we doing now we are
trying to find a charging point and I
have absolutely no idea where the hell
to go we're looking around charges we
can't find Tesla's electric super
charges but then we spot them nestled in
a rainy corner of a hotel car park it's
time to refuel the Model S if we can
find the charging port it's on the other
side give me a second
that means it's charging it's hardly a
dignified start but we've hit a major
milestone we're in France and the car is
charging only 900 miles to go what could
go wrong we're gonna stop here for about
20 minutes give it a quick boost how was
this happened where are we</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
