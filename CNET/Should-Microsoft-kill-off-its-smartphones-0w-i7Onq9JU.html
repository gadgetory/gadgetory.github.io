it's not a trusted company they're not
even using the Nokia name so they lose
what little sort of bit of
respectability that Nokia had left don't
talk to me about about Nokia it's no
secret that Microsoft has had a hard
time over the last few years when it
comes to phones but shouldn't give up
completely and let Apple and Samsung
have all the fun with me is rich trend
home of a C net fame I don't think
that's the case you think there's still
life in Windows on mobile absolutely I'm
a huge huge fan of Windows fan with the
phone I have been for years I think
there's more than life in Windows Phone
I think it's only gonna get better why
why well for many many reasons I mean it
it's been around for a few years that's
true and it is there been a distant
third there's that time very distant in
most markets that is true but the whole
point of being Microsoft is that you can
stay the course we're not talking about
we're not talking about a Bundy we're
not talking about yotaphone we're not
talking about some tiny little player
we're talking about the big one of the
biggest companies in the world they've
got all the money in the world and they
can continue to stay the course and keep
building this platform up and they need
to be in mobile let's face it Mobile is
such a big thing they need to be in
mobile they need to stick with Windows
Phone and it's going to only get better
you may have a point about having to
stay in mobile but I think you're wrong
when you say that Microsoft is big
enough that it can stay the course like
Microsoft does have a lot of money and
and all like that
but you know the tech history books are
full of companies that people thought
were too big to fail and then they
failed like you know including sort of
Apple when it fell on hard times and
sort of had to make a comeback and
Microsoft would be wise I think to learn
the lessons from Apple when it was
struggling and not sort of spread itself
too thin and not put too much effort
into something that's clearly not
working and hasn't been working for
years but this is the thing it hasn't
been working on current terms but this
thing is we're looking forward to
Windows 10 right and that's going to be
the point where Microsoft has one set of
software across all devices and that's
kind of been a Holy Grail for mobile
it's almost like this is the first
chapter of the mobile era where we've
had iOS and
s10 are separate things we've had
Android and the Internet are separate
things we've had you know mobile phones
and laptops and computers and PCs as
separate things but when Windows 10
comes along then we're gonna have
Windows on your mobile windows on your
laptop and it's gonna be the same thing
they're not even going to have numbered
releases anymore they're not going to
have Windows 10 and then Windows 11 and
Windows 12 they're just gonna have
Windows and it upgrades all the time and
it's cause all your devices you have
Universal apps and that's gonna be the
killer it's the fact that you have
Universal apps there's more to it than
that's like I don't think it matters if
Microsoft gets that right I think it'll
be something that it come it could be
something that it gets completely right
but that nobody buys anyway because
people don't look at phones and think
what I can use multiple apps across the
platform that's so exciting people don't
buy iOS and they don't buy Android they
buy Apple and Samsung and Microsoft is
not a force in phones it's not a trusted
company they're not even using the Nokia
name so they lose what little sort of
bit of respectability that Nokia had
left don't talk to me about about Nokia
derp derp derp derp derp derp derp derp
did it gets me every single time but no
yeah it's hardware hardware hardware
hardware is really important and
Microsoft has not made a really
compelling Lumia phone like Microsoft
hadn't made one in ages it's been so
long since we saw a Windows Phone
flagship or anyone actually any Windows
Phone that really looked interesting or
different and so I don't think it
matters how good the software is or how
well it works across multiple devices if
basically no one's interested possibly
yeah yeah by the near hand Windows Phone
it is on the up its up to 10% market
share in the first quarter of 2015 in
Spain France Italy Germany and the UK
and those are countries in which Android
is declining statistics statistics prove
anything he's preventing anything the
fact well I was reading another bit of
research like that I think came out I
think it was IDC yeah it came out in
February bit of analysis showed that
Windows Phone was growing but slow
then you know the other major operating
systems like growing slower than say
slow and steady wins the race
slow and steady isn't winning the race
nothing in the hair look two lights in
the hair if I'm if I'm matter in the
hair I can't remember what the animal is
stop your list the animals and it's
distracting me because I enjoy thinking
about animals they know that underhanded
politics Richard the poor boys
the poor boys in the hair that was it
yeah as it the poor boys in there so I
think ultimately the bottom line about
Windows is that it's the most
future-proofed interface the most
future-proof experience because you look
at iOS for example it hasn't changed
since the iPhone first came out and it
is still what it's always been which is
little tiny icons that don't tell you
anything
whereas Windows and Windows Phone you've
got this with the colourful square live
tiles you've got the kind of the icon
system that small enough to work on
small screens but they still tell you
stuff and it scales up to different
sized screens with Windows on your PC so
where you've got iOS which is you know
your like ons don't tell you anything
and then OS 10 on your laptop and it's
completely different separated
experience and iOS is half fat stripped
down cut down sawn off you know hobbled
experience compared to our RS 10 Windows
you've got this much smoother transition
across both and it's added kind of if
the difference between a library and a
newsagents so iOS is a library you go in
and you can see a lot of spines you can
see all the books but you can't tell
anything about them whereas you go into
a news agents and you can see all of
magazines but you can also see the
covers you can tell a little bit about
them you see the covers the magazines
for younger viewers magazines like a
website printed out and stapled together
but so it's so Windows is it's just a
much more future-proof experience so
looking to the future Microsoft has all
to play for
I mean looking to the future like iOS is
stripped down and it is like not as
feature-rich in yeah-ha baldra terms of
internet whatever but it is also like
more popular than oxygen like it's just
just people love it and they use it and
they like it I'm not saying people like
Coldplay people
not saying that Windows Phone is like is
bad or that if tomorrow we magically
replaced everyone's phones with Windows
Phones they wouldn't be better off
because I think maybe they would I'm
just saying I think from Microsoft's
point of view like maybe it's time to
call time like in honor on a failed
experiment well I disagree okay but all
right okay so let us know what you think
we want to know your thoughts on what
Microsoft should do with this smart
phone business so do let us know in the
comments all right thank you for
