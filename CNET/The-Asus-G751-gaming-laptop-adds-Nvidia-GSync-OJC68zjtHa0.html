technologies comes to laptops I'm Dan
Akron and this is the ax sous g7 51
g-sync edition now this is a big 17 inch
gaming laptop very similar to a model
that we reviewed late in 2014 that one
was also called this is g7 51 both of
these things have core i7 CPUs and they
have nvidia 980 M graphics cards which
is about as high-end graphics card can
get on a laptop right now and they both
did great for basic pc gaming
performance what's new this time is this
updated version supports g-sync which is
an nvidia technology that basically
takes the output from the video card and
the refresh rate of the display and
slinks them together so that the the
graphics card only outputs a frame of
animation when the display is ready to
receive it and vice versa what that
means is you get a much smoother overall
look without overly taxing your hardware
in order to get that previously used to
have to turn on a feature called vsync
that's usually in the settings menu of
most games and Leasing vertical sync
would would smooth most of that out but
you'd also take a hit to performance
with vsync off you usually get what they
call tearing on the screen which is
where the image sort of looks like the
top half is being drawn before the
bottom half and you have this weird sort
of jaga a bit in the middle and when
you're playing a game that can be very
jarring now up until now we've only seen
g-sync this new nvidia technology in
desktops where you had to have a
compatible graphics card in your desktop
computer and a compatible Jesus a
monitor and connect them with a
displayport cable and we always said oh
this is great but why can't we have this
in a laptop and this is one of the first
models that has that using this system
which costs about twenty-five hundred
dollars same as the non jisuk version
from last year gaming performance was
still excellent and when we turn GC
gaand you could definitely see this the
screen tearing was reduced it's not
going to change your life completely but
it's a nice extra feature to have
especially if you'd like to run games at
higher detail settings and you want
things to look as smooth and crisp as
possible besides the Nvidia version
that's called g-sync AMD company also
makes CPU
and graphics cards has their own version
called free sink and that uses a whole
nother set of hardware and software
standards I'm dan Aykroyd and that is
the asst G 751 gaming laptop with g-sync</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
