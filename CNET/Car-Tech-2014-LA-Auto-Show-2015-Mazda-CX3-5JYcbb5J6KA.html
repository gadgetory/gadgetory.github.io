a rocket trip to the moon in the US one
of the hottest categories is where this
guy's playing in the compact crossover
market new entry from mazda this is
theirs it's the cx-3 now it's based in
spite of the nomenclature on the mazda 2
but they've kind of pulled that thing to
its maximum dimensions eight inches
longer than a to going this way about
three inches wider going this way but
what I want you to see more than its
volumes is its overall style this is all
about premium look and styling you got
good size wheels you got an audacious
body you've got Mazdas very celebrated
new kind of front clip and face and
inside a lot of premium look as well
it's not a bare-bones proposition also
check out the rear quarter it would be
the c-pillar you've got some blackout
treatment there you see us on a lot of
Jaguars in fact that gives you the
impression of sort of a floating roof
again I premium touch you don't expect
in a little guy this size or class now
inside we see a lot of classic current
Mazda cues they're going with something
called Mazda connect on this car believe
it's their second car that will have
that they're moving more into a
connected absent infotainment platform
it starts off largely with an LCD panel
here this kind of multi controller down
here and ah ha from Harmon bringing in a
lot of different services in an audio
form information podcasts radio even
travel information but all kind of
packaged for your ear and they expect to
have more apps supported in that flew
2015 which would be a good piece of
ketchup for them I notice up here a
little plastic pop-up HUD combiner a
little hood screen basically this is
part of the Mazda connect technology
also as they kind of bring some
information out there to keep your eyes
more on the road even while you have
other interfaces in the car CX three
hits us spring of 2015 pricing is
obviously it's a little too early for
that I can tell you this it's one engine
only in the US though a two liter
skyactiv high compression gas for hooked
up to an automatic transmission
all-wheel drive will be an option will
look for it soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
