com and welcome to road warrior where we
take a look at the hottest gadgets for
life on the go coming up a blackberry a
blackjack and brian cooley redesigns an
Audi by mistake first up the Oakley
thump pro sunglasses with an mp3 player
built in you're skeptical I see that
Jasmine France explains up to you so you
may be asking yourself what are you
going to use these for these are
actually extremely handy for athletes
and outdoor enthusiasts so any time
you're doing something outdoors that
priority to be active such as cycling
snowboarding golfing really handy for
that actually and the buttons are easy
to press there's no LCD or screen and
the earbuds let in plenty of extraneous
noise which is a good thing because
whenever you're doing something active
outdoors you want to be aware of your
surroundings that's right so don't drive
with them on it's distracting you know
it's illegal to have headphones in your
ear when you drive even if they are in
sunglasses next up the samsung blackjack
it's a 3g smartphone on the singular
network and it's taken on the motorola q
so how does it compare terms of design
it's really nice and flick it has this
nice sexy black casing that i like also
has a kind of soft touch finish makes it
easy to grip compared to the motorola q
you can see it's slimmer you do get a
smaller screen but it's still gorgeous
and the keyboards a little cramped and i
actually had some problems with the
navigation controls there really cramped
and i kept pressing the wrong button so
that was really frustrating Bonnie
points out that it's running the Windows
Mobile 5 smartphone edition so you won't
have the ability to edit Office
documents onto the evdo seen Bonnie also
got her hands on the blackberry 8703e I
didn't 8700 series so you got this more
traditional form factor with the full
chorded keyboard which we really like
keys are a little bit slippery but still
large and really tactile so easy to
message on really nice screen it's sharp
and colorful so shouldn't have any
problems viewing images or your email
and text documents on here do you sprint
customers get a version of the 8703 for
your service to doesn't that make you
feel special finally we take a ride in
the audi a4 2.0 t quattro as brian
cooley caused a redesign in the a4 got
this motorized double oh seven ish
button and that rotates the LCD down and
away
and there you find to SD slots the
problem is in the last car we tried
these were treacherous they were mounted
lower down so you could barely get to
them and she tried to stick your SD card
in there well I dropped mine it fell
into the guts of the radio we couldn't
get it out after an hour of struggling
he went to the dealer they couldn't get
it out my card is still floating around
in some press vehicle somewhere in the
country it was very annoying what
they've done now though is they've moved
the slots up higher so they're easier to
access and if you look down in there
they've kind of blocked off and sealed
that gap where cards used to fall inside
the guts of the radio so that's now a
feature I actually think is livable good
thing there's those SD card slots
because there's not an iPod adapter not
even an auxiliary port that's it for
this edition of road warrior I'm Tom
Merritt check back next time for more
gadgets to keep you armed and
dangerously productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
