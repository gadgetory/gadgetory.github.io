today we're cooking with the Wolfgang
Puck pressure oven and this is a
countertop appliance for your kitchen
the promise is to cook meats and poultry
quite a bit faster than the conventional
method you might be using it does this
because it's a pressure cooker it has
this valve up on top here that locks in
the heat locks in moisture actually gets
the boiling point of water up that makes
the steam that infuses your food super
hot and that's what cooks it fast now
you don't have to pressure cook with
this thing you can leave the valve on
top vented and not seal it shut when
you're using it and that will in effect
make it into a very large toaster oven
but if you're using that pressure
cooking function you're going to get
really fast performance and that's the
main claim of this thing so we wanted to
verify that we cooked a full sized pork
roast both in a traditional oven and in
the Wolfgang Puck pressure oven and we
found that the pressure oven pork cooked
way faster we also tried cooking a full
size 8 pound chicken and the results we
got there were terrific
we got juicy meat on the inside a crispy
skin on the outside it was even better
than what we got out of a convection
oven now the true torture test though
was the full size turkey that we cooked
and this was 13 pounds in change it was
large size bird it almost didn't fit had
to squeeze it in the door there a few
watches we're cooking it Browns up
nicely on the outside and a little bit
extra on the top because it's so close
to that heating element it's kind of
smushed in there
the ovens recipe says it'll cook at 11
pound bird in 50 to 55 minutes this was
13 pounds took about an hour and 10
minutes to get it fully up to
temperature but that was still
exceptional compared to what it would
take to cook in a normal oven if you
want to save time this thing will do it
I do have some qualms with the design
though especially with the pressure
valve this thing has to be used
correctly and it's not quite as
idiot-proof as I would like to see if
you look up here it's got the vent spot
and then it's got these two different
seals this is actually one large seal
position here anything outside of vent
will seal it but still it's a little
confusing there's also the fact that the
arrow is on this side and then the
little handle is on this side I could
really see someone making a mistake of
using the handle as the arrow if you put
that handle towards vent it's going to
actually be in the seal position I wish
it was a little better designed
inspire some more confidence as you're
cooking these large cuts of meat it cost
249 dollars that's not an inexpensive
countertop appliance but it's pretty
reasonable given the time-saving
performance that it offers for CNET I'm
