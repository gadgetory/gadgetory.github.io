at these former residents of Thomas
Edison here in Louisville Kentucky for
134 years his incandescent lightbulb
reigns supreme but that is all starting
to change thanks to recent legislation
that mandates stricter efficiency
standards for lighting and that means
that new bulbs like LEDs and CFLs are
starting to become the new normal
this means that replacing your lights is
going to be a whole lot different from
here on out but don't worry because
Cena's got you covered with a handy
buying guide so come on let's talk some
lights so with these new standards and
these new bulbs you're going to need to
know a little bit more about lighting
when you make your next light bulb
purchase they're going to be a much
longer lasting appliance for you it's
going to be more of an investment even
if they cost more so you want to know
what you're getting before you get it
the first most important thing you need
to learn is what a lumen is and that is
a unit of brightness a lumen just tells
you how bright a light is the more
lumens of light has the brighter it's
going to be so when you're looking at
two bulbs and you want to compare
exactly how bright they're going to be
just look at the lumens don't worry
about the wattage don't worry about
anything else the lumens are going to
tell you how bright it is the concrete
number the more lumens the brighter it
is and this is an easy thing to do these
days because the Federal Trade
Commission made sure that lighting
manufacturers put lighting facts on the
box and they've got these little labels
that are just like nutrition facts on
food so if you look at these two boxes
we have an incandescent box here and a
halogen box here the incandescent is a
60 watt and the halogen is a 60 watt
replacement it's 43 watts but it's
supposed to approximate a 60 watt
incandescent the incandescent puts out
880 lumens and that's a good average
number for what a incandescent should
put out at 60 watts but the halogen only
puts out 565 and that's pretty low so if
you wanted a nice bright light that
approximated the 60 watt incandescent
here this halogen probably wouldn't be
your best bet and understanding lumens
will help you figure that out and shop
around and get a better bulb the other
principle that you're really going to
want to know and understand is color
temperature the way this works is you've
got a scale of temperature from 2700
degrees Kelvin or so to 6,000 degrees
Kelvin and the confusing part is that
lights on this end of the spectrum low
end are considered warm lights and as
they get hotter in terms of
color temperature they're called cool
lights so it is confusing it's not ideal
but just understand that warm lights are
yellow on the low end of the spectrum
and cool lights are blue on the high end
of the spectrum incandescent have always
lived here on the yellow end of the
spectrum and CFLs and LEDs have been
thought to sit on the blue end but
that's not true anymore there are plenty
of bulbs across the spectrum when it
comes to CFLs and LEDs so you're going
to have plenty of options so if someone
tells you that the new energy standards
mean the end of yellowy incandescent
style light that's just simply not true
to help you find these options to make
it really easy the manufacturers even
color code their packaging in many cases
here are two bulbs from Sylvania or two
packages for bulbs I should say this
one's nice and yellow this one's blue
and of course this is a low color
temperature incandescent type light this
is a high color temperature cool blueish
very fluorescent light and finally
you're going to want to be aware of the
fact there are a lot of emerging smart
light options on the market you can find
bulbs you screw in and use Bluetooth or
Wi-Fi to control from your phone bulbs
you can connect with an existing home
automation system like Insteon or nexia
and sync up with your smart locks and
with your thermostat and with all sorts
of devices and they're really kind of
cool to play with they add a lot of
functionality and make your life a
little easier
there are also lights like the philips
hue that change color on demand and are
creative parties you can sync it up to
your music and have all sorts of fun
recipes with if2 going on it's just a
lot of fun a little expensive and kind
of a novelty but as novelties go this is
one that I kind of love for more light
bulb tips and guidance check out the
rest of my buying guide and leave a
comment let us know what you think about
lights these days
for seeing it I'm right Chris
