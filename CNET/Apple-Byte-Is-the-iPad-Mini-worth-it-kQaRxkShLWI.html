welcome to the Apple by for all the good
and bad inside the world of Apple the
new iPads are here and some of you might
even be watching the show on them I can
assure you I'm much bigger in real life
now there are no big secrets here with
the iPads but let's take a look at a
first look review of the ipad mini with
scott steins when the ipad mini was
announced the whole idea was to take the
ipad experience and make it smaller and
lo and behold this is a really small
device they notice the design is
different and it's really taking a page
more from the ipod touch it's a curved
anodized aluminum shell that goes all
the way around the sides and it's flat
on the back and it curved on the edges
and the taper over here is sort of an
aluminum bezel is a lot like the iphone
5s there's a 5-megapixel isight camera
on the back there's an HD FaceTime
camera on the front that's similar to
the fifth generation iPod Touch and
similar to what's on the new fourth gen
ipad there's no flash on the back but
you can shoot 1080p video and you can
take facetime calls in HD you have a
much faster processor at that top end
level and in a 6 X and this is an a5 so
you have a performance gap and you also
have a Retina display on that end you
also a price difference the
fourth-generation iPad starts at four
ninety nine for 16 gigabytes this is 334
starting with 16 gigabytes and this at
three hundred thirty dollars is a
premium but when you pick it up it's
going to be hard to put back down I'm
Scott Stein and that's a look at the new
iPad Mini available in November second
alright guys you know it's still a cool
product and a nice addition to the
lineup if you're willing to pay for it
but no retina display is still a turnoff
for me at that price especially with a
7-inch Nexus at 199 for 16 gigs it'll be
interesting to see how this all plays
out this holiday season now Amazon wants
to make sure you know the ipad mini
isn't the only kid on the block with a
front page comparison between the mini
and the kindle fire HD now amazon
claimed the mini only had a mono speaker
but phil schiller responded to a
customer email saying nah nah it is
stereo he actually used those words now
in response amazon then took down the
comparison and phil schiller responded
with rock on now the semi controversial
ipad 4th generation is also available
and it delivers on its claims of being
twice as fast when benchmarks appeared
in the Geekbench database and showed off
performance about double the speed of
the 3rd gen ipad and it's the fastest
mobile device Apple has produced to date
cnet also received confirmation from
Apple that iTunes 11 will in fact be
delayed for a release in November in
order to get it right now this is a good
thing people and after what we've seen
with serious performance and maps it's
better to wait plus iTunes 11 is just
another thing that we can be thankful
for in November along with family
friends good health and my personal
favorite slinky tricks you can't do that
trust me I've tried now in big news that
might not be the sexiest but very
significant Apple announced a major
change up in their executive management
team senior vice president of iOS
software Scott Forstall will be leaving
the company in 2013 you know the guy who
serves directly into your soul during
Apple videos well he's played a big part
in the evolution of Apple's mobile iOS
but reports for multiple outlets says
part of his departure had to do with
four stalls refusal to sign an apology
letter for Apple's revamp and
embarrassing maps fiasco Tim Cook put
his name on the apology but for stall
didn't Forrestal was also known inside
the company for creating tension between
the executives and having
abrasive style that also clashed with
head of industrial design Jonathan Ive
Johnny I've Scott Forstall Johnny I now
in addition to his current job I will
also take over leadership of human
interface and I immediately expect we'll
see a more unified look between some of
the services so say goodbye to the green
felt game center senior vice president
of mac software engineering craig
federighi will now lead both the iOS and
OS 10 teams moving forward in addition
to that big change senior vice president
of retail john browett is stepping down
effective immediately after only eight
months on the job he was criticized for
his cutbacks on staffing and an
increased focus on profitability at the
expense of apples customer service
according to some retail employees now
guys I see the shake-up as a good thing
and we'll see how this all plays out in
the long run all right let's take a peek
at the App of the Week
I've been telling you about how
ridiculous google's voice searches and
now it's finally available to iOS users
in the Google Search app it's fast who I
real fast and fast don't lie plus if you
ask for something like the weather it
gives you an instant result and a really
cool interface that allows you to scroll
through the hours each day now Siri has
an edge when it comes to the look and
feel of results when you ask for things
like sports scores or even nearby
restaurants so it depends on what you're
looking for but Google search is worth
checking out and it's my favorite price
free also guys last week we told you we
would read a few of your emails with
your impressions from Apple's keynotes
to see if you think apples lost some of
its magic Roland Josiah chimes in with
nope I think we have become quite
spoiled and expect apple to sweep us off
our feet every time they introduce a new
product but to be completely honest with
you I was impressed with all the new
products except the ipad mini but
rolling I like being swept off my feet
just like the San Francisco Giants did
to the Detroit Tigers in the world
series four games to none
alexandria Ison writes in and says yo
Brian yo Alexandria Apple has definitely
lost some of their magic the products
are still good but they just aren't the
ones pushing the industry anymore I
switched to a Galaxy Nexus after my
disappointment in the 4s announcement
and i've been using Apple products since
well before they released any iPhone you
know I don't think you're the only one
and Madoka from Twitter rights in with I
should have won because I'm Kenyan
hashtag one love that's crazy Madoka I'm
Kenyan as well no you're not well
because of that I'm giving you check
this out a speck case for an iphone 5
and an ipad nakupenda alright that's
going to do it for this week's show guys
email us at the Apple by to cnet com and
I will answer your questions i'm brian
Tong thanks for watching we'll catch you
guys next time for another bite of the
Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
