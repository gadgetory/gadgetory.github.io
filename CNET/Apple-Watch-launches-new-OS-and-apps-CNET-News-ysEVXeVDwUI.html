your favorite apps you can just press
the side button below the crown to show
what we call the doc you can choose
which apps go here and you can quickly
scroll through them the apps are down
both glanceable and interactive rather
than separate concepts this is a
dramatic improvement how it feels to use
the watch so this increased performance
allowed us to have access to our
favorite apps quickly we want to be able
to access them anywhere so be using the
side button and get to them easily now
another key design goal we had was to
make the watch feel more familiar and so
we've done with the watch face now we've
added control center you just swipe up
from the bottom just like on iOS and
very familiar this is a giant
improvement in how it feels to use apps
and to navigate the watch very simply
and easily in watch OS three now we've
also been it more powerful powerful to
reply to messages so now when you
receive a message you can see the ways
to respond right there we've removed a
step you don't have to actually press
reply now you can just pick the way
you'd like to reply and if you just
scroll down you'll see your smart
replies right below the message so you
can just tap to reply in less than a
second now sometimes you don't see
exactly the response you like and you're
not in a situation where you can use
dictation so would it be great if you
could just write your message on the
watch well we're introducing a new way
to do that with something that we call
scribble scribble you have a new way to
respond just by writing what you like on
the screen you can just quickly draw the
letters for your message right there
like writing something like Starbucks
you can see the letters go right on top
of each other
so that's a great new way to respond
with just the response that you like on
your watch now the watch face is great
for quick looks and it reflects your
style it's also the character of the
device and we've had Mickey as a fun
watch face that I like to use on
weekends but I know what my daughter is
going to really love is Minnie is coming
to the watch now and of course you can
choose from a variety of colors for her
outfit that match our bands perfectly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
