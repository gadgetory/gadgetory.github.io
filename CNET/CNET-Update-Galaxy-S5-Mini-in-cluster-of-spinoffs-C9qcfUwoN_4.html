galaxies I'm Bridget Carey this is your
scene at update in the universe of
smartphones there are many galaxies well
Samsung galaxies that is the top model
is the galaxy s5 but Samsung likes to
make many versions for all sorts of
price points and now we have more
spin-offs there's the galaxy core to the
galaxy star to the galaxy young too and
the galaxy ace 4 but in the UK it's
called the trend too now each have
smaller displays and less powerful
processors than the flagship model but
they do all run the latest version of
Android that's 4.4 nicknamed KitKat
there's no word when these new ones will
go on sale or if they're all come to the
US or what they will cost but samsung
preaches that these models will be more
affordable now Samsung does love to keep
pumping out phones just last week sprint
announced that it would be the exclusive
seller of the galaxy s5 sport which is a
little more fitness focused and rugged
than the s5 and if that wasn't enough
samsung also has the galaxy s5 mini and
that's similar to the main model but the
screen is 4.5 inches so it's a bit
smaller or perhaps you'd call it a more
traditional screen size because these
phones keep getting bigger every year
the mini has the same design it's also
water and dust-resistant it has a
fingerprint scanner heart rate monitor
and it works with all those new
accessories like the gear fit but the
display the processor the camera memory
and storage they're all slightly
downgraded it'll come out first in
Russia in early July and it's going to
roll out globally soon after no price
was announced but it'll likely be the
same as last year's galaxy s4 mini which
was sold for a hundred dollars with a
contract now if you're looking for an
android phone that's different from the
bunch how about one that's really
off-the-grid black phone is a privacy
focused smartphone and it was created to
avoid typical tracking and surveillance
methods that are used by hackers and
government groups like the national
security agency the first black phones
have begun shipping to customers that
paid six hundred and thirty dollars for
the unsubsidized models
runs on a modified android operating
system called private OS it has built-in
support for encrypting voice calls video
calls and text messages it doesn't allow
Wi-Fi hotspots to identify personal
information and there's an extra
security menu that lets you control
application permissions it can also help
you browse the web anonymously now it's
got the hardware chops you need with a
4.7 inch HD screen a high-end processor
with 16 gigs of internal storage the
company will reopen orders for the phone
on July fourteenth that's your tech news
update you can always get more details
