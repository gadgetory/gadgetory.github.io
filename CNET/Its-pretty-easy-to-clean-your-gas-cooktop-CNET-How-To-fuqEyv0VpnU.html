gas cooktop pretty gross but cleaning a
gas cooktop isn't as easy as just wiping
down the surface here's how to safely
and effectively clean your gas cooktop
first you'll need to gather your
equipment you'll need paper towels or
cleaning cloths a big bowl or bucket
dish soap dish gloves a gentle scrubber
a spray bottle of water a toothbrush and
a glass cleaner the first thing you
should do is make sure your cooktop is
cool then remove the grates that cover
the burners check your cooktop manual to
see if the grades are dishwasher safe
if you're not sure wash them in hot
soapy water rinse and let them dry
completely newer gas cooktop models have
two caps over the burners you can also
wash them in hot soapy water rinse them
and let them dry thoroughly next use a
paper towel or cloth to wipe away any
stray crumbs then squeeze a generous
amount of dish soap into a big bowl or
bucket and fill it with hot water next
put on your dish gloves dip your
scrubber in the water and clean the
cooktop surface make sure you're careful
around the burners then spray the
surface down with clean water and wipe
it dry with a clean cloth or paper towel
now we're going to take a look at the
burners if food is stuck around the
burners ignition use a toothbrush to
gently clear away any blockages if your
control panel is also covered in gunk
use a glass cleaner in paper towel or
cloth to wipe away the mess and don't
forget to wipe down your burner knobs as
well after everything's dry replace the
burner caps and grates to make cleaning
your gas cooktop easier for the next
time give the surface a good wipe down
after every time you cook on it it'll
save you some time and energy for your
next
