just coming for your for a visit
let's face it traffic is bad and parking
is the worst but not for me because I am
in the scoot Co on that's right I'm in
my soup and my sourdough bread bowl at
the same time because I'm able to get
along and this all electric get about
town I can park easy and when I'm done I
just give it back because it's a rental
baby so what this is is a rebadged
Renault Twizy it's coming from Nissan as
a new mobility concept and it is being
leased as a scoop quad here in San
Francisco I've got a top speed of 25
miles an hour which means sometimes I
wish it was faster a range of 40 miles
it takes three and a half hours to
charge and you can charge it via a
regular wall outlet although it is
compatible with the super high flux
capacitor charging that you use for your
Tesla and whatnot so up front and in the
rear
I've got coil over shocks can you
believe it and teeny tiny little control
arms it's the funniest thing I've ever
seen but what's great is that it parks
super easy and the turning radius is
amazing I've got 17 walking horsepower
and 42 amazing pound-feet of torque
that's right it's small but it seems
full the hills just fine
so why my speed is governed to 25 miles
an hour I'm on a road right now that
speed limit is 30 miles an hour
people are passing me left and right but
there's nothing really I can do about it
so you are limited to your speed and
that might make you feel like you're
going dangerously slow maybe it's just
that these people are going dangerously
fast now as you'll see here there is no
window so be sure to wear your jacket
but check it out go wing doors it's
Superman Eve ice this is a two-person
vehicle so let me so I guess I'm not
wearing a skirt in this cuz this is
right in my Flex super comfortable so
you will notice there is no key you turn
this guy on and off from the app alright
so the beeping says that it's all
connecting so I turn this little knob
here to the one position I wait for my
display to turn on I take off my
handbrake I go to the to put this baby
and drive and I'm good to go
of course you do have some safety
features here I've got an air bag in the
front I've got a four-point harness for
the front seat because it's a race car
right plus a three-point harness in the
back
I got disc brakes on all four wheels and
those 13 inch wheels are wrapped in
continental conte contact tires so if
you're coming to San Francisco you can
rent one of these babies 80 bucks for
the full day and 40 bucks for the night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
