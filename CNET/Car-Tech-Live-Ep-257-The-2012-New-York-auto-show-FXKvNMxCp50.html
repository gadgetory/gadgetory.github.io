goodwin at the 2012 new york
international auto show we got some
pretty nice cars behind us there's a
mclaren an aston martin and ugly aston
martin yeah no ugly mess today Aston
Martin's there's a Bugatti over there
pretty nice stuff but we're not going to
talk about those we're gonna talk about
some of the new cars they've actually
shown off here none of these are really
new yeah that's the same thing is this
show has been all about like regular
cars that regular people drive I mean
pretty much everything here is something
that you'd probably see on your commute
into work next year yeah except for well
maybe next year the RLX concept by Acura
right I just saw that that's actually
pretty close to production so you know I
expect to see a production version of
that at the LA auto show this is really
the replacement for the RL sedan and
that's a cure is big you know full-on
sedan who they're showing off here as a
concept and it's going to have that
super handling hybrid powertrain right
that they talked about last year and
released in the nsx too so gasoline
engine up front and then electric engine
spinning the back wheels when you need
it kind of like the the alexis RX yeah
yeah how they do it yeah kind of a
similar kind of thing to that so acura
is really kind of catching up with the
whole toyota lexus hybrid power system
this is especially pretty cool i mean
they're talking about Oh 370 horsepower
with this and 30 miles per gallon to
which is a nice combination you think
they're gonna keep the RLX name where
we'll just be the RL when it comes out
next year I think it's going to be the
RLX because I think they want to put
that whole RL thing behind them and also
X means all-wheel drive although the
little secret is that this car will also
come in a non hybrid variant with just
front-wheel drive yeah so maybe it will
be the RL in the RLX it'd be interesting
good be weird split that could be the RO
of the e sh-awd yeah whatever just like
they do with the T oh yeah the RL is
interesting but what really got me
interested was just debuted a couple
hours ago it's the infinity le concept
now essentially this is a small sedan a
little bit smaller than a g sedan in its
all electric powertrain so this is like
the infinity version of the leaf yeah
actually heard someone in the press room
say it's like they just left the AF off
of leaf
ndle but what's interesting is that it's
a concept so it looks very conceptual
but they say that it's about eighty-five
percent accurate to what we're actually
going to see on the roads and 24 months
and I'm thinking that puts this car a
luxury sedan that has a full electric
powertrain about 240 pound feet of
torque hit in the market within about a
year of the tesla model s so I'm
thinking it's going to get really
interested for people looking to spend
about fifty thousand dollars on an
electric car that could be yeah so they
are definitely to put this in a
production they're definitely going to
put it into production and it should
look pretty much like what we saw here
at the show yeah I walk by it and it's
definitely not a kind of car that
infinity currently has I mean it doesn't
really look like the g it doesn't seem
to keep that same kind of styling I
guess it looks a little bit like the
larger em in some ways looks a lot like
the JX the big SUV but they shrunk those
sort of bulbous proportions down to a
more of a sedan sighs and they did kind
of like want to emphasize and this is
like their company line it's like they
didn't make an EV into an infinity they
took the tailpipe off of infinity and
made it in EV so they want you to know
this is through and through if you're a
fan of the the G in the M or even the FX
SUVs you'll probably like what they're
going to have here so yeah I'm Pierre
electric drive they said anything about
the rain journey of those kind of specs
yet they haven't officially quoted it
but unofficially they're saying about
the same hundred miles of the leaf and
if it's exactly like that then we can
expect the EPA give leaf or like 73
miles range so oh yeah still a little
bit less than what Tesla's guessing with
160 miles range on their Model S but I
think when it comes out it'll probably
end up chalking up a little bit less
than now also yeah so no real
breakthroughs as far as powertrain
technology electric power clean
technology in that but now what about
the the cabin tekken that if they'd seen
anything new as far as infinity goes
well they've got like a very conceptual
cabin technology package in there right
now so i don't think that anything that
we're seeing in that car like on the
show floor is actually going to make it
into production that's the fifteen
percent that's not going to be in pretty
precisely but what is interesting is
that it has built-in wireless inductive
charging and what infinity has done that
amazing is that they've built that
system they've tied it into their
intelligent park assist
system in there around view camera the
idea being that you're not going to have
to spend 20 minutes back in your car up
and going forward trying to get the
inductive plate lined up with the
inductive charger on your car just pull
into your garage you hit park and it
lines itself up I'll be convened it's
actually very interesting and I saw that
the Nissan company which owns infinity
obviously also launched the ultimate
here right now that had pretty high
hopes about the ultimate have been on a
bit of a roller coaster as far as how i
feel about this vehicle because it
debuts and it kind of looks like they
just took the headlights off the maxima
and slap them on the ultimate called it
a date the powertrain is pretty much the
same 2.5 liter four-cylinder no direct
injection or anything like that they've
got six more horsepower so nothing new
really happening there so that's a
bread-and-butter card yeah and the 3.5
liter v6 also exactly the same no change
in power or fuel efficiency this year
still all cbt but when you get on the
inside of that car it looks like a
completely different vehicle we've got
really nice leather on the interiors
lots of different materials you know
metal like looks like a mental on the
dashboard nice wood finishes and what
they're calling the zero gravity seats
that have based on nasta technology I
guess that means they're really
comfortable okay and they've also got
their new infotainment system
nissanconnect which is actually rolling
in google maps pio I and Pandora
internet radio integration when you pair
it with a Bluetooth smart phone so we're
probably going to see like a connected
car connected cabin teksystems from
Nissan Infiniti right and we're very
interest to see what they're doing there
so it kind of seems like they took a if
it's not really broke don't fix it sort
of attitude with the Ultima for this
next generation it never really was a
bad-looking car and the CVT and the
basic powertrain is never it's not
really that bad i mean the 2.5 liter
they've got in there with a cbt will get
about 38 miles per gallon on the highway
in the Federation so that's pretty close
to 44 big sedan can't really complain
about that but when we left have the
also man we hated the cabin tent and
they fixed all of that good yeah that's
their midsize sedan I did see a new car
from Alexis this is there LS which is
kind of it was their entry levels today
I'm that's what they termed it your
front wheel drive and now Alexis is
saying oh this is actually more than
just an entry-level sedan for Lexus now
they're saying they're actually
comparing it to the mercedes-benz
e-class so this is the the ES 300h that
I saw spinning on the the platform in
their boots that everyone's walking
passing out looking at yeah well that's
that that's actually maybe the coolest
thing about it they're actually offering
a hybrid version of the es so they've
got the ES 350 like they had before the
same 3.5 liter v6 engine no changes
there that's a new capitec they've got
that new Lexus enform system which is
very much like Toyota Entune right so
I'll have that stuff in there and
they've got that little remote touch
controller oh my god that thing yeah I
kind of works like a mouse a little bit
so they've got that and you know you
kind of expect them to build those
things into the refresh of the es it's
about time but really it's the hybrid
version that I think is the most
interesting because that uses well
actually it's the same hybrid our train
is the camry hybrid right so a 2-liter
Atkins cycle a 2.5 liter acting psycho
100 horsepower combined yeah yeah so
basically if you like the Camry Hybrid
which I did we just reviewed it not too
long ago and I really like that car and
you want to spend five thousand dollars
to ten thousand dollars too much for it
that's my car yeah I mean supposedly
luxury you got that Lexus badge on there
yeah any better sound system you know
there's a few things you'll get with
that over the Toyota but I don't know I
mean I certainly you know the Toyota
that powertrain the Toyota is great and
they're talking about 40 miles per
gallon with the lexus ES right so that's
really good yeah I mean I couldn't
actually think of anything that I would
have changed about the camry hybrid
though it's a tough sell for me yeah of
course the es has always been a tough
sell for me what are the cars that I
probably responded to the best at the
show is the BMW x1 which is it's just a
compact SUV but it looks cool it's nice
and practical it seems like it's
actually one of the cheapest BMW you can
get it is very base it's gonna be about
31,000 I know as soon as you like add
and you know ipod integration it'll jump
up to 35,000 like 75 yeah that's what
navigation but you can get that car in
just rear-wheel drive or with all-wheel
drive
or and with a the four liter engine or
the six liter engine both turbocharged
right so you know I think there's some
really good powertrain combinations in
there and it also has BMWs latest head
unit technology which is really good
stop i think i've been given cars with
that editor choices every time I review
them lately so essentially this is a you
know for all of us who were basically
compact complaining that we didn't get
the hatchback version of the the BMW 1
Series this is BMW going like we had
someone just kind of like a hatchback if
you don't mind sitting up a little
higher and like a lot of people like
sitting up a little higher well there's
that and maybe if you got some lower
he's lowering springs or something and
be kind of like a BMW 1 series hatchback
I don't think about definitely never
quite Paul okay and it would at all what
else have you seen at the show that you
are um well I mean it was along the same
vein of the small you know crossover SUV
there's the hyundai santa fe they've got
two models of those a five-seater in a
seven seater one of the things that i
really am also kind of mixed on is the
new infiniti not infinity lincoln MKZ i
really like the fusion in the new 2013
fusion that debut last year earlier this
year actually right around the time we
were at CES and the MKZ is pretty much
that same car with a really nice
interior and what i would consider to be
a polarizing exterior I'm not a huge fan
of that mustache grill that Lincoln's
got going on right now the big wings
that go all the way across the front
yeah they say wings and I see mustache I
don't see how they're not seeing
mustache it reads a little bit big on
them k zi machine in on some of the
other cars i'm kind of like but I'm MKZ
it's like that's kind of a smaller car
and the wings go all the way around well
they integrate into the headlights so
it's like yeah they're going all the way
back darn near to the a-pillar but then
the interesting thing about that car is
that it's got this glass rough like for
maybe 14 and a half square feet of glass
on the on top of the vehicle and all of
that lifts up and slides back so you can
have an open top experience and kind of
like that it looks a little weird when
it's open but when it's closed you can
barely tell if they're and along the
lines of that hyundai santa fe s2 saw
the subaru outback whichever he loves it
out back and they've you know refreshed
it a little bit they haven't changed
much but one thing they did do is they
made the prop look Maura
it's and I'm not sure Subaru buyers will
like that because I kind of think the
reason why Subaru buyers like it is
because they're all progressives and
they like a car that doesn't look so
super macho I mean no cowboys by Subarus
well I think the reason Subaru buyers by
Subarus is because they're Subarus and
they're expected to buy them so I mean
you've got that sort of thing going on
there I think regardless of what you do
Subaru is the company that drastically
changes there like visual identity every
couple of years I mean you see that with
the Impreza we're at cars changing like
every five years like to a completely
different looking vehicle so I think
super buyers are going to pick it up as
long as it's a good car and it delivers
that all wheel drive performance that
they really kind of want yeah they I
mean they have the reputation for
dependability and in all-purpose pneus
to which that Phil you know people like
that okay now the worst thing at the
show in my opinion all right you know
where you're going back the flying car
which is not even a flying car
Terrafugia the transition right it's not
so much a flying car as it is a plane
that you could drive on the highway if
you want it to yeah and the company does
say they just call it a rootable
airplane they don't call it a flying car
everybody else seems to it's like come
on people get over this car it's not
that interesting you will never buy what
none of you will ever buy one of these
and drive it to the airport take off why
do another airport and drive somewhere
else I think somebody will someone with
like almost two hundred eighty thousand
dollars just to throw away on a toy add
a pilot's license and who absolutely
hate standing in line yeah so I guess if
you're like one of those people who may
be like takes a commuter flight maybe
from San Francisco to LA four times a
week and you just don't want to deal
with Airport lines maybe you could get a
pilot's license and drop almost three
hundred thousand dollars on this and fly
it yourself but I mean I feel like for
maybe ninety nine point nine five
percent of people this is a completely
useless endeavor and a very odd ball
sort of situation well actually there's
a key statistic here the cruising speed
of this terrafugia in flight the
transition in flight is hundred five
miles per hour given maybe 500 miles
from San Francisco to LA that's a good
five hour flight and I think most people
say like I'm going to get on a 737
757 and get there in an hour yeah I
think maybe you save like an hour over
driving at that point yeah there you go
and just you just ruined it for me and
is now is a one hundred percent useless
I think the people that you know the
same people who buy this flying car
thing at the same people it by
amphibious cars and that's like milk
people would just kind of want to be
able to say oh I've got it we'll see one
in Jay Leno's Garage that's that's it
memorized it'll never get a single mile
put on it alright well we've been
