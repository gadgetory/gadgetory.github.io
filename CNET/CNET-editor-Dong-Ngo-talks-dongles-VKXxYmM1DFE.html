also the brand new MacBook Pro right
here 13-inch now they both have at least
two thing in common first they are made
by Apple and second while they both come
with just us PC port and that mean if
you plug any non-us PC devices to this
laptop here
you can't this iPhone for example made
by Apple cannot plug in if you have an
SD card like this one
well you can't either and if you have
this purple drive well good luck why
sure it's not like that you need what do
you need is dongho's now there's a ton
of them here and of course eventually
they will make the e-waste ecosystem
very diverse but for now they're very
useful now this one for example it had
one SD card slot one mini SD card slot
and two USB 3.0 port to the computer oh
these two right here they allows you to
connect the clap top to a big-screen TV
to display even 4k video and also we
report now if you just want to turn an
USB C port into a regular USB port this
little guy wouldn't do and it worked
actually really well you need a gigabit
internet port or this guy will do now
with a new laptop here Apple decide to
go use pc hundred percent and that means
you can chart over use PC port that's
very convenient because you can pick any
of the port for charging but the problem
is if you step on the charging cable it
can send the left of flying and you know
what happened there
don't make me demonstrate this laptop is
too new for that now to avoid a kind of
mishap with this cable right here the
prick safe that's right now has two
parts this part goes the computer and
this part just snap it like that and
then they can break off very easily now
obviously there are many other dongles
and I will show you my favorite at
another time before now remember though
before I get your new MacBook Pro make
sure you get at least one or two of
these otherwise the fact that it cannot
plug something in the moment you want to
will drive you nuts and by the way in
case you're wondering why I have a two
laptop of the same time well I
to have through it this is the 15 inch
1/2 and I use them all the time every
day
simultaneously and that's because I'm
down low and only for today among other
things
I'm also the down in dongle so go ahead
enjoy this video tremendously</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
