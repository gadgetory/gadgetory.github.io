speakers but you know what they sound
like crap
that explains why separate bluetooth
stereo speakers are trending really
strong these days but man can they be
pricey I'm looking at you Bose I'm Bryan
Cooley with the top 5 Bluetooth stereo
speakers that cost under a hundred bucks
I've ranked them by a matrix of CNET
rating score against current street
price then weighted by user popularity
scores yeah
Cal Tech helped me let's go number 5 the
sound freak sound kick sfq Oh for one of
the newer ones we've reviewed it's got 7
hour playback time on a single charge oh
you can also charge your phone off its
USB port the sounds a little bit thin
and it won't function as a wireless
speaker phone but it's a good value with
an attractive design and good
performance for its size number 4
Logitech the z5 15 this one's
interesting and then it includes a
little USB bluetooth dongle so you can
use it to stream from a computer let's
say that doesn't have Bluetooth built in
as well as from your mobiles that do
it's very flexible 10 hour battery life
that's up there with the best and it
handles a wide range of music well
doesn't do speaker phone functionality
bear that in mind
78 bucks or so street number 3 is the
logitech mini boombox now I'm not sure
anything smaller than a toaster it can
be called a boombox especially when it's
such a cute little bean shaped thing but
it's got cool illuminated touch controls
on top 10 hour battery life again and
quite good sound except with really bass
heavy tracks which is ironic for
something called boombox but at a
current street price of around 78 bucks
we're good number two the iHome IDM
11-hour reviewer called it attractively
designed I called him high but if you
can keep from mistaking this for your
boxy box you'll find it puts out pretty
good sound from such a small lopsided
package it does Bluetooth speaker phone
as well personally though when you just
want to use an aux cable connection to
your portable you have to use this
speaker's proprietary cable we
you will lose before I take you to
number one here's the most compelling
reason of all not to spend more than a
hundred bucks on Bluetooth speakers
because bluetooth streaming inherently
doesn't deserve it it sounds good but
doesn't sound great because when you do
this the mp3 you're listening to has to
be reconverted and recompressed
as part of the bluetooth streaming
process that kind of makes a mess of it
so think convenience here not home
theater okay the number one affordable
bluetooth speaker we love this one is
the creative d100 it's got an impressive
vase which you almost never hear about a
speaker in this category and it uses
double-a batteries so you're never stuck
without a charge those things alone make
up for its lack of speakerphone ability
plus it comes in four cooky colors uses
a standard aux jack for when you want to
wire up your portable and unlike many on
our list doesn't look weird it also has
the best scene that score and the lowest
street price of any I'm showing you
about 60 bucks right now
by two okay folks that's it for this
week thanks for watching and for more
like this it's top 5 see Netcom
