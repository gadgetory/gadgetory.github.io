visuals at the company's developer
conference Google i/o they launched a
whole bunch of updates that got a
release date for smart displays that
have new integrations on the phone they
have Google Maps updates and they have
customized routines so I'm gonna start
with Google Maps because this update is
really pretty cool not only can you talk
to your phone when you're in navigation
now so while you're driving somewhere
you can say hey Google read me my text
messages you've got one new message
it's from nucleus tonne messages it says
hi when will you get here but then you
can respond with the simple command
share my ETA letting nucleus know you're
nine minutes away that was the last one
and Google will pull that info from your
navigation and send it to the person
you're having a conversation with now
when you talk to Google assistant on
your phone you can actually swipe up on
the interface and it'll show you a
proactive screen about your day it can
have your calendar info it can have your
route to work it can have the weather
things you need to know and things you
like will be pulled right into the
feature so you get a very customized
Google assistant screen the assistant
screen will also be a little bit richer
pictures will be bigger and take up more
of the phone screen and you get these
rich smart home controls that will pop
up and speaking of smart home stuff
Google is finally unlocking the
potential of its routines and now
they're going to be fully customizable
you can have a routine for dinnertime
you can have a routine for time for the
Red Wings game you can have a routine
for whatever you want so I'm excited to
play around with some of those custom
routines I'm also excited to play with
Google's updated smart displays with a
cool couple of extra features one you
can customize the ambient screen on your
display so it'll pull up a clock or a
map or the weather when you not you
it for a while to Google's opening up
the displays so third parties can create
more rich experiences like choose your
own adventure games and then three the
smart displays are getting YouTube TV so
Google assistants always been good at
interacting with your voice as of i/o
it's gonna get a lot better at
displaying information visually</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
