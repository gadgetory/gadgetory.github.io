cnet.com right now I'm taking a look at
the Nintendo 2ds so I'm sure you've
heard about this this is Nintendo's
brand-new 3ds
even though it's called the 2d s it can
still play any 3ds game any DS game but
it just can't play it in 3d so you got
that good so here's the deal
it feels pretty cheap because it is
cheap it's only $130 but it's not really
for the adult portable gamer so it's not
really for me and it's not really for
any older gamers it's for your kids
because they break stuff and this is
kind of unbreakable it doesn't have a
hinge like the 3ds so it makes it a
little less breakable the only real
moving parts on this thing are the
joystick and I can't really see a little
kid breaking this as easily as he or she
would with the 3ds so that's basically
the idea behind the design so it's got
this really interesting sort of
wedge-shaped design kind of looks like a
doorstop in many ways the back buttons
the LNR shoulder buttons are enormous
they're a lot bigger than what you're
used to on the 3ds or the 3ds XL that
said that's really the biggest sort of
changes you'll notice there's also a
different location for the headphone
port the home button feels a little
differently and to shut the screen off
you now have this sleep switch instead
of being able to close the screen like
you could on the 3ds around here on the
side is an SD card slot and Nintendo was
nice enough to include a four gigabyte
SD card what else is different well
they've changed the location of the
joystick and the buttons so if you
recall on the 3ds they flanked the lower
touch screen on the two DS they are
higher up so when you're holding it it
does feel a little awkward I'm not going
to lie it definitely feels a little
strange you're going to have to hold it
with one hand like you would the 3ds to
use the stylus which is included here on
the back other than that like I said not
a gigantic difference here
something that's a little weird why does
it have two lenses on the back it could
take 3d photos but you can't see
anything in 3d because it's for kids and
kids can't they're not supposed to look
at the 3d pictures because it like you
know messes up their eyes and whatnot
nevertheless you can still take 3d
photos on the 2d s which you can only
view on the 3ds so I hope you're taking
notes because this is really confusing
for me all right I can only imagine what
a mom or dad would be experiencing
trying to understand all this as well
okay so you this doesn't really have any
protection on it right the 3ds you can
close and not really worry about
scratching the screen what's going to
happen when you give this to a
five-year-old it's going to get really
gunky and messy and it's going to get
food and all the other things that these
kids find themselves playing around with
it's going to get on the sides here it's
going to be a disaster so Nintendo is
selling for $12.99 a little pouch here
that can fit the 2d s very easily and I
still sandwich pouch it's got here and
there you go you're all set and that's
the kind of protection it's really the
only protection you can do on the 2d s
so that will just about do it
interestingly enough the cartridge
little slot in the back here is just
moved off to the side no big deal it's
got that same power interface as the 3ds
and the 3ds XL and that is just going to
about do it for my first look at the
Nintendo 2ds for cnet.com I'm Jeff
