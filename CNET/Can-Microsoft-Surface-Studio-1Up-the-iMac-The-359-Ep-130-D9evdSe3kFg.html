right on the heels of the big microsoft
event it's time for episode 1 30 of the
359 podcast with Ben Fox Rubin and Roger
Cheng good afternoon guys hey welcome
back Roger thank you glad to be back
miss i missed the podcast rose yes yeah
often a sunny san diego although it was
actually raining so maybe not so sunny
that's too bad and now it's cold as hell
here yeah it's a lot colder out here
than it was back okay it's still sunny
I'll take sunny and cold too rainy in
the in San Diego yeah seems like kind of
a waste but yeah just off you know catch
its Ray's fishing and you back just in
time for all the sunny news from
Microsoft no yeah citing stuff we'll be
talking about some cool stuff there yeah
yeah I think what Microsoft yeah geez
yeah yes though trying to convince
myself wow wow no no there was some cool
stuff look William Todd we're going to
break down a big announcements from
Microsoft's event just ramped up here
New York we'll also talk a bit about
apples earnings give a little shout out
to a katie collins story on
accessibility tech which actually played
a role in microsoft's levin they
actually kicked off the event with a
video highlighting some of their work
with making their products are more
accessible to everyone e so without
further ado let's get started if you
have any questions I producer Brian will
will put them in the will pick them out
well we'll do our best to answer them
and yeah let's go let's get going let's
do it all right 32 welcome to the 339
when we talk about the tap top what go
gallon we go all right welcome to the
future 29 when we top talk about the top
tech news of the day over the crap we
want to throw in I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben
Fox Rubin so Microsoft just wrapped up
its big event in New York one really big
new product literally a big big new
product or for sudhir surface to do 28
inched all-in-one desktop that it looks
really nice that's the big thing there
were a lot of announcements about VR and
AR
3d everything like all the surges in 3d
with paint but the real highlight of the
show which is what they ended on yeah
well they knew it the surface to do this
this thing's of a he missed 28 inch
display eyes twenty-three thousand
dollars starting price and it goes to
forty two hundred dollars pay yeah
they're doing a really good job
presenting tech porn you know like it's
just like it's a very pretty looking
device it does a lot of cool stuff I
really don't think that it's for most
people no no it's for designers and
artists and definitely for professionals
or folks with way too much money right
it is I just want to draw stuff is I
anything I'd love to have this in my
home or the office but I know I would
never will because it is just a way too
expensive I would also like to give a
shout-out to Panos Panay yeah do I
pronounce it yeah right panos panay who
I would argue is probably one of the
greatest salesman of all time and he
does his presentation is a very
different way than the Apple folks to
he's like with a lot of energy and
passion provides a lot it it just
creates a very different color flavor to
the Microsoft events than the apple
event so you know did you a did you take
notice of the surface dial yeah it's one
of the more interesting peripherals to
come out in a long time even actually
tap on the screen it is like dalit
images it's like looks cool i think
three people are going to use it I don't
know yeah I want me I will be but again
I don't have two thousand dollars a
spare yeah so just a quick shout-out are
one of the reporters Katie Collins put
out a story on accessibility looking at
how Apple and Facebook have sort of
expanded their perspective instead of
creating features that help address
folks with disabilities features that
are found on your phone or Apple watch
or on Facebook but it also features that
while they start off is sort of a niche
thing end up being kind of mainstream
yeah it's just relevant because
Microsoft actually kicked off its event
today with the video talking about
accessibility in the work they've done
to make microsoft products and software
more accessible to people
yeah next up we also wanted to hit on
apples earnings which were last night
yeah and they weren't that great folks
we're expecting them to not be that
great and the good news I guess if you
want to look into the future which we
always like to with Ernest is that the
iphone 7 is expected to boost up their
revenue going into the holiday season so
they might actually do better they did
with the successes there was definitely
a lag and interpreter I talked to a
bunch of the carriers and they they
complained that I complained but they
noted that a lot of customers still
don't still haven't gotten their iphones
yet I mean I just got mine like a week
ago so I mean people that ordered them
and are still waiting on them yeah yeah
so today's that they repeatedly
mentioned that on the call that they've
they've had a back especially if you
have more demand order to plus that you
ordered like a 128 or 256 gaming phone
if it's a black or jet black phone
chances are you you might not have one
yet right they definitely mention that
they're selling out of everything that
they're making particularly with the
pluses and they're hoping to actually
end up catching up to the demand at some
point yeah you have to imagine the whole
Samsung thing is it's got to help them
in the long run it sort of it's shell
win right yeah yeah but they said that
it isn't quite yet because they're
selling out I also wanted to mention by
the way that Thursday they're going to
be having a hardware event yep and it's
mostly going to be focused on what we
expect max so we'll see what sort of
refreshes they're going to have with
that that played for more about these
stories check us out on CETA I'm Roger J
I'm Ben Fox Rubin thanks for listening
so what do we think Apple's going to
counter with to answer to this because
this was a pretty interesting a book
yeah more powerful more more about your
hardware hardware I mean that whatever
the long-rumored virtuals triple though
it's not really rumored right at the
cold yeah they're details it's it's like
a it's like a strip at the top yeah the
keyboard that's context-sensitive yeah
and then it changes yep yeah did I miss
anything i'm assuming a fingerprint ID
reader now is similar to touch ID to to
enable transactions because right now if
you want to use touch ID on your mac
like hair with your phone and then you
have to touch her phone to secure the
transaction which is cuz I didn't even
know that feature exist yeah yeah yeah
no I still type in my stuff like an
idiot I suppose that dial was
interesting I mean like you said this is
not the kind of thing to replace the
general home pc setup no very designer
this is a fascinating new like that's a
real innovation haven't seen anything
like that yet so it's absolutely i mean
peripheral we haven't seen any of the
innovations of peripherals for a long
long time so I mean they penned to the
Apple pencil so right that's true yeah
but that was cool I was really cool yeah
be interesting to see that really like
I'd love to see what the the tactile
yeah I'm imagine there's something
satisfying about no darlin yeah that it
makes really around oh yeah we're like
opening up a menu and turning it that
just that's intuitive yeah at least
something finally unique something
innovative to see how it actually
performs yeah I'd have to give it to
Microsoft right they've mean they've
really done a good job of the last few
years kind of reinventing there's a home
brand of surface devices they're all
they all look really attractive there
slick yeah they really are trying to
like set the tone for what all windows
devices should be yeah and the surface
book has it was also one of those things
that they presented last year and
apparently they're selling the surface
tablets especially like really well it's
just pros for sure a big business so
it's not it's not just a proof of
concept but this is something that's
actually making serious money for them
which means they're going to keep doing
it I don't think so much with this
all-in-one but yes definitely more
vanished thing and even they said for
the holiday season this is supposed to
be a limited product runs hmm we'll see
folks in the chat think the hinge is
ugly then oh the hinge of physical hinge
on the surface pro oh yeah I actually
kind of like it it's going on the
surface studio studio sorry I misspoke
Emma's hug it's okay it's like a double
hand thing it's it's not as a I guess
ideas like you can sort of see through
it as opposed to that I'm a crisis or a
large and Sloan the function right yeah
and it you know it helps because because
you just have to be able to pull it down
but you've got a touch screen or a panel
you constantly rayon
the pressure there is going to need to
stay there that there needs to be like
my counter sprinter to keep it steady
steve says it's all about the new zune
you know why you guys job but I love my
zune like I hope soon and it was great
seriously it was like a thinner model it
was basically it used the the same kind
interface that what in terms of what
Windows Phone can I ended up being
mm-hmm I kind of liked it is thin it was
it played movies you knows I had lower
expectations back then we found the one
zune customer out there we should
interview I think I got them afraid so
okay I could actually I could actually
buy it I think though they made it till
I agree whatever kid in school had the
zune we mocked mercilessly so this
wasn't like a thick zoo like yeah at one
point they like buckle down and start
and I think this is sort of like the
start of that trend of like slick
hardware because it was like nice it was
like metal aluminum it was super thin
and it was just it was nice actually
really sexy looking yeah what I'm what
I'm always wondering whenever Microsoft
comes out with new hardware is how long
are they going to be allowed to get away
with this before their partners start
getting really tight all done yeah yeah
and say like we've been using your
Windows operating system forever I mean
you're stealing you're taking food out
of our mouths yes but I think they've
gotten away with it for so long now like
it's become part of the status quo I
think we seen our companies either
making higher-end versions like a better
or more expensive version surface or
lower end versions right like taking
they basically they followed what
microsoft said they would do it
basically use the surface pearl as a
template for what their tablets should
look like when they're they're all well
what's category two in one's two and one
that is that right who is that is that
like the laptop that's also a town yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah sorry i'm using the
term terrible technical term my two
cents to take away from today's i
actually thought that the 3d stuff was
kind of cool yeah yeah i mean it's your
novelty but yeah i loved the idea of the
scanners like wow we're actually you
know again we could easily be fooled by
this and maybe it doesn't function as
well as they represent
on the but it was neat to see because
like that's something straight Jetsons
right there yeah yeah I had his virtual
office I really don't think people are
going to be using it that much like
maybe there's going to be this very
small niche group that's going to get
really excited about putting on a hollow
lens and actually yeah I don't know
visiting what is it Paris or Rome or
something that wasn't a whole lot right
wasn't that the VR headset oh okay yeah
because they had a separate head so it's
a little bit of they didn't really talk
about hololens that much I mean a little
doze a little bit of it but it was
interesting that they they kind of
stress that they're actually work with
partners to build VR headset to me yeah
about 300 bucks starting at two hundred
dollars I don't know that that's good or
bad so here's my plan i'm gonna take the
the three scanner i'm gonna scan a big
stack of money and then 3d print it do
you think yeah that'd work in my favor
it could work I think you may have
committed a federal crime just now um
one last thing how do we think that
their presentation went how did we feel
about Moke tool a little long it was a
little bit launched a little window or a
lot of charisma yeah and they did a good
job of making it very consumer-focused i
think i've seen some of the other
microsoft this is definitely a point
where they had a comic book artist onda
like literally sketchy-ass trip our
friend like what is going on here we
don't need the entire damn comic book
that's true a little when they throw in
like 11 sizzle reels yeah sizzle been a
lot of sizzle reels for that okay these
are good points however I remember like
one of them from last year or something
they really focused on what was it
called the surface that giant screen
hottest thing service hub yeah yeah
there were a couple of things that were
more like business focused or be to be
so I did like that this one was very
consumer mostly consumers that's hard
for you Schumer to an extent are for me
to call a to our then focus though
that's just a little meandering yeah
okay yeah a little redundant but I love
the presentation was sharp and yeah I'm
sorry what was his name again and I know
Alice pinay hi gnosis is a pretty
caricatures yeah he's an interesting
character for sure he will stay employed
for quite some time yeah oh yeah certain
all right so uh oh the are you guys
excited about the new paint what do you
want to do with the new paint uh-huh
fearful being like it when was the last
time I use a windows to vote well no I
was last time i use painting me I used
1997 yeah I used to love you see pain
yes awesome oh yeah totally I mean they
really brought that back from the grave
apparently people use it a ton yeah they
were Sega under additional use it a
month I really know just kind of a
novelty out for people whose like it's
like a subreddit of its own subreddit oh
yeah you know modern paint yeah yeah I
think with some of the things that
they've added to it I think people would
definitely want to use it more with the
3d stuff they made it look super easy I
don't actually think that it's going to
be that yeah 3d paint equals 3d memes
you are very right yeah yeah I can't
wait here comes that boy viewing or
creating memes with VR headset so that's
the best future right there it's a brave
new world we're looking forward to I
think I'm greatly terrified that sounds
horrible no I did like idea
realistically of like sketching out this
like you know fancy island or whatever
3d and like putting on a headset
actually like getting into that world
that's very minecraft e it is yeah
there's definitely people out there that
would love that there are a lot of
people right there I mean most of the
kids what that's like the most popular
game for kids right is like a game that
allows you to create a new world yes and
this is this allows you to not just like
code or you know like actually like
physically build pieces but like sketch
your world as opposed to what minecraft
allows as one useful anecdote I remember
a time when like we were all playing
like double oh seven you know focus and
shoot her yay oh yeah with with like
four people so he's like yeah the split
screen and everything I was at my
nephew's birthday party and they had
this truck with all these different it
was like a video game truck they were
all time yeah you're playing Minecraft
and super smash brothers but a huge like
more than half
we're playing minecraft together like
yeah like the same world yeah yeah yeahs
made very little sense to me but because
you're old it i am i'm old i don't
understand snapchat here told you got
hit like me manifest that but all the
time oh never go down that road so
cheers and microsoft we back tomorrow
for apple yeah right busy busy busy we
misery doing the friend should we tape
the late tape yeah you should tape late

as today we'll take a little late so we

jumping in and talking about like
shopping lists are you excited about Max
be more excited about the the surface to

tough one to live up to that was a good
that was a short presentation today yeah
