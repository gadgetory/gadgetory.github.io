it's the least expensive OLED or LED TV
you can buy and it's around $2,000 in
the US right now it only comes in one
size 55 inches and it's curved not flat
yes
2,000 bucks is expensive for a 55 inch
TV but for this level of picture quality
that price is kind of a bargain OLED
display technology outperforms any LED
LCD TV in our tests with pitch-black
dark scenes and perfect fidelity when
seen from seats other than the sweet
spot if you just want the best picture
you can get the 55 eg 90 100 is the
cheapest option not that it looks cheap
by any means
OLED allows the top portion this TV to
be remarkably thin at just a
quarter-inch deep
that's thinner than a pencil although
the body does widen quite a bit along
the bottom to allow for inputs and other
necessaries design cues are minimalist
with chrome highlights and a somewhat
chunky stand and of course the set is
curved you'll have to pay a lot more for
the privilege of a flat OLED TV as LG's
cheapest OLED TV the 55 eg 90 100 also
skips the 4k resolution and HDR
compatibility found on higher-end models
that's not a big deal today since TV
shows and movies in 4k and HD are rare
but may be a sticking point for high-end
buyers who want the very latest
technology otherwise it has plenty of
features including a slick motion remote
LG's webOS Smart TV system and even 3d
capability of course what you're really
paying for here is old ads world-beating
image quality and with the 55 eg 90 100
you'll pay less than ever before I'm
