Apple has taken them off shelves to
bring more focus to the watch arriving
next month and even though the Apple
watch won't be available for pre-order
until April 10th there are already some
accessories you can buy for it like the

laptop industry with its new MacBook it
encourages you to transfer data

ports there's only one main port for
charging and if you want to connect
anything else you need an adapter the
internet is having a bit of fun with a
new video going around taken from a
spanish-language TV show subtitled in
English to make it appear he was an
engineer on the macbook design team and
this guy is just cracking up over how he
can't believe the MacBook came in too
