personally can't think of a better
reason to invest at home theater tech
than to watch a bond movie so it's kind
of fitting than here at CES 2012 MGM in
conjunction with Panasonic is announcing
that all 22 bonds are now available on
blu-ray it's also gave me the chance to
catch up with three bond directors John
Glenn Michael Apted and martin campbell
to talk about the role of technology
behind the camera and on the screen in
the bond series
message received we are waiting over and
out working with a fifty-year 22 film
franchise like double-oh-seven has
availed these directors of the latest
and the best technology some of their
thoughts on where that's worked and
hasn't been and now Michael Apted was
director of the world is not enough in
some ways I was always of the opinion
still of the opinion that doing a bond
you have to be very careful how you use
technology we were still very much in
the realm of you know creating real
things and real special effects you know
if you let the CGI get out of control as
it has in there are other franchises
probably for very good reasons I think
bond is in a danger of losing that kind
of poor reality
martin campbell directed in to bond eras
goldeneye with Pierce Brosnan and the
most recent version of casino royale
with daniel craig i never really cringe
at anything when i look at blu ray
because it's so fantastic when you see
him come up you sort of there's always
just a slight kind of gas or reaction of
just how good how good it looks if you
look at some of the old movies for
example that was gone on blu-ray and
stuff you'll see all sorts of like
makeup limes you'll see you'll see map
lines of the old sorts of things so just
a little bit careful about that John
Glenn directed five Bond films from for
your eyes only two license to kill we're
always trying to improve the quality of
the image and with exactly our theory
was that you know if it's if it's poorly
photographed then when you when you to
reproduce it if you make a dupe negative
which you have to feel release prints
then the quality goes down in ever
decreasing curve whereas if the quality
is great then it reproduces very well I
think the blue rails obviously the thing
the medium that's going to take over and
you know good luck to it I think it
reproduces our films very well and it
shows the whole the whole picture that
we photograph and it does justice to
what we did or all the skills that went
into it
