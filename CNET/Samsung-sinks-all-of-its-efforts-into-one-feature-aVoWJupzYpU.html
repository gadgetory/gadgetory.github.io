pretty standard but this model by
samsung the active wash model for 1199
bucks is actually kind of cool for
starters it has a built-in sink that you
can see under this transparent lid it's
basically four pre-soaking pre-washing
hand washing it handles all of your
delicates
then when you're done you lift up the
sink water pours into the main basin and
then drains out of your regular drain
it's kind of neat if you actually are
the kind of person that uses a sink for
hand washing me myself I tend to skip
that and just use the hand wash setting
that's already built into the machine
but it is a neat feature that you really
don't see anywhere else also in terms of
performance it did good but not great so
if you're looking for a top performer I
would keep looking the other thing that
kind of bugged me was the location of
the soap dispenser down here it actually
runs like flush with the sink so when
you try to open it it jams you actually
have to lift up the lid and the sink and
then you can access the dispenser but
it's still kind of weird and cumbersome
to get to I do like the overall design
and if you like the sink but don't
already have one in your laundry room
this is a model I would definitely
recommend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
