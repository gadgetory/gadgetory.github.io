this I understand we all want to make it
long and most importantly keep it
consistent long for as long as we want
and of course I'm talking about the
Wi-Fi range here what else and for that
we have the company con em wireless that
focuses on making very powerful routers
like this brand-new RTA 15 right here
now this is a true dual band router
meaning is support all existing Wi-Fi
devices on the market right now but it's
also the first film my list that support
the new 802 point 11 AC or AC for short
Wi-Fi standard is a dual stream router
though meaning that when you squid AC
client it offer up to 867 megabit per
second and not the top speed of 1.3
gigabit per second and when used with
regular and clients it support up to 300
megabits per second and not the top not
415 megabit per second speed but this is
a special router however because comes
with a lot of amplifiers up to 700 mini
watt of power nap adapt of any regular
router so in a way is a router on
steroids now on the back here at the
railroad comes with three detachable
antennas these are high gain antenna and
when they are detached you have to be
attached biking in the right spot not
the number one two three right here now
these antennas podcast the Wi-Fi signal
so your clients such as smartphones
tablets and laptop can receive and hands
connect to the internet and other things
in your network now the more powerful
the router is the longer the range and
that means the longer you can walk
further away from the router without
getting disconnected that's the idea at
least in my testing the RTA 15 did offer
very long range longer than most router
I were tested though not by much but
unfortunately is Wi-Fi signal wasn't
really stable meaning that you can
actually get disconnected anyway so just
like steroid this router here could use
some better quality don't get me wrong
this is not a bad router at
well range it offer very decent
performance and it also comes with a
very robust web interface you can use
this interface to change its many
feature including the option to this
creative power which make the rain
shorter but the signal more stable and
the railroad is also very easy to use of
the box it come with two network cables
already plug into is one port and one of
its lamppost all you have to do is plug
the one put into an idiot source such as
the cable modem and you are done you can
use the railroad right then with D for
Wi-Fi networks printed on its bottom now
on the bottom here as you can see the
router can also be mounted on the wall
and it also comes with a base right here
for it to stay quantify degrees from the
surface pretty cool you know the RTI 15
is a decent and interesting router to
say the least but inexpensive though
costing some hundred and ninety dollars
and from that amount I'd like to see it
off for better Wi-Fi signal quality and
for more on this device check out my
full review SL calm in the meantime
remember sign doesn't really matter long
or short is the quality that counts and
speaking quality this short short video
just made your day that's only because
I'm don't go and this has been the first
look at the RTI 15 high power router
from my list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
