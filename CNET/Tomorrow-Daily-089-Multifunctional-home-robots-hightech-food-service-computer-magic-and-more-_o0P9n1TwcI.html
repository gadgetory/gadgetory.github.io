robot with multifunctional capability a
restaurant in Paris is getting a tech
upgrade to help service and a London
University teaches a computer how to do
magic tricks are you done and a smoke
bomb well I didn't post no we won't
it's tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best feet
talk show in the known universe I'm your
host Ashley Scott that join me as always
professional sky puncher once again
Kalyan Thomas
it's an illusion Michael it's not a
magic trick it's an illusion
I love job as a magician it's my
favorite thing ever or as an illusionist
I should like we're some really cool
stuff today so let's not waste any time
it's time for the headlines okay so I
saw this robot I got very excited
because you know usually you see a robot
and you're like this robot maybe only
does one thing and how often would I
need it to this one thing well this
robot is a multifunctional robot
designed by flower robotics in Tokyo and
what it does is they want to make here
it is you can see it on the screen here
it's a little robot it's about the size
of its kind of the side of the Roomba or
Roomba esque size they want to make a
robot that can do a bunch of different
stuff in your house way to go depending
on what's attached to the top and this
is what's so cool and you can like
choose different types of lot sizes like
fuzzy logic yeah you're still learning
stuff like that yeah I'm so like jacked
up on robots right now this is like this
is Rosie the robot that you can have
this is called the patent concept if
this is an actual prototype device this
is not just an idea that somebody has
they actually have a working prototype
of this which is really cool so the
video you're gonna see shows this little
robot and they just added a lamp
attachment so here comes the robot with
a light on it and it can turn on the
light for you it can look for you it can
find where you are can get closer or
farther away depending on how much light
it decides that you need and it will you
know come over and real just turn on the
light Thank You robot yeah you're like
thanks robot okay so a light that's one
thing which is pretty awesome but there
are other peripherals that it mentioned
so they have things like a little tiny
garden that they show a little pretty a
little tiny garden like maybe an herb
garden so you could grow like oregano in
there or whatever
it's totally cloud connected so not only
can it stream things download wise but
it can also do
its own updates so no that's terrifying
but what other stuff can you put on it
okay so the some of the things that they
talked about were so here's the one with
the garden there's a play a little plant
in there okay but they also showed a
robotic arm to help you like you know
great hold stuff carry stuff around your
house maybe you only can't carry
everything all once you give it give a
robot arm speakers so can follow you
around play some music for you your own
personal soundtrack
oh yeah DJ Roomba yeah and then a
projector even so it could come over to
the wall project something up on the
wall oh cool um but the neat thing about
this is is that even if flower robotics
doesn't create a bunch of different
peripherals and attachments for this
thing they are going to provide an SDK
for developers so so here's all the
different arms and stuff that they ever
said so you can pick all the different
types of AI probability fuzzy deep
learning like all this stuff and then
it'll learn based on like what you
peripheral you put in there whatever but
they're gonna provide an SDK for
developers to make peripherals for it as
well that's the way to do it so
different companies it's gonna be an
Android based SDK that you're gonna be
able to like program different parts
that you can add to this prototype this
is so so cool and the neat thing is is
it's the working prototype is already
produced it's run on Linux it's Arduino
powered it is and it has a lithium ion
battery and they're saying that they
want to bring this to market in 2016 so
it's only a couple years oh yeah there's
gonna be a lot of robotics coming real
real real soon yeah Kayla and I are
talking about this we think like next
year's like next year and 2016 is gonna
be virtual reality and robots like these
are gonna be the two big things yeah
there's big leaps in technology virtual
actual physical virtual assistants not
just Siri in your phone let's just
watches that's gonna be like robots yeah
it's gonna be awesome
yeah so yeah I saw that and I just
thought it was so cool it's a patent or
Pettine @p atin and you can check it out
you can find it online it's so amazing I
just like really excited about it just
looks awesome I want to know I still I'm
not fully grasping the the plant on the
robot well I mean it would it would
measure water so I would say when the
plant needs water and it would come over
to you'd be like water hey listen this
thing needs water help it out it could
also say this plants dying its drying
out or it could say it's sick maybe it
could detect it is
it depends on what kind of sensors they
have in there but I could I would
imagine that if you had a third party
create something specifically for
growing plants there might be sensors
inside that peripheral that would then
be able to talk to you the main unit all
right all right yeah see the plants all
right good all right tell me about
something that's happening right now
okay so right now if you're in Paris or
plan on going to Paris soon there is a
restaurant called whoo that has upgraded
their servers their waiters it's called
who it's called who play that okay we're
not gonna play they upgraded their
servers with electronics including
taking your order which they they will
use a samsung galaxy s5 okay and then on
there so they'll take your order here
they go yeah I've seen this before but
they also have a galaxy gear on their
wrist so they have the watch I'm also in
the kitchen they have they have tablets
there too and then on the the waiters
wrists they have this the gear so when
your foot when the food is ready the
waiter will know or if like hey this is
ready who's ready your french fries are
ready let's do this yeah so it's just
it's fully yeah yeah it's fully
automated your foods not gonna be
sitting under a heat lamp that's nice oh
wait he's like oh the escargot are you
ready yep two plats two plots so that
yeah so all the devices sync together
using a P Box server which is supplied
by a peak at oh nice that's pretty cool
I like I really like that this there's
that's always a complaint about people
like they get their food it's cold and
like wieners don't really know sometimes
when food is up so um you know having a
waiter be able to say like oh okay this
tables food is ready right now
like I can go get that or even at the
bar like oh this person's drink is ready
it's not gonna be watered down it comes
your table or otherwise cold I think
there's less chance for mistakes
honestly I'm like I go to a ramen joint
that happened they use foam tattoos oh I
was gonna say I go to Tatsu and they
have the iPad ordering room oh that
sounds amazing yeah this is I I look
forward to seeing more stuff like this
yeah it sounds pricey but this is all
Samsung stuff this is like better so
you're getting better so
it's out of this I would imagine yeah
that's kind of me wonder how all these
devices work with when they get food on
them oh I hope well I would imagine I
mean you there a little look the galaxy
s5 is waterproof yeah so I mean I I'm
sure durability there I'm sure this a
job okay wash them alright you want to
talk about a magic computer yes it's it
well technically it's a minute it's an
illusionist illusion Michael so this is
an experiment from Queen Mary University
in London and this is kind of neat so
they taught a computer a combinatorial
card trick which are the card tricks
that maybe you've seen online or around
that use math to devise which card the
the person has chosen so you use like
math and then you also have to memorize
the order of the deck to decide like
exactly which card the person has picked
so here's the cool thing so they they
have this app called phony and it's kind
of cool and it does the counting for you
so it keeps tabs up for the magician it
keeps tabs on the order of the deck so
it would reveal the spectators card
right there you flip it and then there
it is right there really really neat so
this is the the point of this is that it
takes sort of the memorizing the deck
portion of the trick out of the
magician's hands but the nice thing
about that is is that after it learns
that skill after the computer learns
that skill it can design a card deck
setup that is well beyond like superior
versions of tricks like so this computer
can help a magician create superior
tricks to the ones they've been doing
Wow just kind of neat and then it also
did this thing which so you'll see
they're counting these elements on a
board so there's twelve and then this is
a magic jigsaw puzzle and the computer
created this puzzle and now like when
they do the recount there's only ten so
where did the other two go and it's a
it's a geometry it's like a clever
geometry trick that is very cool it's a
geometric principle that it uses to like
make this thing so really cool like a
kind of an interesting thing like not
necessarily again like not necessarily
something that's going to be
life-altering for all of us but really
neat that you
technology's kind of be used to
integrate into things that we really
maybe never even thought of like magic
and I think this is really cool because
a lot of times um you know people you
would expect people to be very skeptical
about like oh it's well there's self
owner this trick look obviously it's
like rigged or whatever but the neat
thing is is when they did these studies
people were totally bought it they
bought that the phone guests like
straight up just guess the card we're
just kinda neat yeah that's pretty cool
like they were very good at that on my
phone or what I don't know I don't know
if it's in the App Store it's called
phony pho an ey okay I'll check later
but I thought it was really cool and I
just I liked the idea of like teaching a
computer and then having it like make
better magic tricks because that better
card tricks these combinatorial card
tricks for magician super cool all right
we're gonna take a quick 30 second break
we'll be right back with a very cool
Bachelor Hackett very interesting kale
hasn't heard of it yet no I wanted to
surprise him and it's very very awesome
and then we will also have a kind of
your user feedback will explain and of
course our photogra for the day so don't
click away tomorrow daily
all right we are back welcome back
everybody we have a very interesting
back at her Hackett I'm not gonna waste
any time just like the headline so let's
get into back at her hackett okay
kale you haven't seen this yet this is
called seeing-eye gay guy seeing - and
then the letter I it's very interesting
this is an experiment it's kind of a
social psychological experiment there's
an artist named mark farad and the
experiment is that he will wear a VR
headset for 28 days it looks I believe
it's an oculus uh and he will live the
life of a completely different person
who will be out and about in the meat
space as I like to call it so he will be
this other person who is actually called
the other will be out and about and this
guy mark will be in a little tiny room
for 28 days living this person's life oh
cool
via VR there's gonna be sitting at his
house alright he'll be in him oh no he's
in like a room okay like they are
literally like secluding him from
everything that he it's like a simple
bed a bathroom like that very simple
very very so Kay alright so the other
who is that's what they're calling the
person the other is gonna wear glasses
that have a camera in them that will
record their entire day and Mark will be
watching that experience from his room
he can only go to the bathroom and
shower when the other does so he can't
just go whenever he has to go when the
other goes what about eating too I'm
sure he has to eat what the other eats
and drink what the other drinks okay
exact same food
nobody will interact with him at all for
28 days with the exception of a
psychologist with he's got some
neuroscience training as well so he
actually won't be in the room he'll be
available via headset for one hour out
of 24 a day
I believe the way that it was made to
sound on the Kickstarter people will be
able to spectate the him like what
viewing this so people will be able to
watch him at any given time like maybe
I'm like a live webcam stream or
something like that in the room but I'm
not sure the question is that the thing
that they're trying to figure out here
is the sort of the experiment is that
will mark lose his sense of self if he
is living the life of someone else even
if it's virtually cool it's really weird
Wow here's the even cooler thing they're
actually taking applications for the
other right now so if you want to be the
other you can apply to be the other
which is the person that Mark is going
to experience his life through all agree
the other so here's your criteria you
have to be it's very simple heterosexual
male in a relationship that's it those
are the only two things boom
kale you're in a min it's so great yeah
that's it like you don't even have to
have like an interesting life cuz I
don't think so they're taking
applications right now on their site
which is seeing - i co dot uk' so if you
want to go check that i if it might be
that you have to be based in London but
then again I'm not sure because if
you're just recording them it'll be a
delay it could be anyone I'll be up at a
different time than he will be here's
the thing though he's gonna have to
watch it regardless because they're
gonna have to bring him the food that
you were eating yeah so maybe it's that
you have to be london-based or it's eat
probably easier for the for the team if
you're london-based but they're gonna
need a lot of pizza yeah yeah they're
gonna make this a they're gonna make
this a documentary and they're gonna
they're so they're gonna do this
experiment and then they're gonna
compile everything together and do a
documentary do this so it's only they're
only doing it once though I mean like
yeah so one experiment he's doing mobile
yes and no so they're gonna do this
experiment and then if you back out like
the five its pounds it's um pound
sterling so if you want a back it's in
UK it's in UK money not US dollars um so
if you want to back it it starts at like
two pound like it's two quid for to get
like a thank you or whatever or just all
our gratitude or whatever and then it
goes all the way up to five thousand
pound which is that they will do this
experiment with you so it's like if you
want to be the mark guy then built it
like day
like really height if you have 28 days
to waste yeah I mean it's like if you're
aware if you're an artist who has 28
days of time but but it's really cool
they actually want that so all the way
through there's all kinds of different
like tier rewards or Devers except
visits and there are things like first
watch privileges credit in the
documentary like all this stuff but they
want 150,000 pounds for this so it's
it's quite a bit of money but they have
a month left to go they still haven't
started
they just started their Kickstarter it's
got like 30 days left so it's but really
interesting like I I would have never
thought about this as an experiment but
I'm sure a lot of psychologists and
people who are interested in sort of the
the science of virtual reality and what
it does to the human brain like I'm sure
this is a very interesting thing there's
a long time if with no human contact
he'll I think he will not be touched he
will not be spoken to and lit unless
it's through that headset with his
psychologist he will not he will just
nothing like nothing I got things to do
but I got a lot of thinking to do about
this but I think I mean you if you do
things like play video games like you
get something out of that but if you're
yes it's your freewill you're choosing
to like veg out for 28 days and play
right and you're getting like some sort
of like high off of actually playing it
and you know doing doing all the actions
but you're just watching it and then
also what if I go see like a ton of
movies yeah like those guys gonna get to
see interstellar for free daddy's gonna
be let into a movie theater with glasses
well that was the other thing it was
like the other has to be be okay with
this guy knowing all your internet
passwords yeah cuz you're me typing on
our stuff and then also I don't look at
the keyboard and then also the other has
to be okay with if he has relations with
his girlfriend or his wife or whoever
you know he's seeing what whoever he's
in a relationship with he has to be okay
with mark watching that like it because
all about you have to have these glasses
on all the time until you go to sleep
like that's it so it's very fancy
yeah I'm like there was a thing where I
think they were saying if he's like
running then mark has to house run like
he's got a job like he is to keep his
pace up and get mark to lose weight
maybe I don't know but this is really
cool yeah I'd like to know all of the
details fascinating yeah
well they have like Kickstarter video
and then if you go to their site they
have like a behind-the-scenes video and
they've got some information there and
then there's like a couple different
places you can get info but seeing - I
is like if you google that you should be
able to find clues again who's playing
on it's like it's like an art a group of
artists and like people who are
interested in this sort of like science
sort of social science psychology
experiment I want to see it a very fast
baguette yeah I mean I and I'm in for
two bucks I give him like two pounds but
yeah I mean it just seems really
interesting and weird okay so this is
the point in the show where we would
normally hit user feedback unfortunately
I am actually hosting the mevy Awards
this evening so yeah so we recorded this
episode really really early and when we
recorded it we actually didn't have any
responses just quite yet so we're gonna
bring your TD movie live tweet so we're
giving you an extra day basically we're
giving you an extra day to send us your
TV movie life tweets as hash tag of the
day where you're gonna tell us what
movie or movies you said you give them -
yeah theme - what movies you would want
to want what movies you watch unlimited
unlimited lifetime pass to watch these
two movies you can do a theater anytime
you want and say hey load them up and I
said you're a sick part and the room and
you said I said die hard and memento oh
yeah good choices
it's weird choices but good good weird
but go I think it's like literally my
life Creed is weird so weird but good
weird okay so yeah yes more time but we
do have of course our phone tog referred
the day
so rich er is our phone hire for the
day-to-day and Richie our rights to us
and he says photo taken with the iPhone
5s Jupiter Florida on the Loxahatchee
River and I there's a story to this
which is kind of cool oh good I like
that
this is a photo from the best first date
I've ever had Oh first date six hour
kayaking trip from Riverbend park to
jonathan dickinson park with a picnic
break at trapper Nelson's old camp it
was during our first cold front here in
Florida not a single cloud in the sky we
both loved the outdoors and I knew this
would be perfect for us to do together
lots of wildlife to be seen from Gators
to manatees kale great to see you found
a new niche on YouTube keep up the great
work you too watching your show
everything I want to know if he's still
with this first I know I see okay that
was me thank you that was the first
question I had when I read this email
Mike are they still together yes or no
yes or no like which what do you think I
say yes
says he was Richie Rich er maybe he's
Richie Rich Richie
oh my god boys Richie Rich rich isn't my
new favorite viewer of the show so new
favorite photographer new favorite
viewer favorite of all time I love it
if you guys want to submit your phone
tog Rafi if you want to submit a hashtag
of the day suggestion or if you have a
story idea you can email us tomorrow at
cnet.com if you hate email that's cool
we're on social media or tomorrow daily
on Twitter Instagram Facebook all the
all usual suspects and of course we are
over on Google Plus at tomorrow daily TV
and if you're rich er or someone like
him that uses YouTube Richie yeah I
don't forget to subscribe on YouTube and
if you're a listener on iTunes don't
forget to you know give us a good rating
there and follow us there every review
is so nice rate and review and it would
love that and if you're not Richie
Richie are make sure to take someone on
a kayak that's a really good idea yeah
it's really sweet Richie are a lot about
the person if you thought of that idea I
mean it's a really good idea yeah you
should never get in a relationship you
should continually date people yes
that's you're full of good ideas
yeah date everyone Richie Rich is a real
catch that's all I'm saying I'm assuming
your name's Richie Rich it's Richie are
I mean it's really close yeah um ya know
he's a real catch all right well uh
we'll be back tomorrow we'll be back
with a whole new slate of awesome weird
technology and geek pop culture stories
but until then be good humans guys and
we'll see in a sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
