very tough about half the times someone
wants to show me something on their
phone there's a crack running down the
middle of the screen but it's not their
fault most phones are designed to be
thin and fast not durable but there are
a few great phones that are built to
last
I'm Donnell Bell and in this top 5 I'm
counting down the five toughest
smartphones you can buy right now
selected by CNET associate editor Lynn
Locke
starting off at number 5 the Kyocera
hydro elite on Verizon it's an
affordable Android phone with 4.3 inch
screen expandable storage and its 4G LTE
compatible it's superpower is that it
can be submerged in water for up to 30
minutes without dying so if you're a
dolphin trainer or a careless toilet
texter this could be the phone for you
at number 4 the very cool rs90 vortex
it's not the prettiest phone and the
specs are a bit dated but you can pick
this thing up for $280 unlocked and off
contract it's a great deal if you burn
through phones quickly polycarbonate
construction protects it against drops
it can take the same 30 minute plunge as
the Kyocera
and its dust proof it's basically the
burningman phone coming in at number
three the Sony Xperia z2 if you aren't
willing to compromise on specs and
design to get a durable phone the z2 has
it all but it comes at a hefty price
around $550 unlocked it's not quite as
rugged as the vortex but it can survive
the same 30 minute dunk this phone
itself is stunning with a 5.2 inch
screen a 20 megapixel camera and a 2.3
gigahertz Qualcomm processor it's a
great phone but still a little too
fragile to make it to the top so let's
try number 2 the Kyocera brigadiere
around $50 on contract with Verizon the
Brigadier is the first widely available
smartphone to offer a sapphire crystal
screen just try cracking that thing it's
also waterproof and dustproof the casing
is all bulked up to help absorb shocks
and one of my favorite features is the
big red button on the side that you can
program to launch your favorite app it's
a super tough phone at a great price but
our number one phone that can take a
beating but also is just a great phone
the Samsung Galaxy s5 active you got all
the specs and features of scene s number
one rated smartphone but housed in a
sturdier casing that's reinforced around
the edges for drop protection I also get
physical buttons from navigation
including a special button on the side
that pulls up a dashboard of handy
outdoorsy features such as a compass and
a barometer made more for the
outdoorsman than the chronic klutz but
it's a great all-around bump so there
you go five phones that are so tough
that could give the iPhone a wedgie for
more advice on picking the phone that's
right for you head over phones cnet.com
