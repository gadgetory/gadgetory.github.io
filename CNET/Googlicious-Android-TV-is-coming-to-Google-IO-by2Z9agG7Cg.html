google issues for all the Google
goodness that we can pack inside of a
show let's get to it and a new report
says google is planning to launch a new
Android TV platform at Google i/o in the
end of June now the report says it will
be a revamped vision of their current
Google TV platform that fell flat on its
face but this time it will focus on
online media content and android gaming
instead of focusing on existing pay-tv
services the goal is to be a software
platform that TV manufacturers can use
to add streaming services to their
televisions google has been making deals
with the usuals like Netflix and Hulu
and Android TV is expected to officially
replace the google TV name and coexist
with the chromecast that's still there
standalone hardware product also
t-mobile's Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 are the
first to the party for the over-the-air
android 4.4 point 3 software update it's
not a major update and the main focus is
to fix bugs like improved camera focus
data dropping issues random reboots and
some security patches now if you're a
little impatient and you gotta have it
now google has released the factory
images for those of you who want to
manually flash their Nexus devices the
update supports the 2013 Nexus 5 and 7
the Wi-Fi Nexus 10 the Wi-Fi Nexus 7
from 2012 and the Nexus 4 all right
there aren't too many cosmetic changes
but the dialer app also gets a refreshed
interface with lighter colors of blue
black gray and white and follows a
recent train of Google bringing back
colors to its apps in another report of
Google search is poised to get always on
listening and improved car functionality
according to a report from Android
police you'll be able to say okay google
to activate google now even when the
device is turned off as long as it's
plugged into a power source you also be
able to wave your hand over the device
like a Jedi to wake it up and you'll be
able to communicate to the phone to read
you the weather or tell you sports
scores from google now cards it's
similar to the stuff we've seen on the
Moto X with Google's own tweaks and
Google is referring to this feature set
as kit
in reference to the amazing car in the
night writer series that was almost as
amazing as David Hasselhoff's hair all
right google continues to support their
big vision projects and a Wall Street
Journal article says the googs is
planning to spend a 1 billion dollars to
expand and bring internet access to
unwired regions of the world with a
fleet of satellites the premise is that
Google will start with 180 small high
capacity satellites that will orbit at
lower altitudes and will be led by Greg
Wilder who recently joined Google and
founded satellite communications startup
o3b networks now we've told you about
their similar project called Project
loon they uses balloons and hopes to
provide Internet access everywhere and
the two are most likely related or
working together in some capacity
alright guys so the quick kids
Chromebooks are making a push into nine
new markets including New Zealand the
Philippines Norway Denmark Mexico Chile
a Belgium Spain and Italy the
Chromebooks available will vary by
location but offerings from acer HP and
toshiba will be part of the first wave
of the lunch and the chromecast
continues to expand its library of
content with watch ESPN and Major League
Soccer being the two big sport offerings
crunchyroll video and Google+ photos and
videos are on there as well and guys and
gals this is a story that I just love
police in Edinburgh Scotland were called
out to investigate a scene of a crime
after someone using google streetview
thought they had spotted an axe murderer
yes this is a real story the scene
turned out to be a prank by two friends
who saw the car coming and had 20
seconds to think of something to do so
now Google Street View has the
distinction of capturing people going to
the bathroom snorkelers on the road
america and a murder scene the world is
a beautiful place alright that's going
to do for this week's show email us at
Google licious at cnet com or tweet me
at Bryan Tom thanks so much for watching
we'll see you guys next week for some
more of that Google Isha's
do delicious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
