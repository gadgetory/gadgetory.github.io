makeover I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update the new iOS 7 arrived
Wednesday giving iPhones iPads and the
latest ipod touch a new look it's quite
different from the previous iOS version
so you may feel a little lost at first
after downloading but you can find some
helpful tips on cnet and with the new
operating system also comes a new
version of itunes software version 11.10
for mixing up your music and there's
also iTunes radio Apple's new streaming
music service of course right as iTunes
radio goes live Pandora releases a major
update to its iPad app as if to say hey
guys don't forget about me Pandora's new
app allows users to learn more about
artists and share on social media
there's also a music feed with a
timeline of your music preferences
including stations you created and it
got a fresh look with colors and icons
to match the design of iOS 7 you'll
start to see several apps give their
icons a new paint job to match the
aesthetics of Apple's new software the
new iphone 5s arrives in stores Friday
but if you simply need to get your hands
on one right away it won't be easy there
are multiple reports that there will be
a limited supply of the new 5s compared
to previous launch years and it could be
because the fingerprint sensor is more
complicated to make if you really want
the gold color that's going to be
another challenge there could be limited
numbers of how much a color every store
gets Apple stores will likely have the
most supply but they will have the
longest lines mobile carriers will have
fewer but you may have more luck at
stores in smaller neighborhoods stores
will begin selling at 8am if you don't
mind waiting just a few days online
orders begin at midnight pacific 3 a.m.
eastern on friday and if you're looking
to pick up a brightly colored iPhone 5c
that should be much easier you could
probably get one by walking into a store
later in the day be sure to check out
the full review of both models now up at
cnet com and looking ahead there's
already talk of the next iPads oh yes
photos have been posted online
of the ipad mini in the new space gray
color that was introduced with the
iPhone 5s apple also has space grey as
an option for ipods Apple is space grain
all the things an apple isn't the only
one with a new phone to talk about
believe it or not blackberry still has
some fight left the company just
introduced a new flagship phone called
the z30 with a slightly larger screen
better speakers and improved battery
life there's no price or launched it yet
that's your tech news update we can get
more details on these stories at cnet
com / update from our studios in New
York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
