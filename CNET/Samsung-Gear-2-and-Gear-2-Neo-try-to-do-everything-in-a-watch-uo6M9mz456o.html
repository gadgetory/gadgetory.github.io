Samsung made the ultimate SmartWatch
I'm Scott Stein and I'm here with the
Samsung gear 2 and gear 2 neo which are
two of three Samsung wearables that are
out there this spring
among many wearable products how many
wearable things can you fit on your
wrist
Samsung hopes this will have space now
last year the Samsung Galaxy gear was
the first SmartWatch they made there
been a lot of changes now a lot of
streamlining and the operating system is
different it's now Samsung's own Tizen
vs. Android that doesn't matter because
you're never going to experience that
you can load apps onto both the gear 2
and gear 2 neo something that you can't
do with the gear fit which is Samsung's
fitness band with notifications that's
being sold at the same time as these
gear 2 watches the price well this fit
is $1.99 the neo is $1.99 and the gear 2
is $2.99 what's the difference well
again this just gets notifications these
both get apps and basically the same
features under the hood this is a camera
and a metal design do you want a camera
on your watch think about that
underneath same processor same screen
really nice OLED display and this
wristband around here can be replaced
unlike last time so the feel that's nice
the battery life you're going to get
about four days which is good so what do
you do with a smart watch like the gear
2 well you can track your steps you can
also check your heart rate you can get
notifications from whatever you want
pumped from your phone you can take
photos if you have the gear 2 you can
find your device if you lost your phone
somewhere want to locate it you can play
music you can use the control the music
on your phone or load music tracks onto
the gear itself has about 4 gigs of
storage it also can make phone calls you
could dial a phone call into here and it
has a speakerphone so you can make a
call in here it has voice commands
although they're very limited and it
even has a TV remote there's an IR
blaster here so you could program it
with your TV in your set-top box it's
actually kind of cool if you lost your
TV remote but let's face it that's not
really why you're buying a Smart Watch
I don't think
and you get your stopwatch and your
basic features like that and you can
record voice memos there are a couple of
games there are a couple of additional
apps but nothing with the breath you
would find on the pebble right now you
can imagine there are a lot of apps
coming in the future right now we're
right at the beginning of smartwatches
and Samsung's clearly lay the groundwork
here but if you're really serious you
might want to wait just a couple of
months see what's coming before you dive
in and did I mention these only work on
samsung phones about 18 phones and
devices right now so you can't pair them
with any Android phone if I were to pick
one of these I'd probably go with the
Neo because for $1.99 you're getting the
best feature set but then it looks a
little more like a watch - and it's not
asleep this $100 for a camera that's a
lot I'm Scott Steiner here's a look at
the Samsung gear 2 and the gear 2 need</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
