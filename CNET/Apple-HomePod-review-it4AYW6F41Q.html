the home pod is apple's long-awaited
answer to amazon's echo google's home
macs and the Sonos one but the tech
giant wants its 349 dollars Siri powered
wireless speaker to be much more than a
voice enabled smart home assistant in
every marketing campaign Apple makes it
clear that home pod is a speaker first
and everything else is secondary it's
true that the home pod delivers
impressive audio slightly better than
the home Mac's still it isn't perfect
apple claims home pod is an
omnidirectional speaker but it has
definite sweet spots where the music
sounds better particularly when it's in
the middle of a room my iPhone
occasionally answered questions I asked
home pod when using hey Siri as a wake
freeze you're pretty much tied to Apple
music for audio but if you want to use
services like Spotify you'll have to
send them to home pod from your phone on
the speakers display you'll find volume
up and down buttons when audio is
playing press and hold the center to
bring up Siri without having to say hey
Siri a variety of taps let you play
pause and skip music straight from home
pod everything else is done either with
voice commands or through Apple's home
app on iOS home pod setup process takes
a minute tops and your new speaker
immediately shows up in the home apps
list of home kid devices in addition to
playing music and podcasts the home pod
can tell you the news and answer general
questions about the weather it can also
control your home kit devices just like
your iPhone and thanks to advanced
machine learning Siri is more
conversational than ever hey Siri who is
Bob Dylan
Bob Dylan is an American
singer-songwriter author and painter who
has been hey Siri figurin pop how old is
he
Bob Dylan is 76 home pod is a smart
device with solid sound quality that
will likely improve over time although
pricy I can confidently recommend it to
Apple customers who are sold on a home
kit smart home but audio files simply
looking for a great speaker system can
find better sound quality for roughly
the same price and if you're already
heavily invested in an Alexa or Google
assistant smart home you won't find much
value here
