what it was impossible to put 75 dollars
in your tank today it's commonplace and
the worst part is of that 75 bucks maybe
10 to 20 it burned on actually moving
your car the rest of it goes out as heat
and exhaust the innate inefficiency of
combustion engines
that's why EPA mpg numbers as imperfect
as they are are an obsession with
motorists today and that's why there are
car tech 101 now the dirty little secret
about the numbers you see here on the
window sticker that tell you the mpg
those are not done by the EPA not in
most cases only about 15% of cars are
actually gathered by the government and
tested by the Environmental Protection
Agency the other 85% they were tested by
the car maker themselves on an honor
system the EPA will pull in the other
15% on a random test basis to keep
everybody honest or when there's been a
lot of complaints by consumers like
recently on Hyundai and Kia cars and
we've also heard quite a bit about Ford
Fusion and c-max hybrids
when they hear about a big discrepancy
then they'll haul one in and when they
do that they don't take cars out on the
road and drive them they put them on a
dynamometer and hook up to a computer
which does the driving on a treadmill
basic
one of several clearly specified cycles
there's the la4 or city test that
simulates a seven and a half mile trip
that's real choppy like stop and go
traffic it takes almost 23 minutes to
complete averaging 20 miles an hour and
there's a number of times when the
vehicle idles it's done with both a cold
start and a hot start
and the MPG results are rounded down 10%
there's also a cold version of the city
test which is the exact same test but
it's done in an ambient temperature in
the test room of 20 degrees Fahrenheit
then there's the highway fuel economy
test that's 10 miles in duration
averaging 48 miles an hour no stops and
takes about 13 minutes the car has only
started once at the beginning and the
results are reduced 22% to be safe now
you may have heard about the new way the
EPA's testing mileage to new tests were
added in 2008 there's us o6 what I call
the Jackrabbit test it's high speed
quick acceleration 10 minutes long
covers eight miles averaging 48 like the
highway tests but hits a top speed of 80
miles an hour it has a number of hard
starts at a rate of 8
miles per hour per second that's similar
to zero to sixty and seven seconds by
the way the air conditioning is not on
for this or most other tests which
brings us to SCO three another one of
the new tests but this one's done with
the AC turned on like you often have it
it's done in an ambient temperature of
95 degrees it's about 10 minutes long
and very city like 3.6 miles averaging
22 miles an hour not freeway oriented
there are five times when the vehicle
stops and 20% of the time when it's
idling one more interesting carve out
the EPA does not change its MPG rating
based on electrical load of the vehicle
and this can be important think about
all those outlets you've got what you're
plugging in things to charge or are your
headlights on are they on high beams are
they high intensity headlights or have
you plugged in laptops and other things
into those 110 outlets you find on SUVs
for every 200 watts of additional
electric draw when you take roughly one
mpg off your car's fuel economy what's
being discussed now by the EPA are new
or amended cycles that better test the
electrified vehicles especially plug-in
hybrids and range extenders and also
doing so under very different ambient
temperature conditions because there's a
lot of concern that electric and highly
electrified vehicles have much different
performance in very cold weather oh by
the way check out my mpg at the
government's fuel economy gov website it
lets you look at real drivers submitted
mpg for all kinds of cars so you can
take their word instead of the actual
tests and you can also add your data
they've also got a mobile webpage that
makes it easy to add your gasoline
information each time you're sitting
