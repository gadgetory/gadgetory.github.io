battery life for double the price I am
Bridget Carey this is your scene that
update do you feel like your iPhone is
always running out of juice too quickly
does it need a charge before you get
home from work well the battery was
never strong suit for the iPhone 6 and
6s and now Apple has unveiled its very
own battery case to give you an 80%
power boost it's the first time Apple is
making a battery case but it's a bit
silly how expensive it is Apple's new
case is $100 whereas you can get good
cases for cheaper from other makers like
the Mophie Juice Pack reserved for 60
bucks shown here and for $100 it's not
like the design is impressing anyone
with that big ol bump in the back the
advantage is that it's soft so it's easy
to take on and off and you can charge it
with the same lightning cable whereas
other battery packs use micro USB cords
the downs are the same as some other
cases it can block some headset jacks
from fitting in right
and speaking of fitting in you know what
else didn't fit in with your phone
Facebook's weird side apps that were
trying to copy snapchat and other
chatting trends there was Facebook
slingshot riff and rooms all of which
have been pulled from app stores
Facebook has quietly shut down its
creative labs division which was tasked
with coming up with these side apps but
nothing really ever caught on some
elements of the apps have been added to
the main Facebook though and as Facebook
shuts down these excess messaging apps
Sony just launched one of its own the
PlayStation messages app is separate
from the existing main PlayStation app
and it's just for chatting with
PlayStation Network friends you can send
text or voice messages along with
stickers and other attachments it's
available for Android and iPhone that's
it for this tech news update and there's
more at cnet.com from our studios in New
York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
