editor at cnet com and this is the sony
vaio fw 480 JT laptop it's a retail
configuration that's available at Best
Buy and we're covering it as part of a
all round lineup of laptops for our back
to school special now what makes this
machine interesting is that it plays
blu-ray discs and it has a pretty wide
16.4 inch screen for 1199 you're also
getting some pretty decent core2duo
graphics and you're also getting an ati
radeon card with about 512 megabytes of
dedicated video memory so it can play
games and it's pretty good at playing
movies too and the design is pretty nice
sony vaio has always have a pretty nice
slick look to them and this one with its
chocolate brand exterior and black
interior has almost type of a macbook
look to it it also has a raised keyboard
which is pretty common across a wide
variety of laptops now especially the
sony vaios the computer weighs over six
pounds so it's a little heavy however it
feels nice and will pack up pretty flat
the trackpad feels comfortable smooth
standard trackpad nothing tremendously
unique good click to the buttons and the
keyboard has a nice feel to now sony
also packages they are vaio laptop so
the suite of proprietary video and music
software music box which selects tunes
for you and it also has a sort of a
playstation like media launching bar
which can be an alternative to Windows
Media Center the fw 480 JT comes with
400 gigabytes in the hard drive and six
gigs of ddr2 RAM which is pretty beefy
and a nice option for a machine in this
price ports are also pretty decent
there's an HDMI port on the side there
also happens to be a mini firewire port
and there are three USB ports there's
also a memory card slot in addition to a
slot for Sony's proprietary memory stick
media fold it over here you can see that
actually the charging and the power
button are inside the hinge charging
happens over here and there's a glowing
power button on the side here which
happens to pulse in a pleasing little
color tone when it's charging or
it's in sleep mode for controlling the
media functions there's no light up
backlit bar here like on a lot of
multimedia laptops instead there's a
series of dedicated black buttons that
are pretty understated at the top here
right by the speakers the internal
speakers while not being a full 5.1
speaker set have some pretty nice sound
to them and they sound loud enough and
crisp enough to be able to enjoy your
movies pretty well and we have to
compliment Sony I mean nobody does
blu-ray better than them and the discs
start up perfectly well there's instant
play of them and there's no trouble with
no problem setting up blu-ray playback
whatsoever which does happen on some
laptops in terms of energy use the vaio
480 JT also perform really well it only
cost in our tests about 12 and a half
dollars a year to operate which was the
best among all of the high-end
multimedia laptops that we tested her
back to school roundup we like the vaio
480 JT the best out of all three and if
you see it in a store and you want to
get something that plays blu-ray movies
and can play games and can be a pretty
decent all-around machine you can't
really go that wrong with this machine
I'm Scott Stein and this is the sony
