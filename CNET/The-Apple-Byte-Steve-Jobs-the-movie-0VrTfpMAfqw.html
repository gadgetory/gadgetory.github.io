welcome to the apple pie for everything
inside the world of Apple I'm on a
little break right now but through the
magic of video production we're putting
together show so we have a little bit of
news your emails and an iphone case
giveaway but let's start off with a
story and you may be heard of it there's
this upcoming indie film titled jobs
about Steve Jobs and the actor playing
SJ will be Ashton Kutcher who also
happens to look like NBA sharp shooter
Kyle Korver which adds nothing to this
story now you may love or hate that idea
but if Ashton is Steve Jobs who would
the apple byte cast for the other
characters in the movie so let's start
this off what about his arch nemesis and
rival Bill Gates now if we're talking to
young Bill Gates this one is easy Topher
Grace from that 70 show fame all right
Steve Wozniak he was sj's best bud and
apples co-founder he could be played by
Zach Galifianakis or maybe even Jack
Black both solid choices but I have to
push hard for Harry from Harry and the
Hendersons all right what about John
Sculley the man who jobs brought in from
pepsi to lead the company and the man
who eventually kicked steve out of Apple
I'd say Jeff Daniels but more because he
starred in a movie with an appropriate
title dumb and dumber all right John
Ruby Rubenstein who led Apple is their
senior VP of hardware during their turn
around and tried to turn things around
for HP he could be played by mortal
kombat trader Ed Boon see the
resemblance there and what about his
wife Lauren well let's just sign up Kim
Basinger right now or you could just say
screw trying to find a real actress and
sign up supermodel Kate Upton I just wet
myself and finally Phil Schiller senior
VP of worldwide marketing and active and
Apple product launches again come on
let's go back to Harry for this one I'm
telling you there's a serious
resemblance now we're going to turn this
back to you the Apple biters who would
you cast in the movie we'd love to hear
what you say send us emails at the apple
byte at cnet com and since we're talking
about emails let's get to a few from you
the Apple biters themselves now Yankee
green writes in and asks yo yo
oh I love your show and watch it every
week but when is the new touch coming
out Yankee it's pretty much an
established pattern now an apple tends
to refresh their music line around the
end of august to early September time
period but it might be earlier if they
push the next iPhone to a fall release
so look for that Eugene rights in with
I'm thinking of buying a macbook for
school should i buy now or wait in other
words when's the best time by one thanks
huge we've told you before wait for
around the june july time period when
the new laptops with ivybridge are
expected to come out before the
back-to-school season do not buy one now
read Gemini PA says hey Brian I'm
curious what a laptop is you seem to use
that word every time laptop should be
used you're supposed to be a tech geek
even mere mortals know it's laptop not
laptop I'm sure you're using OS 10 lion
try spelling laptop with autocorrect
turned on it'll be replaced with laptop
every time now between you calling
laptops laptops and the irritating
iphone 5 to refer to the next six
generation iphone i don't find myself
wanting to watch the apple byte very
often please stop all right red I just
hope you enjoyed watching me read your
email on your laptop and Matthew scripts
bizzack asks how old are you Brian
Matthew if you want me to be honest I'm
65 it's Asian genetics and my is real
smooth all right guys let's show you
some really cool stuff happening with an
amazing Kickstarter project that goes by
the name Galileo it's an iOS controlled
robotic iPhone platform with spherical
rotation capability and it can be used
for video conferencing cinematography
360-degree panoramas and more now its
reach to school for funding I'm getting
one and the project is a go but it's
something we're checking out and truly
innovative in the accessory world also
