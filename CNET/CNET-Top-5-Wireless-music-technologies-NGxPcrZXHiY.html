5 or a new iPod Touch or iPod Nano
you've probably noticed that it doesn't
work with your old speaker dock Apple's
new lightning connector is a punishing
blow to your old accessories and if you
invest in a new speaker with a lightning
dock
who's to say the Apple won't change
their connector again next year
fortunately there are tons of great
affordable ways to listen to your music
wirelessly I'm Donald Bell and in this
top 5 I'm going to tell you the top 5
wireless audio technologies for your
home all of which are compatible with
the iPhone 5 starting off at number 5 a
Bluetooth speaker adapter if you already
have a speaker that you like you can
make it work over Bluetooth for a little
less than thirty dollars by going
Bluetooth this is gonna work with just
about any phone or tablet and will even
work with the new iPod Nano now it does
degrade the audio a bit and the wireless
range is limited but if you're looking
for the cheap way to go wireless
this is it if you don't already have a
great stereo we're patching with an
adapter how about number for a Bluetooth
speaker that's wireless speakers go the
Bluetooth variety are the more
affordable of the bunch you still have
to sacrifice some audio quality and some
range but there are some beautiful
options out there including some great
portable speakers at number three
airplay now there's something sad about
being driven to a new proprietary Apple
format after the last one just burned
you but if you're a fan of Apple's whole
it just works mantra then airplay is
gonna be the thing for you it works with
both audio and video so you can stream
content to an Apple TV or an airport
Express router or a dedicated airplay
speaker system the audio quality is
better than bluetooth and so is the
wireless range since it works over Wi-Fi
the downside is that it only officially
works with Apple products so if your kid
goes Android you'll have to disown them
but if you do have a few Android users
in the home that you're fond of and
Bluetooth feels beneath you
that's where number two comes in a Sonos
music system great sound great range and
a great cross-platform app that controls
everything compared to the other options
on the list sauce is a little pricey but
it's a solution for your whole house
from one app you can put Barry White in
the bedroom Barry Gibb in the kitchen
Barry Manilow in the dining room and
then probably some Motorhead in the
living room just the
things out now before we get to our
number one wireless music system for
replacing your old speaker dock let me
make sure you're aware of the
five-dollar fix a mini jack cable plug
this thing into the aux input in the
back of your old speaker system and
you're good to go
the dock may be dead but wireless
speakers aren't cheap so just get a
cable alright and finally our number one
option is a bit of a surprise
it's the Sony STR DN 1030 AV receiver is
it small no it is portable not a chance
but if you're like most people these
days the best speakers in your home are
hooked up to your TV so you plug this
$500 receiver into the heart of it and
you can use any wireless music standard
you want Bluetooth airplay DLNA Wi-Fi it
works with all of them now I know a lot
of you are in the market for a new
receiver but I had to hand it to Sony
they threw in everything really the
perfect wireless system is going to
depend on your needs and your budget for
a more in-depth rundown of all these
wireless audio options check out John
Falcone's article the doc is dead over
on iphone Atlas and for more top fives
