accidents at roughly five times the rate
of more experienced drivers let's say
their parents generation and booze and
speed only account for about half of
that so an experiment was done a
University of Massachusetts at Amherst
to Train young drivers in what they call
rap risk awareness and perception
training it basically turns peripheral
awareness while driving into a crude
sort of computer game awarding points if
you see what's around you so the
research program was trying to aim at
getting younger drivers to recognize
these threats from many peripheral and
lateral areas not just the linear space
in front of and behind their car they
got the recognition rate of these
peripheral hazards up to about 65
percent in young drivers compared to
just 37 percent in the untrained ones
now old codgers have kind of a similar
issue as drivers get older they realize
their reactions are slowing and they
tend to slow down their driving and
increase their gap quite a bit as a
result frontal impacts among 70 to 90
year olds go down quite dramatically but
side impacts go way up so researchers
here got older drivers to for example
scan the area around them while they're
making a turn not just the area where
they're pointing that term here the
UMass team got older drivers to side
scan at a rate of around 83 percent up
from an untrained 44% it helped that
this group was real receptive to the
input they noted because they were all
quite afraid of losing their driving
privilege should they have a lot of
accidents now this may seem incredibly
sort of basic and I admit it is but the
more I read about this kind of research
the more a simple theme keeps coming up
you got to face the driving task as one
that is not linear as these lines on the
road suggest but that is a 360 scape
it's one of the habits that drops away
from many classes of drivers old young
and perhaps those that are just
distracted or bored with the task so
it's key that we all bear in mind check
the cars three zones what's going on in
front of you linear what's going on
around you in the sides and what's going
on behind you through your mirrors or
camera technology these are all areas
that it pays to double check</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
