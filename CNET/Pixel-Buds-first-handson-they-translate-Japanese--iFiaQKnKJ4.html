at I'm wearing the pencil but Google's
first wireless headphone it's $159
coming this November it's not just a set
of wireless earbuds it's a real-time
translation and kind of like the Babel
Fish room Hitchhiker's Guide to the
galaxy I hold down a button here I can
start talking with somebody else in
another language more or less here goes
help me speak Japanese after you do that
the Google assistant launches the
Translate app on the phone which I can
hand to another person and have them
communicate in another language while I
speak some English let's give that a try
over here I've got somebody speaking
Japanese who will say how do mmmm mas de
volc√°n on the my wha he wrote this and
it says nice to meet you my name is Hiro
and if I want to talk back to them I can
do that in English just by pressing the
button here hey my name is Shawn how's
it going
and then on the screen here we said I
don't know if you can hear that
yeah well touching on um Iowa don't only
only Sean that's and so it's saying
basically in Japanese what I just said
in English translations we try here
aren't perfect but an excellent start
and we hear that it works better in
other languages like Portuguese and
Spanish are much further along so again
these are the pixel buds connected
together by a wire which is actually
rather cool because the way they fit in
your ears you can adjust this wire on
the end here to fit a larger earlobe you
want to get it up in the nooks and
crannies a larger ear you can make that
happen here so I pulled it out about
that long to get them to stay in my ears
even though I have a hard time generally
getting buds to stay in there I can tuck
that edge of the strap in there to get
it going so pixel buds coming in
November thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
