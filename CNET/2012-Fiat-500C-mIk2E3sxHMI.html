80s this tail between its legs and
reputation for building stylish little
cars they were built like crap now
they're back trying to change exactly
half of a shoe with this guy the 2012
Fiat 500
let's take it for a run check the legacy
and check the tech now this Fiat 500
known as the nuova 500 has a lot riding
on it nothing less than Fiats returns in
the US but it's not technically a new
car it was reintroduced back in 2007 to
huge acclaim overseas like the new mini
and the New Beetle is capitalized on a
classic car that had good bones and like
those cars it's much bigger than the
original
the first thing Fiats not resetting on
the 500 is the iconic look you may not
know the original 500 but bajillions of
people did it was made from 55 to 75 and
sold hand over fist this car looks
remarkably like it even more so than the
new mini looks like the old mini you'll
notice it's got an undeniable cuteness
though lots of rounded edges and a
petite little non-threatening face
clearly this car speaks to a stylish
urban hip kind of a crowd now where does
it fit in size it looks smaller than it
is it's several feet longer than a smart
fortwo six inches shorter than a Mini
Cooper as well as being a little bit
narrower than a Mini and slightly taller
the key thing on our car is that it's a
500 C that means it's a Cabriolet you
might call it a convertible but that's
only part of the picture look how the
top works its gutter to gutter cloth
reinforced and nicely insulated with
several stop points one is a giant
sunroof position like this hit the
button again and now you push it all the
way back into a true cab a Cabrio 'la is
a convertible that folds its top down
kind of untidily on the rear deck it's a
classic European thing and that's what
this does another great trick notice how
the high mounted center stop light is in
position whether the top is up or down
but it's the same light that's kind of a
clever trick and below that you do have
a trunk at all times since this doesn't
fold into the trunk it never takes up
any room
now inside a 500 you've got lots of cute
and lots of circle circles are their
theme not quite as whimsical and kooky
as a mini thank God but you've got a lot
of circular themes here that give the
car a friendly nature here's one of
those retro touches this painted
metallized surface that used to be a
metal dashboard an old 500 interesting
gauge in the middle here notice you've
got concentric rings for the speedo and
the tack and and then in the middle of
course a round info gauge head-unit
there's only one this is it you cannot
get a built-in nav screen head unit on
this car instead they offer you an
optional clip-on TomTom that mounts in a
special factory bracket up here but
there's no integrated head unit that has
a screen this basic readout takes you to
your media choices that are
straightforward am/fm no HD radio single
slot CD right here and then in the - we
have an aux and a USB right there the
audio option we do have is Bose audio
and you can see we've got evidence of
that down here this is a ported
subwoofer underneath the passenger seat
now for a car that has fairly Spartan
tech options interestingly you can get a
Wi-Fi hotspot in this guy it's an ala
carte option I believe it's dealer
installed it's from auto net mobile a
Bay Area company that makes in-car
routers that go 3G to Wi-Fi it's 500
bucks now the last interesting part of
technology in this car is blue and me
it's a kind of a detuned version of Ford
Sync voice command for the
communications and the audio and a few
other features here's the button for
voice on the wheel help the available
commands are message reader Eco Drive
settings
media player alright good so not a whole
lot in there obviously no navigation
commands and the last interesting tech
option of this guy is the installation
of GPS vehicle location tracking for a
450 bucks kind of a you know a poor
man's LoJack or something now under the
hood well the hood at of this car is a
1.4 liter sidesaddle inline-four that
drags it around by the front wheels
small displacement of course 1.4 is
pretty tiny for this market so are the
output numbers 101 horse 98 foot-pounds
of torque
zu 260 about 9.5
seconds mpg is 3038 with the manual if
you get the automatic you shave about
three mpg off each number and the key to
making all those numbers work with that
little engine is the weight of this car
it's not even twenty four hundred pounds
with a full tank of gas and a
labradoodle in the backseat this car is
gonna be all new to most people it's a
platform you've never driven in the
United States
and the bottom line is it's fun the
suspensions a little springy there's a
little bit of body lean that you might
not be used to in every car most cars
trying to be really firm and planted the
power on the engine is only really
available from three grand and up this
thing has no low-end grunts oh you might
dump the clutch a couple times when
you're first driving you speaking to
that clutch it's very light a little bit
of rubberiness in first and second the
left side of the gate of the
transmission you get used to it pretty
quickly but it's not one of those super
crisp air boxes but again the mission of
the car is not performance wind noise is
not bad with this top back and I had
folks in the back seat and they say it
wasn't a buffett fest that's a pretty
good trick now that said overall this
car feels very timid on power as I
mentioned that's going to turn some
people off who are used to driving below
3,000 rpm and they might come away from
a test drive thinking it's gutless
Europeans tend to row their motors
better we don't it's kind of built for
the European driving style the ride
quality is very good nicely compliant
but as I mentioned you've got some body
roll in there it's a little wallowing
especially for a little car and all this
car comes off very refined it goes
head-to-head with like a Ford Fiesta
which is pretty much top of the pack in
terms of refinement in that class which
this one plays in but I think Fiats
ace-in-the-hole is this the outside of
the car says that European Jawad IV and
then the inside of the car and the
driving deliver on that
that's a nice consistent experience
okay this priceless 500cc for Cabriolet
including that it's nineteen five plus
delivery twenty thousand even for the
ragtop not bad now on top of that couple
ala carte options you can get that
TomTom clip-on nav rig for four hundred
bucks and to choose your phone you can
also get the in-car wireless router for
five hundred see the last remark the
lounge package adds a lot of niceties
the Bose audio serious automatic
temperature control the alloy wheels but
it also rolls in the automatic
transmission and that's going to turn me
off especially with its MPG reduction i
stay with this 5-speed and an ala carte
or aftermarket all the rest in general
this car should make this car pretty
darn proud</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
