top shelf phone I wanted to see how the
S eights tall narrow build beautifully
curved sides battery life both megapixel
camera big speed digital assistant and
waterproofing so basically everything
held up at one of my favorite spots in
California verdict
it's a damn nice phone to hold in use
that 5.8 inch edge to edge screen those
curved sides they draw you in no matter
what you're doing the narrow body fits
my hand better than most phones even
those with smaller displays and sending
texts and updates went smoothly I didn't
miss the physical home button you find
in the s7 and I dig the essay it's new
custom interface that rides on top of
Android nougat everything just feels
really clean and easy to use
but the all glass phone felt so slick
and glossy I was worried I'd drop it
rounded edges plus glass equals breakage
anxiety and the s8 is too pretty and too
pricy to leave to chance I think a case
is a really good idea also the
fingerprint reader on the back was a
pain to set up its off-center and
fighting a blind was hit or miss which
was a problem when using skimping pay
sorry its I got a I'm having a an issue
here
I often hit the camera or didn't land my
finger dead on the first time
aha
there you go iris scanning is the so-so
backup but face unlock can't be used
with Samsung pay the 12 megapixel camera
is solid I love double-clicking the
power button to launch the app it just
feels really natural there's no dual
camera mount that you can dig into a
mountain of effects and settings to make
a kind of portrait mode and really
fine-tune those shots I just wish that
the portrait tool was a little less
severe playing around with the snapchat
liked features was also fun for a minute
but I got more out of the other filters
selfies are easier with the SAS
autofocus which is great and low-light
photos come out looking fairly bright
and detailed for what they are without
being harsh and overexposed let's talk
about Vic speed voice Samsung's new Siri
like digital assistant it has its own
button and no you can't remap it to
another app Bixby voice will control
phone settings like screen brightness
and toggling on Wi-Fi then there's Bixby
home which can surface information like
the weather and headline news in Bixby
vision can tell you about a thing or
place across please
okay so now Bixby is trying to identify
the ride and I got it number two James
if er plus there's always Google
assistant it's on here from the get-go
what time is sunset that will set at
7:42 p.m. the s8 is totally okay to get
wet look I wouldn't jump it on purpose
but I could easily use it with wet hands
and rinse off straight beach sands it
survived a soaking on the water ride and
other random splashes now the s8 has a
cutting edge processor and it's
definitely faster than last year's
Galaxy s7
everything Ram quickly and smoothly from
navigation to image processing after the
note 7 battery disaster samsung has a
lot to prove the s8 battery underwent a
new eight point safety check no problems
with dangerous overheating so far it did
however get warm while charging which a
lot of other phones do too
it survived a day of heavy use just in
time to charge overnight or wirelessly
charge if you buy the accessories the
good news is that the galaxy s 8 plus is
almost exactly the same but with a
larger screen and build a slightly
bigger battery and yeah a higher price
for that extra screen real estate
I'm really happy with the Galaxy s8 it's
gorgeous and it worked well but I do
think that the phone could be a little
bit better especially when it comes to
the fingerprint reader also fix people
start off with limitations which is
disappointing because it is such a key
feature and it isn't like Samsung to
trail behind a dual camera trend but I
have a feeling we might see two rear
cameras in the Note 8 once again the
Samsung Galaxy s8 is a stunning
all-arounder but there still room for
competitors to elbow their way in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
