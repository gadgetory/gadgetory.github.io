these crazy summer gadgets in front of
me and really these are my fav five of
all these cool tech toys and really my
favorite of the bunch so we wanted to go
down the line and show you what each of
these are and then we're gonna ask
people what they think I like that's got
more cool back definitely something new
numero uno on the fat five this is the
ifetch it's an automatic ball shooter
for your dogs don't like bench so it
comes with these three little tennis
balls it's used about 10 to 20 to 30
feet this guy only costs $115 all right
next up we have everyone knows about the
Apple watch I don't know I don't think
so apple SmartWatch watch is just weird
and like no offense to apple and then
third this is for all you photo lovers
this is Polaroid zip mobile printer it
starts at around one hundred and twenty
nine dollars and it allows you from your
phone android or iphone to print two by
three photos yeah sweeter cuddlier takes
about 30 seconds for them to come out
but it's really a way to get photos and
anywhere you want their adhesive on the
back you can stick them the different
services and I really like taking
pictures so the fact that you can just
print them on the go and do whatever you
want with them it's pretty cool this is
called the fly x3 pro this is a
Steadicam for your iPhoto video check it
out yeah ground the whole bed your face
stays in the pretty mention the box I
like that that's interesting so you can
see here I can move it around you can
put a GoPro on this you can put an
Android foot on this but this really
makes the videos that you take it home
look really clean and professional and
then finally number five of the 55 we
have the monster superstar back flow
this is a bluetooth speaker completely
wireless what makes this special is it
can be completely submerged in water and
let it go it's made to be waterproof so
it shoots out shoots the water out
that's pretty cool these are the fat
five we're gonna talk to people here on
the streets what is their favorite pick
for the summer it has to be the water
Speaker I would take the stick just
because I'm in action sports junkie i
would i'd go with the watch i get what
the fuck i think i would go for the
water speaker as well i will definitely
use it sure the steadicam is neat i
never seen anything like this before i
take the Polaroid you're feeling the
beat you feeling ABI i like that i would
say that likely that's number one in
this terms of grabbing your attention
the way it works you just fold it and
why not so it's pretty cool I like it I
like the I like the speaker i think it's
just something out probably means the
most so based on our completely
unscientific poll here's the result at
zero the ifetch with one vote the Apple
watch with one vote the Polaroid mobile
zip printer for boats going to the fly
Exley pro Steadicam and with six votes
the winner the monster superstar back
float now look at all these let me know
which one is your pick and I know the
one that I'm taking home with me this
summer um the superstar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
