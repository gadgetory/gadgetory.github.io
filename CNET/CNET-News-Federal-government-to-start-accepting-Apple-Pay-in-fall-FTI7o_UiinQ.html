from this growing threat with Apple pay
we put in place a mobile payment system
that is significantly more secure than
the old days of the plastic card in the
magnetic stripe this is another product
where security was it an afterthought
security was part of the reason we
developed the technology in the first
place you see Apple pay starts with the
premise that your credit card
information and purchases are personal
to you and they should stay that way
when you add a card to Apple pay your
actual credit card numbers are never
stored in your device or on our servers
instead for every payment we create a
unique one-time code that is only good
for that one transaction from your
device your purchases are private and we
don't store the details of those
transactions they remain between you the
merchant and your bank we don't know
your credit card number or what you
bought or how much you paid and we don't
want to just three months after we
launched over two thousand banks have
signed on to bring Apple pay to millions
of their customers and today we're
excited to announce that beginning in
September Apple pay will be available
for many transactions with the federal
government like for example when you pay
for admission to your favorite national
park we're also working to make sure
credit and procurement cards issued to
government employees for their expenses
can be used with Apple pay and we're
working on initiatives with leading
banks and networks to use this
technology with benefit programs like
Social Security and veterans pensions
that serve citizens at both the state
and federal level
we can imagine a day in the not so
distant future when your wallet becomes
a remnant of the past your passport your
driver's license and other important
documents can be digitally stored in a
way that's safe secure and easy to
access but only by you after all we
shouldn't have to trade our security for
the convenience of having all of this
information at our fingertips when a
system is designed properly security and
convenience can actually work in harmony</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
