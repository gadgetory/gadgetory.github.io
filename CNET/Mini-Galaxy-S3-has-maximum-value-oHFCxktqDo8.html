around for a year but it's new to AT&amp;amp;T
and there's one very compelling reason
why you might want to buy it it's a one
dollar reason I'm Jessica doll court for
CNN and this is your first look the s3
mini looks a lot like the s3 that came
before it not the s4 it's got that same
rounded corner high gloss shape the same
sort of brushed color for this pebble
blue version globally it also comes in
white there's a 4 inch AMOLED display on
here it's pretty bright it doesn't have
the highest pixel density but it is just
fine for day-to-day use the operating
system gets a bump here to android 4.2
point2 not android 4.1 so that's really
great it's got the TouchWiz interface
riding on top of it so you get a few
extra Samsung tools but you're not going
to find everything that you see in the
samsung galaxy asked for flagship phone
so just be aware of that there is a very
reliable 5 megapixel camera on the back
with autofocus and flash took pretty
good pictures and 720p HD video so I
thought that was great low-light shots
aren't so hot but there is a night mode
so that might help there's also a
front-facing vga camera that took very
basic front-facing shots I wouldn't use
it for video chat if you have an
alternative inside there's a 1.5
gigahertz dual-core Qualcomm processor
it's going to be fine for navigating
around but you're going to notice some
slow down especially when you're using
the camera and trying to take one
picture quickly after another this phone
does come equipped with AT&amp;amp;T 4G LTE
speeds were pretty good and consistent I
found the phone also comes with NFC and
s beam you are going to be able to
transfer our content like photos and
videos from one equipped phone to the
next one interesting little tidbit is
that this version 480 has a slightly
higher battery 2000 milliamp hours
instead of 1,500 and that's to
accommodate the extra resource drain
from LTE specs aren't the highest on
this phone definitely not as high as
some of the other mini phones that are
out there today but it does cost about a
dollar so it's a really great deal for
what is essentially a free phone I think
it's going to be best for first-time
smartphone users for somebody who just
wants a very
basic and reliable android smartphone
