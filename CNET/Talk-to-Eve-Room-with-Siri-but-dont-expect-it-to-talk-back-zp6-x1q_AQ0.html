I'm taking a look at the elgato Eve rule
this is an indoor air sensor that's
compatible with apple's homekit this guy
is bluetooth enabled and battery powered
and sends you readings on temperature
humidity and air quality if you just
painted your home or done some
construction alternatively if you're
suffering from some allergies this thing
should be able to diagnose the problem
and let you know hey maybe you need to
air this room out a little bit more
before you spend some time in it that's
pretty cool and eighty dollars actually
isn't bad for something that precisely
measures volatile organic compounds and
this thing was pretty accurate on all
three of its criteria and gave us
accurate readings that were then graphed
and you can view those graphs by the day
the hour the week the month
it's got a cool there were two times
when I was using it when it refused to
update on me and there's no way in the
app to force a refresh so it can be kind
of a pain to be looking at the app and
it looks like it's up-to-date but
actually you're looking at readings that
are a couple of hours behind again that
only happened to me twice but it did
annoy me both times and it's something
to watch out
and thanks the homekit you can ask Siri
a question like this hey Siri what's the
temperature in the living room it's at
seventy six point one so the yokatta of
room makes it easy to check on the
conditions of a room and graph that data
over time what it doesn't do is give you
any way to use that information you
can't set up warning thresholds triggers
push notifications so if those volatile
organic compounds rise to a dangerous
level you have to be in the range of the
device with the app open to even know
about it it's unable to talk to anything
or use the info it gets in any sort of
helpful way that actually makes it a
part of a larger smart home system in
theory this device will improve and gain
that functionality as apple's homekit
improves but we'll have to wait and see
on that
to me the whole idea of a smart home is
to automate tasks for you and as of yet
this thing can't do that so right now
again unless you have a specific muse in
mind for it I recommend you pass on the
elgato Eve room for more be sure to
