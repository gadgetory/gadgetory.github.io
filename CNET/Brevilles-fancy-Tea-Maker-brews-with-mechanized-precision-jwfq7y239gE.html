centuries but Breville has now automated
the process to the enth degree with its
product the Breville tea maker priced at
two hundred and fifty dollars this
machine is definitely no impulse buy as
a matter of fact it cost as much as
premium drip coffee makers but I can
guarantee you it is worth the expense
especially if you are into tea what sets
the breville tea maker apart is that not
only does it have presets for brewing
the type of tea you want to brew at the
correct temperature it has a basket that
lowers into the water to ensure you have
the perfect steep time and it's all
automatic you also aren't limited to
using presets you can set a custom brew
mode tailor to the exact temperature
that you'd like to brew for the tea you
have on hand the Breville tea maker
isn't completely automatic you have to
still fill it up with tea leaves but
thankfully that's easy to do because the
filter and baskets is pretty easy to
open all this robotic action doesn't
speed up the process it still takes as
long as it would normally take you still
have to wait for the water to boil and
for the tea leaves to steep I definitely
like this machine it is well-designed it
works really well has accurate
temperature controls one thing is if
you're not into tea it's a lot of money
to spend in one place</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
