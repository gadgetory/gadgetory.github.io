years old but the twitter concept goes
back even further co-founder Jack Dorsey
came up with the idea back in the you
two thousand on this sketch pad he was
using livejournal to blog about life in
the universe and everything but wanted a
quicker way to post short updates kind
of like a microblog the twitter egg was
hatched Dorsey sent out the very first
tweet on March 21 2006 in 2007 the
hashtag made its debut to group together
discussions on the same topic the
milestones soon followed twitter is used
to spread breaking news about world
events like the Arab Spring retweet
records broke thanks to celebrity
selfies at the Oscars but recently
things haven't been as turkey at Twitter
users were in uproars the company
changed the timeline algorithm to a non
chronological model it was suggested
that the 140 character limit may be
lifted but that idea was abandoned by
Dorsey in a recent interview twitter
also reported that it had zero growth in
monthly active users at the end of 2015
as a result stock prices have been shaky
in 2013 the IPO price is twenty-six
dollars in 2015 that drops to $22 and
now prices hover at 16 so how does a
social network reverse its fortunes well
if there's one thing we know for sure
we'll find out on Twitter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
