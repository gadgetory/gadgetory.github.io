cnet com we're at the gamespot booth
here at comic-con 2013 our buddies I
change spot has put together an
unbelievable feat the 3d cam here with
me as Jenn who's the genius behind this
incredible concoction Jan tell me
exactly what's going on here and how
does it work so basically this is a
process called photogrammetry it is
basically taking measurements off of
two-dimensional images so what we have
here is an array of cameras we've got 89
cameras up here and it's basically just
trying to get a shot from like every
angle and we can reconstruct that into a
three-dimensional model of it cool so
you were telling me that they all have
to fire at the same time what yeah how
do you rig that together um I rigged it
together by building this box over here
I made it so that all i have to do is
push a button all the cameras are wired
together on to it and so yeah basically
everything is everything is hardwired on
it the flashes are a radio trigger to it
and basically all of those have to go
off at the same time there's a lot of
timing involved has like these flashes
you're talking about the light is on for
only a millisecond so like when when the
cameras go off sometimes it's like just
by nature of the camera so it can be all
fine like a millisecond even that is
enough to throw it off so it's like it's
got to be millisecond kind of accuracy
so you're you're faced with the
challenge of getting them all to fire at
the same time what about the fact that
we're in the middle of comic-con and
there's all this chaos around us how do
you deal with taking that into
consideration so the strobes that put
out a lot of light in all actuality like
I could have it so this background is
pretty much dark with how much light
these put out but I do get a bit of the
light in here just to get a bit of
separation because if it was just flat
black in the background then dark colors
dark colors are hard enough to scan if
it's up against a black backdrop or
anything it's going to be even more
go to scab right so yeah it's just
trying to find the balance in there so
and you were telling me something really
interesting about these patterns here
that look like yeah I'm computer vomited
them out how does that exactly basically
this is something that our design team
put together it's basically just a bunch
of non repeating patterns it's like
they're all different colors and so the
idea is that basically any of the
cameras by seeing any of these patterns
yeah they'll know exactly where they're
looking at like you know this one you'll
see oh here's the red one over here at
the orange one though they'll be able to
figure out spatially where the closest
order because basically when it's
putting it together it's like it's got
to figure out where all the cameras were
positioned right throwing aside you know
what it's seeing from that angle cool
now once you get your 89 photographs how
do they get stitched together how does
that work that's over over in this room
we've got a couple of graphics guys that
are just frosting it out on computers
they've got got stacks of computers for
them to be working on because this stuff
it takes a while for it to do all the
processing and then when it's all said
and done the 89 images how big is that
like stack of images what are we talking
I just like we follow like started I
mean it's like inert it's a bunch of
JPEGs and said it's only like about 130
miles or so 130 yeah yeah Mick powder
that's high all right yeah do you think
what I'm wearing I can it'll work well
I'm right here yet basically the
patterns and stuff are definitely a
bonus and everything for it the the dark
colors can be a bit more difficult but I
think that with this patterning and
everything I think that we probably get
something for an interesting out of it
all right let's uh let's let's try down
see if we can make this work all right
cool all right let's do it ready
alright so it's been a few hours the 89
photographs have been compiled into a 3d
rendering of myself so I have it here on
my computer let's check it out and look
at that I can anchor it anywhere I want
whoa that's pretty crazy I didn't you
know these are these are viewing angles
that no one should really ever have of
me but nevertheless it looks really cool
it's amazing how how seamless the the
transition from each angle is I could
zoom in and out I can see angles on my
body that I've never seen before I'm not
gonna I thought I was a little fatter
than that and this is very flattering so
I'm excited about that so we want to
thank our buddies at gamespot we're
hooking up the 3d photo if you're here
in San Diego make sure you check out
their booth for a chance to get your
photo taken just like this and have a 3d
rendering of yourself from comic-con
2013 i'm jeff beck a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
