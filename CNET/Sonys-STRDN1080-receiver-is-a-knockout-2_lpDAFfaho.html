latest receiver and it's even better
than last years with more features yet a
similar performance and the same price
the Sony fix is one of the only problems
from last time no support for Dolby
apples the receiver also offers the same
amount of HDMI points 6 and all have
been upgraded to support 4k HDR the DN
1080 is a little smaller than last
year's model but it has the same
excellent interface and easy to use
remote the receiver also includes
bluetooth streaming in addition to Wi-Fi
you get access to chromecast built-in
which lets you stream from dozens of
smart phone apps as well as Spotify
connect and Sony's own music Center app
sound quality is a little different from
last year with a sound slightly more
geared to home cinema so if you're in
the market for dedicated height speakers
this receiver is aimed at you whether
it's a Dolby Surround soundtrack or just
the news the Sony will make dialogue
clear and surround effects seamless
that's not to say this won't play music
because we had an enjoyable afternoon
streaming from Sony's music center to
the receiver and if you have high res or
DSD tracks it will do those natively to
at $599 the sony is an excellent deal
and it's very little that it can't do
2017 might have only just started but
its competition will need to step up if
wants to take Sony on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
