apple bite and everything good and bad
inside apple let's get to the show we
start with error 53 that's become a big
deal so what is it well the Guardian
reports some users who had their iphone
6 is repaired by third party technicians
and not apple have reported that an
unknown error 53 message is permanently
breaking their phones the issue happens
after updating for the latest version of
the OS and prevents all access to the
iphone now apple says error 53 is
related to touch ID security because
they want to ensure that data from the
sensor like your fingerprints for
authorizations has not been tampered
with error 53 is intended to prevent
third-party components from compromising
it when it doesn't pass a touch ID
validation but why completely brick the
phone and make it unusable
I understand Apple is keeping the
integrity of the product that's not a
bad apple but the biggest issue it's
really the first time we've seen
anything like this so after media
attention and threats of a lawsuit
MacRumors reports some but not all Apple
stores are servicing error 53 phones but
charging and out of warranty repair fee
on top of the price of replacement parts
which obviously will cost you we know
about voiding the warranty and how many
times have you all had to replace your
screen outside of Apple because it's
broken multiple times or it's just
cheaper and it's happened for years
Apple didn't completely brick phones
back then but they are now so we've all
found out the hard way and sticking with
Apple stores a new system will now allow
store employees to apply the Belkin
branded screen protectors for the iPhone
6 6 plus iPhone 6s and 6s plus it's
called the Belkin screen care plus
application system because they wanted
to find the shortest name possible now
it's a specific procedure using an
actual device called the screen care
plus machine to apply it so maybe this
will help you from shattering your
screen and then getting a third-party
replacement screen from somewhere else
which ends up then breaking your phone
see Apple's got your back now on other
iPhone news we turn our attention to the
iPhone 5s e Mac Co takara claims the
rumored phone
may come in silver Space Gray and a pink
shade that's not like the rose gold
color of the iPhone 6s they believe it's
a bright pink that's more like the
seventh gen iPod Nano and the six gen
iPod Touch yes I know what you all just
can't wait for the pretty and pink
t-mobile pink iPhone 5se could be coming
to a store near you now this is all
speculation but it could make sense
since this is their lower end phone that
might be something parents would
purchase for their kids or just grown
adults who would add a whole bunch of
Hello Kitty stickers to it
alright Apple has released new beta
updates for the stand out this time
around is the TV OS 9.2 beta 3
it adds dictation support that allows
you to dictate into text field so
currently you have to enter in words
letter by letter they've also added App
Store Siri search which is helpful but
still no support for video podcasts in
the podcast app its beta so I won't bad
Apple them yet and if Apple wants the
Apple TV to really take off streaming TV
service or not it has to be a player
when it comes to original content a
report from Variety says Apple Amazon
and Google are all in the mix to
potentially be the NFL's official
streaming partner for Thursday night
football games and the street reports
Apple is met with TV and Hollywood
producers and studios about developing
original shows to offer exclusively to
iTunes customers now rumors claim they
were turned down after making offers to
the Top Gear crew and sports podcaster
Bill Simmons for exclusive deals but
it's up to Apple to make all this happen
after seeing the success of orginal
content from Netflix and Amazon and
finally we wrap things up with a Super
Bowl the big game we saw some of the
craziest ads like puppy monkey baby
puppy monkey baby puppy monkey baby
buggy buggy baby puppy monkey baby puppy
monkey baby puppy monkey baby puppy
monkey baby okay
okay I'll stop but the best moment came
after the Super Bowl
when Tim Cook tweeted Colorado Rocky
Mountain High Congrats Broncos and
included one of the blurry pictures you
could ever take with presumably his own
iPhone like it wasn't bad it was really
bad
then again maybe we'll see it on apples
next shot on iphone billboard but you
know what made it even worse getting
flak from lots of random people on the
internet all in good fun of course until
Tim removed the tweet completely Oh
Timmy and that my friends is a bad apple
all right that's gonna do it for this
week you can email us at the Apple vidas
cnet.com or tweet me at brian tom thanks
for watching and we'll catch y'all next
time for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
