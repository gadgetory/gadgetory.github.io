Alfred I'm Google's parent alphabet
today said it's making project shield
available for election campaigns and
candidates shield protects against
distributed denial-of-service attacks
and has already been available for
journalists and human rights advocates
Alfred do you think this tool will help
with campaigns well when I spoke with
the product manager app project shield
he was mentioning that they always see a
rise of DDoS attacks around election
cycles they have seen it happen at the
election and France they saw it happen
in South Korea in the Netherlands where
these attacks essentially just take down
websites so it's not as high-stakes of a
hack as you know what had happened with
John Podesta when they got all this all
these emails and all this information
and leaked it to the public and it's not
even close to actually changing people's
votes which I think like when we talk
about election hacking that's probably
like the nightmare scenario that a lot
of people are worried about but I think
the bigger argument is that you know a
lot of people go on like candidate
websites to see you know when they're
gonna be speaking next or you know what
values they represent or try to figure
out how they can donate to a campaign or
anything like that so it is reasonable
to say that it's valuable to protect a
campaign website or a candidate's
website or even like a political action
committees website and it's not like
these attacks haven't happened and you
know it's a free tool and you know
project and you know it's easy to say
this is just something that's you know
for the Democrats or Republicans but he
didn't mention that it's available for
all elections so like even if you're
running for school board or if you're
running for like City Council in your
town of like 20 people or something like
that like this tool will also be
available to you so more broadly are we
better prepared now for the midterms
then maybe we were for 2016 at least
from where I'm sitting it seemed like a
lot of people were caught totally
surprised by some of these election
hacks and is it I mean is it at least
gonna get a little bit easy it's hard to
say if we're better or worse just
because hindsight is always
like I think we're better prepared for
tactics that they were using in 2016 but
you know obviously it's not like they're
gonna be using the same playbook again
and I can't say I know what that
PlayBook is now mm-hmm yeah that's a
good point next court documents revealed
the name of the suspected leaker of
valuable CIA tools used to hack
electronics his name is Josh Schulte and
for reasons that aren't yet known he
hasn't yet been charged for the leak
Alfred how damaging was this hack it
happened last year sorry this leak it
happened last year and what what exactly
like how significant was this leak last
year showed off all the CIA hacking
tools that they had so one of them was
you know how they were able to use any
Samsung Smart TV and turn it into a
listening device another one was a lot
of it was like IOT based and how they
were able to use that to like get your
data or anything like that any any like
leak of a major government organization
is always damaging especially within
like hacking department hacking tools
because like that's what happened with
the NSA when they lost the you wanna cry
hacking tool and then it was used
against you know the general public yeah
pretty much
not wanna cry but the hacking tool was
eternal blue but they use that for wanna
cry and the other thing is even even if
it's not used against the general public
at the very least it means that they
can't use it anymore because anyone that
they're targeting would you know
basically know about it but they would
have the antidote yeah and and they
would basically have to develop like an
entirely new set yeah last Twitter is
working to clean up its social network a
little bit more using quote behavioral
signals to cut cut out trolls from
Twitter threads can you tell me a little
bit more about what is how does this
work what's a behavior so surprise
surprise they're using artificial
intelligence oh god or this but the idea
is that if you're like jumping into a
thread that like if you and I are
talking and then somebody else like just
jumps into the thread on Twitter and
they're AI 12 believes that like you're
not really contributing to the
conversation it'll basically like
they're not gonna delete it or block it
but like they're not gonna they're gonna
basically bury it and then and it works
in the same way that like like YouTube
comments or reddit post where like if it
has enough down votes
much harder than I actually fine
either way check back with Sienna to get
the latest news today on a net
neutrality vote in Congress and the
ongoing Apple Samsung patent suit I'm
Ben Fox Ruben I'm alfred a thanks for
listening sorry little slow on the
uptake there okay i was already trying
to dig into the chat which is what i'm
going to do now not even half as bad as
when i forgot to say my name toward the
end so yeah but anyways thanks everybody
submit questions and comments now about
the topics at hand will try to expand on
them further cuz for minutes it's never
enough
until then go ahead guys you can just
talk amongst yourselves okay
I mean is this even going back to the
Twitter thing I feel like they already
rolled out some of this I'd seen it
already before where you you just click
at the bottom of a tweet thread and it
says show more tweets and usually those
tweets are you know they tend that might
be based on like your own Twitter
settings though okay I think I mean I
don't really setup like that I don't
mess around with the Twitter settings
much so I guess they're gonna be doing
more to just try to filter and I don't
know maybe that'll be helpful mm-hmm um
I don't I don't like I don't really I'm
not a guy that's like affected by trolls
or anything like that though not in the
sense that like trolls don't bother read
more so that like people don't really
troll on my Twitter page or like I don't
interact with enough people to warrant
something like that but I do whole I do
know that it's like a massive issue for
Twitter and you know they announced that
they would be doing something about this
in March so it'll be interesting to see
how this develops for them mm-hmm yeah
wait how are we on questions well let's
take one from the vet Kumar asks which
companies are a part of alphabet can we
stay for a couple of hours encounter
mole off all the honey all 26 of them
but I mean there's there's Google that
fool jigsaw no nest way mow a sperm now
we should yeah they have some other ones
like calico which I think does health
health tech capital G which I which I
think off the top of my head does
venture capitalist
deepmind another a I think and Google
Fiber which I don't even know what the
the status of Google Fiber is but it
used to be this big push to try to get
fiber-optic cables to different
different cities in the US but I
shouldn't think it kind of went belly-up
we should do a quiz where it's like
crappy cyberpunk movie or alphabet
company that's a pretty good BuzzFeed
post right there or alphabet company or
Pokemon no no I think somebody's gonna
see something that says capital G and
think it's a Pokemon yeah yes
you'd have to mess with it a little bit
more to make it sound like you've talked
about it Alfred you may have opened the
floodgates here Alex says uh challenge
accepted about the trolls so buckle up
get ready okay oh cool you've got a
running scared Alex
moving on to WWDC already because our we
can't oh geez next month yeah so that's
the question is when is WWDC for one and
then Kevin wants to know when are we
going to start talking about WWDC
probably too soon
I think the Undertaker has a good chance
of being the new WWDC champion he he's
never really performed well in ladder
matches though so it'll be interesting
to see how he like fares off when is it
supposed to be though I'm trying to find
out right now I think it's next it's a
good month the first week of June isn't
it it's oh it's June 4th to the 8th yeah
so it's a little early for us to talk
about it it's about two two-and-a-half
weeks away but we certainly expect a lot
of announcements from Apple I'm sure
we'll start previewing it probably what
like a week in advance we can preview it
like you know well we're already sort of
previewing it I think we even talked on
the show previously about the idea that
after Google i/o Apple would hopefully
focus a little bit more on Siri to try
to get Syria to catch up a little bit
more to Google assistant and Amazon's
Alexa but there's no telling whether
that's actually gonna happen WWDC like I
don't know like what did they focus on
last year mostly software yeah so and
they did talk a little bit a lot of they
are stuff
wasn't it yes yeah they focus a lot it's
right last time
mm-hmm yeah so you might expect to see a
lot more AR stuff again I mean if they
do a big focus on Syria I'd be a little
surprised but they they definitely do
need to catch up a little bit in that
area they're really gonna need to dump
or get off the pot with Syria with all
what Google is doing with their
assistant and duplex these days I mean
like I don't think they're gonna I don't
I don't think so necessarily either I'm
just stating what's obvious people are
buying home pods probably not in very
big numbers I mean like it's three
hundred and fifty dollars you're not
gonna buy 16 of them for your house like
you wouldn't echo died but it's you know
I think they're probably selling as much
as they wanted to because they put the
price point pretty high they're swinging
back we've got a lot of left fielders
here today Jerry W says how quickly if
we forget the vault seven scandal is
your neighbor leading NSA doing all the
moves yeah I'm gonna let you field this
one I mean yeah I think that's how the
news cycle like works you know I'm
pretty sure there was like another
scandal
immediately after the vault seven hack
had happened
spoilers everybody's terrible yeah
pretty much I mean it's it's how hard is
it for the government to come up with
new tools though like did they spend
years developing this stuff and like I I
mean that's that's if I remember
correctly that was the big scare
mongering or or the big to do that they
mentioned right afterwards which wise we
can't use these tools anymore it took us
years to develop them we understand if
people are really like freaked out that
we do this but this is the work that we
do to keep Americans protected yeah I
remember that their defense was
basically you know we're not really
gonna be that ashamed or anything like
that for doing our jobs like part of it
like we stopped like terrorists with
like these hacking tools are and you
know well that sorts of stuff I mean
yeah it's that part of I mean I get the
argument like part of it is their job to
like hack other countries and like
figure out and tell any way that they
can so III don't have any reasoning for
why this blew over so quickly other than
the fact that yeah this was you know
that's that's how the news cycle works
yeah especially these days there's a
fantastic conversation
going on to the chat with Michael and
APEC and everybody else and I kind of
want to just shut the show down and
watch this unfold more entertaining but
Michael Bradley they're talking about
security issues and on that no Michael
Brown asks does Apple's privacy stance
entice you more into buying an iPhone
than a pixel or Samsung phone I know
that that is a really big selling point
for a lot of security experts and like
people like privacy folks in the sense
that like yeah they're not collecting
all this data on you but I would also
make the argument that you know if you
know Google's data collection and
Facebook standard collection isn't
entirely based on Hardware alone like if
you're gonna get an iPhone for the
privacy purposes that what like you use
Gmail on it at the same time it kind of
doesn't yeah self Gmail and Facebook for
sure yeah yeah Apple still hasn't come
out with its own social network so yet
if they did it would be subscription a
hundred dollars a month so I'm not
getting it would be a really sad boring
chatroom that's not true I would just go
on that chat room as a hello fellow rich
people how's it going from Alex Mitchell
I just started using LastPass is there a
smart tool to help with most hacks what
I mean LastPass is yeah password
managers are really useful I mean if you
want to get the Chrome extension in the
app for it that's also I'd say let's
expand on his shopping list if he's
already subscribed into LastPass you do
pay for that right they have their yeah
they're they have a it's like tiered so
like you there's like free versions of
it too there's if we're just talking
about like password management for as
far as like tools go them you can always
always take the extra step and yeah
Yubikey which is just basically like a
small like USB Drive kind of thing that
like works as a key for your password
like you type in your password and it
tells you like put it in as well Google
has this whole like advanced protection
program that they you can register for
it with that what if you lose the key
I'm sure you can contact Google okay so
it's not like losing Bitcoin where like
you it's just gone
I mean data is money man yeah it's
valuable
Shane Thomas has a philosophical
question if data is no longer private
Facebook Google vault seven and it's a
Equifax IRS OPM etc should our data just
become open-source
no I mean I think that kind of follows
the argument of like if you don't have
anything to hide like you know just show
it out there or anything like that like
I don't know everbody camera at all
times like my name's not private but I
don't go around everywhere if like a
name tag like say hi my name is alpha
ring I was born on this date and like no
only Utah loggers do that yeah you do it
online though I put my birth date no
well some people a lot of people put
their birthdays on Facebook yeah that's
my point though but like that's like
technically not private but my point is
like you don't walk around everywhere in
real life with like hey I'm Ben Rubin
I'm I was born on this date and here's
my social security number Facebook by
the way thinks I'm 118 years old so I'd
roll with that yeah I mean they don't
like check what your birthday is I think
I'm one of several people that do that
where you just put a fake birthday and
so so is there like a black market where
we trade each other's data online like
dark web stuff where sure there's
monetary exchange to find more people's
data to further exploit them yes I
absolutely yeah but I I'm pretty sure
it's like sold in bulk though like it's
not exactly Costco for social security
number nine it yeah because like you're
not gonna buy like one person social
security number on the dark web like
people cyber criminals that like buy
this stuff are using it to like try to
pull off scams of course they're not
looking for you yeah they're looking for
everybody yeah I mean that's that's like
we're like the money is that's why I
like some of them can like come across
like so cheap there's a lot of headlines
I was like oh your social security
number can be sold for like $15 but it's
like yeah but one Social Security number
in a pack of like five hundred or
something like that so like you're not
paying $15 for like one Social Security
number that's not really how it works
right easy ideas is that it's just like
drive-bys where they get well that's
that's what like spam and phishing and
that kind of thing is that you said that
like they're they're pretty they seem
they seem pretty amateurish sometimes
because the idea is just to like hit as
many people as possible
I like and and if it looks really
professional that's like I mean that's
kind of what happened with John Podesta
and that was like that they've been
calling that spear phishing now where
like their specific
targeting like a single person so what
they had done for him was that they
created a page that looked exactly like
a google-like login page down to the
point where like they had his email
address already like filled in or that's
why he thought that it was like his
email page because this email was
already filled in there and his login
photo like you know how you have an
avatar for goop for like Gmail so like
his photo was already in place there
they set up the page that specifically
to make it look like it was made that
was his page like so that's like
spearfishing so pretty sneaky sis yeah
but like considering that though how
many of us are really that important
that we would get hit with a spear
phishing attack is this something that's
actually like on the rise for I don't
know John Q public I mean I don't know
if like the average person would but I'm
like if you're saying how many of us I
think as journalists like you're
probably much more liable to be a target
that's right I'm not thinking about it
from yeah from us as in us in the room
more that like you know people in the
general public is not really on like an
issue that's on a lot of people's radars
but I would still like we're like
explain to people that they should be
cautious about stuff like this like you
know look at the URL that you're
clicking on Google's gotten a lot better
at that we're like they'll tell you if
you're going on a page it's like not
really a Google like site like that
claims to be like it's a Google site or
anything like that so that's like yeah
it's not it's not a common issue for you
know people that like don't have to
worry about like Russian spies trying to
find out what's in their email address
but I mean you know like these kinds of
things like do evolve and like people
should be aware of them you seem to know
an awful lot about this I'm gonna tell
us something no I just get paid to do it
for a living
never cyber security he's the guy to
talk to
alright we are down to the 11th hour
let's go lightning round on a couple of
last minute questions from pas booba is
there a new privacy clause in Gmail in
the new Gmail I think I got that over
the weekend oh yeah that's part of the
gdpr stuff oh yeah ever so if you've
been noticing a lot of emails lately
from like every online surface you've
ever signed up for sale under privacy
policy that is because they've had to do
that too
meet European regulations with the
global data protection regulations or
something like that so the EU has
actually set forth new data policies
that basically say like your privacy
policy has to be a lot clearer like this
is this has to be stuff that people can
actually understand people have to give
their consent to for you to like harvest
their data and stuff like that this only
applies to the EU but you know as it
turns out there's a lot of companies
that do operate in the EU we are getting
some of those protections yeah I mean
you one from Twitter and from SoundCloud
and from a bunch of others yeah the idea
is that like even like they're changing
it for like the GDP our standards but
the idea is like okay well if we're
doing that for like the UN we're just
there for everybody so it's kind of like
when California changes their emission
standards car manufacturers basically
have to obtain nationally yeah because
so many cars are sold in yeah for it
that's a good analogy
that's pretty sweet so I'm basically
getting GDP our protection yeah even
though I'm in America so Facebook has
done it a little differently where
they're like they have different privacy
policies for like different regions so I
think we're using the one that like
Ireland is using right now that's good
but there have been other companies that
like just straight-up have stopped
service in the EU because of that we're
just like you know what if we can't if
we can't keep our privacy policy the way
it is we're not gonna do it anymore
screw this wow that was really helpful
and informative
that this guy knows a lot of stuff we
should talk more about the thing that he
covers then Alfred will you no no no
that was really helpful to spell it out
that way cuz I was kind of curious as to
why I was getting all these update
emails even though ultimately no I don't
uh yeah well at least you're getting the
TLD it's it's just covering their ass
which is fine mm-hmm okay before we let
everyone go Michael Brown says I have an
unrelated question if Apple has such a
strong stance on privacy why do they
continue to allow Facebook or apps and
companies that share user data to
install on their iPhone devices
consumers and analysts claim having an
iPhone gives them special privacy
features but then they turn around and
install Facebook Instagram Google and
etc I mean like they want to sell their
phone
it's a it's a good point from Michael no
ever privacy is in your own hands
not only that but like nobody's gonna
buy an iPhone if you can't download
Facebook or Instagram it would be way
too or restrictive I would argue if
Apple was gonna kick out so many
different yeah at ease I think Apple is
making it more so from their own
perspective like we don't take your data
like we're not the ones like doing it
but if you choose to like put Facebook
on it like we're allowing you to do that
but like you should know that like
you're like your data's going to
Facebook so it's like Facebook takes
your data but like we're not we're not
good guy yes yeah there's probably a
good way to think about it that's
actually a good way to end it oh yeah a
little bit of a think piece to kind of
go out on okay unless you want one more
Michael Browns got a fun one here it
says on a scale from zuker burg to
Edward Snowden how much do you care
about your data by way of social media
and apps ooh that's a good one
why don't snow turns on Twitter and
though you didn't go with that cardi B
that's somebody right sure person where
she's holding you it's listening to
somewhere in the middle I don't know
anyway thanks fine 3:59 podcast is
