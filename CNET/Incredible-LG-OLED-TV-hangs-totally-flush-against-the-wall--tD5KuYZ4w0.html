televisions I've ever seen I've been
going to CES for a long time David Katz
mine for CNET this is LG's w7 OLED
television the W stands for picture on
wall that's right this TV is so thin
hangs on the wall like a poster you see
it here on LG's demo wall we actually
pull it away from the wall a little bit
it's slightly flexible it's not designed
for curved walls or anything but that
just gives you an idea of how thin it is
this is a 65 inch size here it's
actually two point five seven
millimeters and thin with this extra
little bit of mounting material around
it's three point eight five millimeters
thin and it weighs just 18 pounds for
the 65 inch set so how does anything
connect it's got this little ribbon
cable running out of the bottom here and
that connects to this dedicated sound
bar the TV comes with this sound bar the
sound bar actually gives you Dolby Atmos
surround sound and LG says it sounds
pretty good it doesn't include any
surround sound speakers or anything like
that but it should be a pretty good
solution if you're not super intense
about the sound and you go around the
back you can see this sound bar actually
has all the connections on it and the
power so the TV itself doesn't have any
connections on it no HDMI slots or
anything like that it's just run
directly from the sound bar up to the
television the course the cool thing
about this besides the design is that
it's OLED LG's OLED TVs have the best
picture quality we've ever tested we
expect this one to be superb now LG
hasn't told us how much this TVs going
to cost I expect to be around 10 grand
for the 65 inch size availability is
pretty soon they're actually gonna show
up in Best Buy's in a couple of weeks
and they're going to be on sales and
general public starting early in March
that's a quick look at the w7 OLED TV
from LG I'm David Katz pine for Cena
