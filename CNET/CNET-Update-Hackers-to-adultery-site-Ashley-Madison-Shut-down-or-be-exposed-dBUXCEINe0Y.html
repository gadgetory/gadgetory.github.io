secrets of millions of people that may
have cheated on their spouses I'm
Bridget Carey this is your scene that
update it was only a matter of time
ashleymadison.com a dating site for
married people seeking to have an affair
has been hacked the site which sports
the motto life is short have an affair
claims to have more than 37 million
users and all those people are now at
risk of having their details leaked
online that includes photos
conversations and credit card
transactions the hack also involves more
than just Ashley Madison parent company
avid life media also owns the hookup
sites cougar life and established men
and data from those two are also part of
the hack first reported by cyber
security journalist brian krebs the data
stolen includes details of users and
financial records some of this data has
already been leaked online but the
hacker or hackers involved have posted a
statement threatening to publish a full
list of the customer details unless the
websites Ashley Madison and
establishment are both shut down the
hackers criticized Ashley Madison for
allegedly line about a service that
permanently erases your profile details
for a twenty dollar fee this scrubbing
service fee promises to remove your
entire history on the site but the
hackers claim the company didn't fully
delete everything credit card
transaction records with names and
addresses still remained intact the
lesson here is that nothing you do or
say online is ever private now let's
lighten things up a bit and move on from
adultery to Angry Birds how's that first
smooth transition next week the game
angry birds will launch its first sequel
game maker rovio announced Angry Birds 2
will launch or shall I say slingshot
into app stores on July thirtieth in the
universe of these furious valves there
have been ten different spin-offs such
as Rio star wars Stella and transformers
but this is a straightforward sequel and
it appears that it's soft launched in
Canadian app stores disguised under a
different title Angry Birds under pig
struction several videos of this pig
struction game are on YouTube and they
show the same artwork and characters
that you'll find in the sequel promo
arch some believe there will be more
this game than just a nap because rovio
is holding press conferences next week
could Angry Birds to tie in with
physical toys to unlock extra features
but if angry birds is at your speed
there's a more simple online game to
satisfy your procrastination needs
comedian and soon to be CBS Late Show
host Stephen Colbert created his own
text-based adventure game online it's
called escape from the man-sized cabinet
and it's sort of like a choose your own
adventure book if you feel inspired by
this tale involving centaurs and magical
daggers well you can make your own text
based game just like this with an online
program called twine you don't need any
programming knowledge and it's free try
it yourself at twat Nuri org that's it
for this tech news update there's always
more at cnet com from our studios in New
York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
