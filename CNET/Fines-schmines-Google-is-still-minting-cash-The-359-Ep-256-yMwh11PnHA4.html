yes we are with a returned Cadillac of
equipment in here so bear with me while
I get used to the new setup and before
we even get going BVG here just wants to
say thanks to all of you guys who have
been staying loyal and hanging out with
us and making the company think it's
worthwhile to give us new equipment to
keep trying to make the show better on
the show today we've got the illustrious
Ben Fox Ruben and Dan the man Ackerman
it's because I just watched good morning
Vietnam and Robin William introduces the
the next producer of the show is dan the
man Levitan and that's a lot of stuff I
would have also accepted can plan flam
no but it's it's a good nickname
either way for today we're gonna it's
it's like now earning season so we're
gonna get through a couple of the major
earning season big names Google was last
night we'll also talk a little bit about
billionaire Twitter with Muskaan's
Zuckerberg trading barbs trading barbs
is a good way to say it over artificial
intelligence also Dan was on CBS this
morning talking about implantable RFID
chips we'll talk a little bit about that
and if we have time we'll talk about
some notes as well which is looking for
donations so it doesn't shut down we
started the four minutes yet we haven't
even started our minutes yet but I'll
get you out of here soon enough not to
worry
as usual sending your questions and
comments BBG we'll get to the best ones
at the end of the show without further
ado let's podcast here we go in three
two
welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Ruben and
with me today is special guest Dan
Ackerman heroic tech reviewer and author
of the Tetris effect why thank you yeah
thanks for being here
my pleasure first up alphabet Google's
parent company last month was hit with a
massive 2.7 billion
dollar antitrust fine in Europe but the
search giant is strut shrugged off the
problem and still ended up making gobs
of money last quarter does this it all
surprise you
oh no because we've talked a lot about
how X percent of every online ad now it
goes to either Facebook or Google and
the interesting takeaway from this for
me at least was that that the revenue
per click is going down but they've
revenue overall for Google's online
advertising is going up so it's such a
scale issue that they have such gigantic
scale they don't need to worry about the
actual per click revenue on on desktop
in particular going down how much do you
think people should be concerned though
that Google is now so dominant just like
Facebook not only anomaly and
advertising but also in just like search
where this is how you find what you need
on the internet that they're just gonna
have too many of those levers of power
and they're gonna favor their own stuff
that's how they ended up getting trapped
in the e usage well it's very hard to
not get trapped by by EU regulations
they're sort of all all encompassing all
over the place but this is why we
invented the term too big to fail mm-hmm
well I do be over Google it'll be fun I
mean it's a perfect case it's a perfect
use case for it do you think anybody
could catch up to Google and search like
this Microsoft do search even to search
even matter that much anymore or is it
every other business that's important
cloud services personal software
services you know all these other things
YouTube yeah YouTube you don't think you
go oh it's a search engine you know yeah
the everything company just like Amazon
just like it is everything store so next
moving on billionaire Twitter is all
aflutter yet again today during a
facebook Q&amp;amp;A Mark Zuckerberg on Sunday
called it quote pretty irresponsible to
trade quote doomsday scenarios about AI
Elon Musk who's raised concerns about
this in the past shot back on Twitter
today saying sucks quote this is not
very nice understanding of the subject
is limited okay I mean like I understand
that talking about billionaire Twitter
especially because like Donald Trump is
now president and you know he trades
barbs with folks everyone this is
this is now what Twitter has turned into
by now to be fair Zuckerberg didn't say
this on Twitter he did it during a
Facebook live from his own backyard
while having a barbecue responding to a
viewer question right about the state of
artificial intelligence and if it's
something we should be concerned about
you know who's basically saying he took
a more positive view this is the state
of our conversation though it's the Star
Trek view where the future is actually
good and positive and technology means
good things for people
look I'm not suggesting that a
four-minute podcast is the best place to
adjudicate these issues to adjudicate
like whether generalised AI is going to
dominate us or not but I don't know that
Twitter is either so it's a great place
to fire off a 3 a.m. tweet whether
you're complaining about your Attorney
General or the CEO of Facebook hey it's
it's great for everybody
also Dan so you were on CBS this morning
this morning talking about RFID chips
implantable RFID my my talking head
popped up for a few seconds this morning
in a report about a company in Wisconsin
that is offering employees optionally
the option to have an RFID chip
implanted in their hand and you can use
that in place of your ID card to open
doors to log into your computer to buy
stuff from the vending machine
in the office or to use the copy machine
and it's been done in Europe a couple
times it's really kind of a publicity
stunt because this company three square
they make vending machines basically so
it's you know they I get that it works
for their business model they want to
encourage this sort of thing imagine you
go up and buy anything just by swiping
your hand but you know what you can't
earn you know location tracking on your
phone off if you want to you can leave
your ID card at home and you know you
can't take this thing out of your hand
without is voluntary right it's fine but
what happens when it goes from voluntary
to well you don't have to but company
culture strongly recommends it I find
this highly highly troubling I so do a
lot of people and I feel like that's the
natural reaction you know when they come
to chip you yeah
last just wanted to mention the longtime
debunking websites knope's is in a bit
of legal in a bit of a legal tussle and
it's asking for donations to stay
float good news it's already hit its
goal of raising $500,000 on a GoFundMe
page but if you want to throw them a few
more bucks go for it anyway if you want
to read more about these stories check
us out on CNN I'm Ben Fox Ruben and I'm
Dan Ackerman thanks for listening we
have a good question in the chat it's
not entirely relevant to everything
we're talking about today but excuse me
I'm having a hard time reading at this
point for some odd reason sir Rob Sharda
what do you think about Google Android
octopus oh the enjoyed oh is that really
the new name now okay I know it was like
an easter egg convinced we're convinced
it is maybe it isn't
it's an octopus even if you coated it
with sugar is not candy as far as I
could tell maybe it is in in certain
countries but I think that they're
probably gonna go with Oreo
I think Arthur post was just like a fun
little way of a use do they use it I
guess they have used kind of license you
know trademark names before they use
white cat right
whoo owns Oreo why wouldn't the biscuit
or EOP I got it fake why wouldn't they
be all over or something like that
well here's like when they wouldn't let
Steven Speilberg use M&amp;amp;Ms and et and he
had to switch to Reese's Pieces instead
and look what it did for that brand
oh my guess is a true movie story this
is why I eat Reese's Pieces to this day
I thought that to really say this is why
you have me on here so I can give you
this 80s movie licensing trivia either
way I don't think it's gonna be octopus
but their's is entirely possible that
they decide to switch things up and go
with something what percentage of people
are gonna get on their phones within the
first year or so anyway fragmentation in
Android is so out of control you won't
have octopus Oreo whatever that's an
exciting new play you know they're
experimenting it's like the weird potato
chip flavors that they keep coming up
with octopus Oreo there you go done all
right so coming from Michael Brown our
old buddy Michael Brown welcome back how
is it that Google is hit with an army of
finds whereas apple doesn't gonna be
that Google is still
not so great at businessing that's it
I don't know you want to jump in on that
one that's it that is a very good I
think Apple gets a lot of grit they have
a lot of problems I think with their
Irish tax situation Rex but they're also
not in as many businesses as Google is
in terms of the person tracking and and
the advertising and it's very difficult
to not run afoul of European regulators
who take a much different view of
Commerce and the rights of companies
versus the rights of individuals then we
have here in the US and not only that
Apple their biggest business is
smartphones and in phones they are still
I think they're number two to Samsung
and Samsung and Apple both have so many
competitors so it would be hard
I mean I'd want to look into it a little
bit more so it's a very good question
for Michael but mostly the fines are
about information tracking and and and
how these are resolved yeah this one in
specific I think it was around shopping
results okay Google favored its popular
sites or services versus competitors
with Apple it would be a little bit
harder for them to do something like
that because they don't control the
market as much as Google does in certain
areas before we go ahead and move on to
some more questions I actually have one
Dan this whole microchip thing is
creeping me out to no end you're gonna
use on Friday so get ready Thanks it's a
Star Trek discovery tie-in okay everyone
on the future Enterprise is gonna have a
hand wave door open implant chip okay so
the door doesn't open for you you have
to wave your hand because right you
don't want to cling on get in there my
thought is that though like would you do
this if was an option just being the
more tech savvy of us here today I think
I'm more tech savvy sorry we're
definitely not doing because I'm aware
of what that entails you see people
getting paranoid about RFID chips going
back years you know someone's gonna come
up behind me in the subway and have a
scanner in their pocket and get up you
know bright close to my pocket so it's
not just the it's not just the receivers
that you know about it's the ones that
you don't know about right and that's
why they sell those ridiculous like
line passport holders to put your RFID
chip passports in well one of my primary
concerns with that too and we were
talking about this yesterday was how do
you how are you supposed to update it
granted I understand that RFID chips
don't really change yeah and I don't
think the data is carried on the chip
it's more of a signifier to to summon
your cloud data aid that being said
technologies always improve you will yes
five years from now you probably would
want to change it and let's say
something goes haywire with it gonna
have to go to your doctor to fish the
damn thing out and replace it that just
sounds like a bad idea to the court I
mean they've been doing it the pets for
years though that's the thing what they
use the pet technology on you maybe you
want to think twice about that I am NOT
a pet yet you know you know you know
you're AI super how would AI is gonna
make you their pet and then they will
chip you Oh God and then then Zuckerberg
will be don't the AI will be chipping
here we go I was wrong muscles right
welcome our robot overlords you have to
say that every once a while just to get
it on the record officially do not like
this podcast anymore this is freaking me
out
calling out to the chat who would
volunteer for something like this do you
see potential benefits in your lot in
life would this actually be that
beneficial to you we got a horse if we
got a hard no from Danny Green of course
Danny Green what's up man and to expand
on this imagine soggy asks any way of
turning the implanted microchip off
seems like it's been around for five
plus years with loveseats
let loves good question imagine saggy
but it's a really good question I
because I mean so I saw Scott Steiner
brought something by the other day that
I was looking at and it was a wearable
on the same idea but that's an on
case-by-case foreign voluntary opt-in
situation but the idea of this like wave
your arm open the door that's awesome
having it under my skin not awesome
implantable bracelet in general
implantables have been used for medical
reasons like a pacemaker or I don't know
like a hip replacement what-have-you
where you basically need it to continue
to live or to substantially increase
your mobility this is the bodhrán
t-shirt workplace efficiency no no keep
track of how many copies you make on the
office copier that says
an office copier I'm not used I've been
you 12 years I've never used a copy
machine at this office you're very you
don't believe in dead trees I I just
don't believe in in in photocopies I
don't know I just wonder it like would
that cause complications with other
electronics all right set off metal
detectors would you scrub MRI machine or
you can screw up your phone like you're
tired yeah I've thought about that is I
would you get a bluetooth drop out right
and somebody's like what's going on he's
like oh that's me I'm paired to my hand
phone sounded wrong I take back the
common first step on the slippery slope
towards transhumanism yep which I
believe Elon Musk also warns against yes
look I
Elon Musk and I think Bill Gates and a
handful of other important tech
billionaires have all talked about the
fact that generalized AI could end up
being a problem they've presented all
these doomsday scenarios I get it that
Mark Zuckerberg is trying to say like
listen stop acting like chicken little
about this whole thing but like once the
cats out of the bag the cats out of the
bag so like let's go back to great
technology futurists of the past like
James Cameron mm-hmm James Warsaw who
foretold this very eloquently in in in
his classic work The Terminator
mmm-hmm that is where we're headed
according to Michael Brown it sure is he
says I know I wouldn't I'd prefer
ambient computing with my natural
biometrics eyes singing voice he says
the moment we start adding Hardware
within ourselves for non health reasons
I think that's a step towards a dark
place that's right right great
transhumanism the merging of man and
machine right I mean like the probably
beside legs and Logan yeah pretty much
yeah I've seen that yeah thanks to the
spoiler
I can't believe trailers I'm pretty
impressed that we merged those two
completely separates our video what are
you waiting for I actually have I just
haven't watched oh my god I can't get
through a movie of too old oh my god it
takes like four nights to watch one
movie I watch one movie all the way
through this weekend and I greatly
regretted it was no Island Skull Island
the King Kong movie was Samuel Jackson
it's
and low-key it's enjoyable the whole
thing is a waste except for the after
the credits scene which which redeem the
entire it's due fee but it's fun and
it's the one of the better did you see
the after credit scene to me I was like
yeah I I literally give a little fist
popping money right there yeah okay back
to the Q&amp;amp;A actually on that note we have
a few newbies in the crowd today
first and foremost shout out to all our
regulars Danny Michael imagine soggy so
on so forth
but we want to welcome folks like Caleb
into the show he's asking what exactly
is this about how do we describe this
wait white podcast it's too late no no
new faces new voice you for coming we
our podcast we're a podcast we do
podcasts no other casts spotting things
we do the tech news of the day I mean
like but look it's it's the dead of the
summer so we kind of sometimes take the
opportunity to talk about all sorts of
stuff like I don't think this Wisconsin
RFID chip thing is particularly new but
it certainly is an interesting topic so
and we had somebody kind of look at it
firsthand here yeah oh we lost them
these two right here at this point
slacking I'm tweeting on two levels busy
writing stories let's move some bucks so
Kaitlin truce effect where we're a
podcast you started as an audio podcast
which you can still subscribe to in a
number of different platforms but we
figured hey why not turn this into more
of like a morning show we're not well
I'm not gonna say we're not doing
anything here anyways but in the scene
at New York office we're in early we got
good stories to ramble about it kind of
gets us a warm-up for the day and then
we like to invite you guys in to hop
into the chat and hit us with Q&amp;amp;A and it
really gets all of our brain juices
flowing first thing in the morning
mm-hmm so thanks for comin if you count
eleven a.m. is first thing in the
morning well which I do frankly we're
we're strategically trying to span the
the time zones bicoastal yes Michael
Brown says movies like transcendence
come into mind which is a great movie
but nanotechnology is awesome but freaky
yeah absolutely all this stuff is coming
I mean that's the thing and luckily it's
humans that are creating it right now
situation when robots started to create
other robot raise their own implantables
for you yeah they tell you it's optional
but give you a little robot wink oh
don't worry it's optional right and how
do we know Mark Zuckerberg isn't a robot
already he was replaced back in 2004
yeah this is suck 2.0 yeah it's like the
Paul McCartney uh you know conspiracy
theories the Paul is dead theories where
he was replaced by a look-alike oh right
oh yeah it's the same thing who was the
walrus yeah yeah yeah I got the cover of
Abbey Road he's barefoot and everyone
else's shoes on I know
cigarette yeah I'm you thrown some good
references out today history repeats
itself the world of our spa lies and
duck mm-hmm
Josh says I would want to be able to
take off my connected device when I want
to disconnect and snap your head right
Yeah right exactly if we're putting
chips in people anyways why not have
like modular body parts like the what
was the glycan Motorola phone the
modular yeah so you chop your hand off
and then you just go to the Apple store
and buy a new hand I mean if I seen hook
have you seen Dustin Hoffman and you're
holding your eyes it really works you're
just holding it wrong right Michael
Browns asking how would chips
help CNET dan no floor that one wait you
mean like plantable chips like Doritos
every day I mean there was different
companies have this idea that if you had
this it would replace that little mag
stripe ID card to use the swipe into
your office wipe out access to your
computer but it was it works it's not
hard to use yeah but I can steal you but
I could hard time yeah yeah I could
steal your card you could lose your car
my hand that's true listen once we're
chopping off hands it's it's you know no
holds barred there yeah yeah they always
say oh you got your fingerprint lock
it's biometric it's very secure it's
then they're taking thumbs mm-hmm what
happens when it's the whole hand yeah I
mean usually it's supposed to be a live
thumb though it needs to be keep it warm
for a while I've looked this up I mean I
gotta clear my history I've done this in
like Mission Impossible Minority Report
or something it's really like it starts
once you talk about biometrics start
getting really morbid
because they're like alright how do we
get the body parts so that we can sneak
in yeah right no thanks
and on that note it's probably a perfect
place oh yeah to conclude for the day
and unfortunately for the week this has
been a great test drive no wait aren't
we back tomorrow right tomorrow we are
back tomorrow tomorrow as well
tomorrow's well I can't think tomorrow
is Wednesday yeah
one more we aren't in on Thursday though
sorry folks but we will be back tomorrow
and then week following we're back full
force full force day week I like Howard
Stern yeah sorry
we're big shots we're big shots we can
do what we want either way thanks for
putting up with us during the hiatus and
we're really happy to get back into gear
here yeah definitely my like script
isn't up so I'm just gonna have to wing
it the 359 is available on iTunes TuneIn
stitcher SoundCloud feed burner Google
Play Music and of course on cnet.com den
Ackerman thank you very much for being
my because you're working the controls
