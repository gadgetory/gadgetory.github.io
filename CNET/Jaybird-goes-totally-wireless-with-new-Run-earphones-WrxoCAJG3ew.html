wireless earphones that are Jaybirds
sports-oriented
answer to apple's air pods they retail
for a hundred and eighty dollars and
come in two color options there are
noise isolating earphones which means
they're designed to fit snugly in your
ears and seal out sound
to that end j-bird provides a few
different size sports fins and ear tips
including two larger size tips with an
oval shape I was able to get a secure
comfortable fit with the largest tips
and the earphones were relatively easy
to pair with both an iPhone and a
samsung galaxy s eight plus each
sweat-proof bud has a single button
that's used to pause play in skip tracks
and turn end calls and access Siri or
Google Voice assistant there's also an
app that allows you to customize your
sound settings you can use this single
bud for making calls and runners who
want to be able to hear the outside
world for safety reasons may also want
to use a single bud for music listening
I tested both a black and white pair of
these in New York City and encountered
some occasional bluetooth hiccups when I
was walking with them in the busy
streets filled with people and cars
however on my runs in the park and using
them at home the wireless connection was
rock solid sound quality was quite good
for this type of headphone they're
pretty open and there's plenty of bass
in a decent amount of clarity I thought
they sounded better than the air pods
particularly in noisier environments
battery life is rated at 4 hours of the
earphones come with not only a carrying
pouch but a charging case that delivers
two additional charges to bring the
total up to 12 hours of battery life
it's also worth mentioning that a five
minute charge in the case will give you
an hour's worth of battery life thanks
to the quick charge feature overall
except for the minor New York City
interference problems I encountered I
really like these run earphones and
think most people will be able to get a
snug comfortable fit that's crucial to
delivering maximum sound quality truth
be told it's hard to go back to Jaybirds
corded wireless headphones after using
these I'm David Carnot for cnet.com
