things digital conference where we're
doing a quick look at the dell streak
which dell showed earlier today now this
is going on sale in europe right about
now this weekend and then it's going to
be also available in the u.s. shortly
july timeframe and that's via AT&amp;amp;T in
the July of timeframe on dell com okay
and so this is kind of bigger than a
phone but not quite a tablet what do we
have here well this is what you call the
largest device that's an Internet device
that fits in your top pocket and that
was really the whole design point
obviously is a great productivity tool
corporate email corporate directory
getting your calendar on their great
speaker phone so great multimedia device
we just demonstrated hdmi out so you can
actually put it on a big screen well
then it's a great kind of internet
device as well and you know i'm on this
thing basically all of the time just
pulling up the browser let's see what i
want to pull up here is pull up see if
msn alright pull that up and see what's
going on here so you know full web
browsing just just small enough to fit
in your hand that you can use it as a
phone yep great community apps get on
youtube you know Twitter your Facebook
doing it real time while you're
traveling absolutely a kid magnet as
well great games on here the ability to
watch different TV shows be able to pull
up different stuff a lots of different
versions being worked on a version here
for the US market as well as versions
for the Asian market and so full web
browsing not things like flash that we
wouldn't expect on a phone you'll
actually see flash on this device in q4
of this year so along with other Android
device rest is there anything specific
that you guys see as a real key
application for this or kind of
everything you might do with the phone
and everything you might do with a web
browser if this is the right size for
you I think one of the thing
really cool is the front-facing camera
well so there's a camera on the back in
another one on the front there's a 5
megapixel camera on the back there's a
VGA camera on the front so you can
actually sit there and use it from a
point-to-point video perspective what
you think is a really neat application
that you can do with this device that
you can't do with others do you think
more people will be deciding on this as
opposed to their regular phone or in
addition to it I actually believe that
this will be something that people start
out with its saying hey I want to go try
that and then I think they'll be like me
over a period of time and I think it's
such a great device that you can
actually eliminate other smaller and
larger screen devices and just carry one
thanks so much you're welcome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
