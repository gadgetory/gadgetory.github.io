levy and welcome to rumor has its
special year-end show where we round up
the biggest tech rumors of 2012 and then
we look forward to the rumors that may
come true in 2013 without delay the
biggest rumor of this year an apple HDTV
though there's little evidence so far
that this thing is actually in the works
the rumor that it could be released at
any moment have persisted all year to
recap briefly before his death Steve
Jobs told his biographer that he had
finally cracked the code to simplifying
and reinventing your television since
the biography came out last year we've
been waiting the most recent rumor from
The Wall Street Journal reports that
apple its longtime manufacturing partner
Foxconn and television maker sharp are
all collaborating on this project even
this rumor suggests that it's only in
the early testing phases but if true
2013 does seem like the earliest that
will see Steve Jobs is last product gift
to the world the most obvious of the
2013 apple rumors is about the iphone 5s
of course it seems like the iphone 5 was
barely in people's hands before rumors
of the iphone 5s already started
swirling according to analysts the next
iPhone will launch in june or july with
the new super HD camera and screen a
better battery and NFC technology
finally it also could potentially have
up to 128 gigs of flash storage and it
could come in different colors there is
no doubt in my mind that the iphone 5s
will be released next year sometime
after q2 that's just what they do agreed
people that are on the S track of iphone
iterations will be very happy with the
improvements and people who just got the
iphone 5 like us will just be happy to
wait for the iphone 6 and maybe
grumbling a little bit too next up
android fans like our fiance's have
their panties in a twist over the rumors
that samsung galaxy s4 is coming out
next year on the one hand we have to say
of course it is that's how this works
bones get better new models come out but
knowing that doesn't mean we know when
the phone will come out or what it will
have recent rumors from a Korean site
suggests that we'll have a 5-inch screen
and a 1080p HD display benchmarks on
Nina mark site suggests it will run
android 5.0 but will only be 720p our
producer Sarah and I have money that
will see it at Mobile World Congress in
Barcelona at the end of februari which i
think is too soon next my favorite of
all the rumors next generation consoles
from Microsoft and Sony these rumors
heat up and then die down almost as fast
as we can report them it is obvious
there will be new consoles but we just
don't know when or what for the Xbox
most recent speculations are that it'll
be ready for the 2013 holiday season as
for features reports include connect to
point o a blu-ray drive an enhanced
controller and an AV port for watching
and recording broadcast TV shows
basically it's going to shoot unicorns
out of its but rumors were the ps4 have
it coming out during the holidays next
year as well as for features they range
from excellent 3d gaming at 1080p to the
games coming out on blu-ray discs or as
downloadable content like with the PS
Vita what we do know is that the current
gen consoles have been around for almost
10 years and although they're excellent
perhaps it's time for a refresh our
final rumor development next year is uh
necessity that the super crisp 4k TVs
will be commercially available for a way
way lower price current Sony 4k TVs
start at $25,000 what else can you get
for 25k a car a wedding a home movie
theater a down payment on a house 25
MacBook Airs Oh for that matter 25,000
hamburgers from the mcdonalds dollar
menu yuck ok young now we saw the first
4k TVs at CES earlier this year and
everyone went goo gaga over their life
like picture quality that was like
looking through a window personally my
vision is so imperfect but I was
incredibly underwhelmed or maybe you
weren't standing at the right distance
CNET's Jeff Morris and writes that your
eyes have a finite resolution and at the
distance that most people sit away from
their TVs it's unlikely that you'll even
be able to tell the difference huh
finally our comment of the week comes
from Garf no tea or garfin OD who writes
of the rumor that iOS will be getting a
Microsoft Office app my biggest problem
with office on mobile devices is this
description model I do not like paying a
monthly fee to use an app give me free
or premium not freemium or subscription
here here that's our show everybody
please share your rumors that rumor has
it at cnet com or call us at 1 800 750
cnet and tweet us happy holidays
everyone and have a great new year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
