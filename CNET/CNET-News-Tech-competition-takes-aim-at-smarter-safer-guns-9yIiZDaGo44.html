public shootings are still regularly in
the headlines while many look to
government to pass gun control
legislation one organization is taking a
different approach and trying to
innovate their way to a solution part of
the beauty of innovation is it's a
political and cuts right at the core of
the American process we're believers in
free markets a group of Silicon Valley
entrepreneurs is tackling gun violence
with technology the smart tech
foundation is lined to create for
incentive challenges these can be
thought of as X PRIZE like challenges
where we foster innovation through
grants and prize money the first
challenge is on smarter safer firearms
what does the smarter firearm look like
it may resemble the spy tech seen in
films ossipee PKS 9 millimeter short
it's been coded to your palm prints only
you can fire it that's it there
everything from biometrics like the gun
seen in Skyfall to dynamic rip
recognition turns out that how you grip
a gun is rather individual similarly
bullets could become smarter by placing
small electronic devices micro devices
with information itself it can figure
out whether or not the person using the
firearm is authorized the smart tech
foundation says future challenges will
focus on other areas such as Community
Safety and mental health one possible
application is the nature of how people
play video games there nor muscular
visual coordination can detect changes
in brain performance that's been shown
to detect concussions initial evidence
around detecting abnormal cognitive
defects others in the tech industry are
also exploring gun safety German company
ARMA tix has developed smart system a
gun and watch pair that incorporates
radio frequency identification or RFID
the gun only fires went in range of the
watch SST recently launched ShotSpotter
site secure which could be used in
airports or schools it utilizes SSTs gun
fire detection technology to determine
the location of shots fired and then
automatically notifies
unfortunate not only could the shave
minutes off the response time it could
give first responders valuable
information such as the whereabouts of a
shooter gun proponents have also made
technical advances in the past year in
the spring defense distributed
successfully fired a plastic gun made
with a 3d printer trackingpoint
integrated sensors into a rifle greatly
improving a user's ability to accurately
shoot a target from a thousand yards
away so you can place a lock on your
target it will persistently track that
target as it moves and it will give you
the velocity of that target up to 10
miles an hour and allow you to make that
shot on that target while it's moving no
matter what form gun safety takes its
success depends on firearm users it
doesn't make sense to create a new
gadget a new firearm itself that nobody
wants and so understanding the existing
customer needs understanding the
requirements for the marketplace itself
are really important and that's why
we're leveraging firearm industry
experts itself to help us guide and
shape the nature of the innovation the
smart tech firearms challenge begins in
January participants will be competing
for a million dollars and Counting in
