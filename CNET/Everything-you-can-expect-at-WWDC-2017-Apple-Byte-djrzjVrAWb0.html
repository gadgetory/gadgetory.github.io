welcome to the Apple buy for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
this week it's all about everything we
expect to see at the Worldwide
Developers Conference on Monday June the
5th and are you all ready for this now
I've got to say this is one of the more
exciting WWDC s to me because we really
don't know too much about what's coming
the iPhone 8 is Apple's worst kept
secret and we'll find out more about
that in September but at WWDC 17 Apple
has a real chance to surprise us now
taking center stage will be Apple's
operating systems and iOS can give us
some insights into what the iPhone might
be doing but we haven't seen or heard
much at all so here are some of the
things that I hope to see in iOS now the
biggest focus come on it has to be on
Siri Apple had the first phone with the
voice assistant with the iPhone 4s back
in 2011 but what has happened since then
an AI that really didn't get much
smarter over six years incremental
feature updates and integration with a
few third-party apps finally just
happened but the fact is Google Amazon
and Microsoft are better and Apple
completely lost its lead and has to do
better like a whole lot better now WWDC
is really where they can start it needs
to be a whole new Syria not just a voice
assistant with a few tactile features
which is what they've done in the past
the ecosystem hooks will be nice but it
needs to be a completely smarter and
better Siri that basically doesn't feel
like today's Siri at all but the product
that could really surprise you're with
Siri improvements is Apple's rumored
Siri based speaker reports say the
device will feature excellent sound with
seven tweeters and a subwoofer with
apple's premium feel and you know what
their price tag ching-ching Apple leaker
Sonny Dixon says it will take design
cues from the Mac Pro and have a concave
top with controls and a mesh speaker and
added Apple marketed as a serial play
device that will carry some form of
beats technology now Phil Schiller
recently criticized the echo and dot
products because they don't have screens
which tells you he believes the iPhone
is the best assistant and he makes a
good point
except Siri in its current state just
isn't good enough now you can't even do
multiple timers with Syria right now did
you guys know this so let's say you're
cooking them
that typically requires multiple timers
for different things Siri can handle
only a single one that needs to change
okay let's get back to iOS 11 stuff dark
mode was rumored back in iOS 10 and
never came to be so come on let's bring
it on in iOS 11 that's an easy one
there's also the fact that the iPad has
a split view that makes it more useful
so why not bring some of that flavor to
iOS 11 which will be perfect with the
new big screen iPhones and this Apple
still really believed only people with
the iPhone Plus Sizes want to use their
phones horizontally I want horizontal
support for all phones and dear lord
please bring landscape mode to the music
player already come on now when we're
talking about iOS 11 we have to talk
about the iPad pro I know it's a pipe
dream that will most likely never happen
but this concept video for Mac stories
shows us dragging and dropping
capabilities the access to a shelf for a
copy and pasted content and even better
file management with a finder type
layout for the iPad pro this is really a
dream come true people told me after I
first showed it to y'all keep dreaming
so yeah I will and will multi-user
support ever see the light of day for
the iPad puh-leeze is 2017 Apple alright
reports claim there's a strong chance
we'll see the new 10.5 inch iPad pro
that's similar in size the nine point
seven inch one but with a bigger screen
due to its smaller bezel will most
likely see an improved processor better
cameras and possibly a second generation
Apple pencil all right you know there's
new bells and whistles for watch OS and
TV OS but again on the software side a
lot has been kept under wraps so it's
really up to Apple to WoW us there now
Mac OS will forever live in our hearts
mark oh yeah
but another WWDC means a new version we
haven't heard a single nugget about the
new Mac OS so not really a single thing
not if we know there will be an update
so we'll see how they might take
continuity to the next level and we've
also heard rumors since last year of
group FaceTime video calls can you also
make that happen already
thanks Apple and the last piece of
hardware we're expecting to see updates
to the MacBook family bloomberg reports
Apple plans to announce a new MacBook
MacBook Pro and possibly even a new
MacBook Air
now the MacBook Pro is expected to get
the faster KB Lake Intel processors the
report says Apple is also believed to be
working on a new version of the 12-inch
MacBook with a faster Intel chip that
has yet to be revealed now sales of
Apple's cheapest laptop the MacBook Air
still remains strong and Apple is
considering keeping it alive with an
update as well so look at all this
that's everything we expect to see at
WWDC obviously new iOS Mac OS watch OS
and TV OS as for hardware its new
MacBooks and MacBook Pros the reveal for
a potential 10.5 inch iPad pro and
hopefully an update to the 12 point 9 so
I can replace my stolen one hashtag
first world tears plus the potential
chance of seeing an all new product by
Apple with this series speaker now all
these things could make this a real
interesting WWDC 2017
but you can watch our live coverage of
the event as cnet.com like we do every
keynote on Monday June the 5th all right
that's going to do for this week there
will be plenty to talk about next time
