all-new Nighthawk are 7000 802.1 I see
Wi-Fi router phone Netgear but before we
get it you know one things about
netiquette you don't know that is a
company cannot make up its mind in term
of its AC Wi-Fi routers sighs that's
right I'll take a look at this one right
here is the R 6300 the first AC router
from Netgear is a very good router and
is huge and then it makes this our 6100
here
very decent one but it's a runt in terms
of size and then now we have the our
7000 and you guessed right it huge
okay in fact maybe is a biggest router
I've seen and there's more to it
it comes with 3ds hachbach antenna right
here and when you put them on you
actually definitely the biggest router
I've ever seen and take a look at this
adapter right here is large okay I had a
hard time firing the woonsocket to plug
it in because so big now on the bright
side if you hold like this it looks just
like a stealth fighter hence the name
Nighthawk in facts so cool like I
couldn't happen to get a second unit so
it can fight with myself doc fine style
you know also the router is well
mountable which the other two are not
and finally is baked for some good
reasons now the first is this is the
first router that actually come with a
very powerful processors a dual core
that run at 1 gigahertz also come with
two nephew to Sigma by AB RAM and some
flash memory for storage too and finally
is the second router on the market that
support the new broadcom Wi-Fi chip that
offered the turbo qualm technology
second because the first one is the asus
RT AC 68 you that i review a few days
ago so go check it out
now the new chip is really cool because
make is rarer here a true dual band
router this made a few thing number one
is support all existing Wi-Fi client on
the market regardless of there
standards and secondly when you use it
with AC client it offer up to 1.3
gigabit of Wi-Fi speed and here is a
kicker when used with the legacy 802.1
and client it offer up to 600 megabit
per second
it's like a new speed for the old
standard on the front the router has a
bunch of LED light to show the status of
the power the internet the port on the
back etc now on the back it comes with
one one port and four LAN ports all of
them are gigabit there's one USB 2.0
port here and that's one USB 3.0 port on
the front now I like this port because
it's fast but it's kind of awkward
because you have something sticking on
the front all the time when you use it
now in my testing this router here is
actually very fast offering the top
speed of some 60 megabyte per second
that is sustained willwill speed and
it's close to Gigabit Ethernet really
impressive indeed it also offer
exceptional range and come with many
features such as a built-in Open VPN the
first in Netgear era
it also have a new quality of control
service that can manage both the
downstream and upstream and listen to
this it's also obviously support
third-party firmware such as needy wrt
so if you're looking for an advanced
rather to geek out on from day one this
is it another good thing about the
router here is that is not too expensive
costing just $200 that is quite a bit of
money but actually twenty dollars less
than a Sue's car apart now the ASU's is
actually a little bit faster and more
compact however now for more on this one
check out my full review stay calm and
don't forget to follow me on Twitter
Facebook or Google+ you find out that
I'm actually very set on size to say the
least
not because I'm dumb no and this has
been the first look at the Neihart our
7000 Wi-Fi router from net here
