exclusive first look at the Philips
clear.led this is a design oriented bulb
that's made for exposed aesthetics you
want to have the sort of bathroom lights
that shine out the filaments exposed
this is the bulb that's going to mimic
that it does that using this sort of
crystal light crown in the middle of it
that going to catch the light from the
LEDs and send it sparkling out sort of
like the old filaments of days past now
this is a 40 watt replacement bulb that
uses six watts to put out 470 lumens
worth of light that gives it an
efficiency rating just under 80 lumens
per watt which is pretty good that's the
same wattage as you'll see from the cree
40 watt replacement although the philips
clear puts out an extra 20 lumens that's
also a little bit more efficient than
the standard philips 40 watt equivalent
LED which puts out the same 470 lumens
using 8 watts so how does the philips
clear compared to the cree 40 watt
replacement and the existing philips 40
watt replacement in terms of light
quality well let's test them out take a
look so here on the left we've got the
cree 40 watt replacement LED moving here
to the middle we've got the philips
standard 40 watt replacement and then
over here on the right is the philips
clear so looking at these three bulbs
all together we can see that they've got
a nice 2700 k across the board we've got
warm incandescent light from all three
of them and the other thing that you
notice right away is that the clear
exposed aesthetic of the clear LED
really stands out in comparison to the
standard Philips and the Cree the kind
of bathroom light look of that exposed
bulb over your mirror works best with
this bulb I think this is probably the
bulb that I'd want in my bathroom the
other thing you might notice is that the
films clear looks a little bit dimmer
than these two and that's not the bulbs
fault it's actually the European version
of the bulb that we're looking at today
the US version not available to us yet
and there's something that gets lost in
translation when it comes to brightness
from Europe to America so it's a little
dimmer than it should be we expect it to
be brighter when we see the US version a
little later this year now Philips isn't
releasing pricing or exact availability
info on this bulb quite yet we'll keep
you updated on that front but all
they're saying for now is that it will
be available in the US and in Europe by
the end of the
years so stay tuned for more here on
CNET appliances I'm Rui Crist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
