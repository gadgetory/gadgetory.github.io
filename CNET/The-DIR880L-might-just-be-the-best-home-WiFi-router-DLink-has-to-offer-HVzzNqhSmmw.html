dir 8 8 0 L router from dealing this one
here is the latest AC 1900 Wi-Fi router
and that means a true dual band router
which offer the top speed on the 5
gigahertz frequency band of 1300 megabit
per second and top speed of the 2.4 band
of 600 megabits a second now of course
you need the clients of the same
standard to offer that high speed but
this router here support or existing
Wi-Fi router on the market now I know
most home is actually use the router or
gateway from the internet provider well
this one here is example why you should
get your old device for one is very easy
to use it comes with these label right
here that show the pre-configured -
Wi-Fi networks
it also can fire on the other side of
the router and that means that's all you
need to make it work this plug is one
port right here to your broadband modem
such as this one right here and you are
old set a number 2 which is very
important that it's very fast in my
testing is one of the fastest on the
market offering the sustained real world
Wi-Fi speed up some 525 megabit per
second on the 5e good band on the 2.4
gig and it offers some 160 meters per
second which is also very fast and one
more thing is very important it also has
very stable Wi-Fi signal I put this one
here in a stressed after 48 hours with
multiple Wi-Fi clients and it did not
disconnect once that is very impressive
now apart from the one port there are
also come with four Gigabit LAN ports
there's also an USB 2.0 port on the back
here and USB 3.0 port on the side you
can use these port to host a printer or
an external hard drive and when you do
that means the route here become also a
NASA or providing the story for the
entire network now in my testing with a
purple drive via a gigabit connection it
offered the sustained speed of some 45
megabyte per second for reading and
almost a 30 megabyte per second
while writing and that means if you have
some casual file sharing and media
streaming this rarities or unique plus a
large external harddrive now the new
d-link bearing here is not perfect
first the top here is a fingerprint
magnet look at this mess right here it's
all come from Jim who's standing over
there now it's not his fault though
because he's never touched the router at
all but that's how strong it acts like a
fingerprint and second this used to be a
strip angle port right here takes a long
time to recognize a hard drive one
plugged in in fact if you're impatient
just use the important back here instead
and finally the router here comes with a
totally new web interface which is not
exactly a bad thing
but if you are used to previous d-link
router you have a hard time figuring out
where things are at froze at least I
personally though like the new interface
quite a bit for example it come with is
very nice and network map right here
that show the connected clients that you
can actually interact with okay I can
also move from one section to another
very easily using this pop down menu
without having to dig through you know
different level of menus and also like
other routers from dealing this one here
come with a support for dealing cloud
service that allows you to actually
monitor your whole network when you are
away from home via the my dealing portal
website there's also a mobile app for it
called mydlink Lite so you guessed it I
like this new router here and I think
it's totally worth the current price one
hundred ninety dollars in the US for 135
pounds in the UK for more check out my
full review at cnet.com you know is a
great router one of the best on the
market and probably the best from
dealing no Joe I'm serious as I always
am that's because I'm dumb low and this
has been the first look at the dir eight
eight zero l AC 1900 Wi-Fi router from
dueling
are these concierge I love</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
