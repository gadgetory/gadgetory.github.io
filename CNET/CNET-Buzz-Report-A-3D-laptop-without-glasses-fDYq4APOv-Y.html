report the show about the tech news that
everyone is talking about this week the
age of the cyber cold war is upon us
some new blackberry phones failed to
make a splash and Hulu is just going to
make its own TV damn it but first it's
the gadget of the week the gadget of the
week is the toshiba qosmio f 755
glasses-free 3d laptop whoo it won our
best of CES award when it was just a
little prototype baby and I have to
admit I'm kind of surprised to see it
all grown up and headed to market it's a
high-end core i7 machine to start with
but then it has stereoscopic 3d that is
you don't need glasses to watch 3d
movies play video games or whatever also
it has this built-in I tracking
technology so it uses the webcam on the
laptop to track your eye movements so
it's delivering a 3d picture everywhere
you look just like the entertainment
industry is hoping it's actually pretty
impressive technology but I have to
admit that using it in real life sounds
like a headache waiting to happen they
should give about bottles of excedrin
with every purchase is that sending the
wrong message anyway look for our full
review when it comes out in about two
weeks and now for the news Vanity Fair
broke a huge story this week about a
high level hacking operation called
Shady rat the story details five years
of cyber attacks hitting 72 networks in
14 countries stealing everything from
secret UN data to private companies
intellectual property to government
secrets to athlete doping records a
security researcher at McAfee has been
tracking the attacks since 2009 he says
it seems clear that a nation state is
behind it which of course leads other
experts to the only obvious conclusion
must be China
and US government officials say shady
rat is just more evidence that we need a
strong cyber defense policy and network
here in America to fend off these kinds
of attacks yeah here it comes I'll come
on I've kind of missed the Cold War
haven't you do you think the Millennials
will have to do nuke drills where they
hide under their desks or just learn how
to unplug Ethernet cables real fast good
times in other slightly hacker related
news you know that study you've been
seeing everywhere about Internet
Explorer users having lower IQ scores
than other browser users yeah the one
you promptly sent off to all your ie
using buddies because you use opera and
you're at the top of the heap it's a sad
but true the report supposedly came from
Canadian research firm optic want but as
it turns out there is no such company
many many members of the media however
including myself fell for the story and
reported the research with I must admit
a tiny bit of glee okay what do you want
from me I mean if they'd said it was a 0
l users it would have been obviously
fake too easy but internet explorer it
just it sounded so true so now I feel
bad for mocking them so completely and
for that IE users I apologize Oh
apologize it means sorry also this week
Research In Motion announced two new
incrementally improved blackberry torch
models and real release dates for it's
very incremental II upgraded OS
blackberry 7 and no one seems to care
like not at all oh I care rim I'll be
your friend when no one else will oh god
no I'm not gonna buy a blackberry I mean
I'll come to your birthday party you
need a cupcake I'm not afraid and
hideous and it looks like hulu has also
been thinking huh TV what are how hard
it is to do that right hulu announced
its first full-length original show
Morgan Spurlock's a day in the life the
six-part documentary from the Super Size
Me ohter will follow various notable
people through the course
a day the first episode will feature
Richard Branson others will feature
will.i.am comedian russell peters and
other relatively well-known people who
are kind of also fans of the internet
Spurlock I'm right here alright finally
it is time to get happy with what's
clogging the tubes this week a mariachi
band serenades a beluga whale at mystic
Marine Life Aquarium in Connecticut and
it's awesome on so many levels
still having a bad day yeah I didn't
think so and that's the buzz report for
this week everyone I'm mollywood and
