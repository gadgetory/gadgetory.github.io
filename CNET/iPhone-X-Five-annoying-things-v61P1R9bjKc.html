over a month now I think it's the best
iPhone and heck I think it's one of the
best phones I really like its design and
I've come to appreciate its interface
too that doesn't mean that there aren't
annoyances and here are some other ones
that I still think are there even after
a month these are the top five and what
you can do about them mostly face ID
just works but sometimes it does it and
that can be annoying it's hard to tell
when that's going to pop up and that's
the challenge face ID works with a lot
of things that you put on your face
including glasses hats beards etc and it
works in complete darkness but distance
factors in so if you have it really
close to your face face ID may not
register you if you hold it farther back
it will also make sure you're not
covering your face and you have to look
at the phone more often than you
normally would
unless you've deactivated attention in
settings which requires you to look at
your phone to unlock it also if you want
to be able to unlock a little bit faster
you should swipe up before face idea is
finished unlocking which seems to speed
the process a tiny bit or maybe that's
just me basically your mileage may vary
control center is so hard to get to my
favorite feature in iOS control center
which used to be a simple swipe up is
now a swipe down from the top right
corner of the iPhone 10 and I still
haven't gotten used to it it's hard to
reach and even with reach ability
activated which brings the iPhone screen
down by half it's still hard to get to
and you have to be able to use your
probably your other finger to control
things like Bluetooth settings or Wi-Fi
but remember music controls can pop on
automatically from the lock screen when
music is playing and there's a
flashlight button on the lock screen and
I guess you could also take advantage of
widgets by swiping over which take care
of some other shortcuts too
what happened to my battery life
percentage the iPhone 10 display has a
notch on top which actually doesn't
bother me much after a month it doesn't
cut into most apps however it does cut
into the amount of information you're
going to get at the top of your display
that factors in for things like
battery-life percentage Bluetooth
connectivity or whether your phones and
do not disturb mode to get that you've
got to swipe down for control center
from the top those pop back up but
otherwise you're in the dark can we
please have an iOS update that brings
that back how do you restart your iPhone
10 that is a good question in case your
phone freezes you're probably gonna want
to know it's kind of like the Konami
code now you've got a press up then down
on the volume button then press and hold
the side button until the phone restarts
it used to be a lot simpler and if your
phone freezes you're probably not gonna
remember that code so write it down
somewhere or remember it plus it's still
pretty weird that turning off the phone
and holding up for too long could
accidentally trigger an SOS that calls
911 the line now the iPhone 10 has a
great way of navigating on the bottom of
the display for flicking away apps and
for multitasking it works really well
except that there's now a bar that shows
up in just about all apps that's
supposed to indicate they were able to
swipe there I don't really need it but
you can't get rid of it
worse it sometimes cuts in apps layouts
when you play video the line generally
disappears but with some apps it still
shows up and landscape blocked apps make
that line it shift to the side of the
iPhone so - so swiping up to get rid of
the app you're gonna have to swipe from
the side it's strange it's very strange
all that being said the iPhone 10 is
brand new and odds are the future
updates of iOS are going to address a
lot of those quirks overall it's great
it's just that there are certain parts
that are a little bit annoying just like
me
