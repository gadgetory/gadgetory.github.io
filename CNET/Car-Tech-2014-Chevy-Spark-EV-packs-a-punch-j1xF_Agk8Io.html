electric car the ev1 but it canceled
that program in 2002 taking those cars
away from their lease holders now GM is
back in the Eevee game for the Chevy
spark let's take a look at the 2014
Chevy spark Eevee
Chevy launched the spark is a gasoline
car it's actually a global car so it
looks a little bit funky maybe not
really perfect for American audiences as
he's weird like oversized headlights
it's a four-door although you might not
realize it because it has these door
handles that are hidden in the panel's
here but you'd fit two people out back
here it's not too bad that's got a high
roofline so the cabin is actually not
too bad either you got good Headroom
here and I found plenty of legroom no
problem sitting in here for the e V
version while we've got the charging
port right here we've also got these 15
inch aluminum wheels they used aluminum
to save some weight another styling cue
for the Eevee are these front plates on
the grill obviously you don't need a lot
of air intake for an electric car
they also have some styling along here
that if you know the Chevy Volt this is
fairly reminiscent of that car
none of the hood here we obviously don't
have a gasoline engine we don't have too
much to see exactly we've got some power
control electronics up here and the
electric motor is down there powering
the front wheels most of what's going to
be down here is batteries and there's
about 500 pounds the lithium-ion
batteries in this car that's electric
motor actually makes this spark a lot
more powerful than the gasoline version
with the gasoline engine it's a 1.25
liter it's only about 85 horsepower this
electric motor gives the spark evey 140
horsepower and also 400 pound-feet of
torque
actually GM likes to say it's got more
torque than the Ferrari 458 Italia but
more important the charging port GM puts
us on the front side of the car which is
pretty convenient when you nose into a
parking space this is the standard J
1772 charging plug for a 240 volt source
they'll charge up this car in about 7
hours this is actually the J 1772 combo
plug so you see down here it's got room
for two extra pins that's actually a
very new standard in the louses car on a
DC fast charger to charge up to about 80
percent battery in 20 minutes the Chevy
spark is actually the first one the
first electric car to include this
standard the BMW i3 will have it too
I like it noted decent size a head room
here I'm 5/8 and I've been pretty
comfortable in this space you know few
more inches I might start getting close
to the ceiling we have this nice body
tone metal pattern in here too that's
sort of part of the interior although we
have a lot of hard plastics around -
that's an economy car we also have this
instrument cluster pod here this is just
like in the spark the gasoline version
but in the electric version we have an
LCD panel instead of analog gauges so
that makes it configurable right now I
have it showing kind of minimal
information here on the Left I've got my
range left on the battery on the right a
set of a driving coach this is actually
very similar to what they have in the
Chevy Volt I can push this configure
button on the side here and add
information so I can add a little more
information about the range and I can
add information about the driving coach
I can actually see how many kilowatts
I am expending when I'm accelerating how
many I'm gaining when I'm regenerating
when I'm braking I sort of like the
information screen that gives me the
maximum information maybe that's sort of
a geek thing that you know people that
are into electric cars you're really
going to like to see I also have some of
that electric information on the main
screen here right now I'm on the home
screen I can just push this this leaf
button here which shows me the power
flow situation this will show me when
electricity is going out to the wheels
or when the wheels are regenerating the
electricity to the main battery and as
you can see there's no CD player here
should we got rid of the CD player it's
you know it seems kind of quaint to me
to bring these little plastic discs in
the car to like play music from when
I've got all this music on my iPhone or
maybe on a USB stick I bring into the
car USB port right down here where I can
plug in any music so I can get on my
multimedia I've also got satellite radio
Bluetooth audio of course I got you know
Bluetooth telephone and I've also got
this smart phone link and this actually
gives me some apps here so I've got like
Pandora and stitcher and tune in I can
run those apps if I have them loaded on
my iPhone and the iPhone is plugged into
the car now if I have an Android phone
it'll actually work over Bluetooth you
can also see another app here bring go
that's a navigation app that integrates
with the head unit if I have that on my
phone at $60 for that app so it's one of
the cheapest navigation options you can
just put into a
are without having a pre-loaded from the
factory I found it pimply you're pretty
quick here this car the Chevy spark is
one of the first of the Chevy models to
integrate Siri so then through the phone
it'll actually feed me its turn-by-turn
directions through the audio system I
don't actually have to look at my phone
I can just hear it tell me when to turn
left and turn right and it should
recalculate and handle all that kind of
stuff we've got the shifter down here
this is really just a drive selector
there's no transmission in this car
except for a single gear reduction to
the wheels this car has a sport mode
I've used it it doesn't really seem to
do much I don't know really why they
have that here maybe Chevy's just trying
convince people this is a really fast
car
the Chevy spark definitely drives like
an electric car really just smooth quiet
forward motion and you also feel that
torque pretty heavily it moves forward
is the real authority when you press
down on it it can really take off and
get moving pretty fast too you know you
can also feel that this is electrically
boosted power steering you kind of hear
that that's what a rheostat like
electric functioning they don't really
hide that very well in this car so you
definitely know it's it's an electric
car and the ride quality is yeah I'm
pretty so-so and this is definitely not
you know luxury car ride it's far from
the Tesla Model S the 2014 Sparky V goes
for about $27,000 with government
incentives such like that depending the
attack situation you might be able to
bring that down to say $20,000 which
makes it a pretty reasonably priced
electric car it compares with the Honda
Fit EB and the Fiat 500e they're all
about the same size very different
styles each one personally I kind of
like the Honda Fit evey for its
drivability and its looks and
practicality now there's also the Nissan
Leaf and the Ford Focus Electric but
those are much larger cars those are
more mid-sized cars I'm waiting for the
day when an automaker can get one of
these cars up to 200 miles and that I
think will hit the sweet spot and range
for most American buyers
