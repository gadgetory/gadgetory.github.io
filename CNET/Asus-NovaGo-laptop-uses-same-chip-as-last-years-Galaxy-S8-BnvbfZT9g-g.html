better it's last longer battery life
remains a sore subject for many and it's
still considered a bad idea to head off
on a mission-critical outing without
lugging a power brick along with you a
new breed of laptop aims to change that
by altering one of the most fundamental
things about your PC the processor the
assist Nova Go is one of a handful of
new systems to swap out the usual Intel
or sometimes AMD CPUs in favor of the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 the same chip
found in smartphones like last year's
Samsung Galaxy s8 why do that the
promise is that these laptops and two
and one hybrids will offer the same
Windows 10 you're used to but AD 20 plus
hours of battery life and a phone like
always-on LTE connection there have been
many questions about which windows have
to work on these Snapdragon pcs by
default the Nova go will come with
Windows 10 S which restricts you to
installing only apps from the official
Microsoft App Store fortunately it's
free and easy to upgrade to Windows 10
Pro like we have here I was able to
install the Chrome browser which worked
fine other apps that installed and ran
correctly include Microsoft Office and
the Spotify desktop app but some apps
like some games or benchmarking tools
wouldn't run at all in hands-on use
feels a little sluggish at times but hey
it's basically a smartphone brain
running an entire laptop
unfortunately it's got a pretty premium
price and we're more forgiving of slower
performance in a budget laptop that
costs maybe half as much but if you're
intrigued by the idea of a laptop with
almost 24 hours of battery life well
then you're squarely in the target
market for the Nova go or one of the
others Snapdragon laptops but if you're
primarily interested in the always-on
LTE connection keep in mind there were
many other Intel powered options out
there such as the new LTE version of the
Microsoft Surface pro or you could just
suck it up and tether to your phone like
the rest of us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
