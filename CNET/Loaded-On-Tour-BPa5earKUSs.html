kindle books may soon include
advertising and it may be illegal to
implant a chip on your girlfriend it's
Monday July sixth I'm Natali del Conte
and it's time to get loaded I know a few
Verizon customers who are getting pretty
excited about the new blackberry tour it
launches this weekend and of course
cnet's own bonnie cha has already put it
to the test take a look the tour will
replace the blackberry 8830 world
edition and brings a number of nice
upgrades especially in design the
Torkham buying some of the best aspects
of the blackberry curve 8900 and the
blackberry bold the tour is just a
little bit heavier and bigger than the
curve but it has a really nice solid and
durable build and it's definitely much
more pocket from you than the bulb it
offers a beautiful display it's the same
as the curves and has an extra sharp
resolution so images and texts look
smoother on screen and colors are nice
and vibrant the tour's QWERTY keyboard
is also excellent it's similar to the
one found on the bold but since the tour
is a little smaller in size the layout
obviously isn't as roomy but still the
buttons are a nice size and don't feel
quite as plasticky as the curves the
tour includes Microsoft Exchange of pop3
and imap emails port and and they've
even expanded its I am client list to
include Yahoo Google Talk aim and
windows live like the 8830 the tour is
of the world phone so it ships with a
sim card and you can use it overseas and
get voice coverage and 220 countries and
data services in 175 countries when
you're in the US it'll run on verizon's
3g network and during our test here in
San Francisco this part from offered
great call quality and data speeds you
may soon see ads in your kindle books
amazon has filed a patent application
for something called on-demand
generating ebook content with
advertising the ads would not be static
of course they would change over time
and be relevant to the content that
you're reading so for instance when I
read Angela's Ashes all I wanted to do
was eat fish and chips this would give
me a location where ad for efficient
chips shops should I ever read that book
again a new facebook app for iphone is
on its way although we don't know exact
we won some features will include the
ability to RSVP to events the ability to
create new photo albums and upload
photos to any album a new home screen
better notifications and the ability to
call or text people in your friend list
no push notification though facebook
says that will come with facebook 3.1
which they expect later this summer
reports have surfaced of the new iphone
3gs overheating and malfunctioning and
in some cases discoloration to the shell
of the device in the meantime apple has
released a new support document
detailing the temperatures the phone
should operate in these numbers sound
pretty narrow but the phone should
normally be operated between 0 and 35
degrees Celsius or for us Americans that
works out to be 32 to 95 degrees
Fahrenheit so does that mean by the end
of the summer I should expect my new
iphone 3gs to stop working in this new
york city heat one of the most extensive
Wi-Fi networks in europe is now residing
in venice the city laid 10,000
kilometers of cables which is over 6,000
miles for those of us not familiar with
the metric system the project blankets
the entire city with Wi-Fi at anywhere
between 20 and 100 megs per second the
network cost the city 15 million dollars
it's free to venetian citizens but seven
dollars per day for tourists I think I
need to go there to road test those
beats the Pennsylvania House of
Representatives recently passed a
measure that would ban the forced
implantation of trackable computer chips
in human beings introduced by
Philadelphia Democrat babette Joseph the
law would ban RFID and other chips I
guess they're afraid of big brother like
futures where human beings are tracked
like dogs technology enthusiasts however
are finding more interesting ways to use
these chips like tracking Alzheimer
patients or security clearance for
government workers in the meantime the
law moves to the Pennsylvania Senate for
consideration there's Wikipedia for when
you want to look up facts there's
chickapedia for when you want to look up
information on attractive women now
there's ji acha pedia for you guessed it
looking up information on athletes the
website is the creation of Douglas
Warshaw a former news producer and will
contain not only basic facts about each
athlete but also these jocks every
musing and ramblings like from their
facebook and twitter pages the website
hopes to have
every single athlete in the world on it
sounds useful when you play Trivial
Pursuit and then your friends are into
sports those are your headlines for
today thank you for watching I'll see
you tomorrow I'm Natali del Conte vecina
TV and you've just been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
