at the shape Etienne Peace Pet Expo in
San Francisco and I'm checking out some
pretty cool sony concept devices first
up in the category of don't hold your
breath for these in stores anytime soon
is this very polite robot assistant in
addition to responding to voice and
gestures and looking cute the Sony
Xperia agent has a little screen that
can show you information like the
weather or upcoming events on your
calendar it also has a built in camera
to make video calls
then there's the smart projector that's
meant to be used for much more than just
watching movies with the family the sony
xperia projector has an interactive
interface projection that you can use
just like a touchscreen it can run apps
like a shared family calendar and act as
a hub for your smart home both of these
devices are in the prototype stages
meaning they aren't available for sale
and Sony doesn't have a timeline or
price range for either on the flip side
these two accessories you can buy but
don't bust out your credit card just yet
the Sony smart eyeglasses sell for eight
hundred and ninety nine dollars however
they're not meant for mainstream use
there's no app store for them so you'd
have to make your own app just to use
them some companies utilize the glasses
to help warehouse workers navigate
around their facilities without having
to look down at a map though that kind
of tech would be very useful when
playing Pokemon go sony has no plans to
make the smart glasses available for the
masses the sony xperia ear however is
meant for mass consumption it looks like
your normal Bluetooth headset but it
isn't as soon as you put it in your ear
the smart accessory which works together
with an app notifies you about any
missed messages what's next on your
schedule or even the latest news fully
charged it lasts about three and a half
hours and the case that it comes with
can recharge it up to three times it'll
be available by the end of 2016 but
pricing is unknown</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
