have what mark I'm definitely saving
this to my camera roll for what it's
worth and you'll notice that in the
composer I have those three dots so
tapping on those three dots expands the
composer now I'm going to go and install
giphy because I want gifts so tapping on
the install button takes me straight
into the App Store install it and when i
get it i can actually have access to
millions and millions of gifts in this
case i want to fist i want to share a
fist bump with mark so i'm going to go
and type fist bump and then i have
hundreds and hundreds of gifts of cool
fist bumps and then I pick the one I
want and you'll notice that at the
bottom of that preview there's a big
sent to messenger button and that's the
new optimized flow that we're launching
today so tapping on this takes me
straight back into the conversation I
have with mark so I don't have to fumble
around trying to find who I need to send
that to I'm right where I need to be I
have this big beautiful preview of the
content i'm about to share and i can
just tap on send gift and I'm done and
as you can see he sent me another piece
of content and there are three things
that I want to highlight here at the
bottom of that content one is the app
icon the second one is the app name and
the third one is a reply link so now i
have the legend app installed and that's
why i have a reply link if i didn't have
that app installed it would be an
install link and i could go straight to
the app store and reply with the same
type of content i just received but
since i have the app i'm just going to
tap on reply and now i'm in the legends
app and this is an amazing app that
enables me to stylize and customize text
and add animations and add photos and i
can pick the animation i like and
customize it with the colors i want in
this case i'm going to try to make it as
close to the messenger blue i can there
we go and then hit messenger and I have
this again freeview inside of the right
thread and I can share right there
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
