this is in Concord California a bedroom
community of San Francisco back here in
the Cold War this place would have
ranked just behind France as a nuclear
power by warhead count that's all been
decommissioned and now something of a
different type of intrigue takes place
here teaching self-driving cars how to
drive in the real world now they call it
go mentum station go mentum station is a
2,100 acre test city with 20 miles of
roads dozens of intersections and lots
of real if decrepit buildings all of it
on county land but still secured by the
military car makers like the fact the
roads are rough the lane lines in need
of a restrike
that's great practice for a car learning
to drive itself in the real world and
the part nicknamed bunker city that's
comprised of 100 empty weapons bunkers
with a natural grid of streets between
them one part could be set up as
left-hand-drive america another as
right-hand-drive australia 99% of the
time when we drive on the roads it's
easy driving one percent of the time
something unusual happens so by testing
it go mentum station we're able to stage
those 1% situations on ball running
across the road or a child coming out
from between cars we're able to test
those unusual situations in a safe and
secure environment now how these
vehicles see their way around go mentum
station is many sensors here's a
high-resolution GPS antenna to make the
mapping really precise up here on the
roof is a lidar this does contour
mapping with a spinning sensor that sees
shapes in the world around it and then
cameras have their own unique ability to
not just tell what's out there but where
something is but what's also being
tested here is the early stages of v2v
vehicle-to-vehicle communications or v2
V is vehicles speaking or talking
directly to other cars ten times a
second basic information how fast am I
going what heading am I on is there an
aspect of the vehicle in motion that
needs to be transmitted to another car
and what that does it allows drivers to
be warned but it also allows vehicles to
automatically avoid collisions Honda and
Acura engineers are here now but go
mentum station would like to add more
curious geeks from vehicle makers to
those who may be one one day Google
Apple other men
factures have approached us and we've
taken a look at maybe partnering with
these companies to begin their testing
here at least in California and Concord
at the catechol mentum station for their
part Honda Acura says they'll have this
kind of technology on freeways in early
stages by 2020 and perhaps just 20 years
later Hondas and Acuras that are crash
free as a result in concord california
