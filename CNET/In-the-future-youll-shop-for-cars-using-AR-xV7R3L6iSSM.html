no need to traipse all the way down to
the dealership we're taking a look at
some technology that lets you explore a
car from the comfort of your mobile
device so it's been put together by
Accenture using Google's project tango
which is a rather exciting system for
exploring virtual spaces and objects
using a mobile gadget like a tablet so
what this is doing is rendering a car in
space in this case it's a v8 500 so that
you can check out the outside but the
car is interactive too so if I've popped
the door here we can check out the
dashboard we can even try some of the
buttons and put some music on one thing
I'll highlight that I think is a
particularly cool touch is that when you
get inside the car in virtual space you
can even look out the windscreen and see
people through a virtual glass so a lot
of effort has been made to make this car
as customizable as possible so you can
see how many options you have so for
example we can change the paint color on
the outside we can check out some
different rims as well and you can
adjust the interior also so this AR tech
can obviously only take you so far I
think if I was buying a car I definitely
want to do a test drive first rather
than just examine it in virtual space
maybe that's a challenge more for
virtual reality than augmented reality
anyway that's all for now but check out
