a classic standard of household lighting
but if you want something brighter you
might be inclined to upgrade to a 100
watt bulb the problem most of those 100
watt incandescent has long been phased
out due to rising efficiency standards
that's why we have 100 watt replacement
LEDs they're way more efficient that
they haven't always come cheap the last
time I reviewed them was back in 2014
and back then a single bulb would
typically cost you at least 20 bucks
thankfully things are a lot less
expensive these days a dimmable 100 watt
LED can be had for as little as $5 and
thanks to the fact that they typically
only use about 15 watts they'll save you
a lot of money in the long run how much
money well each one will add about 2
bucks to your yearly energy bill on
average an old-fashioned 100 watt
incandescent would add 12 bucks to your
bill over the same stretch 10 bucks in
savings per bulb per year adds up fast
but that in mind I hit the local
lighting Isles and set out to test every
100 watt replacement LED I could find
here the ones I recommend you check out
for the best bang for your buck head to
Lowe's and look through the utility 100
watt replacement LED you get two bulbs
for less than 10 dollars and they're
surprisingly good performers for the
price utility Tech's bulb was the most
efficient one that I tested it's plenty
bright and it did a nice job on dimmer
switches to dimming all the way down to
an average minimum of 1% about any
flicker I did notice a slight hum when I
did it using modern dimming hardware but
it wasn't loud enough to be a
deal-breaker if smooth dimming without
any of that hum is essential then I
recommend upgrading to the Cree 100 watt
replacement LED it's more expensive 13
dollars per bulb but it dimmed smoothly
on every single switch I tested it on no
flicker no buzz you could also consider
my dimming test runner-up the Philips
100 watt replacement warm glow LED it's
almost as good as Crees at dimming and
it has a longer lifespan to boot if you
want light bulbs that will help the
colors in your home look more accurate
and true
I like the 100 watt version of the GE
reveal bright stick LED which sells in a
2-pack for about $15 it isn't as bright
as I'd like but it does a great job at
making colors pop you could also try out
the Target store brand 100 watt
replacement which surprised me with its
above-average color accuracy one caveat
though neither of those picks are
dimmable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
