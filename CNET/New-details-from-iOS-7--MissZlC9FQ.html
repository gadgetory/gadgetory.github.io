the apple pie for all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple there's still
a combination of happy thoughts and a
lot of mixed emotions over iOS 7 but
that leads to the next question what
will the next gen iphone really look
like well according to Apple Insider
accessory makers are already beginning
to manufacture cases for the company's
rumoured low-cost iPhone using designs
believed to have originated from inside
Apple headquarters now the leak
schematic suggests the low-cost iPhone
will be slightly wider and taller than
the rumored 5s that appears to have no
major design change at all in these
drawings it also looks to be point 8
millimeters thicker than the next
flagship iPhone and the back edges will
be rounded off like the ipod classic now
the alleged blueprints for the iphone
light shows off a single flash LED while
the 5s features a pill shaped flash
that's also rumored to be a dual LED
flash for greater brightness now even
Macotakara showed off a hands-on with a
case from design firm MGM that was made
based on the leak schematics it actually
fits the current iphone 5 but it's
curved edges are clearly meant for
another device I would also never use a
case that uses lime green and due to
brown together now we've seen plenty of
iOS 7 and I still like it I'm a fan even
though a lot of you started using four
letter words on YouTube because come on
I keep it real without the Apple
kool-aid there were words like yeah and
copy and those can be very hurtful now
we still haven't seen Apple released a
beta version for the ipad but that
didn't stop my russian youtube comrade
rosette kid who released the video of
what he claims is the alpha version of
iOS 7 running on an ipad this hasn't
been confirmed as legit but when he
brings up the control center many of the
options like a flashlight or access to
the clock or calculator aren't there
having no flash makes sense since
current iPads don't have one so either
just isn't ready or Apple is holding
back because there might be some iPad
specific features in it like
electrocuting people when they want to
take pictures all right other images
from user Hamza stood show hidden
settings inside iOS 7 that also show off
the potential for multitasking and
navigation gestures including edge and
corner swipes that might be more
specific to a larger screen like the
iPad as well and one last tidbit the
Apple TV gets some new software beta
love as well and it's been revealed that
the iTunes radio service and a new
conference remote is in the works that's
in the future but recently the apple TV
received a software update available to
all of us that adds HBO go and watch
ESPN to their lineup of services you'll
still need a subscription to the
services through your cable provider to
use the apps but it's better late than
never and a welcome addition so you guys
should check that out all right our Cena
team finally finally got a chance to put
the new macbook air through our test it
looks exactly like the previous one so
here's a first look with cnet's own dan
the man Ackerman I've been Ackerman and
we are here take a look at the new 2013
version of Apple's 13-inch MacBook Air
now of course this looks a lot like the
2012 version even kind of the one before
that the big differences this year are
on the inside three main points to keep
in mind the first and most important one
is that this guy moves into Intel's new
fourth-generation core i series cpus you
may have heard of them under the code
name has well and that means faster
application performance although you
know most consumers don't really need
their CPUs to be that much faster more
importantly you get better battery life
apple claims of this guy is going to run
for 12 hours without needing a recharge
you also get an upgrade in the wireless
280 2mm an AC of course you're going to
need one of the new faster routers and
Apple has this built into some of their
hardware as well in order to take
advantage of that but it's a good way to
sort of future proof your setup and
apple claims that the flash doors are
using is also faster than previous
generation even though it doesn't have a
lot of the high-end features that we'd
kind of like like a Retina screen or
edge-to-edge glass over the display or a
touchscreen it's still one of the most
universally useful laptops you can get
and now it's a hundred dollars less
thanks D now apple claims there's 12
hours of battery life for the third
an inch but we squeezed out 14 hours and
41 minutes of video playback it's pretty
awesome all right onto the quick bites
if you haven't tried it out recently ATT
is quietly rolling out support for
facetime over their cellular network and
even for those of you on their
grandfathered unlimited data plan it was
a surprise to me recently so you know
maybe I should take this back from a
year ago this side sucks on the CT nah
I'm not gonna do that I'll write music
fans you'll like this story Kanye West's
latest album Jesus drop this week I'm
not a fan of the name but it's a super
unique sound that I'm feeling but a true
Kanye form you told the New York Times
in an interview I think what kanye west
is going to mean is something similar to
what Steve Jobs means I am undoubtedly
you know Steve of Internet downtown
fashion culture period by a long jump
seriously I do know one thing Kanye SJ
never did this
come get you okay you okay oh yeah those
street signs they just sneak up on you
like that and before we go let's check
out our iPhone app of the week I've got
to say thanks to my producer Jamie for
this one you're welcome Brian but you
Apple biters have to check out dumb ways
to die it's free it's available on iOS
and Android and it's an awesome
cartoonist collection of minigames that
challenges you to do simple tasks under
time pressure to prevent these
cartoonish characters from dying so you
can swat away the wasps or connect
balloons to avoid a train wait seriously
I don't get what's so great about this
whoa yeah add the balloons oh my god I'm
hungry here today yeah go go go Jamie
what is this who's dumb ways to die oh
okay Mia cleared it that is stupid no
one's gonna die like that are you

secret

guess Brian's not here now so why don't
