u.s. currently have cameras on their
traffic signals red-light cameras not
everyone's crazy about how a machine
gives you a ticket how you can test that
kind of ticket or how much of your fine
stays local if you pay it but the IIHS
says large cities with established
camera programs have seen big drops in
fatal red light running accidents as
much as 24% and a 17% drop in all fatal
crashes at those intersections all via
three layers of awareness word gets out
around town that cameras have been
installed scions go up warning drivers
that they're approaching a camera
intersection and should you blow a light
a ticket goes out to your mailbox what
of our integrated awareness could be
coming alleys developed a dashboard
display showing the state of the light
ahead and how long it will be that way
vehicle to vehicle technologies on the
way enabling cars to signal each other
if they're about to intersect either by
a smart intersections as several car
makers have been developing as part of
the crash avoidance metrics partnership
or vehicle to vehicle technology that
Ford's been showing in action and while
these technologies are all envisioned
first as passive warnings it's not a
huge leap to have cars take over the
braking based on intersection conditions
much as they already do based on follow
distance today
clearly better technology than today's
signals and rather primitive cameras is
coming soon in the meantime the
intersection is definitely a place where
it pays to double check</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
