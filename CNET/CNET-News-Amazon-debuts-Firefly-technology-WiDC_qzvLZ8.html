different I got a demo something we call
Firefly for you I think you're going to
like it I am going to go really fast
because i want to show you how fast this
is i'm going to press and hold the
Firefly button and start recognizing
things phone number recognizes a book
recognized as a DVD QR code CD recognize
an earl how about a game what's this
kosher salt look at the bar code kind
bars spot it great family game highly
recommended I have a Nutella lover in my
house and dishwashing detergent alright
so let's pull up the history on those
and take a look I did that fastens you
could see how quick Firefly is there's
that you see the dishwashing detergent
at the top and they didn't tell and the
spot it and so on and we can come down
now we recognize the phone number or
recognize an earl i can tap on any of
these items and there are actions so
i'll tap on the book and you can see i
can buy the kindle edition i can buy the
paper back i can go into the audio book
store i can share with a friend and so
on okay i want to also show you that
firefly can not only see the firefly can
listen as well can you please go ahead
and play that song
sunshine by court yard hounds and let's
look at the actions here you can buy the
mp3 you can buy the CD but you can also
third parties can build actions for
fireflies so here's I Heart Radio is one
example and well I Heart Radio does they
have an action that creates an I heart
radio station using the song that I just
recognized as the seed for the station
let's tap on that let's just do it and
there it is
it's as easy as that okay pause that and
Firefly can even recognize TV shows can
you play that episode please that's not
what happened yes it is they all
attacked me and she threw my sword in
the river liar shut up you know he tells
me one thing she tells me another we
have just recognized we've just
recognized the kingsroad it's episode
two from season one of Game of Thrones
and we haven't just recognized the
episode we've recognized the scene so we
are 49 minutes in one second into that
scene and so now we have all the x-ray
data available you can see all the
actors in that scene one of the actions
here you can quickly just go to the IMDb
page if you want more detail okay
Firefly can recognize something else too
fireflight can recognize art let's try
this cornflowers tap on the action there
we pull up the wikipedia entry you can
learn about the artists learn about the
painting if you pull up the next
painting please man with red hat pull up
that there you go wikipedia info learn
about the painting learn about the
artist one more thing if you pull up the
phone number just if you're walking down
the street you can do this from a
distance to you don't have to beat
doesn't have to be a poster so there I
just recognize that phone number that's
it super simple these are some of the
other I mean they're just tons and tons
of techniques that have to be stitched
together to make this work in the real
world and all of that work on Firefly
all that advanced computer science would
it be completely wasted if you couldn't
get to Firefly quickly so that's why we
gave Firefly a dedicated button
press and hold the Firefly button no
matter what you're doing in the middle
of text message anything anything you're
doing on the phone press and hold that
button even from the lock screen even
behind your pin and bam up comes Firefly
the fireflies could release they
immediately start recognizing that's
really critical because if you have to
you know type in your pin or you know go
to your appt grid find the right app tap
on something and then get it recognizing
there's so much friction in that process
you're just not going to use it very
often Firefly is so easy to access
customers going to love this and super
exciting for us is that we're also
making available a software development
kit so third-party developers can build
on top of Firefly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
