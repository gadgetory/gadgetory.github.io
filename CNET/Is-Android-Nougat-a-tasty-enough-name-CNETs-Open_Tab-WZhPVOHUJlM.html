k mounted hey Android n you know at the
end stands for it's not the nougat it's
what it's not Nutella it should have
been although I guess the Nutella people
were like pay us but anyway I guess no
one knows the copyright the nougat hey
get all snooty sneakers probably has
like a nice young nigga but anyway
that's the new OS is called source
nougat nougat in is creative commons
right off the bat i want to talk to
google right now i got a bone to pick
with you google and I get it I get it
you let me load nougat onto my Nexus 6p
and I thank you for the opportunity to
test drive your beta software but we've
got some problems number one so overall
it is a good experience with nougat I
mean nothing wrong with new year good no
one's ever been like oh this cake has
nougat in it can we just specify to that
nougat can be purchased two blocks away
this is not a plug to our so we got a
great like World Food mark you're in the
pocket of big new game exactly big
nougats asking said but I thought about
buying a bunch of new get to bring on
cuz they make some delicious types of
nougat around the world with nuts and
fruit and what have you i'm gonna eat my
hand right now are encouraging a baby 40
was the last dessert we had in here for
90 s okay cat we do do we have kid cuts
in here oh you mean actual what do you
say is Right Bennett brought froyo for
everyone when he was with HTC for the
launch okay for people know what you're
talking about long time ago oh well
that's when i was android but i would
say i would say if this raises a little
bit more awareness about the
deliciousness of certain types of nougat
yeah to the new guinea veil has been
lifted yeah so wait back to my yelling
at Google so it like I said it really is
it they sped up marshmallow god you
can't sound cool at all talking about
android or less um really selling
masking I sound like a maniac uh so
anyway marshmallow I really enjoyed okay
ah newgate so far so good I have a big
problem with the fact that this it does
it like if I have Wi-Fi on and I leave a
Wi-Fi air
the 4g radio the LTE radio like doesn't
turn on and i have to like cycle
airplane mode for it to pick up LTE
again which is just like a lame come on
bizarre baby maybe it's like why is this
still a thing don't why is that so thing
it could just be me I haven't googled it
or anything I just noticed me it could
also be another half you have installed
let me be conflicted out no that is not
the answer it is nuclear actually have
no other half on your phone nose mucus
south aware where you can ask you at
that directly and it could start to you
mean coalescing answer let's do it let's
try it out you get ok Google what why
are you doing this thing with good right
now it's just searching what I just said
a theory is it called nougat because
maybe all the chunks of nuts and fruit
or like the little things they're
integrating into this into the I'm
overthinking anyway it's good enough to
pay for the rights that enjoys the rest
of his acid trip yeah delicious you have
anything else to say about android
nougat you guys you you've got to play
with us I know like uh so if you're
worried about features the doze mode you
know dozes this is just like remarkable
sleep battery conservation technology
they put in or software rather they put
in a marshmallow it worked amazing you
would leave the phone sitting still
overnight in 10 hours you would get like
maybe three to four percent battery
drainage which is like unheard of
apparently now it's new and improved I
haven't noticed much more of a saving
but I mean if you go over night and only
lose about five percent battery like
that's kind of remark the other state
analysis they let allow you to reply in
notifications which is just basic self
it really isn't a cosmetic design
redesign it's just more of like a zippy
ur performance under the hood sort of
stuff that work on like what version
hardware's will go back to my god for
max I don't know I don't know that
answer ISM is assistant working on that
now like have you tried any chat bot
assistant stuff in messages well I just
use the regular Google person whoever
she is she's she's lovely she's around
she's around she will she responds to ok
Google there's a dad like instant
instant apps ever show up in any
meaningful way that was like I think I'm
talking about but I like
that's a developer thing about but they
have to get on that if they want that to
be a thing answer questions like how do
you that's the biggest question means
like when you have these like how best
to appreciate we're gonna have this
question with iOS 10 yeah how best to
appreciate like all the new features
yeah I don't know what I'll have to see
how it shakes out Carlos seems to be
fond of the name nougat and he's happy
with the brand name right Carlos from
the chat oh that's got okay exits it's
less um it is kind of less cutesy it's
just more weird and gross nougat nougat
okay we're just back to her talk event
which I imagine there might a name
somebody didn't do some Nutella would
have worked better for me there's really
no other candies or desserts to be an
S&amp;amp;S neste but they they're big they're
bigger slice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
