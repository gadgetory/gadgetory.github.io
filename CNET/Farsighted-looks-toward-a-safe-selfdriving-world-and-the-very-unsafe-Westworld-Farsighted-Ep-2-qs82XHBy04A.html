the waning days of November there's just
one month left in 2016 and so far it's
been a year dominated by some pretty
wild politics but if you can get past
all those headlines it was actually a
really big year for the kind of
technology that we wanted to watch
you're far-sighted now I know the events
of 2016 have changed the vision many
people had and there are in their heads
of what the next 5-10 years might look
like in the future but the matter where
your head is at right now one thing 2016
has shown us is that life and say 2026
is a lot more likely to involve
self-driving cars and other connected
technology that will move us and our
stuff around so this seemed to be the
year that this technology went being
mostly hi to dare I say mostly
inevitable you've got self-driving ubers
we've got self driving big rigs we've
got autonomous Tesla's and that's really
just to name a few I had even an even
bigger signal that this stuff is the
real deal comes in the fact that there
is an emerging ecosystem around this
technology and company trying to figure
out how we'll leave it into daily life
and the future in a way that makes sense
and is safe and so for today we've
actually pulled in one of the folks who
is doing that work that you'll probably
appreciated that point too distant
future so please look welcome our guest
there's videos M Francisco fall Sakamoto
the COO of Safari and thank you Eric are
you doing Paul great so this is a
company that's working on all the other
stuff that we need to connect not just
to our cars also to our cities and to
their environment so that all kind of
works together and works this is a fair
description what would you say is your
your fishing over this well on a time
scale autonomous vehicles are great you
know the whole idea of having a bunch of
essentially robot cars but they don't
really become truly fully effective and
well they're all connected if you can't
think of the real promise of having
autonomous vehicles it be not having
them be little islands of self-driving
self-awareness but actually to be
coordinated in their driving so that
they are actually much greater than a
human driver could ever be because one
quick example they come to a stop light
a bunch of cars are stopped and if you
want them to all get going today even if
you have an autonomous vehicle it's
going to wait for the car in front of it
to move before it moves if they're all
connected they can all just take off at
the same time and it seems like a small
thing but if you think about the amount
of efficiency that you gain in both
throughput and safety and especially
energy conservation it's it's tremendous
there's one small example gotcha so I
mean what do you what do you envision
all this technology is going to mean for
us you know about 10 years down the road
are you of the mind that we're going to
do away with you know human driven cars
eventually how how long we look at that
transition or is this more you know just
going to be kind of a technology that
doesn't go Mean Street artist well you
know not only is the market evolving a
lot Eric but also the the way that we're
even thinking about the market evolves
as time goes by and it's very geocentric
for instance you know in the United
States that's going to evolve a lot
differently than it does and say
Malaysia or Japan or some other area I'm
like you can look at the different
regions of the world and you can think
of some places are already very very
comfortable with much more of a public
transportation or mass transportation
kind of mentality and ownership of a
private vehicle is actually something
that is uncommon right and so those
areas we think autonomous technology
will just immediately take off and be of
great benefit and rapid market turnover
in areas like the United States there's
going to be both regional and market
differences you know across the nation
if you can imagine once again a new york
city much more likely to be a rapid take
off san francisco same thing out in the
middle of the United States maybe not so
much because their needs are a little
different and the sort of the market
mentality is a lot different in each of
those areas and maybe actually they're
the real
need to have independent transportation
might be a lot different out there in
the middle of the the Heartland that it
is in a dense populated area and so your
company suvari actually I turned me if
I'm wrong but you you find some sort of
a deal in China right where you go are
you doing up there how's it different
well we've engaged the largest
manufacturer in China which is Shanghai
automotive industrial Corp or as they
call themselves saic so saic is a joint
venture in a joint venture with some of
the major OEM car makers like General
Motors and others to manufacture those
types of vehicles in China both the
brands that I mentioned and their own
saic brand we are using them as our
distributor in China and also as our
partner to help penetrate the Chinese
market which is great because in China
for instance is an example of a
different market you do have to have
some amount of government cooperation in
order to have anything like this be
successful and scic is a private-public
cooperative company sort of a joint
venture company between government and
private sectors okay so so so lay it out
for me what this is going to look like
for example you and I had a conversation
about an hour ago as you're on your way
to see us to do there in San Francisco
you were stuck in traffic and you know
you're talking about the accident it was
in front of you and you can you can see
where everyone else was how is that
journey different in the future if
everything that you guys are working on
comes to prove it well in in that future
let's say it is the 20-26 vision you're
talking about instead of having a sort
of an estimate of time that ends up
being off by a factor of two to come to
San Francisco to make that journey from
Silicon Valley up here the estimate
wouldn't be me an estimate it would be a
direct forecast and be accurate to the
minute you know they're absolutely would
be like a train in Europe or something
it wouldn't be like getting in a car
today and taking a journey I think at a
very high level that the predictability
of transportation the safety of it would
completely change as well as the
productivity because I wouldn't have to
sit there looking at the license plate
in front of me as I'm traveling along I
could be
doing some actual you know work work and
you'd probably have cars there a lot
better at doing their job and I am since
I forgot to introduce everyone else yes
so let's uh let's throw it to questions
you guys these guys I've got this
beautiful pour ce n'est pas si atoms
Steve beach by the grove Jeff Sparkman
and also joining us from Sydney
Australia over the google hangout this
Luke Lancaster I guys sorry tomorrow you
go ahead and jump in um I was wondering
we usually talk about smart cars in the
context of sort of smart cities um at
least when I think about smart cars is
usually in a large group as you were
saying maybe approaching lights or it
part of integrated network and there
have been contest to try and design
smart cities and so on I'm so I'm really
interested in this question of how you
would how you take this technology to to
rural areas and here or in China and
could you say more about that sure the
technology actually applies across all
of these different situations I think
the the way that you would want to
coordinate traffic and use energy more
efficiently or even clear the path for
emergency service vehicles in a city is
fairly straightforward you know you have
control or a priority established
between the car communication and
communicating with the stop lights etc
and also through the traffic management
centers which look like a big war room
like in the movies you know these things
really exist but I think out in the
country it's a little less obvious
sometimes but the way that it plays out
is you know you can use the same
technology to locally broadcast road
conditions for instance we could
actually transmit a condition of ice or
slick road or something that's hidden
from a viewer like if you're traveling
through a canyon road and it's out there
in the middle of nowhere if a proper
transponder was located at that blind
corner where there might be ice and you
wouldn't see it instead of hitting an
ice patch at 60 miles an hour you would
understand you need to slow down to a
near crawl and therefore avoid a
potentially very bad accident one
example there's actually active programs
that are going on now out in some rural
areas to actually have programs we're in
the middle of the United States you they
end up with a lot of accidents which are
believe it or not crosswinds
bellowing semi trucks off the road Wow
and so having a sensor that could
actually say okay we've got a 60 mile an
hour crosswind coming when you come down
out of the past slow it down to about 20
miles an hour and crawl or else you're
going over buddy is a message that could
be broadcast back up the the traffic
chain with enough warning so that the
trucker could avoid that accident by the
time they can sense that on their own
they're already down yeah that's a it's
an issue that's the number of trucks
blown over in Wyoming is tens of
incidents per euro stud yeah I actually
saw a video the other day I was just
watching stuff and it was just a
somebody's dashcam video of a semi in
front of them I just you can just see it
starting starting an engine straight
over yeah that sounds like a problem we
could fix already before self-driving
cars right we just need sensors and
communication well the particular sensor
technology that we use today you know
where we envision a road map of
different radio technologies but the
actual algorithms and the idea of
putting the little black box in every
car actually our box is silver but
anyway you get the idea the little black
box in every car and then they don't run
into each other or they can be messaged
as far as issues go is something that we
could technically do today most of the
hurdles have to do with economics and
regulation and the usual friction to
life that we agree encounter yeah can
you tell us a little bit about the
devices that that pick up signals from
the traffic lights so basically all the
cars are just kind of telling each other
where they are right and then so that
they avoid each other right and then
they also can that helps to to find it
helps to tell a driver where there might
be traffic and stuff up ahead or
something well the the the number one
mission of the vehicle to vehicle
communication or v2v as we call it is to
give each car whether it's being driven
by a robot driver or if it's been being
driven by a human driver about a three
second warning that another vehicle path
is about to intersect it now you think
well a lot of those things you can
already see you can use radar you can't
slide are but specifically because this
technology can cover a 360 degree field
around the car me
that when you're pulling out from say a
blind corner like from behind a van
parked in front of your driveway or near
your driveway or some other time a tight
circumstance it can see around that
corners that's that's the the main
advantage of this is being able to see
around blind corners for safety now for
the infrastructure piece communicating
to the roadside unit that's got a safety
piece which has to do with communicating
conditions as i said but also on more
common basis inside a city like in the
smart city application we're talking
about it doesn't matter if you have an
autonomous vehicle or a human driven
vehicle you can get information to the
driver of the car once again robotic or
human that tells it ok the stoplight is
at this particular phase and it's got so
many seconds to go to either turn red
green amber whatever we can also do the
emergency service vehicle preemption
where you know the ambulance is coming
through shut down traffic on all the
cross streets oh wow which is a function
that once again they can't they have a
rudimentary version today but it's it's
what we call line of sight right there's
a there's a beacon that goes out
triggers the stock the next stoplight
but it doesn't clear the whole road so
as a result you know it doesn't fix the
problem for the whole route to the
hospital the fire or whatever it's it's
a much different you know kind of last
generation sort of technology the those
just a couple examples and and then
there's lots of others you know one
thing that people probably don't know
about is we've already prototyped and
demonstrated with the u.s. department
transportation a cell phone based text
so you would have like a pedestrian
would have a cell phone so here's a
quick pitch for why cell phones are a
great sensor today most of you cnet
watchers listeners if you were to leave
your wallet at home you might not go
back for it if you were to leave your
phone at home you probably would go back
for it because you're in a horrible
state if you don't have your phone so
what we've already done is shown that we
can actually use a phone as a sensor for
a pedestrian keeping in mind thousands
of pedestrians are run over each year
and actually use that to communicate
with the infrastructure and say you're
about to step into a busy street don't
do that and and I think we read in the
paper and one maybe once a month or so
someone does that also we could signal a
vehicle that's approaching that
are about to run over a maybe a
preoccupied pedestrian I'm going to be
generous that's very cool so I wonder if
there's no when you're kind of building
your your environment and of your
network of sensors so that you know
these vehicles are always aware of this
environment of how you kind of build in
some of the you know more unpredictable
factors i'm thinking like wildlife or
you know we also recently published a
piece here on cnet about how a lot of
drivers are excited to self-driving cars
because they want to mess with them excu
with them what cut amount on purpose oh
how do you prepare those kind of factors
well you know my general statement is
don't never let the great be in the
enemy of the good right you know i think
the USDOT is estimating they can cut
down traffic dust by about eighty
percent by complete installation of this
technology we're killing about 35,000
people a year so i think the you know
the twenty some odd thousand people that
are saved that's that's worth saving not
to mention the million injuries but to
back up to those other things you know
this is not a replacement technology for
every other sensor that can go into a
car it's one of a number of sensor
technologies so if you can imagine the
car of the future the 20-26 car that
we're talking about would have radar it
would have lidar which is the laser
version of radar and it would have also
echolocation it would have cameras of
course cameras everywhere probably 360
degrees around the car of cameras and
any other sensor that we can come up
with including this one so that we can
actually have beyond human sense for the
car and I think that that's that's the
car the future so we're absolutely
looking at things like the deer okay the
deer would be pegged not by the radio
technology but it would actually be
found by the late either ride out laser
excuse me the lidar and the radar and
the camera and those three would take a
look at it there'd be what's called a
fusion sensor sensor fusion computing
program located in the the car and it
would make a decision about whether that
was a real image or not what the what
the urgency is and a bunch of other
factors and take appropriate action or
recommend appropriate action if a human
still driving the car so that's that's
the net of it and then this
communication technology could be used
to send that information back to the car
behind you which would be perhaps key
information depending on how tightly the
traffic's packed so it's a you know it's
going to be amazing I'm curious what
this sounds like to Luke I don't know
Luke can you hear me ok yeah ok yeah so
I was told when I was in Australia that
they have a much stronger car culture
there than we do here and here we have
sort of a tradition of driving as a sign
of Independence right and adulthood and
so forth so I'm just wanting what this
sounds like to you Luke um we definitely
do have a car culture but that's because
I guess we've got space of driving um in
a city I could definitely say something
like this especially because we have a
very strong public transport culture as
well um like buses and trains I guess
that would be my question about this
like in terms of shaping public attitude
is it an easier sell to your average
driver to do this as something that's
based around public transport first hmm
you know actually that is something
that's happening now a lot of the early
projects for autonomous driving that
include connected cars clinic connected
vehicles rather are taking places with
like some of the uber pilots and other
things where they're they're looking at
different ways to connect the cars
they're looking at a bunch of a variety
as a technology they're using autonomous
vehicle technologies primarily to
supplant their drivers which are their
cost Center and I think the best thing
about the public transportation is
unlike private ownership you can very
very tightly scope the mission of the
vehicle and that's actually important
for success if you think about it
cutting down the checklist of things you
have to do with an autonomous vehicle
tremendously increases your chances of
success with it and so if you can
imagine i'm only going to do these ten
blocks of downtown san francisco during
these hours of daylight and if it rains
forget it you know it makes it much
easier task to do then then if you're
saying i'm going to let any any Tom Dick
or Harry have their autonomous vehicle
and try to break it which is I think you
mentioned earlier is that something that
people will try to do well you know I
think everyone talks about that guy who
managed
to Darwin eyes himself with the the
tesla car and and that's going to happen
that's going to be out you know i think
it's there i'll be always someone who is
somehow going to overcome the few
thousand PhD man years of work that go
into the safety systems and and then
we'll pack another few years of energy
into it i mean people have been doing
that with like regular cars for years
like Dukes of Hazzard i mean they're
flipping cars over jumps and stuff so
yeah people are gonna do that stuff no
matter what okay for its jet pack yeah
yeah people like to be Daredevils yeah i
think what we're trying to do is we you
know I think it'd be a little ambitious
or arrogant to even say we're going to
eliminate traffic death but we're going
to manage them down a lot you know
that's what some of the major car
manufacturers have been saying though
they want to eliminate traffic deaths
completely by 2020 I think was the year
do you think that's a realistic number
or a realistic year no i think i would
say that there's like what someone says
like that i think is a goal right if you
let me jump sideways clean out attack
and go to management theory but you have
to have a be hag right a big hairy
audacious goal i think that's theirs and
I wish them I'm gonna kind of bet
against him good luck with that yeah but
at the same time people are safer
driving than flying but are usually more
afraid of flying because we don't like
to feel out of control right we don't
like to go I think there's a lot of
people that way but I think it's
changing you know if you look at the
dynamic from say 40 years ago even
versus today I think it's shifted quite
a bit I think when you look at the
dynamic of the desire of the car culture
you know people wanting to have their
own independence and have their own car
and drive it whatever way they please
you know kind of being scofflaws and
saying you know the traffic what is the
speed limit as a serving suggestion you
know that's that's a that's when I was a
kid and now today I have to say
Millennials like my children are you
know the kind of like driving is kind of
optional it you know it'd be nice if I
had a nicer car but frankly I just need
to get from here to there and I think
it's a generation that's much more prone
to start that trend so it to say I
didn't really want a car I want to
transport right and and I think that's a
key market change and it's not going to
happen everywhere
same time it'll be uneven I gotta say I
drove home from tahoe this weekend and I
wanted an autonomous car back yeah I
hired I was like telling my wife I'm
like if my car can drive me like I
wouldn't have to worry about you know
I'm staring off into the woods you know
like the robot wouldn't do that or the
autonomous car when do that would be
paying attention the whole time yeah oh
my god I mean with this plane yeah so I
mean I can't wait I can't wait so we
don't have somebody in the chat room
asking why do we need self-driving cars
in the first place um and saying the
tech has replaced a lot of middle-class
jobs and is this a threat uh what do you
like to just take on that basic question
why do we need these well I mean I've
talked a lot but I continue oh yeah
always yeah so this is something that
you look at in the u.s. maybe there's
three three-and-a-half million jobs that
are directly dependent on driving and
with those jobs be affected eventually
initially there's probably actually more
drivers and the reason is is because you
look at every autonomous pilot that's
come out so far and what do they have
they have another driver actually
sitting there in the the drivers
position ready to take over if the
autonomous system fails you know so
temporarily I don't think that there's
an issue probably for years and years
now eventually there's going to be
certain classes you know when you break
through in certain areas and certain
market segments are going to be affected
more than others you know maybe certain
aspects of long-haul trucking might get
affected but I think to say that we're
going to push back on autonomous
vehicles as something that's going to
reduce a certain number of jobs in the
trucking industry for instance is to say
well why didn't they push back on triple
hookups for trailers right because they
were running one-third less trucks all
of a sudden own didn't hear trucker
strikes over driving that I think I
think you know there's there's all sorts
of issues and I think that it won't be
an overnight thing we're all of a sudden
three and a half million people are out
of a job right I think that this is
going to be a very gradual transition
into each of these segments and you're
going to find that for instance probably
short haul truckers don't get taken over
for years and years and so I think
unlike some other things it's not like a
factory closing yeah right it's not like
saying we're going to move 20,000 jobs
out of Detroit and into Mexico it's it's
a lot different I think it's over time
it changes
which probably doesn't completely fix it
for everybody but I think it's I would
put it in the natural evolutionary kind
of notion of job changes and job market
changes versus overnight someone made a
decision and killed three million jobs
yes a gradual oh yeah any final thoughts
um Paul in terms of not just where you
think we're going with the this kind of
technology in our cars but also in our
cities will you Annette sure uh you know
I think that the by the time that this
actually happens like a lot of things
that we've experienced you know whether
it's consumer items like HDTV and things
we were able to do it a long time before
we had it and I think that that's the
case here we're actually able to do
actually all of this stuff the tech
already exists it's already had millions
of miles of road test particularly the
connected vehicle tech when we pull up a
couple things we already have you know a
thousand of these things installed in
test beds across the United States and
in other places in China and other
locations and this is the thing that
communicates with the car and the
traffic signal or back to the traffic
management center whatever you're doing
and can relay messages around to the
other vehicles in the traffic stream as
to road conditions etc it's called a
roadside unit and these are available
for the you know like a thousand ish
apiece kind of level and the price is
going to go down it's definitely one of
those things that the price goes in half
every couple years and so it'll be
essentially something that's easily made
ubiquitous when we look at this box here
that with is actually not even our
latest one this is the little box that
goes in every car you know the eventual
price of this is going to be a few tens
of dollars that goes in every car so if
you think about the impact to this you
know we a social priority etcetera you
know I'm frankly a little conservative
on that so normally i wouldn't say it
this way but actually it's one of the
few places where government could come
in do a mandate now save thousands of
lives within the next five years and and
they're going to have a tough time doing
it right so the vehicle the vehicle
communication of the vehicle that
everything communication is something
there for a few billion bucks and some
effort we could probably save thousands
wives and if you think about other ways
that we spend money that don't do that I
think it's a shame and hopefully
everyone will kind of start asking the
questions about why we don't and that
plus autonomous vehicles you know let's
think about eighty percent times the
35,000 people in the united states per
year let's think about eighty percent
times the i think it's actually closer
to a couple million people who are
killed or seriously injured in the end
the world in traffic accidents and
taking that number down by even a more
modest amount it's it's actually I think
it's a parrot of that we all get behind
this and and back autonomous and
connected driving and and in the devices
do you're showing us those are going to
be standard in cars pretty soon right
the function will be standard in cars
the fact is that most of the the power
of this is located in a right now say a
dozen ICS and it gets shrunk into a
couple ICS there's some ambitious
projects that have reduced it already I
think very much that the physical
contents going to be subsumed into the
overall vehicle computing and
communication architecture and that the
the remaining thing and one of the
things that we specialize in is actually
all of the artificial intelligence and
the algorithms that determine the hard
part which is you know are you going to
run into that car or not you know think
about being in the traffic jam I was
just Daniel you know we have to filter
thousands of messages per second and
determine which three are the ones
coming from cars that are going to
potentially harm you and and that's
that's the thing that will continue to
evolve also cool wait I'm really glad
that you're working on this and we're
all really excited to see where it goes
and it's great to meet the person whose
gun our safety definitely at hearts 0 or
one of them at least and I wish you
success in that I'm excited to see where
this goes we'll be watching um I think
we're going to take a quick break and
then come back to you to talk about
westworld I don't know if you're a West
world band all the earth welcome to
stick around and join the conversation
or if you need to get on down the road
please feel free well uh thanks for
asking and thanks for having me here
you got it yeah we'll take a little
break and be right back guys still got
Kofi Adams Jeff Sparkman and i am
stephen Beecham there in the studio in
San Francisco and Luke Lancaster joining
us from cnet australia in sydney and so
you know we started off our show with a
few technical glitches but if there's
one place where you really don't want to
run into technical glitches is the world
of Westworld hbo's latest hits sci-fi
series and if you don't know you know
really quick synopsis the basic idea is
an amusement park maybe in the near
future that is populated by incredibly
lifelike robots that you can do all
kinds of things too but in theory or
relatively safe from them as long as the
code remains stable and does it well you
gotta watch to find out that the season
finale is coming up on Sunday and I
think everyone here but stephen has seen
something so this is really just a
seminar to bring Steven up speed yes
thanks no open seen anything an
interesting Lee it's based off a film
the 1970s and tell me you guys think so
you know in the nineteen seventies not
actually a very good film on wood um you
know it's basically more what you would
imagine robots to be in the 1970s just
kind of these metal tin cans with a
really well done um layer of skin over
them i guess and now the more modern
version is you know flesh-and-blood
robots that are basically 3d printed
bank um but i always found it
interesting that the show whereas i
think if the show were based on
something more contemporary see quick it
was just big place virtual reality my
only person who thought that
do you think it's a virtual reality like
a dream the whole shows a dream no the
show takes place in a physical amusement
park like in the West but I think it
takes place that way because it's based
off of 1970s movie when they didn't have
virtual reality back then that seems
like this concept lends itself so much
more diverse reality I love do I have
derailed this conversation Riddick then
if half the point of going this places
to have sex doesn't it make more sense
to have solid object I'm sure if you're
in a solid objects does it or just like
a really really oh really good you know
Bobby suits like I read where if anybody
anybody so okay don't it's all about the
nerves anyway what do you let's just
talk about the show you guys think where
you guys first I'm only caught up there
episode for the whole virtual reality
thing um and I guess this is kind of
what I think about the show as well
there's a whole sort of creating life
element to the people who build a park
and like there's a physicality to that
you know and like they've been making
people essentially so I don't know if
the whole virtual reality think plays
into that no I think I think that it is
fair I think a lot watches logistical II
be so much easier we're literally oh
absolutely get her um I like much easier
to turn off when if if things go poorly
right really spoiling you Luke says it
like he's never seen a holodeck episode
mm-hmm those things never break um yeah
yeah I'm super into the show I'm I'm in
deep we've got like our um water cooler
catch-ups which we haven't had in the
office for ages so then can I ask right
it's like game of throne oh yeah yeah
okay and it's it's kind of the quick
whip around who's up to date who's up to
date so you don't spoil anything so can
I ask you what makes it good God Kelsey
what makes it specialists cuz I'm
hearing a lot about this show people
could tell me I need to watch it it's so
good but I okay i don't i don't want to
sound horribly jaded here but I feel
like anybody who's been reading sign
fiction watching science fiction the
whole lives has seen all the all the
basic plots and questions before like
what's really a person what's really
free will can you really love is it
dehumanizing to hurt in a robot and you
know I mean it just seems like I'm just
wondering what makes this one
particularly great or different or
something um I I don't know if anything
particularly does like I'm a pretty big
sci-fi node myself and they're not new
issues but they're done in a really
entertaining way I guess like it's it's
quite well mate like it's a very
well-made show and it's HBO so the
production value just through the roof
and you know it does a really good job
of hitting that in the serialized TV HBO
format which I think has sucked a lot of
people in and it's it's kinda like the
game of thrones thing that doesn't do
anything you in terms of fantasy but
people have jumped on it because for a
mass audience there might not be huge
fantasy fans you know and it's kind of a
cool aspect of it a meta aspect of it
wish you know it is not completely
unique but the fact that the characters
are you know in a fantasy world within
the fantasy world that you're watching I
kind of find that appealing and it's you
know it's a it's a lot of popular in
kind of prestige TV right now in terms
of this you know constant twists and
turns and uncertainties and surprises
but like Luke said they're just done
particularly well do you guys have
favorite characters are like the first
good sorry I didn't realize you're still
talking this sound is a little bit odd I
was just wondering if you guys have
favorite characters like are you sucked
in on a personal level isn't worried
about the ride the experience I I think
it's more kind of the narrative for me
rather than any specific characters um
like it hasn't been revealed yet but I'm
pretty sure there are several different
timelines happening and it's kind of
piecing that together as the show
unfolds there's really interesting for
me hmm yeah
you know that and that's something I
just ended keen to realize over the last
couple weeks and people had to point out
some kind of dance to this but yeah I
think time is like an added dimension to
the whole thing really obvious and that
there's they're going out of the way to
not being honest we think we're not
quite sure but I've also noticed in
terms of characters and Luke and Jeff
you can tell me what you think but is
another one similar to Game of Thrones
where you're not really sure who's good
or really if there are any any good guys
good gals involved and so far the ones
that do seem to be potentially the
protagonists are worth rooting for also
seeing DB to make just terrible decision
to not be super uh great hmm um yeah
hard to root for many of them absolutely
like paul james marsden every episode
you know put through the ringer on um so
Jeff I think you if I understand right
you um you watch me to the first two I
were your impressions oh I like it a lot
I went and watched another two episodes
last night instead of sleeping and it's
just it's it's interesting just to watch
all of this kind of like unfold and like
unravel but then also kind of like twist
around and and I tend to have kind of a
short attention span these days so the
fact that I was able to keep paying
attention seems like a good thing I just
it occurred to me that like I feel like
Michael Crichton must have really just
hated the hell out of Disneyland because
well I mean yeah because I I was just
trying to describe this and I'm like
well it's it's sort of like Jurassic
Park but with cowboy robots and then I'm
like well it kind of is not the series
but the basic premise of the original
movie and then I'm like well why does
michael crichton have all these like
theme parks that just go horribly awry
like he just had a really crappy time
waiting with the Matterhorn or something
yeah yeah his childhood must have been
pretty interesting so r g makes a good
point in in the camera Tamela Griffis is
kind of why it's hard to find many
characters root for in that show because
you know arm are proxies in the show are
they people that are going to some use
Minh park and I kind of by definition
all self-absorbed rich people so that
you know that that makes it difficult to
find somebody's relate to in the show
for a lot of people but you know I agree
with Luke so you know the production
values and the storytelling still make
it worthwhile so it's been kind of hard
to get invested in the character right
that's kind of similar to the game of
thrones as well right I still haven't
watched it yet given what's game I'm
that guy yes yeah sorry you st. if I was
just saying I'm like the one guy who had
it still hasn't watched it yet but you
can certainly make a great show about
terrible people that's that's no
question about that yeah didn't climb
Tarantino Quentin Tarantino just had a
movie about terrible people all in one
room I forget what it was called intern
Tina a movie you're saying what is it
caught Luke oh no um here like it's very
much an along for the ride show for me
rather than picking individual
characters to root for and I think
that's that's okay because it's not
getting bogged down in a lot of those
character focused moments like it is
keeping the narrative moving even if it
is teasing it out really painfully
slowly you know great I agree um well
you know it's West world and you haven't
check it out I recommend it first season
wraps up on sunday sunday on HBO um
we're bad at a time but before we go i'm
wondering if from any of you guys had
any kind of a pop culture things that
you're you're you're into right now or
that you're looking forward and aviation
if you want to go around the table
anybody got anything just on the way it
note reading east of west a comic it's
kind of a post-apocalyptic thing about
the four horsemen and the end of the
world said in the future it's really
weird but if you're into West world and
also say check out east of west ah where
do you find that uh comic shops
everywhere you know what else you can
find it's a comic book Luke sky one's
called bad guys I do i do write a comic
called the bad guys you should check
that out as well just to shamelessly
plug cool sweet all right anyone else
final thoughts final recommendations oh
well there's a big crossover been going
on this week with the arrow Supergirl
the flash in DC legends so that's
happening and I'm really busy being
terrible at overwatch personally what
about you Jeff um I've been doing a
whole bunch of nothing lately that's
that's my new hobby fine beachin uh I
haven't I have two kids I don't really
have time yeah anything except sleep so
that's about it I don't watch TV really
separators Raiders go raiders in 20 to
26 gonna still be fighting over sports I
I'll give a nod to to arrival although I
would have liked to seen it shortened by
about 20 minutes but I think a lot of
people there into the same sort of thing
we're into would enjoy it so check that
out and as we go out the door i'll also
give shameless plug to a feature i'm
working on for cnet that i spoke to
former apple CEO John Sculley and 41
he's the guy in between Steve Jobs the
two times I if once didn't actually talk
about Apple a whole lot he's working on
some really interesting projects but
also deal with future technologies and
so that will be coming up on seen it in
the next week or so and you want to
check it out if for no reason other than
to hear his prediction of how old
Stevens children will lift the net think
you'll find it surprising and
entire generation not just even children
he is enough even children person so so
check that out and I think that's our
show for today top of the hour it's
probably almost time for lunch in
Australia so I want to say thank you to
Luke Lancaster Australia and also to our
guests home sakamoto from Safari things
so much for stopping by and also for
Kelsey Adams and Jeff Sparkman there in
the studio it's evil deeds behind the
control quality Burk feel better we'll
see you next time this is far sighted
thanks for watching
