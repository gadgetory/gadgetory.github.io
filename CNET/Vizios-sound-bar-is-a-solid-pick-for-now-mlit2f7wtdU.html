we're taking a look at the Vizio SB 40
21 ma-1
this is a budget sound bar that came out
at the end of 2012 and it's currently
selling for two hundred and seventy
dollars if you've seen a vizio sound bar
over the last year or so you're gonna be
pretty familiar with this design it's a
relatively slick look with the glossy
black finish with silver accents and
angled feet at the bottom it's not quite
as slim as some other sound bars I've
seen but it's still gonna fit
comfortably on a TV stand there's a
front panel display which is handy so
you can see what level the volume is at
plus some basic controls on the top of
the sound bar for when the remote goes
missing the included subwoofer is
Wireless which is nice because you can
place it almost anywhere in your living
room although you'll get the best sound
quality if you keep it within 8 feet of
the sound bar it also does need to be
powered so you'll want to keep it close
to some kind of power outlet the
included remote is a cut above the
typical sound bar remote it's got a nice
sizable design plus the button layout is
very straightforward it doesn't have the
neat slide-out panel that videos older
VHT 215 had but it's still overall a
good clicker there's an optical coaxial
and mini-jack input on the back which
should be enough for all your devices as
long as you use your TV as a switcher
there's also a USB port which can be
used to play mp3s although it's a clunky
solution since you need to navigate your
music using the small front panel
display the big missing feature is
built-in bluetooth which is still
relatively uncommon on sound bars but
will be much more prevalent in 2013
based on what we saw at CES built-in
bluetooth is quickly becoming a
must-have feature for sound bars since
it works with nearly any smartphone or
tablet for wireless audio streaming and
it's not an easy feature to add to a
sound bar with an adapter sound quality
is good for the price and the Vizio lets
you adjust bass and treble to dial in
the sound exactly how you like movies
are a strong suit and they can get
plenty loud without distorting even on
dynamic action sequences as you'd expect
it's not as good with music and heavy
roxeanne really reveal its limitations
the videos big weakness is that the
blend between the subwoofer and the
sound bar isn't perfect and when we
compared it to our reference higher SPE
v40 slim the higher really shined in
that regard however that higher sound
bar is currently discontinued which puts
the physios performance in a better
light since it's one of the better
performing options that's still
available on the market and that's
really the main story with the vizio if
you need a sound bar right now this is a
solid all-around choice with a good
blend of design features and sound
quality but if you can wait a few more
months you'll have a lot more options
and most of them will include built-in
Bluetooth so it's worth the wait if you
can I'm Matthew moscovia and this is the
Vizio SB 40 21 M a - wha</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
