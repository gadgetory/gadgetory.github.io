for joining us i'm donald bell and i am
Hollywood welcome to seen its top 10
holiday tech gift list we'll be counting
down CNET's editors top 10 gift ideas
for the holidays these are the hottest
guidance we reviewed here at cnet.com
the place where people go online to
discover the latest in tech and it's the
best place to find everything you need
when it comes to buying it you get seen
us unbiased reviews and thousands of
product ratings from users like you
today we're gonna count down see nuts 10
most popular tech gifts for the season
but since it's only a half-hour program
we suggest you cruise on over to see
Netcom for our complete CNET Holiday
Gift Guide there you'll find the
complete list of our editors picks for
the best giftable tech in every category
and at every price and maybe even a gift
for someone who looks an awful lot like
you that's okay
we won't tell Oh huh meaning I always
tell ya already ready to get this
started
I am let's do this Donald Bell picking
off our top ten list coming in at number
10 is the 3m streaming projector now
this to me is the perfect gift for the
geek who has everything because they
don't have this it's a little portable
video projector that's completely
self-contained built-in battery built-in
Wi-Fi built-in speaker and it comes with
Roku software now what that means is
that you can stream Netflix Hulu Amazon
HBO Go and even CNET TV just through
this little device plus it projects it
it's so small its handheld think of it
as a tiny little TV in a box content
included as long as you have Wi-Fi it's
also great for travel all right let's
not just stop at ten coming in at number
nine on Cena's top 10 holiday tech gifts
list is the audio technica ath and 30
headphones earbuds are dead and
everybody needs headphones so these make
a great easy gift idea especially for a
traveler in your life and these ones are
a great price
just $50 for pretty good performance
they're also an over ear design that's
great for blocking out noise and they're
very comfortable most smart phones and
mp3 players these days don't come with
any headphones and they come with those
little rinky-dink earbuds so these make
a great upgrade all right
we have a long way to go in a short
amount of time so let's keep this train
moving at the great number eight unseen
its top ten holiday tech gift list is
the Panasonic Lumix DMC ZS 20 pointed
shoot camera with so many people
choosing to shoot their pictures on
their smartphones these days camera
manufacturers are really starting to
step things up and this is a prime
example this little point shoot includes
GPS that can tag a location to your
photos and the scene as Josh Goldman
points out the lens is an ultra
wide-angle like a brand lens you're just
not gonna find my own smartphone yeah
that lens especially is remarkable yes
there's the ultra wide-angle which is a
huge plus but it also has a 20x zoom
it's practically a telephoto and it
takes great high-def videos which is
another big selling point now it is
still a point-and-shoot so the image
quality isn't going to be enough for
taking and printing poster size photos
but standard prints and photos are gonna
look great I just kind of wish it had
Wi-Fi almost time for our first break
but before we go as interesting as these
tech gifts are we all know that kids
play a big role in the holidays and we
didn't want to leave them out of the fun
so we asked CNET senior editor brian
tong to come up with some tech gift
ideas for the little one tis the season
to think about what everyone on your
gift list is looking for and chances are
you have some young ones on that list
well there's no better way to show them
that you are in the know then to give
them a tech gift I'll show you a few
great tech products that will pretty
much work for kids of all ages
first up the iPod Touch a lot of the
kiddies want smartphones these days but
you're not ready for your child to have
his or her own phone the iPod Touch is a
great solution it allows them to
download apps listen to music surf the
web and watch videos while leaving you
alone all without running up phone
minutes or data plans next up how about
a 7-inch tablet it's smaller which is
great for the kids and they can download
textbooks play games and surf the web
you've heard of the kid-friendly iPad
Mini but a tablet like the Kindle Fire
HD also has parental controls so you can
feel more secure and even better it
won't break the bank and finally
something for the family and kids the
Nintendo Wii U is the new video game
console this holiday season and it will
be one of the
hottest gifts this year it brings a
whole new type of experience with the
Wii U gamepad it's a touch screen
controller that interacts with your
games in completely different ways that
you just haven't seen before this is the
perfect gift that will make your kids
happy and bring the family together just
like my mama's marshmallow covered yams
e now for more great ideas head on over
to cnet.com for our holiday gift guide
i'm brian tong from seen it and we'll be
right back
some of CNET's top picks for gifts under
$50 are the Panasonic rph TX 77035 seen
at top picks for gifts under $100 are
the Logitech Harmony 650 universal
remote control the Barnes &amp;amp; Noble Nook
Simple Touch and the Apple TV the more
on these products go to cnet.com for a
complete Holiday Gift Guide welcome back
to the one and only cena's top 10
holiday tech gifts list we've been
counting down CNET's editors top 10 gift
ideas for the holidays let's keep the
momentum going coming in on Cena's list
at number 7 is the somos play 3
streaming audio speaker these sono
speakers are on our top gift list almost
every year they are just a great gift
they sound good you can get several of
them to cover your whole house and they
come with free iOS and Android apps so
you can actually control your music with
an iPhone and iPod Touch or even an iPad
or any Android phone or tablet that's a
big deal it's all happening wirelessly
so you don't to worry about special
adapters or extra cables Apple's
changing his connection to standards so
it doesn't work anymore it all happens
over Wi-Fi the next gift on the list is
one for the whole family and it is a big
one number six on CNET's top 10 holiday
tech gift list is the Panasonic TCPS T
50 otherwise known as our editors
favorite overall TV now again nothing
says tech gift for the whole family like
a new TV but if you haven't looked into
a television in a couple years they've
come a long way yep if you've been
waiting to upgrade your TV are waiting
for the prices to come down this is a
slam dunk the picture quality is awesome
deep blacks good colors and it looks
good at any angle our review editor
David Kazmaier seen as TV guru calls
this flagship level picture quality at a
mid-level price
yeah our editors absolutely love this TV
and for good reason it can also do 3d if
you wanted to although unfortunately
it doesn't come with any glasses still a
hot TV Plus this is the first product on
the list that is a sea net editor's
choice
that's the award that we give out very
sparingly to the cream of the crop
products that we review on cnet.com as
we get closer to the top of this list
you're gonna hear that term a lot now
here is something that I'm sure a lot of
you been looking forward to on this list
and it's also a sea net editor's choice
coming in number five on scene its top
ten holiday tech gifts is the iPhone 5
actually that tells you how many good
tech gifts there are that the iPhone 5
is number five on the list right but you
know phones are a tricky gift to buy for
people so this is a good option for a
family member or a spouse that kind of
thing and of course the benefits are
obvious thinner lighter and has a bigger
screen and that faster 4G data and
obviously it's a great gift for someone
who already has an older iPhone
especially if they're still on a 3GS or
a four you can get almost any carrier
and this phones go nothing holds this
value better than an iPhone all right
we're halfway through the list now if
you want more of a breakout of the tech
gifts this year head over to cnet.com
where you'll find a complete list on
CNET's Holiday Gift Guide almost time to
take another quick break but first a
must-see especially if you like to put
your own unique stamp on your gifts are
crafty editor Sharon Vaknin has some
great ideas for DIY tech gifts
when it's cold out and you've got your
gloves on forget about using your phone
or tablet it just doesn't work because
these devices have capacitive touch
screens they respond to the static
electricity in your fingertips gloves
block this signal and you're left
without access to your phone but here's
a way that you can turn almost any pair
of gloves into touch screen compatible
accessories so your fingers stay toasty
while texting or checking Facebook this
makes for a great gift for anyone with a
smartphone or tablet all you need is a
pair of gloves conductive thread which
you can get on spark fun calm and a hand
sewing needle to hack your gloves just
make a few short stitches at every
fingertip you'll use with your
touchscreen the conductive thread will
transfer the electricity from your
fingertips to the touch screen this DIY
is so easy that you might make these
touchscreen gloves as stocking stuffers
for all the phone addicts and your
family for more DIY gift tips such as
making Instagram photo strips and even
creating your own personalized QR code
gift tags head on over to sea nuts 2012

Vaknin and we'll be right back

three to e8 4,000 for more on these
products go to cnet.com for a complete
holiday gift guys welcome back to see
nuts top 10 holiday tech gift lists
we're halfway through our list of seeing
its top 10 tech gifts and it only gets
better sneaking in at number four is
another SEMA editor's choice pocket oh
man is that small it kind of stops it
actually because when is Roku not on our
holiday gift list it's pretty much the
best easiest gift in the world for
anyone who wants to add streaming
Internet content to their TV this little
$50 box turns any TV into a smart TV
give you instant access to streaming
video from Netflix Hulu Amazon even HBO
GO it's easy to set up and it's great
for anyone you know is still getting
DVDs from Netflix let's see what number
three is shall we the tech product that
reads number three on CNET's top 10
holiday tech gift lists is the Kindle
paperwhite get it breathe yeah here's
another editor's choice and it
represents a big trend in readers this
year the ink screens with a built-in
light so if your husband or wife likes
to read before bed keeps the lights on
it's gonna be a slightly selfish gift to
help you sleep better and it's a big
departure for Kindle this is not quite a
tablet it's still about the reading
experience but the backlit screen is
really something and they say it won't
give you a headache the way an LCD
screen could although it is not as full
featured as a tablet still has nice long
battery life and you know Kindles they
always make a great gift
alright the end is nearing number 2 on
Cena's top 10 holiday tech gift list is
Samsung Galaxy s3 and this is the little
smartphone that could it's out selling
the iPhone 5 and it has really showed
people that an Android phone can be as
fun easy to use and actually more
powerful than an iPhone 5 and while the
iPhone 5 is still an excellent
smartphone it's a little timid compared
to many of the flagship Android phones
out there the galaxy s3 has a bigger
screen it's beautiful and it comes on
every major carrier and as you probably
guessed it it has a stamp of a Cena
editor's choice now we need to take our
final break but don't go anywhere
because when we come back we'll have the
device that is number one on the wish
lists of CNET the people who love tech
taking us to our break is our own
Bridget Carey with tips on how to do
your online shopping fighting crowds
waiting in long lines camping out in
front of stores it's not something you
have to put up with anymore to score a
sale here's a crash course in mastering
the hunt for online deals with these
tools you can save some serious money
the first step is to know what you're
looking for and make a list even if you
don't know the exact brand name put down
something generic you want to stay
focused to be efficient with your time
next do some research if you're looking
for a new TV or a camera but you don't
know where to start use a site like CNET
to check reviews and roundups try to
become an instant expert on the product
category you're shopping for once the
homework is done you can get specific
and zero in on the products you'd be
happy with let's say I want to get this
Canon sx260 point and shoot
it's got great reviews from critics and
users but I don't want to pay the full
retail price of $350 so now it's time to
see which retailer is selling it for the
lowest price go to google.com slash
shopping or go to PriceGrabber comm and
type in the product name it'll show you
all the different prices from around the
web and it looks like you can get the
camera for under $250 and that's a much
better deal once you've found a price
you like you can still get it for
cheaper with a coupon code RetailMeNot
has a bunch of check out coupon codes
for popular stores you might find one
you can use you also have to think about
those shipping costs some stores have
free shipping promotions and if you're
buying off Amazon you can get free
shipping with an Amazon
I'm account and up to four family
members can use it prime does cost $80 a
year but you can get a one month free
trial parents get three months for free
at amazon.com slash mom students can get
a year free at amazon.com slash student
finally if the pressure is on to find
something in a hurry and you're stumped
for ideas try a daily deal site these
are clearing houses for random stuff but
the deals are legit checkout sites like
woot slick deals and fatwallet these are
all worth a shot if you're in a pinch so
there you go those are your online
shopping tips that you can use for the
holidays or year-round for cnet.com I'm
Bridget Carey and we'll be right back
some of scenic top picks for cameras

t3i some have seen its top picks for the
best ultra books and thin laptops
include the Acer timeline u m5 the HP
Envy Spectre XT and the Apple MacBook
Air for more on these products go to
cnet.com for a complete holiday gift
guide ok everyone I hope we've given you
some great tech gift ideas here on
Cena's top 10 holiday tech gift list so
far but we are just getting to the
hottest technology on almost everyone's
list today drumroll please
well we should do a recap of all the
products we've done so far that's true a
recap yes alright number 10 was the 3m
streaming projector that little TV in a
box followed by number 9 the audio
technica ath m30 headphones number 8 was
the panasonic lumix vm CBS 20 camera
number seven on Cena's top 10 holiday
tech gifts with the Sonos place three
streaming speaker coming in at number
six our favorite overall TV the
Panasonic TCPS t 50 and at number five
the ever-popular iPhone 5 number four
was the Roku LT and number three was the
Kindle paperwhite number two was the
Samsung Galaxy s3 and that my friends
brings us to the big kahuna numero uno
number one unseen its top 10 holiday
tech gift list drumroll please
wait stop before we do a drumroll
there's the twist here's the twist there
was so much debate around Cena about
which product would be number one we
decided that we had to include a
runner-up you can think of it as
technology as Miss America that's right
so the runner-up to number one on our
tech gift list is
the iPad Mini the new baby iPad it's
still a little bit expensive compared to
those $199 7-inch tablets out there but
if you've been dying for an iPad that is
smaller and lighter and easier to hold
329 bucks gets the end of one it's kind
of like a starter iPad right whether you
already have an iPad or you've been
sitting on the fence about buying a
tablet at all you really can't miss with
the iPad Mini you get all the apps and
media of Apple but in a much more
portable form ok are we finally ready
for number one because I'm gonna say
drumroll yes and I don't want you saying
stuff you have it ok ok
drumroll number one on Cena's top 10
holiday tech gift list is will 7-inch
tablet this one runs Android yeah I
think the idea here is that all these
7-inch tablets make a great gift for the
holidays they're like a little mini
computer but not as big and heavy as the
full 10 inch tablet but the Nexus 7 got
our Cena editors choice and it's just a
much better value at $199 it's
absolutely a better value than the iPad
Mini the screen is better the size is
even more portable and you still get
great apps and content the Nexus 7 ties
in with everything that Google does so
well Android apps ebooks YouTube search
Google music it's all there and you save
a hundred and thirty dollars over the
price of an iPad Mini this is a winner
I'll take it all right we did it
and unfortunately we are out of time
everyone we hope that you enjoyed
spending this time with us and learning
all about technology if you didn't get
enough for your tech fix you can find
more of us and great tech news and

you
hey I'm just a new head phone editor for
CNET with a product spotlight on my pick
for best all-around over your head phone
of course the main reason we really like
this set is its picture quality to price
ratio this TV scored a nine and our
picture quality evaluations which is
right up there with the very best TVs of
the year and better than any LED we've
reviewed this year unlike a lot of big
screen smartphones the iPhone 5 is
discreet it's compact and it still
manages to fit in a larger screen and a
lot of great features that we've been
waiting for it's a van tastic all around
phone and it's one that a lot of Android
users are going to envy - so far I'm
impressed with what I've seen screen
feels very responsive to tapping and
swiping
typing also feels very precise the
tablet ships with Android 4.1 which
updates Google Play to now offer movie
purchases TV shows and magazines Riptide
GP ran smoothly and of course includes
the Tegra 3 splashy effects the lights
plays across the screen very uniformly
and the screen has a pleasing white cast
to it this kindle keeps track of your
reading speed and can tell you how long
it will take to finish a chapter or the
rest of the book also you get amazon's
x-ray feature which isn't available on
the entry-level kindle CNET's top ten
