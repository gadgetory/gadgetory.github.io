to the buzz report the show about the
tech news that everyone is talking about
everyone is talking about only one thing
this week so let's get right to it Steve
Jobs resigned from his CEO position at
Apple on Wednesday in his letter of
resignation to the board he said he can
no longer meet his duties and
expectations as CEO of Apple CEO Tim
Cook will take his place and job said he
plans to stay on as Apple's chairman of
the board jobs also said that Apple's
brightest and most innovative days are
ahead of it obviously though it's just
about impossible to imagine Apple
without steve jobs in the news hit the
tech community pretty hard obviously
some folks on the internet are already
predicting doom and gloom for Apple
because that's kind of what the internet
is for and also cat videos but Steve
Jobs will still be around and you know
he's got like a hundred year plan for
Apple that he gave Tim Cook in a sealed
white lucite cube and it's going to be
okay also we did spot this one really
funny tweet Steve Jobs's text was meant
to say I reign as CEO of Apple damn you
autocorrect good one all right let's do
a show and let's start with the gadget
of the week the gadget of the week is
the HP TouchPad Yeah right the must-have
device of the season thanks to HP
brutally killing it off after giving it
a generous 48 days on the market to
destroy the iPad tell me that wasn't
playing the second leo apotheker walked
in the door anyway in an effort to get
rid of all those stinky touch pads HP
started selling them for as low as 99
bucks and people went crazy limes
outside of Best Buy's multi-page
slickdeals threads detailing where and
how to get one sell out reports gloating
hoarding now they're going for more than
three hundred dollars on ebay and you
know what even with a brand new install
base a cult following and all this great
attention I think HP is still so stupid
that they're not going to do anything
worthwhile with the webos platform but
hey that new enterprise software plan
sounds fun too moving on
yay for new privacy changes at Facebook
the company rolled out some big new
changes this week including the ability
to filter who sees whatever you post
when you post it kind of like circles in
Google+ Facebook swears they had these
changes in the works for a long time
before Google+ came out though whatever
you can also change who sees a post even
after you post it which is good for that
internet regret in other changes you get
more control over whether you're tagged
in any photos although more people can
now tag you facebook is also getting rid
of places but you can put location into
any post oh and you can block someone
like an X and then they can never tagged
you and all your tagged interactions
disappear forever nice you've just been
erased I like it also um that reminds me
Facebook actually can we go powder our
noses real quick and now it's time for
Girl Talk in the powder room okay can I
give you an idea that you should take
from google plus you can call it my idea
if it'll make you feel better but I
really want the mute this post thing
that they have like how you don't get
any more notifications when someone
comments on a specific thread and I know
you know what threads i'm talking about
when somebody has a baby and they put it
on facebook and i want to say
congratulations but then i don't want to
get a pop up every time the other 300
people say congratulations I don't even
know them you don't talking about
anyways thank you in advance I would
love that okay moving on in the news
today reports say the iphone 5 could be
coming to both t-mobile and Sprint now
some people already have unlocked
iphones on t-mobile so it's mainly huge
news for Sprint customers right yay the
little network that could an iPhone on
it and the happy no shut it down pray
this rumor is not true sprint ease the
iphone is like the ultimate Trojan horse
it's like a blanket covered in small pox
when the iphone comes to town unlimited
plans
now on to one of my favorite stories of
the week the latest update in the great
Apple Samsung pissing match of 2011
Apple has had some victories lately the
EU ban on selling galaxy tabs which was
actually overturned except in Germany
now though there's a new ban on selling
the galaxy phones in the Netherlands but
Samsung is not going down without a
fight an awesome hilarious movie loving
fight they have cited Stanley Kubrick's
2001 a Space Odyssey as prior art in
Apple's design patent case because of
this scene how despite your enormous in
select are you ever frustrated by your
dependence on people to carry out
actions not in the slightest bit I enjoy
working with people um right how is that
not a very very large iPad or galaxy tab
or whatever Kubrick pones actually I
want to see the Kubrick estate jump on
in here kate matte alright finally let's
have a look at what's clogging the tubes
the site fiverr com has been all over
the place lately people put up jobs that
they'll do for five bucks like write a
message on a piece of lettuce that a
bunny eats or recommend your LinkedIn
page or write a song for you but the
biggest hit from Fiverr is dancing
drawer see for yourself
he went viral after he put up one of his
dances on regretsy and he got like 300
orders and don't even think about trying
to get him for your birthday present
because he's not even taking any new
orders and now tell me you do not love
the internet and that's the buzz report
for this week everyone I'm mollywood and
thank you for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
