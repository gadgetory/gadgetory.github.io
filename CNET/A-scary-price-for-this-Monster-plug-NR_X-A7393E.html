I'm taking a look at the monster central
power control kit the idea here is
pretty simple you plug this into a wall
and then you plug any electronic you
want in here that allows you to use the
monster app to remotely control whatever
you plugged in say you have a lamp
plugged in here now from the office you
can turn on your living room light you
can set schedules this thing will also
monitor the energy of it for you and it
will provide some surge protection to
connect to the internet you'll also need
to hook this hub directly into your
router this will talk to this guy and
boom you have a connection so 140 bucks
is a lot for this and I mean like a
whole lot now maybe that'd be okay if
monster invented something brand-new to
help you take a first step into the
smart home except that there's a million
other devices that do the exact same
thing as this and cost a lot less d-link
idevices quirky I home insteon grid
connect all of which offer wider
interoperability some of which are going
to be home kit compatible and all of
them cost way less than 140 bucks so
look it's not that this thing doesn't
work it's fine it'll flip your light
switch on or off but honestly pulling up
the app and having to press three
buttons to get your light to turn on
your sort of gonna miss just going up
and flipping the light switch but it
offers remote functionality with only a
little bit of lag it has energy readings
but it's not enough to redeem this thing
monsters are well-known brand and maybe
they're counting on that and the fact
that a lot of people still aren't very
familiar with the smart and honestly a
smart plug is a great way to get started
with home automation but there are
better cheaper options out there that
offer more interoperability go with any
one of those over the
and forty dollar monsters central power
control for cnet I'm Andrew governor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
