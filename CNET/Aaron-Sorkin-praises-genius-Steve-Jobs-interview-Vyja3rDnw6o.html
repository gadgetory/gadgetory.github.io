dollars and your daughter and her mother
are on welfare she's not my daughter we
must be able to see that she looks like
you we will know soon enough if you were
Leonardo da Vinci or just think you are
you're the only one who sees the world
same way I do no one sees the world the
same way to do all right so can thank
you for speaking to us today yet what
well first you eat the story of Steve
Jobs and what was come the biggest
challenge that you face and telling that
story Oh what drew me to it was a blind
date I had just had a great time making
two movies in a row the social network
in Moneyball with the same studio the
same producer and they had just bought
Walter Isaacson's authorized biography
of Steve Jobs and they said I'd like you
to do this and I said sure and it was a
blind date but then I fell in love and
before I knew what I wanted to do I knew
what I didn't want to do and that was
right a biopic I didn't want to write a
cradle-to-grave story where we land on
the greatest hits of the protagonist
along the way I wanted to do something
else and after spending a lot of time
with the real people who are represented
by characters in the movie and then
several dozen others who aren't I
started to recognize points of friction
between Steve and a number of these
people particular his eldest daughter
Lisa and I came up with a whole
different structure which is that the
movie would just be three scenes each of
them in real time and each of these
scenes would take place backstage and
the moments leading up to a product
launch how did you choose those three
moments in Steve's life they had nothing
to do with the products themselves
people have said well you know how could
you not do the iphone it's just uh you
know was seminal it's because the the
those choices didn't have anything to do
with the products and the movie doesn't
have much to do with with the products i
chose the launch the mac because steve
was still denying paternity of lisa in
1984 and because the Macintosh was the
first product that Steve really felt
complete ownership of the others he'd
either made compromises on or he had
been kicked off of her
like that this was his baby and it
failed and then the second act next
that's the king in exile the third act
is the King returns uh you know if a
third act had been the iphone it would
have been well the King returned several
years ago there's nothing much dramatic
about that show those first two acts
that they're both film makes very clear
that they're both times when he didn't
really have the things that he said he
had what you think that sort of says
about him as a person well I think um it
says a number of things its first of all
he dreams big he swings for the fences
and of course the reality distortion
field you know he would have a dream
that was here the technology would be
here he always knew the technology would
catch up to where his dream was it was a
matter of how fast could it do it and
the boro phrase one more thing was Steve
Jobs genius first of all let me tell you
for a while I thought but that would be
the title of the movie and one more
thing um but I couldn't work and one
more thing in a screenplay was Steve
Jobs a genius I don't the results speak
for themselves that he marshaled the
forces that created not just the most
successful company in the history of the
world but these products and devices
that so many people feel emotional about
I yes it's my verdict is yes that he
stood at the intersection of art
technology and and and that was
something
duh sure I what I like to have his brain
has man donation you back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
