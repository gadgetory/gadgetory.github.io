or another but the Citroen SM did it in
at least five ways
I'm Brian Cooley with the top five tech
innovations of this odd-looking
masterpiece a few of which appeared on
its predecessor the DS we're gonna rank
its tech features by importance and how
well they predicted future popularity
number five composite wheels they were
made of carbon reinforced resin and
weighed only about nine and a half
pounds each roughly half the weight of a
steel wheel even today the use of
composites carbon fiber and ceramics and
cars is exotic
but in wheels still almost unheard of
unless you look at products like carbon
revolutions see our nines they're
fifteen thousand dollars a set about
three grand more than an entire SM cost
when it was new number four rain sensing
wipers this is before the modern
electronic sensor era so the SMS wiper
motor detected the current needed to
wipe and move the blade it translated
that into an approximation of how wet or
dry the windshield was an adjusted wiper
speed accordingly Rube Goldberg e'en
today every car has intermittent wipers
at a fair number also since the presence
of rain automatically number three
automatic suspension under the hood of
an SM you'll see all these little odd
green orbs those are reservoirs that
have pressurized fluid in them pumped
around to the cars corners that's how it
adjusts its ride height leveling and
shock damping no Springs now similar
systems are used on supercars today but
it's still pretty exotic more
down-to-earth are the related
magnetorheological adaptive suspensions
like GM's magnetic ride control but even
it can't lift up the car for a tire
change the way an SM can number two
adaptive headlights home market FM's had
six headlights up front in an array that
made the car look like it was wearing
Google glass
they both leveled themselves and aimed
automatically based on input from the
steering wheel unheard of them this is a
widespread feature in the last handful
of years but it was so far ahead of its
time in the 70s the US law didn't even
know what to
deal with it so us-spec sm's had to
substitute for dopey sealed beams that
did nothing except turn on one of the
great tech buzz kills in auto history
before I get you to our number one
amazing Citroen SM feature here's one
that's more oddity than breakthrough the
brake pedal it really isn't it's this
rubberized button or bulb on the floor
that only has about an inch of travel
for the entire range of its braking
force if you ever get a chance to drive
one of these I'm pretty sure that'll
take the most getting used to the number
one piece of tech that the SM had first
is variable steering it adjusted the sms
hydraulic steering assist
according to vehicle speed so the amount
of assist got less the faster you drive
and it was only two full turns lock to
lock that aided slow speed maneuvers and
parking and the wheel inside the cabin
was adjustable in both height and reach
this is amazing stuff back then it's an
area where the SM saw the future most
clearly so common in cars today by the
way technology is what killed the SM in
America that adjustable suspension we
talked about back at number four it also
moved the bumper height up and down so
it various settings it was out of spec
with US law Citroen was not about to
abandon the feature for that reason so
they abandon the market instead high
tech cars and modern driving that's what
we do at CNET on cars.com i'm brian
