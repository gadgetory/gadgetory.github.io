some sort of Star Trek future that's on
the horizon I'm Scott Stein and I'm
wearing the telepathy one another device
in this increasingly growing landscape
that google glass seems to be birthing
much like Google glass you're dealing
with a Bluetooth wearable headset here
with a projector very micro projector
that hovers over your eye and delivers
an image that hovers right about here
where I'm looking but the idea what the
telepathy one is very simple there's a
sort of a dream behind this the founders
thinking about the idea of telepathy
between individuals and intimate
communication right now the app future
is very specific about sharing streaming
videos with a small circle of friends
will then be able to comment what you
see will be the comments and that
information over here there is some
other app support as well there's a nap
that turns what you see in two animated
manga comics and but as far as other
apps not right now it's gonna be pretty
basic and the goal is to have this
release by the end of the year at a
price that will be competitive with
Google glass what will you use this for
well that's a good question and that's a
question that a lot of this territory is
going to be working out how does this
stuff feel how will be comfortable and
one angle here is aesthetics the idea is
that this will be maybe a little less
intrusive that the projector is not as
bulky as the google glass optics would
you like to have an intimate moment with
me we shall see when the telepathy one
maybe arrives by the end of this year so
stay tuned i'm scott stein wearing each
