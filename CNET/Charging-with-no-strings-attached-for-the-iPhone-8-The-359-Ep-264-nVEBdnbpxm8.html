with me is our fearless intern Brianne
Garrett she put out a future this
morning about the future of wireless
charging and where the iPhone 8 could
fit in now Samsung and Android have
already you know implemented this
feature if you put it down on a pad but
Brianne you're making the point in your
article that this is not true wireless
charging what what is that
yeah it's come become a misnomer officer
it's on we have two major players that
being Chi and power Matt and they really
operate using inductive charging rather
than true Wireless which means you kind
of you know put your phone against a
base and your phone's not you know
connected to a wire but the base is so
you can't really technically can't call
this wireless charging they have this is
pretty convenient they have it set up in
stores like Starbucks and McDonald's
where you basically just tap your phone
onto a circular kind of tablet as you
can see and it's pretty convenient it's
nice
we actually headed to a Starbucks
yesterday and tried it out I hadn't seen
it in person it's a tad finicky kind of
have to like find the perfect placement
to put your phone and order for it to
start charging but once we figured it
out it's um it's nice but there's
definitely a little bit of an inaccuracy
in calling it true wireless charging
yeah so if Apple we kind of I've already
seen this with their you know SmartWatch
and with the air pods which also isn't
true wireless charging so with the
iPhone eight do you think that we'll be
seeing this as this true wireless
charging that everybody's talking about
or do you think it'll just be sticking
to the pad I mean just put it down
that's hard to say there's been some
rumors you know Apple has worked with G
in the past so people are kind of you
know guessing that they will work with G
which is considered the inductive
charging method but then there's also
I'm energist which is one of the major
power players that have actually started
implementing true wireless charging but
not on a consumer level yet and how this
works is through radiofrequency this is
kind of new and a little people kind of
feel fearful of it because you know
things past the air what's gonna happen
is it's safe so there is a little bit of
skepticism yeah it's a real shocker
it's
CNET's roadtrip series continues this
time taking us all the way to a smart
city in Italy Ian's share visited a
Sicilian city that's about 2,800 years
old but it's trying to bring its tech to
modern day so they've got sensors on
pretty much everything you know they got
them in parking lots they haven't been
there trash cans or bus stops and they
all pretty much talk to each other and
your phone it means you can kind of like
find parking spots without driving
endlessly a trouble that you know I've
experienced a lot in New York or you can
you know find out what the air quality
is like ran what city problems do you
hope to see you know a smart city to be
able to like solve one day there's a lot
I mean I go back between New York and
Boston and I'd have to say as much as I
love these ride-sharing companies I am a
sucker for when it comes to cabs and so
having a platform where I can you know
obviously you can catch a cab on the
street but I tend to have problems when
it comes to that so having an app or
some sort of system where I can locate
where these cabs are and if they're
available what saves some time so that
would probably be the number one thing
I'd like to yeah I'm like the complete
opposite where I try to take public
transportation as much as I can and I
know that the MTA and New York is in
dire straits right now and please if you
could just I don't I know a smart city
wouldn't fix it but I really I really
want to like you know hope that it does
you know there's so many problems with
the MTA anyway so we're wrapping up
today's show with more news from Apple
and Qualcomm's legal battles the US
government is getting involved now if
the US International Trade Commission
investigating a claim that Apple was
illegally using Qualcomm's technology in
their iphones modem the investigation
could mean that iphones would be banned
from selling in the u.s. now this
wouldn't be any time soon it'd take
maybe a couple years before they
actually make their decision but can
imagine that like the u.s. without any
iphones being allowed to be sold there i
it's not really imaginable to me at this
moment maybe you know within the next
year something crazy will come out that
will you know yeah we may have to be it
have to be crazy yeah crazy and have to
be but right now I see the iPhone going
nowhere no time soon well thanks for
listening if you liked anything you
heard today check us out on sea
I'm Alfred a I'm breanne Garrett so I
would like to agree with the MTA
sentiment /i are first of all they need
to get it out of the like 20th century
technology like they're literally not
even they recently only installed like
Wi-Fi stations and you only like this
year was able to use your phone
underground but I mean more of their
issues are you're like functional issues
where signal problems and you can't tell
unless like you're really far away all
these issues and I don't know if it's
something that a smart city would be
able to fix because like the technology
in general is so old there that like
literally at 34th Street they use
technology from like World War two and
they can't fix it because it's so deeply
embedded in there yeah that being said I
still hate riding the MTA yeah I mean
there are days I flip back and forth
between the extremes where I say you
know I really appreciate that it exists
where would we be without it and then
there are other days where I want to
like find where their home addresses are
and see where fate takes me I mean but
they have been adding some smart city
elements to their buses though turn the
buses have become like Wi-Fi enabled you
can charge your phone on and you can
track where the buses are on like your
phone if you're like you'll ever tell
you what bus stop it's been in that
stuff and in certain neighborhoods I
actually saw one two days ago they have
like the bus post and it'll tell you
like how many minutes away it is yeah
unfortunately the one that I was trying
to ride was it literally had no number
it just said like nothing but it had
like lights just passing through that's
what I got a wonder is what happens when
the idiot the minutes away is beyond
like the two so so I I was there with my
girlfriend and I was just saying you
know this bus goes all the way back to
our apartment let's just wait for the
bus here we waited like 20 minutes yeah
and it still never changed on the thing
even though the bus above it like it was
it was like five minutes two minutes
whatever yeah and it got to a point I
was like I'm just gonna see where it is
on my phone app
and it was 30 minutes away I'm like
that's cool let's go that you didn't
display it up here on your soil smart
bus stop that's all right I'm just gonna
take the train home now Thanks
all right we've lamented enough since
most of our listeners are not in New
York City we apologize but it does suck
sometimes and we're just getting it out
getting it out of our system you're
saying a smart city would be able to fix
that so these are cool but if you're
studying abroad a plus public
transportation systems definitely rub it
in and I'm not used to being back in New
York all right yeah let's jump into the
chat first up - what's up dude the
matter
Matthew batcher yeah that's a good eye
but it's actually a belt buckle not a 45
adapter that's on on the desk in front
of me so cheers there's a camera behind
me oh right I forgot and then he also
goes on we want to talk about the
wireless charging for a little bit dad
says hasn't IKEA been making furniture
with key charging for a few years now is
the story with Apple is finally doing it
I'm not sure I don't know why it was
charging companies like I I look at the
IKEA catalog like religiously this is
like a recent development this was I saw
it like the first time I had seen it was
like this year was like a cabinet like a
bedside cabinet that you could put your
phone on huh interesting
yeah how recent was that you know I saw
it in like like maybe like the fall
catalog or something and it operates in
the same in the same method is inductive
charging how it works no I just know
that you put your phone on it and it
charges so probably but yeah I mean not
on the line of Ikea but definitely with
like Samsung and Android devices all
like yeah a lot of people have been
doing wireless charging for a while now
this is another case of Apple Wireless
yeah like there's another there's
another case of Apple just coming out
and he we invented this like it's in the
same way where you know Bluetooth
headphones have been around for a while
and then out of nowhere
hey we have the air pod have you guys
heard of wireless headphones like it
yeah it's Apple being late to the game
and just saying like this was this was
awesome what are you talking about we
make this collective whatever and all
things coming out of that company at
this point they're purple wants us to
compare contrast how fast will it charge
will it be faster than the Qualcomm
quick charge that I do not know because
we do we have numbers on that yeah
you're gonna match the Qualcomm quick
charge though because unless like like
that charge is like ridiculously fast
and that's wired like so we actually I
included in my story we did a scene that
test and found that the Galaxy s8 took
3.5 hours to charge inductively compared
to a typical two hours it would take
with the standard USB C cable so you're
getting a longer charge with the I feel
like for now maybe for like the next
like two three years I I generally feel
like Y are just gonna be much faster
yeah yeah yeah especially not against
the quick charge so isn't that like
that's like 30 minutes or like a full
charge exactly something you want maybe
put on sleep and then wake up and you're
good I mean isn't that the whole like
idea behind like true wireless charging
though where like even though it doesn't
charge really fast you're literally
doing nothing extra to like get it yeah
you're sacrificing time for convenience
I guess yeah I kind of like this idea
Dell has a question what about the
prototype for having a wireless charging
modem which charges all devices in the
same room now that that's a dream come
true so wait does it also provide like
Wi-Fi or something or no no I think he's
referring to as a modem as it be a
centralized hub yeah charges multiple
things just as you yeah that's mobile
devices yeah that's supposed to be it's
supposed to be the point is that you
have like this one yeah I guess modem in
a sense that is important yeah modem
that's providing charging capabilities
through the air through radio frequency
so it is kind of a concept that it
hasn't necessarily been on consumer
level yet but it has been tested I think
Disneyland did something like that
recently where I was like a specific
room that you could it was like a test
kind of thing where you know they wanted
to do it where people like could go and
then just look
you have their phones charged in that
room while they like just hang out there
kind of thing yeah the only thing with
that if true wireless charging was
available do you realize like how packed
like Starbucks would be oh you know I'm
glad you brought that because like
sometimes like I'll go in a Starbucks
Justice to charge my phone and if all
the seats all the seats near the outlets
are always taken yeah yeah so if it was
wireless charging and you don't have to
plug in anything and you also don't have
to put on like a specific pad like you
could just be in the room surprisingly
though all of these the inductive
charging stations I have yet to see
anyone use those yeah it's just me but I
try to one out when I was in Toronto and
my phone was I didn't have my charger on
me and yeah it took forever so I can see
that being a big reason why I can also
see you know not every phone is
compatible with that car yeah I just
don't think the technologies like really
there right now it's a nice idea let's
swing back over to Apple for a second
Michael Brown sir like Apple made mobile
payments popular wireless charging could
be like that let's take this down to
brass tacks here Apple was kind of ahead
of the game on mobile payments don't
give him that much yeah I I will say
that's kind of the you know motive or
advantage that Apple has here with a lot
of these things is that they don't have
to be the first to something you know
it's like being like the first on a live
stream comment section doesn't matter
it's kind of more like the quality of
comments here but I think I think it's
that sensors they have a massive user
base and it's much easier for them to
adopt it and they can kind of refine a
lot of these it's also taking something
making it better than calling it your
idea calling it more unique not
necessarily first the game that you were
the best of the game yeah I think I
think that subjective still of course I
mean and I think you know in technology
we've obviously seen that a lot like it
doesn't matter if you're first it kind
of matters like how many people are
using it right now like as we've seen
with snapchat and Instagram where you
know Instagram copied everything I
snapped
did what's doing way better because they
have a much larger user base yeah that's
true if Apple does anything they appease
there are in Britain embedded audience
almost it in bread I mean it's branching
off of that I just I love that this
comment exists svet Slav says oh my god
the whole Apple sheeple versus Android
fanboys is getting ridiculous it's
gotten almost as bad as liberal versus
conservative we have a choice guys
whenever companies compete we the
consumers win thank you for saying that
actually sincerely we get a lot of you
know trolls and extremes and it's just
nice to see someone with the level head
I've always thought it was ridiculous
with people taking sides on these things
because I unless you work for them or
are making money off of this I really
don't see why you're such like a like a
warrior for or like this company that
really has no ties or affiliation to you
like it's a sports game like they're at
battle I've always felt about sports I
mean if you've got money invested yes
sports a little different but I get what
you're saying
swinging back over Danny Green asks so
speaking of trains and buses is there an
app in the works for more than one city
to help you find if your train or bus is
on time and I don't think that's really
ever gonna be in the cards because every
single cities public transit authority
is its own private entity there's no is
he talking about like trains and buses
between cities oh that's is that what
you meant Danny you know what I don't
know why I just kind of jump to that
conclusion that's probably exactly what
he meant yeah I mean there's there's
apps like like for Amtrak and things
like that yeah buy the business but if
he's talking about like an aggregation
of like every cities like trains and
buses I think you know a lot of for a
lot of them they're not really like like
that advanced yet I mean I know New York
has there's I don't know what it's like
in Boston like do you have like an app
there to tell you with something's on
time there's even in New York there's no
app than no see if your train is on time
they only have them for left and when it
arrives but it's not saying oh this
train is 20 minutes too late yeah I
don't really think and as far as like
the aggregation goes between cities I
feel like you
to travel to a lot of cities to like
have that be useful but how many people
do I know they do that for libraries
like they have an app that aggregates
all the libraries and that tells you
like what book is available yeah oh
that's cool I don't know that actually
it's funny you say that I'm just signed
up for my New York Public Library card
especially last night I think the
library is a comeback right now
definitely well did you see that they
announced the the criterion collection
is going to be available for stream but
I was the Brooklyn Public Library it is
all New York Public Library oh really
yeah and I'll be honest that was a
mitigating factor and pushing me or to
finally go and get my card I really got
my library card after some I saw some
like idiot comment on Facebook where I
was just like you know what if they had
like a Netflix but for books dude wait I
should have a card it's like that Wall
Street Journal article about Millennials
discovering TV antennas oh my god you're
right is it like a free way to get like
TVs without streaming what did you catch
his age how old is he yeah yeah it was
like a shared post it was like a meme
like oh one more for Michael Brown we
gotta wrap it up here soon but will
Wired versus wireless charging matter if
there is a place where a place every
where for wireless charging for example
restaurants homes stores and etc so kind
of like what you're talking about with
the Starbucks scenario like do you think
that like wire like basically why are we
gonna go extinct kind of thing like
there's I think he's saying will it
matter whether it's wire free was
whether it's inductive or whether it's
radiofrequency like you could charge it
anywhere like would it even matter if I
think it definitely does because it's
just also about the time it takes to
charge I'm also like you also got to
think about like all the bureaucracy
that they're gonna manage yeah or to get
this everywhere I mean like because it's
not really like a major thing right now
it's really not in the on the political
like eyes well I just think about you
know now we know that like Wi-Fi is like
pretty much everywhere right but like
think about all the like hurdles that
they had to jump through for
you know is Wi-Fi like frying your
brains kind of thing right are these
like wave signals like messing you up
kind of stuff which they're still like
arguably like talking about like in
Congress yeah I mean imagine if that's
taken that long how long it's gonna take
for this true wireless charging to kind
of make it past the is it safe yeah my
scared to use it stage it's gonna be a
little bit of time before it's actually
you know accepted yeah
razor goes back to our discussion about
Apple fanboys Android fanboys sheeple
etc the issue is that we don't have
enough competition Android and Apple
equals not enough competition thus
devices remain overpriced for both ends
he's got a point too
this is really good discussion this is a
whole episode in itself we should have
just gone on it's the yeah I mean a lot
of people Battle Royale
yeah there's no competition they're just
I mean I don't know man that Nokia 3310
it's coming back yeah they're running on
Android though that's that's a good
point
that's why there's no os's like that
okay that's a good point and like
blackberry tried making their own and
then just decided to jump on Android
that's that's the thing like there's all
these people saying like oh well like
this is competition and but like because
Android made their stuff like all
open-source it's like it's all pretty
much Android versus exactly yeah alright
that's a good point all right I'm just
bummed out yeah it's probably the time
to wrap it up thanks everybody
really that was fun home I feel like
what you heard today the 3:59 podcast is
available on iTunes tune in stitcher
