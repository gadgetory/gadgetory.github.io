gaming laptop super expensive and ultra
stylish well the new Razer Blade might
be for you we reviewed the Razer Blade
last year actually earlier this year in
its first configuration and it was a
thin but very expensive twenty eight
hundred dollar laptop that had specs
that didn't quite match up to the types
of cutting-edge gaming laptops that
we've been reviewing but it did offer
some interesting interfaces and designs
had a really cool touchscreen trackpad
called the switchblade UI that was
futuristic but didn't quite have that
many apps now in late 2012 the Razer
Blade has been upgraded and the price
has been dropped down to $2,500 and what
you're getting is a very improved set of
internal specs in a quad core Core i7
processor you're getting nvidia geforce
gtx 660 m graphics and you're also
getting a larger amount of hard drive
space 500 gigs instead of 256 now once
again like the previous Razer Blade
there's no optical drive this is a super
thin laptop it's actually nearly as thin
as a Retina Display MacBook Pro and hey
this had the idea before the MacBook Pro
did in terms of introducing a very thin
initially solid state based laptop with
high-end specs as opposed to going the
Ultrabook route when you fold this down
this is about point eight inches thin
it's very thin although it's over six
pounds and it will feel a little heavier
than your average laptop and it's wide
so this kind of surf board laptop will
not fit into your average backpack
before worn but if you're a hardcore
gamer you're probably used to that now
what you're getting here is a lot of
design this beautiful metal chassis and
getting a fantastic 17 inch screen and
you're buying into that switchblade UI
now instead of a trackpad on the bottom
you're getting a touchscreen trackpad
over here with 10 programmable LED
buttons above fancy stuff but what is it
really used for it well the first time
we wondered where were the apps they're
about ten built-in apps ranging from
Facebook apps to browser apps to a
calculator nothing tremendously exciting
now there are four games that are
supported with apps Star Wars The Old
Republic Counter Strike Team Fortress 2
and battlefield 3 and what the
now two are really more like
customizable button sets that you can
bring up with a touchscreen interface on
the bottom very useful when you're
playing a game like Battlefield 3
perhaps but not really true second
screen gaming that you may be seeing
perhaps on the Wii U coming out now it's
a nice touch but is it worth buying into
there are more apps that are going to be
on their way and you can program these
top buttons yourself and add either your
own graphic assets or an increasing
library that Razer provides but that's a
little bit of a hobby type of experience
and in terms of an out of the box
supported library we're still waiting
for more games that brings us to the
question of Windows 8 well this is not a
Windows 8 laptop although it will be
Windows 8 supported razer promises that
they will be updating the drivers for
this in time for Windows 8 launch or
shortly thereafter but if you're buying
into this laptop as a cool futuristic
laptop just remember that there were
going to be a lot of interesting cool
laptops coming out in the next month or
two a lot of them with touchscreens a
lot of them that flip into crazy origami
shapes or slider laptops those are going
to be maybe even more interesting to
show off but if you want a cool gaming
laptop one that is specifically meant
for gaming well this is probably the
most stylish and interestingly designed
one that's out there because let's face
it a lot of gaming laptops are pretty
conservative looking and they're a
little thick and heavy and they opt for
power over cool factor all in all it's
an improved product although maybe you
might have an issue with no optical
drive and a hybrid hard drive instead of
SSD I like the extra storage space and I
also like the extra performance this is
the new Razer Blade for late 2012
