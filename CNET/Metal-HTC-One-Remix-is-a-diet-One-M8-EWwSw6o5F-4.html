slightly cheaper version of the HTC One
m8 then you're going to want this this
is the HTC One remix for verizon
globally known as the HTC One mini 2 i'm
jessica doll court for CNN i'm going to
give you a first look now this phone
does have slightly scaled back specs
from the m8 and it's a little bit
smaller as well its got a 4.5 inch 720p
HD display that is lower than the m8
1080p HD resolution but I still thought
that colors looked good and images
looked crisp the body is really nice
it's still pretty big but it's just not
massive and it does have aluminum on the
back plate and some accents as well it
is running Android 4.4 KitKat inside
with HTC Sense 6 skin on top of that so
you are going to find things like
blinkfeed and a bunch of HTC apps as
well HTC has continued to deliver really
top-notch audio quality through google
speakers on the front camera wise you've
got a 5 megapixel shooter on the front
so that's pretty good and the quality
was pretty good as well on the back you
have 8 13 megapixel camera so for this
model HTC is backing off of ultrapixels
overall this is a really great little
phone it's a reliable performer the
camera is pretty good and it looks a lot
better than most other mid-range phones
you can read much more about the pros
and cons of my full review at cnet com
I'm Jessica doll court and this has been
the HTC One remix</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
