us to 4k Apple come along with you
guessed it 5k i'm dan ackerman and this
is a first look at apple's new 27 inch
imac with retina 5k display now this
huge display native resolution 5120 by
2880 that of course is more than a
typical 4k display which is still pretty
gray on a certainly a lot more than you
saw on on imax previously even the super
high-end ones the model we saw last year
you had a basic 2560 x 1440 and this is
a really big trade up from that it's
something like 14.7 million pixels on
this one screen right here now why are
you going to need a 5k display no you
could argue that you need it for very
high-end photo and video editing
certainly great for bragging rights if
you're the first person on the block
with one of these other than the display
it's actually very similar to the
previous version of 27 inch imacs same
Intel Core i5 core i7 processors the
graphics have actually been changed
instead of nvidia they switched over to
AMD r9 graphics maybe they needed
something more powerful to drive this 5k
display maybe it works particularly well
with AMD graphics Apple's little cage on
why they made that switch but you
certainly need a lot of power to push
this 5k display here which is a real
standout feature and what is otherwise
pretty much the same 27-inch imac you've
been able to buy for the last year or
two now of course all this does not come
cheap this guy starts at 24 99 and that
includes just a basic intel core i5 cpu
if you want to trade up to an i7 that's
another two hundred and fifty dollars on
top of that as we continue to play
around with this new system we're going
to try out all kinds of 4k and super
high-res videos and see how the display
performs so we can't wait to get in
front of all our display testing
equipment i'm dan ackerman and that is
Apple's new 27-inch imac with 5k Retina
display</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
