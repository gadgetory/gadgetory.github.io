released the ipad 2 and when you get
your hands on one it feels totally
different so analysts say it stands to
reason that a new model is on its way
this is a product that no one knew is
going to be as popular as it is so they
don't they don't have to do a whole lot
at this point so the more they do the
better Apple is notoriously tight-lipped
about any of the details surrounding new
products but some of the rumors are more

screen resolution with the iphone and
the ipod touch they've kind of moved to
this thing that they call the retina
display and technically that just means
that when you're holding it about a foot
away you can't really see the pixels
also Apple experts like seen its josh
lowensohn say to expect better cameras
it was one kind of big shortcomings in
the too and it's an area where they can
very easily kind of do a little
adjustment and have a lot of positive
benefit come out of it and it could be
faster with an upgrade to a quad-core
processor moving up to four maybe give
you some faster installation speeds I
might also like games run faster one
feature that everyone would like to see
on a new version of the ipad is siri the
talking personal assistant ipad users we
spoke with in san francisco had other
features in mind probably a better
keyboard yes you could use him like a
laptop more portable than my my macbook
perhaps flash capabilities I can't view
a lot of the websites that I'd like to
view because they're in flash if the
rumors are true apple is expected to
announce this new iPad during the first
week of march in San Francisco I'm Kara
