but you've been intimidated by both the
price and the type of calorie you want
then maybe this model is the one for you
this is a first look at the lack of tea
I'm Alexis Avedis for CNET like a whole
bunch of other Locker models that have
come before it this one has premium
quality as the name of the game its hewn
from 1.2 kilograms of pure aluminium and
it takes another 45 minutes to polish
this by hand resulting in a really nice
smooth finish and it's a unibody design
so basically the only parts that are
added on to it are the pop-up flash and
the two control dials at the top as well
as a 3.7 inch touch screen at the back
and a little flap here for inserting
your memory cards inside the Leica T it
is a brand new mirrorless
interchangeable-lens system including a
brand new lens mount which is a team out
if you have old Leica M lenses you can
also get an adapter and this will also
let you use them easily also on the
outside as I mentioned it's very simple
there's no real other physical buttons
apart from your shutter button your
power button these two control dials and
a simple video recording button apart
from the controls on the top of the
camera all of your interactions with the
Leica T happens through the touch screen
fortunately it's super responsive and
really easy to use
first up at the top here on the right we
have a selection of your modes including
program full manual and aperture and
shutter priority you also have a couple
of scene modes to choose from as well if
you just like to keep it on automatic
going back just hit the back button
which as you saw is nice and simple the
rest of your controls are found within
this camera icon here so this includes
things like you're shooting resolution
your exposure compensation white balance
Y fire control and Heat small if you
don't like the way this menus been set
up though you can do it totally
customized to your liking you just need
to get a screwdriver and wrench icon up
here press and hold and drag over here
and you'll find that it shows up on the
main menu now that one that was already
there but we'll add another one
wasn't there such as scroll down video
resolution
press and hold drag over here back go
back into the menu we'll find that video
resolutions being placed right here same
thing for removing if you want to get
rid of things say like your AF mode hit
and drag and it's all gone so nice and
simple to use really easy to customize
as well the screen itself super bright
super easy to use as I mentioned and if
you want to go into playback mode that
one is quite hard to find because there
is no actual physical playback button
I'll give you a hint you just simply
drag from the top and it goes into the
latest photo and you can just interact
with the camera just like any other
smartphone tablet device that you used
to scrolling back and forth if you want
to zoom in simple just pinch to zoom and
move around like so the lens is an 18
256 millimeter lens it's not
particularly fast it's F 3.5 25.6 so
it's pretty much a standard kaitland and
it pretty much costs the same as to like
a t body itself a little part of me dies
inside knowing that I'm paying the same
amount for kit lens as the body but it
is like and there is obviously no
compromise when it comes to image
quality and that comes through in a lot
of the test shots that I've been taking
image is a super sharp it is beautiful
beautiful bouquet so that out-of-focus
characteristic is absolutely gorgeous
colors are vibrant as well the other
thing I wanted to talk to you quickly
about on the lack of tea is there is a
little electronic viewfinder this is an
optional extra attachment but it's nice
and bright and obviously if you're using
it in outdoor situations this is the
Jing you're going to want to invest in
plus it gives you gps control as well
and finally on the side the lacquer
locking system is pretty ingenious I
have to say rather than having to fiddle
around with threading those camera
straps all you need to do is just click
and unlock the strap and it doesn't fall
out this has been a first look at the
like a tee stay tuned to seen it very
soon for a full review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
