come into the classroom and talk about
this minecraft game and they were just
engrossed in it and they were very
passionate about it so we thought as a
teaching staff we need to really look at
this game and get good sense of what
it's about I'm Craig Smith and I'm the
deputy principal at the aspect hunter
school for children on the autism
spectrum students on the autism spectrum
a very visual learners and the more that
we looked at it the more that we felt it
really reflected a lot of the core
characteristics of autism they find
abstractions difficult and problem
solving and convey a tricky thing
our teachers started to put together
lessons around minecraft and to share
them with each other and to talk about
the different ways you could use them
and we ended up with such a really big
Bank of all these really interesting
lessons that use minecraft that we were
able to put together a textbook called
minecraft in your classroom
conceptualizing time can be quite an
abstract notion to talk about that
process of change and we did a series of
lessons on Sidney Nolan's led kelly
series of artworks the students
recreated those artwork so you have
these beautiful big sculptures inside of
the Minecraft world what was fantastic
was the students could see what the same
painting would have looked like at night
for first thing of the morning and to
get a sense of her time changes and
transitions around in objects like this
painting together so we've seen Hamish
take a real big interest in in Minecraft
and it's also helped him engage in other
areas of the curriculum he would go to
the library and often wander around a
bit aimlessly before and he'll look at
lots of other books now as well to try
and think oh you know what can I create
in Minecraft to challenge himself it's
been a big pride moment for me because
I'm a gamer and have been the years I
play MechWarrior a lot so he's now
making mechs in Minecraft
it's him reaching out in a different way
to try and get attention so it's it's
been good for me in some senses because
it shows me just what we can do that way
as a parent you're always concerned
about how much screen time your children
take on but I think when it is used in a
way that's creative and enjoyable
so has that learning aspect to it I
think it's um a real big benefit
minecraft gives the children a smaller
version of the world to test things out
they're able to test our social skills
practice rules and are able to
understand the world on a level that's
very manageable to them and apply that
into bigger social situations in the
real world and that transfer of skill
from the game into the real world is a
really exciting thing for our students</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
