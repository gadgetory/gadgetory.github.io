jam box and I home before they started
about 80 bucks and promised Wireless
music streaming from your phone computer
or tablet but what if you've already got
speakers that you like but wish they had
that wireless Bluetooth feature I'm
Sharon Vaknin for CNET with a quick
guide to making any speakers Bluetooth
compatible to get this done you'll need
a Bluetooth adapter there are several on
the market including ones from Sony and
Belkin but today I'll use the Logitech
wireless speaker adapter it's 30 bucks
and adds bluetooth to any speaker with
an auxilary input or a pair of powered
speakers the setup is simple just grab
the adapter and plug it into an outlet
it's a little annoying that it requires
power but that's a small price to pay
for wireless streaming now plug your
speaker's into the appropriate
connection I'll use auxilary for these
guys now press the connect button on the
top in a couple seconds you'll hear a
little alert come through the speakers
to let you know they're all set so
that's it you can use these speakers
with just about any Bluetooth ready
device which sadly doesn't include
either nuke tablets or the Kindle Fire
but to test it out let's see how it
works with my iPhone first I have to
pair my phone with the speakers so I'll
head to my Bluetooth settings and scan
for devices until Logitech shows up I'll
tap to connect it and now I can start
streaming music when you play a song
your device should automatically stream
the music to the speakers
but if it doesn't just change the audio
output using the appropriate settings
for the iPhone that option is here and
if you have an Android you'll find that
option here now one thing to note is
that when you string music over
Bluetooth some compression will happen
so expect slightly lower audio quality
if that turns you off you can look into
airplay products for iOS devices or
Wi-Fi based streaming products but
they're much more expensive than this
$30 adapter if you have any questions
