CES 2017 we are coming to you live from
Las Vegas and also i'm here with Scott
sign i'm brian Tong we are two men who
can't use our iphones but have them
nearest because we need them as security
blankets it's a it's a sad cold world we
live in today it's a mobile age we'll
recap the products and the trends that
are making news here at CES and first up
we got a chance to talk to hear one
these are these wireless earbuds they
came on stage and I got to experience
them for the first time really I know
you've been able to try them in the best
way that I can describe them to the
audience you guys can see that in this
video is these are earbuds that
basically have a computer inside them we
joked around calling them care puters or
compute here's that will never take off
of me those will never be they didn't
like the hero bowls either they're like
we've heard them all but not hear bells
listening thingies I got me called
headphones people is they look better
than the air pots for sure but what
these do is they're able to filter out
sound but even cooler really augment the
sound around you they had a gentleman
talking over here I couldn't hear them
they turn on this filter that allows me
to hear anything that's facing me in a
direction I turn that way and I heard
him loud and clear it was and you can
little behind you an array of six mics
and so it's combination of noise
cancelling and enhancing you can set the
levels of music and they were saying
they want to go into some level of
augmented audio technology augmented
reality for audio so you can start
having voices of things that aren't
there or maybe mommy I have voices in my
head Lusa nations but it could be like
if you're if you're at a sporting event
you want to focus on what the game you
look in the play what happened based on
what you're looking at or the museum
you're looking at the art and it starts
to talk to you who knows what by
yourselves the sounds great better and
better every time we keep talking about
it though it was really awesome it was
awesome tech and they're coming out soon
yeah they're gonna be available for 299
they're called here one and just check
them out or if you have a chance to
watch our video on our site because it
blew me away but something that might
blow us away for different reasons do
you want to talk about this guy uh there
are many mysteries at CES putting the
all the things hidden in Eureka park and
David Carr know yet seen the hush me
which looks like one of the concept art
designs for bein
you you wear these on your mouth if you
would like or around your neck their
neck band headphones they are meant for
privacy if you're worried about who's
listening in on your phone calls I guess
you could talk and it will it will mask
audio and send out different noises for
it and not weird at all totally everyday
normal so this case to honor the hush me
or maybe we called the couche couche may
push may push may I pulled up some of
the 10 most popular quotes from bein and
I'd like to in honor of this product
just recreate one okay we will destroy
Gotham then when it is gone the Gotham
is officers and you have my permission
to die that's pretty was that pretty
good I can't make it for dinner tonight
for a large Mart on stage alright also
other interesting the interesting things
here right yeah going from that design
totally practical that you probably will
want to buy Nvidia shield actually has
one of the best streaming boxes out
there David Katz merits cnet loves it
I've used it a lot it's great I'm it's
it's what's great as it plays lots of
videos it also plays games locally and
it can stream from your PC the new one
adds a double dose of extra stuff first
of all it's gonna be Google assistant
connected and it's going to listen and
tap into Google services which is great
and also is able to connect to smart
home stuff so all of a sudden hey now
your shield turns on your lights or
handles all your stuff like a little
echo but it's like a Google home it also
in videos can be selling a little plug
connectors so you could connect in other
parts of your home kind of like the echo
dot so that's coming out really soon and
existing shield owners are going to get
updates I think it's a super underrated
device quite honestly it doesn't get
enough love and also I don't know if you
mention it because sometimes I zone out
when I stare into your eyes but it does
simple it also supports a HDR and 4k
streams you didn't say that no but you
I'm saying thank you i also got lost in
your eyes that is a very good point HDR
it can even I think can I've been HDR
through Plex if you're into that and and
it can stream them so that's really cool
really cool so I'll say really cool one
more time say it one more time really
cool you know what's also you know it's
also really cool sneakers that tell you
when you're tired I'm
a sneakerhead and under armour showed
off their Gemini sneakers here they have
sensors in them and basically obviously
under armour had a first generation last
year they can detect right your steps
but what was interesting is they have
the ability to kind of calibrate or
create a baseline and understand when
you're getting tired as the day goes on
based on you know that reaction time and
from that baseline I thought that was
for that that's interesting because when
I'm tired with my shoes I just stop
moving and now it's saying no we want to
test that we want to make sure jump up
and down six times and these are Gemini
shoes they're jumping Megan Megan
Wharton is jumping up and down to prove
how these work they really do now under
armour i connect to choose last year I
got to wear them around they work
they're only good for so many miles I
guess running shoes are kind of
disposable by design if you're a runner
I'm not a runner but they say that is
true so but that's a new feature and
under armour is making more things
including a Tom Brady Tom Brady pajamas
did hear about that the connected
sleeping I would not wear those but
there's a large audience that might
enjoy that everything yeah audience Tom
Brady pajamas yes or no a lot la DiNozzo
the lady with the thumb the big thumbs
down sorry Tommy really sorry Ryan
Fitzpatrick pajamas that's next time
please that that's that's for a small
minority of fans that even know who ryan
fitzpatrick is jets joke always good for
that the crowded general for the general
viewing audience so keep going deeper
and and weirder but also I think it's
art emerging tech that I think could be
really practical I really like and I
talked to them on the stage you probably
see this on the floor but you people
don't like how long or short the battery
life on smart watches and fitness
trackers is but I matrix Industries has
got a technology using thermal gradients
both of them who founded matrix
industries both co-founders at
backgrounds in thermal electrics and
they believe that this that can power
itself through body heat so we tested
they want to put this not on a watch
which they also say is with the most
accurate calorimeter because it's
actually measuring your body heat but
they want to put this in sensors to go
to Internet of Things smart home stuff
even medical explorations to
ad self-powering sensors that you don't
need to recharge the batteries for so if
you start having this I mean if that
really working you put in a smart grade
and start having things you don't have
to replace in very low power sensors
this is an ambi chip that they said is
low power enough that it will charge up
beyond a certain amount based on your
body heat and then it will stay in
standby mode for two years but basically
so it's crazy but all it is is just an
always-on screen and steps in a watch
it's coming out this year it's
crowdfunded those are heat vents on the
sides which is weird but doesn't
generate heat but it has to cast off
heat in order to make that work so I
know you're I know you're a smart watch
guy right and for the record to prove
this theory for everyone that's watching
if I noticed that you're wearing two
watches am this is actually a CES
product this is the winnings activity at
this is their HR you're still like
Charlie yeah it's at heart rate 20-day
battery life we're gonna test that out
but speaking of longer bad are you are
you testing that is that why you're
wearing right now or you just like to
wear to what I'm gonna post this
hands-on hopefully tomorrow I wondering
give it a rest on rissa rissa on not
hand risks on deep rest on deep blue Sun
wristed we haven't come a wrist of all
first of all wrist wrist wrist of you
and this is just an apple watch you
heard about those yeah you might have
heard about that so that's that's the
thing I like I mean the VR I talked
about that yesterday VR which is a cover
all the time it's the stuff here is more
for developers I tracking project alloy
which is like you move around but I
don't think it's as cool looking as
hollow lens and you know we're all
waiting for like the next development of
oculus rift or what's going on
PlayStation VR but they just spend so
much money on making that hardware they
want to make software now and the show
is about hardware so I think in smart
glasses didn't fit over my glasses two
different makers I'm sorry that my eyes
are fine better than 20 20 still I'm
envious can you see my face if you take
your glasses off no well I see a blur
like an impressionistic tongue s it's
nice it's learn I liked it soft soft
soft soft and fluffy also at CES we
always have these moments that sometimes
stick out and we wanted to give you our
moment of enlightenment from Charles
Barkley who we got to talk to a little
earlier yesterday what's your take on
social media in general I think social
media just
losers to feel like they important they
get the voice their pain on every single
thing in the world there's probably some
good quality to it but the problem is we
made it where every loser out there get
some oysters opinion every subject in
the world and everybody paying doesn't
matter unfortunately and unfortunately
the more success you have the more hate
comes at you at different times so I
have chosen to eliminate all social
media from my world now is there any
tech things that you like to use are you
even use anything like uber or anything
like that you got to use lube or you got
to use your computer i mean that's some
great stuff happens I got just and I
don't do Twitter Facebook and Instagram
and that type of crap listen you can't
survive in this world without technology
and its getting bigger and better every
year okay Charles I've got something to
show you here okay I'm not going to
freak you out here when we talk about
technology and it's a combination of
maybe to your one of your favorite
worlds have you have you seen these you
know what these might be I think that's
the laces up like yes it's the self
lacey to now what what if this existed
back in your day I mean silly stupid
listening you know I'm starting to get
nervous with America is the greatest
country in the world but now we got
everybody so lazy now we've got a
self-driving cars I like if you're too
lazy to lace up your own shoes or
something wrong with you like we're
making things some easier for Americans
the other countries are passing us back
and we're just so stupid and lazy we got
the first of all I love Mikey yes but I
don't need anybody lacing my shoes I'm
never if I ever get that lazy I like to
do stuff man i cut my own grass that's
important yeah i watched my own clothing
but we gotta quit making stuff so easy
for America that's why we're so fat and
lazy alright a Charles thanks so much no
problem thank you for having me all
right thank you like we said our moment
of enlightenment and then I don't know
if the crew has us in the back I wanted
a tweeting as he's telling me the social
medias for losers send the sin that send
that tweet away I don't know if the back
houses photo I wanted to send this to
you is day two of CES I know sometimes
we might feel like this picture but I
just wanted to tell you that it gets
better there you go ladies and gentlemen
our moment of CES day too that's me
explains a lot in how many of us might
be feeling at this moment all right we
will be back at 11 a.m. pacific for
cnet's final top 10 products for CES
2017 and somebody tells me that's not
