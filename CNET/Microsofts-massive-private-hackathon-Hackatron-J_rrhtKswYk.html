the largest private hackathon in the
world is happening right behind me as
part of Microsoft's of one week that
happens every year it was started by
Satya Nadella the current CEO as a way
to inspire new innovation at Microsoft
among the things that come out of it are
some interesting products like the Xbox
adaptive controller for people with
disabilities and dyslexia technology
that is in a lot of Microsoft software
these days so let's take a look at
what's inside we're all here to
participate in a hackathon or in the
packet Ron tent today and we've decided
to focus on the Xbox and how we could
expand that platform to go through four
therapeutics so what kind of
therapeutics Ike explain that to me so
there's a lot of different therapeutics
that people utilize some for autism
maybe some for a sports injury I think a
lot of people have had maybe an ankle
injury where they've had to use a fan or
a wrist injury where they've had to use
a ball all of those kind of can be
boring and for parents that may have to
take the kids back and forth or autism
visits they don't actually do a lot of
the exercises at home and so when there
doing those exercises they're not
getting the betterment of themselves in
it and so thinking about could we make
that Xbox enable those therapies we're
working in a little bit of hardware hack
to see if there would be maybe a glove
that could fit for maybe a ball injuries
that could see and connect it up to some
wires and connect it to the Xbox with a
new adaptive controller because it has
the ability to have another plug so that
then we can utilize a game for those
activities so this is smart tattoos so
this is temporary tattoos that enable
you to have capacitive touch so you can
then troll things in your environment
from your skin or other surfaces via
Bluetooth so it's next generation
wearables with the fabrication processes
that are easy enough to for anyone to do
and and your goal with this hackathon is
just to show all the different ways it
can be used yeah essentially I mean we
can't think of everything so the goal
was to come up with a fabrication
process that would facilitate anybody in
the company to play with it whether they
want to augment their controllers
prosthetics before ability or for
disability and
so we're gonna demo so we've got an
instrument on the arm that actually
anyone can play their own instruments so
and you can also change the instrument
so think the next generation bands are
musicians or even dancers who want to
you know play music yeah and then we
also have other instantiations of being
able to control things in your
environment oh wow so I can just turn on
the different ways yeah right so
basically via bluetooth we can send
signals to anywhere right so this kind
of opens up the door and this is why
we're here today so that we can get
people to kind of play and experiment so
that's a look at some of the projects
happening under this big tent at this
hackathon you want to learn more you can
go to see Netcom or you can follow me on
twitter at Ian's shirt meanwhile I'm
gonna look at some more cool new stuff
