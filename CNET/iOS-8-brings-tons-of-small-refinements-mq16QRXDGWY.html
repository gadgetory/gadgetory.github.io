bringing useful changes across the board
for both your iphone and ipad i'm jason
parker for cnet and this is a first look
at iOS 8 now this isn't a major redesign
like we saw in iOS 7 so won't
drastically change the way you use your
iPhone but what it does bring is a
multitude of smaller refinements and
many of the core apps to make things
easier and more efficient let's start
with a camera at that now lets you shoot
time-lapse videos just pointed at the
clouds or a busy intersection and the
app delivers a great time lapse
experience but even for regular shots
you have more ways to make photos look
better with smart sliders that adjust
brightness and provide color correction
while making several smaller adjustments
behind the scenes when we want to browse
your photos you use the Photos app and
it receives some nice changes as well a
new search field lets you tap to see
search suggestions or you can search on
a date or location to zero in on the
photos you want next let's look at
messaging the messages app has gotten
some stiff competition from third-party
apps like whatsapp messenger and kick
but new changes close the gap with some
cool new features you'll now be able to
record a quick audio clip for capturing
the scene around you with sound and you
can send your location so your friends
can find you it also has a new details
page that lets you quickly browse all
the photos and attachments for a chat in
one place one of the biggest new
additions to iOS 8 is an NFC payment
system called Apple pay unfortunately
you'll need an iphone 6 or the new Apple
watch to use these features but Apple as
deals with several of the biggest stores
and there are sure to be more added in
the future to pay for a purchase you can
just hold up your phone to a wireless
pay device and use the fingerprint
scanner to confirm your purchase next a
new keyboard and support for third-party
keyboards is going to make a lot of
people happy because apps like SwiftKey
will be coming to iphone but even the
keyboard in iOS 8 get some help with
predictive text much like what you see
on Android the cool thing is whether
texting or sending an email it remembers
how you talk to specific people so will
predict more slang terms for your
buddies but give you more formal
suggestions when you're talking to your
boss Apple's health app will track your
vitals by bringing together all your
health data in one place it will work
with third-party hardware like the
jawbone and Fitbit and it will also work
with third-party apps to know
by the Mayo Clinic for example to get
word to your doctor in an emergency the
health app will track all your fitness
apps and wearables at once to give you a
comprehensive look at your overall
health it's also loaded with categories
to help you track everything from iron
intake two flights of stairs traveled
with data points you can enter yourself
Apple's iOS 8 has hundreds of changes in
all and there's not enough time to show
them all here but check out my review at
cnet com to get all the details about
iOS 8 i'm jason parker for cnet and this
is a first look at iOS 8 thanks for
