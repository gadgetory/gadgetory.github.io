numbered while the next-gen iPhones get
a new paint job let's get down to the
core of Apple news and rumors starting
right now we begin today's show well
pretty much the same way we've been
starting off for the past couple of
weeks now with yet another iPhone 10
leaked this time another render from
Casemaker go stick these images
published in Forbes and SlashGear
featured the same iPhone housed in one
of their cases this is not the first
render we've seen from the company
meaning they seem to be pretty sure
they've got the specs right for this
budget iPhone 6.1 inch LCD display with
slightly thicker bezels as shown in this
concept by Ben Gaskin with that true
depth camera array on the knotch and
single rear-facing camera and by budget
they should really say entry-level
because it's rumored to be priced at
around $700 that's the same price of an
iPhone 8 longtime analyst Ming chief Guo
also helped shed some light on the new
iPhones last week when he revealed new
colors for both lineups his report cited
in 95 Mac states that the less expensive
model will come in gray white red blue
and orange a color gamut reminiscent of
the iPhone 5c the more expensive second
gen iPhone 10 and iPhone 10 plus would
get a new Gold Edition with a dual SIM
option on the plus similar to what you
see here from concept I phones and with
two months to go til the event I would
be willing to bet that these rumors are
getting pretty close to becoming reality
but the new batch of iPhones could spell
doom for the original iPhone 10 as
rumors continue to surface about Apple's
plans to kill it off before the end of
the year according to bluefin analysts
cited in a Barron's report Apple would
discontinue its 10th anniversary iPhone
to prevent it from cannibalizing sales
of the new iPhone trio which this report
refers to as the iPhone
and 11 plus at this point I think the
biggest question mark at least for me
here is what these phones are actually
going to be called a few months ago
Michiko also shared a similar prediction
about the iPhone 10 the other casualty
here the iPhone se not only have we lost
all hopes of getting a sequel to Apple's
tiny budget phone this year now we've
learned Apple may be planning to scrap
the existing se altogether after the
launch we've also been hearing rumors
about a refresh to Apple's MacBook
lineup now these rumors have been around
for a while but the latest ones seems to
suggest that it will happen sooner
rather than later
last week French sight console Mac
pointed out that Apple has registered
new Macs and iPads with the Eurasian
Economic Commission the report lists
five model numbers that could correspond
to a 13-inch pro with and without a
touch bar a 15-inch pro maybe a refresh
to the 12-inch MacBook and hopefully a
new MacBook Air like this beauty right
here and you may have noticed the new
iOS 11 point 4.1 update this week and
though it's pretty minor there are some
things to point out apple says it
includes the usual bug fixes and improve
security for the iphone and ipad but
there's actually an entirely new
security feature now hiding in your
settings USB restricted mode basically
shuts off data transfer to new USB
accessories if it's been more than an
hour since you last unlocked your iphone
this in turn will make it harder for law
enforcement or hackers for that matter
to break into your iPhone through the
Lightning port Apple characterizes the
new mode as closing a security hole not
a way to lock out the cops but yeah
we'll take it
Apple also updated watch OS and TV OS
in March of 2008 Steve Jobs took the
stage to announce a platform where
developers could get their creations
into the hands of all iPhone users and
the way we're gonna do it is what we
call the app store this is an
application we've written to deliver
apps to the iPhone and we're gonna put
it on every single iPhone with the next
release of the software on July 10
marked the 10th anniversary of that
software update that brought the App
Store to life alongside 500 I phone apps
since then the App Store has grown to
house over 2 million apps and generated
a hundred billion dollars for developers
which apps have topped the charts
according to an app any report the
Facebook app has been the most
downloaded app of all time followed by
messenger
YouTube Instagram and whatsapp but
that's not necessarily where people are
spending most of their time that number
one spot belongs to Netflix then Spotify
Pandora radio Chinese video streaming
app called $0.10 and tinder is at number
5 streaming services may dominate our
screen time now but back in 2010 it was
an app called Documents To Go where
users spent most of their time this five
dollar document reader allowed you to
view and sometimes edit Word docs PDFs
powerpoints and Excel Doc's back in a
more productive era when we actually
used phones as more of a business tool
than a way to binge watch shows and
stock people on social media here's
hoping the next 10 years of the app
store brings back a little more
productivity to our digital life hey
