Google issues for everything inside the
world of Google and let's are off by
catching you up on the latest galaxy
note 7 developments now according to a
ventureBeat report and a carrier
document the galaxy note 7 is expected
to resume being on sale in the United
States on October the 21st now that's a
full month after they begin sending out
replacement phones Samsung will start
selling the note 7 in South Korea on
September the 28th but it's still not
clear when sales will start back up in
other regions now Samsung has officially
announced how consumers will be able to
tell the difference between the older
Note sevens at risk of you know
exploding and the new batch once they
start rolling out a new green battery
icon through software will be visible in
three places on the new note 7s one is
on the status bar the always-on display
screen and the third the power off
prompt screen now a black square symbol
will also appear on the label of the
packaging to indicate this is a new note
7 plus you can still use Samsung IMEI or
serial number tool through their website
now we also wanted to make a correction
that last week the boy that was
reportedly burned by an O 7 was actually
burned by a Samsung core Prime and not a
note 7 the updated information happened
after we already posted the show so we
wanted to clear that up also a new
report by Bloomberg now claims Samsung
rushed the note 7 launched to take
advantage of rumors of a dull iPhone in
hopes of capitalizing for themselves
it's now one of the biggest setbacks and
blunders the korean giant has ever seen
the report says the top brass at samsung
including phone chief DJ co decided to
accelerate the launch of the note 7 they
push suppliers to meet tighter deadlines
despite adding multiple flagship
features like their edge wrapping screen
iris recognition and more powerful and
faster charging battery now Samsung
isn't just a phone company
they are literally woven into the
culture of South Korea beyond consumer
electronics I've seen it during my time
there and it's really a huge blow to
their psyche and internally employees
have also called this fiasco humiliating
now like I've said before it's a damn
shame but it can sometimes make for some
you know really good memes
and in other Android phone use LG's v20
their latest flagship phone with a dual
lens camera and one of the first
companies to bring a dual lens camera to
the market as far back as 2011 it's
rumored to be going on sale October 21st
in the United States and that sounds
familiar it's because it's also the date
that the note 7 is rumored to be going
back on sale in the US as well and if
you're looking for an unlocked moto Z
really the best modular phone that we've
seen to date and yes it still has a way
to go but it's truly innovating come on
Aztec fans we should all appreciate it
now that phone will go up on Amazon on
October the 2nd in the US you can
pre-order the lunar gray model of the 64
gig unlocked Moto Z for $6.99 and lots
of news in the software side for the
googs
Evan blast tweeted out that Google a low
their new messaging app will be released
this week on September the 21st which is
the last day of summer and when Google
promised to get the app out by also
Google has announced a new app called
Google trips that lets you manage and
organize everything about your vacations
in one place so check this out it stores
all your trip information offline so
you'll always have it and make
suggestions during your trip based on
what's nearby and a feature called day
plans it looks like a nice travel
companion and it's available now on the
Play Store and iOS App Store and Google
is also making it easier to share your
Google photos with friends we know that
our friends are all on different types
of services so now all you do is pick
the contacts you want to receive your
photos and it will send them out a
notification on their phone if they're a
Google user or an SMS text with a link
instead of bouncing around multiple apps
for yourself so that's pretty sweet
alright that's gonna do it for this
week's show you can always email me at
Google issues at cnet.com or tweet me at
brian tong thank so much for watching
we'll catch y'all next time for some
more of that foolishness
