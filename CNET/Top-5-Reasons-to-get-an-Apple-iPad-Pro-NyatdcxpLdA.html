count down all kinds of things
I'm your host Aya's Akhtar let's talk a
little bit about the Apple iPad pro the
device isn't even out yet and there are
ton of opinions out there if you want
reasons to maybe wait on purchasing an
iPad pro we've done a top 5 on that
which you can find that top 5 dot
cnet.com in the interest of fairness
we're going to take a look at the top
five reasons why buying an iPad pro
could be a good idea at number five
speakers speakers speakers and speakers
Apple crammed in for speakers into this
giant tablet the iPad air 2 suffered
from pretty quiet speakers that should
not be a problem here
apple says the iPad pro will pump out up
to three times more output than any
other iPad so while the iPad pro might
be large you won't need to carry a
Bluetooth speaker to hear it
at number four for some it can replace a
laptop there are people out there who
are perfectly content using a phone or a
tablet as their primary computer if
you're one of those people the iPad pro
looks like a good idea
even without the smart keyboard cover
the on-screen keyboard should be quite
usable in landscape mode the big screen
should ensure you can still see your
work even if half the screen is taken up
by that keyboard at number three for a
monster tablet it's actually pretty
light 1.57 pounds that's the weight of
the iPad pro which is a sense of the
size of two iPad air screens jammed
together Apple made mention that the new
iPad pro weighs just a little bit more
than the original iPad at one point five
pounds seen that Scott Stein got to
handle the iPad pro at the unveiling and
said the weight distribution is quite
nice the iPad pro isn't as dense as the
original iPad so it's relatively
manageable to hold and number two the
accessories are pretty cool they don't
come cheap but the Apple pencil stylus
and the smart keyboard cover make the
iPad pro a different kind of iPad yes
they seem awful familiar hi Microsoft
Surface accessories and I maintain those
are cool accessories for the Microsoft
Surface as well the iPad pro also
introduced a new connector the three pen
smart connector for its keyboard cover
Logitech even announced it will release
a new iPad pro keyboard so expect third
parties to jump on the smart connector
bandwagon
and at number one it's the most serious
iPad ever this is the machine that iOS 9
was truly built for the ability to have
two iPad apps running at one time and
picture-in-picture video that should
work really well in the iPad pro on top
of that it's got a faster processor than
the iPad air 2 and according to some
reports it has double the RAM of the
iPad air 2 as well additionally this
tablet looks to be aimed at both
creative professionals and people
looking for productivity Apple brought
Adobe on stage during this presentation
to show off three new apps including a
couple of Photoshop apps Apple also had
Microsoft on to show off its office iPad
apps which looks truly at home on a
tablet go figure
now I'm sure this list Rumpel some
feathers which makes me ask the
following question why are you wearing
feathers anyway let me know your
opinions in the comments section or on
twitter i'm matt is thanks for watching
and i'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
