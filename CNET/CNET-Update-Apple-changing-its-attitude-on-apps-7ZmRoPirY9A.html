I'm Bridget Carey and this is your CNET
update Apple dropped a ton of software
news on Monday at its annual Developers
Conference and in the last update show I
gave you a quick rundown of the big
changes to the operating systems on
mobile and Mac computers but there were
several tiny changes that could make a
big impact
Apple is loosening its grip of
controlling what apps can do and the
developers now can tinker more with the
iPhone experience they can make new
styles of on-screen keyboards which was
off limits before future apps will be
able to use the fingerprint scanner on
the home button so you can bet some apps
will use it for mobile payments or added
banking security and speaking of
payments Apple is reversing its stance
on Bitcoin it updated its guidelines for
apps to be able to use approved virtual
currencies so maybe we'll see a Bitcoin
payment app again on the iPhone the
notification pull down menu will have
interactive alerts and widgets for
example you could increase your bid on
eBay from the notifications bar instead
of going into the app you can download
extensions to the Safari web browser so
apps like Pinterest can make it easy to
share from a website now this increased
programming freedom is starting to sound
a little like Android isn't it but there
is a price for this freedom Apple also
rolled out changes that could make you
feel locked into their world if Apple
makes it annoying to jump to another
system like Android then you'll be
encouraged to keep buying all Apple
products messaging photos and iCloud
drive are the key to keep you in Apple's
universe if apps on an iPhone talk
easily to the Mac well then you won't
want to mix and match Apple with Windows
or Android now Apple wants to hook you
in with more photo editing tools but
Google is still putting up a good fight
Google updated the Google Plus app on
iOS with new photo sharing and photo
editing tools the changes rolled out to
Android last month but they're now on
the iPhone and iPad also in mobile there
has been lots of attention on wearable
computers like smartwatches
and many new Android model
we'll be coming out this year we're
still waiting to see what Apple is
working on but one company has an idea
where you can smarten up your existing
watch whenever you want to the product
is called glance and it's a Bluetooth
accessory that slips onto the band of
your watch the screen can alert you to
messages or calls it uses motion sensors
for fitness tracking and you can even
use it as a clickable air mouse remote
using your hand gestures it's not the
most stylish gadget but it is different
a $70 pledge on Kickstarter can get you
one
that's your tech news update you can
