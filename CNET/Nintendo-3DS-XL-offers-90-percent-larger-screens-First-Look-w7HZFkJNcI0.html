Bakalar for cnet.com and today we are
taking a first look at the Nintendo 3ds
XL now just about a year and a half
after the 3ds is launched Nintendo is
releasing a super-sized version of the
3ds called the 3ds XL most noticeable
are the screen improvements you're
getting 90 percent larger screens on the
top and bottom with the 3ds XL
unfortunately though Nintendo didn't use
this opportunity to fix a bunch of Miss
steps that happen the first time around
most obvious of all of them is a right
circle pad which is not here on the
device I don't know if you remember but
they released an attachment for the
original 3ds called the circle pad pro
that made it really bulky I can only
imagine how ridiculous the 3ds XL is
going to look like when that attachment
comes out for this which it will
supposedly come out later this year
other than that functionally the two are
exactly identical games look really good
on this screen on the XL and it's
actually only a few millimeters smaller
than what the PlayStation Vita has right
now now because the screens are bigger
that doesn't mean the resolution is any
bigger so there's the same amount of
pixels when you blow up that image it's
going to look a little more pixelated
and sometimes a little more blurry than
how sharp the original 3ds looked that
aside the battery life is a lot better
they made some improvements with the
bottom row three buttons which is
definitely a step up from the past they
include a four gigabyte card in this
model as opposed to the old 2 gigabyte
card and other than that you're getting
the same identical version the 3ds was
sort of glossy and for the XL Nintendo
chose a much more matted look definitely
feels heavier but that's a good thing
because the 3ds was almost too small
didn't feel right in your hands the XL
is much more ergonomically friendly
overall if you're going to choose
between the two
obviously the XL is the way to go this
is really the unit Nintendo should have
shipped from the gecko this is going to
go for $30 more than what the current
3ds is
now so the 3ds is 170 the new one is at
200 it comes in red and black and blue
and black to start and that's going to
do it for this first look I'm Jeff
