people your only question about the
iPhone 4 at this point is white or black
I'm Brian Cooley with another see net
top 5 let's head for the cliff and find
out the top 5 reasons you just got a
rush out and buy an iPhone 4 even if it
means choosing between heating your home
or feeding your children
number 5 better antennas ok this one
sounds really boring but what cell
phones do is really magic a tiny
battery-powered radio in the palm of
your hand that can do voice calls emails
texts load web pages stream media to
video calls and all that while talking
to a tower up to several miles away the
iPhone fours antennas are now right
around the outside edge but without
being one of those goofy external
jobbies we had in the 90s and the
iPhones antennas might now even function
as a hand warmer but that wouldn't be
good
number four two cameras the main one on
the back is now 5 megapixels and there's
a tiny new one on the front for video
calling it shows you to the person on
the other end while you see them on your
screen an apples FaceTime app promises
to make the whole process easy and
pretty now you've got to have an iPhone
4 on both ends of the call and it's not
like we need another technology to
enable self-absorption but you know this
one's a huge crowd-pleaser
number 3 multitasking ok consumers don't
walk in the cell phone stores with
multitasking on their lips but they do
ask for fast and powerful and
multitasking does that and lets the
iPhone 4 now truly do multiple things at
once and that always feels fast like
with the two cameras Apple's actually
playing a bit of catch-up in this area
but when Apple plays catch-up everyone
calls it innovation number 2 HD video
and how the iPhone 4 can not only shoot
720p HD video it can also edit in phone
with a mini version of iMovie and upload
directly to YouTube
Mobile me send via MMS or email
this sort of thing is really Apple's
strong suit but even if they made a hash
of it wouldn't you love to have a phone
that means you can stop carrying a flip
video camera with that goofy little USB
thing that sticks out before we get to
number one pricing iPhone 4 is going to
be either 2 or $300 with a new contract
or a reappear it's for your blood
don't forget the 3GS remains on the
market for just under a hundred bucks
now our number one reason why you just
gotta have an iPhone 4 the Retina
display this whole business about 326
pixel per inch resolution via an IPS
transistor matrix or may sound like the
kind of stuff geeks bout to compensate
but let's put it this way it'll look
like ink not dots got it yeah the one
feature you always use on a smartphone
is the display and it's also the first
thing that Wow's somebody's sitting next
to you at the bar so yeah retina is
gonna pay dividends like BP did before
the Gulf that's it for this edition of
top 5 folks look at your iPhone 4 and
shoot and edit and upload a better
version of this show and then send me
the link I'm Brian Cooley I'll see you
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
