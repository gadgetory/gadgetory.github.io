search perk I'm Bridget Carey this is
your cnet update
appletv will soon be stretching its
eerie powers so you can use your voice
to enter in all sorts of searches and
even speak your password instead of
hunting and pecking through an on-screen
keyboard with your remote or by reaching
for your iphone or ipad to type it out
the new Apple TV already does have
series so you can search for movies or
shows by talking into the remote control
but the update let's use your voice to
search for more things like apps the
features are not available to everyone
yet only developers can access these
perks in a beta version of the new TV
operating system software that's TV OS
9.2 that means most people probably
won't see this until the spring but
maybe we'll hear more about it next
month it's not official yet but there
are reports that apple is planning to
hold a presentation on March fifteenth
to announce new products and that could
be when we hear about updates to the
Apple watch a new iPad and maybe even a
new smaller screen variation of the
iphone meanwhile in social media land
prepared to see video advertisements at
the top of your twitter feed twitter is
selling a new video ad spot and it will
show up in the twitter app and the
desktop website twitter has been under
close watch lately with reports that it
may be changing the timeline to be more
like Facebook and sorted by popularity
or algorithms instead of showing you the
tweets in chronological order twitter is
also often criticized for not doing
enough to combat serious harassment the
network talks about not tolerating abuse
of users but many say not enough action
has been taken even former Twitter CEO
Dick Costolo once said about Twitter and
I quote we suck at dealing with abuse
and trolls months since that statement
Twitter just announced it created a
trust and safety council made up of
outsiders from 40 organizations like
safety advocates academics mental health
professionals but just how exactly this
just this league of troll fighters can
do something actionable remains to be
seen that's it for this tech news update
there's more at cnet com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
