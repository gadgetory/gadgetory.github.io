main options you got your iPad
you've got your Android tablets and then
there's the HP TouchPad BlackBerry
PlayBook Windows 8 and it is not easy
being the third horse in the tablet race
but I think Microsoft has what it takes
in fact there's already a healthy
selection of great Windows 8 tablets out
there and to help you figure out which
one is right for you I've got seen its
top picks rounded up by senior editors
Dan Ackerman and Scott Stein starting
off at number 5 the razor edge Pro this
is the first tablet designed for gaming
and it also happens to be a great
all-around Windows 8 machine built in
Nvidia graphics 256 gigabytes of storage
USB 3.0 and one very cool game
controller accessory but for all of its
power and glory it's the most expensive
tablet on this list at around $1500 and
for the core i7 version which is the
only one that's really worth your time
now it stuck on that $249 game pad and
extra battery pack and you're nearly out
to grand
ouch at number four the Samsung ativ
smart PC pro 700 T right around eleven
hundred dollars you get an 11.6 inch
Windows 8 tablet with 128 gigs of
storage Intel Core i5 and a solid little
keyboard dock that comes included also a
typical samsung style you get their
s-pen and a little place to store it on
the back sure it's kind of chunky and
the battery life isn't anywhere close to
what an iPad or Android tablet could
give you but it's a real PC for
something a little more stylish check
out number three the HP Envy x2 sells
for eight hundred dollars so we're
seeing it for $700 in some places then
clean lightweight design included
keyboard dock just like the samsung only
this one comes with an extended battery
pack built in giving you a total of 11
hours of battery life so what's the
catch well the processor isn't Adam it's
a far cry from that Intel Core i7 on the
razor edge but you're still getting a
full windows 8 experience just you know
be paid
but to save even more money go with
number two the Lenovo ThinkPad tablet to
now fall you really want is a straight
up Windows 8 tablet this guy gets you
there for six hundred and forty bucks
we're still looking at an atom processor
so keep those performance expectations
low and should you decide to upgrade
this thing with the keyboard dock you're
out 120 dollars and it doesn't even come
with a trackpad instead you're left with
one of those old-school think pad nubs
staring at you like some kind of raw
robot nipple and so that leaves us with
our number one Windows 8 tablet pick the
Microsoft Surface pro now here's a
company that doesn't typically make
their own hardware but when they do it's
beautiful thousand dollars gets you a
full Windows 8 machine with the third
gen Intel Core i5 processor a thin
compact design and a pen that
magnetically attaches to the sides
expect that you'll want to spend that
extra $130 for the keyboard cover which
we love and that keyboard cover includes
a trackpad so those are the best Windows
8 tablets out on the market you can
check out Dan and Scott's full list over
on cnn.com as well as a ranked list of
the best Android tablets and the best
tablets on a budget I'm Donald Bell
