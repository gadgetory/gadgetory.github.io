that's gonna help you kill bugs in the
air you a video showing off the future
of AR but it might be too good to be
true and a really cool online simulator
is gonna show you where hide during the
zombie apocalypse hint it is not in
kills basement it's Los Angeles there's
no basements here that's right so our
daily
Prudy citizens of the internet welcome
to tomorrow daily the best speak talk
show in the known universe I'm host
Ashley skellige Ovie's always kill
anonymous the man the myth the legend
how's it going
it's great all right happy Monday yeah
happy Monday it feels it feels good
there's a new color with some nice new
color in the set we're gonna point it
out yeah it's nice I really I really
like this color it really brings it
brings out your eyes yeah it feels like
we're not on the like the front of a
Hallmark card oh yeah look at this yeah
I look at your so go it's so good yeah
good we owe this to producer Logan we
down Frankie wonderful taste not
insecticide lighting so perfect good on
him all right so with that being said it
is Monday which means we have a lot to
get through so let's have headlines so
I'm about to tell you got a laser
flyswatter
this product has actually been in the
works for a while like years now but the
original designer kind of walked away
from it but now a company intellectual
ventures which is a big patent company
has announced that they are licensing
this thing for manufacturing is a laser
bug killer okay okay
so your lasers the future of killing
bugs obviously the future of killing
bugs so we're gonna watch some b-roll
here and I feel really bad for the
mosquitoes and this b-roll cuz they're
getting shot down like her red bears
getting taken out of the sky okay so the
thing about mosquitoes is is that you
know they're really they're extra bad in
places like Africa where there's malaria
there's there can be malaria where
there's a lot of still water and so and
there's also things like sand flies in
the Middle East which are also extremely
bad oh boy that's the smoke trail coming
out of that mosquito um so here's how it
works
the goal of the device is to make this
sort of fence around an area I love this
like crazy slow-motion video it's so
good just blast their wings off okay so
it creates a grid it kind of makes a
fence around an area and then the laser
beam used to zap the bugs is only a few
millimeters wide so I think it's between
like two and six millimeters wide but it
has a lot of range the ideal distance
for the laser to hit
a bug is 25 to 100 meters meters so 75
to 300 feet away so it's far and
basically it uses two different beams it
uses an infrared beam to actually track
the bugs and then a laser beam a 3 watt
laser to take it out of sky this really
does sound like zombie apocolypse
protection types okay so even even
crazier they are trying to figure out a
way to pinpoint because of the rate at
which mosquitoes wings flap their
differently for male and female
mosquitoes they're trying to figure out
how to make it so that the infrared beam
could track whether or not the mosquito
is male or female and then shoot down
only the female ones to save battery but
yeah so that's what they're doing that
is that's the mosquito laser I saw that
and I just I shouldn't laugh I should
not laugh at that video of them just
like let just blatantly shooting
mosquitoes out of the sky but it's it's
kind of entertaining I don't know it's
weird because if there's a lot of people
that probably be like they oh there was
a mosquito but watching that slope if
you put some sad music to it sad Hulk
music yeah put some sad music to it and
it's a completely it's not as it's not a
great story it's like our saddest story
robots where they show the people
kicking them and everything and they
make it longer robots is the same type
of thing all right tell me about magic
all right so for this story you're gonna
need to see the video so let's I mean
let's just roll right into the video
because really unbelievable video and
unbelievable is the word that I doesn't
get a stick with c4 here so this is a
magic leap okay this is this is uh wet
of showing off magic leap this video is
called just another day in the office
it's kind of showing us what can be done
with a are that at the highest level
that the that what is imagination
perfect world can go so well uh wet out
workshop helped make this magic leap
produce this video you might know some
of their other work is like Lord of the
Rings and stuff like that so there are
no strangers to graphics post-production
visual effects I love the I love
inclusion of the dr. gourd bortz
ray-guns
right because I have some at home you
just wanted to plug that anyway so love
them so they're showing off what an AR
interface can do but presumably
we don't really know which way this
video is going whether they're like we
are doing this or it can do this there's
been no response from anyone about this
as of this filming but obviously it's
showing off how you can play a game and
interact with your surroundings how your
hands can interact how you can interact
with that gourd board gun yeah like
that's the first Street like you pick up
a real life object and then use it in
your AR game it looks like a corridor
digital video yeah it feels like we've
seen stuff like this before
and it just seems like whetted toying
around and that's playing with our pets
I had I had a very guttural reaction to
it - yeah I got me so excited you got
excited I did not get excited cuz you're
I got a groove in it I'm tired of seeing
what AR can do because we've seen to do
it I want to see it do that okay I feel
this video good job Letta it looks
awesome Freddie Wong's already do
already done it let's see what AR can do
but again we don't know if this is
something they've actually done right
where the or if they'd actually worked
with so magic leap so magic leap
interestingly has a lot of money right
now they have over half a billion
dollars maybe they have oh I think it's
like five hundred and thirty-some
million dollars in venture capital from
places like Google Ventures so yeah a
lot of indefinitely they have a lot of
investors and they were supposed to give
a talk I think it may be GDC or another
conference and then they cancelled but
then they released this video they said
this is what we were supposed to show
you but then so I don't I think that
it's just like Halloween plans it might
be a little planned
yeah just like hololens like you know
though all these promises get us excited
and I'm sure like they they buff that
video up since the hololens video camera
but regardless you're right they have a
lot of money they are still hasn't
really shown us that yeah well I mean
hololens actually showed us some stuff
right I guess we'll see
but either way we'd love to know your
thoughts on this yeah that's our hashtag
of the day what I want to know are you
super happy like her
or unnecessarily annoyed by it
unnecessarily I'm excited about I'll oh
they are I love the are but waiters real
don't make it look like a like a Freddie
one okay so here's the hashtag of the
day okay what is it
it is T DVR var so virtual reality
versus augment I'm very good virtual
reality versus augmented reality which
one are you more excited about at this
point so okay obviously the
controversial reality versus on okay
yeah so ARR VR and why and what's what's
that for you guys what's the tipping
point like what's the must-buy piece of
software for you that like you're like
okay I've got to get a VR or an AR
headset at this point this is the thing
that this headset would do I choose AR
or VR and here's the thing that is gonna
make me buy it okay I'm very interested
to see what you pick we usually don't
set these up no I hear each other's
reactions I write presenting yours is
wrong I like this question literally
five hours before the show and I don't
think of an answer until we sit right
there yeah so you go first okay so for
me I think I am as a gamer I have to be
more excited about virtual reality we're
excited about right I am more excited
about virtual reality because I love the
idea of being immersed and I if I'm
wearing a headset I want to escape
that's I want to be in a whole different
world I don't want to see extra stuff on
to the things I see in my everyday life
like I want to see something totally new
and beautiful and amazing and incredible
and so for me I would say the game that
I would buy would I don't want to say it
would have like I love the BioShock
Infinite so much and I feel like that
world would have been so grand and
virtual oh man yeah absolutely so I feel
like if I could play and like a 4k
remaster of BioShock Infinite I think
that would be the game that would be
like oh I have to buy Bioshock a
Bioshock in any Bioshock any atmospheric
game would be fantastic and b7 right I
mean that's that's what we're all
dreaming everybody are and we're getting
really
clothes ready okay what about you I am
work setting about AR because I feel
really no I I I'm I feel like I already
have faith in VR to do its do its thing
it's running its course it's getting
where it's supposed to be okay and it's
going it's chugging along
um AR I feel like is going to be the
thing that a lot more people like adapt
I think my mom will put on a headset my
sister will put on and then more more
people like like Twitter and YouTube are
going to be more likely to push those
things forward so more people will be
using them it'll start a new market
gearing up I'll be mere catting with my
stupid headset but yeah it's something
that we've all wanted since we saw
Google class everyone got excited
right so it's also very reminiscent of
this this magically video because the
first video they showed of Google glass
was was very ambitious in terms of a
scope and scale and very similar in in
excitement levels to what we have here
with me so me and Angus the robot are
totally on board with the aim of the
robot he told me how he taught so but
yeah AR there's there's a lot of promise
and it's it's the thing like I mean if
we're talking about moving towards
watches I mean even better if we can
just not even have to look down at a
device and then I guess I mean this is
not this is not gonna be a perfect world
once we have those AR headsets
we're gonna look stupid yes it's gonna
remove us from our world around us and
we're just it's so it's a bad thing but
I'm excited like I'm gonna light it well
yes sometimes if there's like a down
moment and you're like you're talking
about that like tim schafer or something
like that and i'll just zone out and
start watching YouTube video yeah you
won't even have to be on the show it'll
be perfect
kills like finally my dreams are coming
true analyst of this broad not so so
that's I mean that's a good split I
think that's a really good point I think
I think you're that's a really good
point too I didn't think about the fact
that maybe mass consumerism would maybe
gravitate toward a are a little bit more
than VR yeah pre I'm very interested in
what producer
yeah what that's pretty slow and you
guys really curious I think this is all
ready so we're all ready i had--my
genghis is ahead of curve with tail
alright I just want walking death is on
last night we got to talk about zombies
of course so this is kind of a fun way
to start the week it's zombie town USA
and this is a simulator that reminds me
of you know that gameplay gink
yes ok so fun it's really good like
outbreak simulator it's kind of cool so
this is online you can go online and
check it out it's and and you can
basically set up some parameters like
how fast your zombies move you can set
up how fast the time goes so you can see
there's there's the outbreak happening
we started it sort of in San Diego and
it's like oh it's going across a zombie
outbreak yeah yeah it's happening so we
did it earlier we recorded this we
screen capped it so it seems like it's
taking a long time so here's the cool
thing about this so the funny thing is
this is not just a fun simulator that
was made for kicks there's actually like
a whole bunch of science behind this the
guys that made this wrote a paper about
the epidemiology and statistical
mechanics of zombies and applied their
knowledge to this simulation they
created the simulation and one of the
creators explains the model like this
and I this is a this is a quote or
paraphrasing of what he said every
member of the population in the model
has two numbers assigned to it where it
is and what state it's in in terms of if
it's a human a zombie or a dead zombie
so those are the three states you can be
in if you remember the population in
this model when the model the model then
charts interactions in that population
over time so the model will pick an
action that can occur in each step of
time so each time increment that you set
in this simulation there's a thing that
could happen and the model updates the
probabilities for interactions every
single time step so it'll say oh you're
more likely to shake someone's hand in
New York than you are right you're more
likely to like things like zombie bites
human human kills zombies zombie walks
like just doesn't kill anybody or get
killed but it just walks somewhere so
they that's how it spreads and so it's a
very like it's a very deep kind of they
feel a very realistic model of what
would happen if it
break or some kind of infection happened
that affected a lot slower than I
thought it would right and so this is at
like 500 plus hours so this is you know
this is quite a ways out a little bit of
Texas that's the safest place is so far
so good right so but it's fun because
you can choose where the outbreak starts
oh she didn't say like oh if it starts
here then like here's how it goes and
you know obviously there's a lot less
people served in that area that's kind
of you know New Mexico Arizona Colorado
like Montana so you can see it's a lot
darker and then all of a sudden gets
really dark as it started there it gets
really red as it starts moving to more
populated areas which is pretty cool
yeah it's very cool it's very relaxing
it it is a little bit relaxing to sort
of watch the doom of humanity the other
way I think it looks like you started
you started this outbreak in the
tomorrow daily office Genghis ya gang
get started can't get started again you
but yeah the zombie robot but it's to
get to New York it takes a long time
yeah it's it's been you only date the US
because I know we have a lot of so so
far they have the US but it would be I
it would not be a stretch to see them
maybe if it's very popular and they can
somehow maybe monetize it like I could
see them maybe expanding it to the rest
of the world that's DLC yeah well DLC
yeah be good but that's those are our
headlines we're gonna be right back
we're to take a quick break we have a
really weird kind of cool back at her
hackett that might change the way we
wear shoes it's kind of neat and then we
have your user feedback and of course
our photogra for the day so don't click
away it's tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show we have a very
interesting round of crowd funding that
we're gonna tell you whether or not we
like or dislike as always on Monday this
is back at our Hackett real quick we
should say that producer Logan said AR
said he so that's me Ganga's three three
games one that's great so I'm feeling
pretty good about my joke a I don't
worry by my choice so the way you wear
your shoes yeah okay so we're gonna talk
about a lady product but it could be
pretty easily imported to guys as well
this is called volver volver e ful like
potpourri Volvo lorry it's a pair of
high heels with an e-ink and like look
at it changes you see change okay it's a
jewel there's an ink panel embedded on
the sides of this shoe and the cool
thing is is you can not only change it
from you know white to black you can
also put patterns on it you can upload
little patterns you can do stripes or
dots or whatever it is that you are
feeling particularly in that day it uses
a flexible each ink paper and it's got a
Bluetooth le receiver in the hollow of
this that's cool so you can just send
you know the patterns I so see look he's
changing the patterns of the soul right
there which is like or the the paper
which is pretty awesome it's wireless
charging so you can charge your shoes
wirelessly and I was thinking to myself
like another thing that I have to charge
every day but no because it uses so
little energy e Inc uses so little
energy you can actually just that you
charge it like every few weeks
takes it like a long time so here's the
thing guys like imagine a tennis shoe
like this like a good tennis shoe oh my
god
yeah that would be amazing so that's
them working on HC this bluetooth
receiver they have everything set up in
there they got to put it in the sole of
the shoe and stuff but man I would love
love loved a tennis shoe like this
that's really cool alright so cool tech
and maybe color how much okay what are
we looking at here so it's on IndieGoGo
that's where you can find it it closes
on April 12th so it's been up for a
little over a week I guess or mail like
it's about halfway through its campaign
maybe as of right now it has about
15,000 ish dollars of a fifty thousand
dollar goal so they're there it's close
they're definitely they haven't been
screaming up the Charter mm of the 50
that they need that they want yeah and
it's they want $249 for one pair which
is for women in the neighborhood of kind
of mid-range designer shoes so it's not
super cheap but it's also not nearly as
expensive as say a Louboutin which is
like a thousand dollars yeah but I can
see like Bridget Carey or or Brian Tong
wearing these yeah I mean Brendan his
legs would look amazing in these yeah we
should definitely email that to him
there's thrilling rock and roll man
garden they're incredible you know like
Miss Universe likes that far but they're
pretty I'm so yeah that's it's a it's
called Volvo II which is vol V Ori I got
$300 for shoes and Bluetooth you can
switch them on the girl they have the
you have like an app and you'll be able
to switch up the patterns and everything
and you charge them every few weeks
through to 250 for a pair of shoes
wireless charging wireless charging
mm-hm and if it helps at all and I don't
know if it does there's like snaps on
the front in the back so you can snap
accessories on it like bows or like
whatever anyway as if that matters to
you
it might yeah I'd say back in III if I
was if I was a lady I would like that
sort of like could you buy for your girl
don't you have to get him herself okay
because I can't trust my I can't trust
my fashion sense for women should be
like wow she loved these no because she
when she wears like varieties she has
cowboy boots and she was slips and she
was like heels that she's that's a big
investment I don't know I the guys shoes
are like a hundred bucks maybe
20 so yeah yeah so I don't know I yeah
these ones were like 60 yeah I say back
it if only if only to invest in the
future of an eating tennis shoe that's I
like oh god you consider my investment
in this like hey hey I really like this
make a tennis shoe please
I'm almost 6 feet tall I cannot wear a
heel I don't like it I've weak ankles
I'm like a giraffe I can't know like its
I'm all about the flats guys well that
answers a lot of people's questions if
you're you're just taller than me yeah
that's right
that is I'm wearing heels right now and
it's not helping you know Caleb wears
heels every day to show you guys an
interest but but cushioning it's got a
little Apple box got a little higher
chair no but that's cool I like I like
all that kind of stuff remember we we've
showed off a necklace that kind of like
chain
yeah the projection it was really weird
there's gonna be more of this stuff so a
mile back this guy get in on the ground
floor
I guess would you do would you order any
patterns you throw on there do you know
of I would just love to see like MC
Escher designs Michele start over time
online yesterday I was she's like what
about MC Escher I call my god yes we're
like the the carpet in the shining do
you remember that I got ya cool I made
like a wall like weird tapestry designs
up I would love like words you could do
you do words
oh you're going happy birthday in
somebody's birthday is your favorite
book yeah that in there you can like
text call us dude call us guys we'll
help you develop stuff awesome yeah but
sneaker does super good yeah but sneaker
all the way okay guys it's time to talk
about what you think so it's time for
user feedback
boy you guys really have a lot to say
about the view you know a lot to say no
whether or not you pay 50 bucks for the
PlayStation view um she she Sheik wrote
in and said 50 bucks is a no-go I don't
have a Playstation and at that price
I'll stick with Charter and TiVo the
price makes no sense at all
yeah people have already found their
ways of getting this content they don't
want to go out of their way to get it
right Ferdie Rodin's that got Netflix
and Hulu got used to not having cable
too expensive 15 to 20 bucks a month may
be worth it also available on portable
devices yeah that's a good thing we
should have asked how much they'd be
willing to pay yeah a lot of people said
like 20 bucks like 20 25 bucks would be
the top I do 35 I I would say 30 35
seems appropriate just considering the
cloud DVR like I like that and I like
that you can fast-forward through
commercial 50 just seems too much like I
don't know why I think it's cuz it's
like going against everything else it
just gives me that sick feeling of like
oh this is another cable contract and
it's like it's I know I'm not signing a
two-year contract or anything with Sony
but it feels like I am it's just this is
a commitment oh I'm gonna pay for this
and look I don't like that um
Shannon wrote in and said TD view
packages are the same as cable you are
still paying for services you do not
want hashtag not for me
love the show guys oh yeah totally agree
yeah agree remote cable package yes this
this answer was probably my favorite
answer Courtland wrote and said I would
pay 50 bucks a month for PlayStation
view only if I could pick 75 channels
that I want alright so you say I want to
pick my 75 channels or maybe if you get
to pick her channels you only get 50
maybe it's like 50 bucks a month and you
can get 75 channels that we choose for
you or you can pick 50 of your choice
don't pick 75 shows yeah that would be
like that you know whatever
and then lastly Rob emailed us and said
yes I have a PlayStation 3 but I'm
thinking about getting a PlayStation 4
I'm undecided whether I'm in or not
because although it's way cheaper than
what I'm paying for cable if I want HBO
it'll be an extra fee plus if someone
wants sports you have to pay an extra
fee I guess the only way that I would
buy a view that I would buy view is if
it offered live sports and HBO and the
other paid channels were included in the
50
I knew you guess yesterday that sports
would be a make or break for a lot of
people and other people say like no
sports I don't want like forget it yeah
HBO's yeah that's a big that's a big
that's a big get that's a big and I
couldn't care less about sports
so absolutely get it see I feel like it
should be that $50 should include like
ESPN and like that stuff but then if you
don't want it you could have it removed
like you can opt out so you can just
like modularly take away I think that
that's more of a fair thing like as
opposed to saying all of you must have
this yeah it's like I don't need 200
channels of every sport that has ever
existed on my FiOS like I pay for that I
never use them but it's like I wish I
could just say you know what just all
sports channels just just take them out
and and then just charge me like it's
not about it my account for the
difference and whatever that is alright
that's what I want not bad not bad
thinking pretty good use a female we're
not in that we're not in that you can't
really make his decisions but ya know
this was a very very active company and
I love it because our segment yesterday
was real long because we were looks like
about this we got rayji so anyway yeah
thanks for your thanks for comments it
was really cool to see how everybody
felt because as we said we got no really
strongly we all have to decide together
so that we control this dream yeah where
things are going it's true we all have
to fight for the user which is us so all
right guys it's time for our very last
piece use your feedback it is art bone
target for the day
Alex wrote in to us and he got a little
I think maybe he was hangry when he
wrote in maybe he just needed to eat
something he was a little upset uh oh he
wrote in and said I took this picture
with my HTC One m7 I love my cats so
much
they are great subjects to take pictures
of and then there was an emoji a grimace
emoji and I could kind of angry crying
emoji and it says please notice me whoa
Alex dude you have cats pick your cat it
calms your heart down and that's what
they they give it to old people so that
they there's a line nine exclamation
points I'm sure yeah we love you Alex
hello we've noticed we noticed you I
like I like your idea that he's that
he's hungry angry that's all I don't
think you were actually mad at us I
think you were just maybe a little bit
you just need a snack that's I'm saying
