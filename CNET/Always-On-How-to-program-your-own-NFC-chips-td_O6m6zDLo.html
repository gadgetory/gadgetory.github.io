and this week I'll show you how these
three letters n FC and these tags can
make your life a whole lot easier
through automation NFC stands for near
field communication NFC enabled phones
work with magnetic induction that
creates a radio wave field that lets you
send little bits of information back and
forth from device to device or in our
case from your device to a tagged iPhone
not yet but there are some rumors it'll
be included in the next model in the
fall these tags have a tee bit of memory
and a radio chip attached to an antenna
I know all in this super thin chip but
there's no battery it actually draws
power from the device that's reading it
in an our case that's the phone so let's
get started you'll need an NFC enabled
phone like this Samsung Galaxy s3 and
one of these tags you can't just go to
Best Buy though and buy them off the
shelf they're not that popular yet
you'll have to order them online so once
you do you'll need to program them so
let's give it a try
download an app like NFC task launcher
and now you can program it so I'll make
a new tag and now I can decide what I
want it to do when my phone it taps the
tag so in this case I'll make it so that
the Wi-Fi is enabled maybe I will also
make it launch an app I like to listen
to a white noise when I get to work
and finally I'll turn off all of the
ringers so that I'm not bothering my
coworkers ok now that I'm done and I
have these three tasks I have to
activate my NFC tag so I'll hit finish
and now I have to tap it to the tag ok
it worked
there we go now my phone is programmed
my NFC tag and I don't have to fiddle
with a bunch of stuff when I get to work
first thing in the morning but you can
do a whole lot of other things with NFC
tags to automate your life you can also
program a tag for your walk to work and
make it play music and enable bluetooth
you can even make an NFC tag for your
car to launch Pandora and turn off Wi-Fi
while you're driving and if you're a
foodie like me you can create a tag that
lets you launch your favorite app when
you get in the kitchen for me that's all
recipes see it was that easy alright if
you have any ideas for cool NFC tags let
me know on Twitter or email always-on at
Cena comm all right Molly let me know
what kind of NFC tag you want to
automate your life and I'll make one
custom tailored just for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
