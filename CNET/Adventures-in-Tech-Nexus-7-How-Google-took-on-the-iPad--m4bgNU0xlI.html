Android tablet ever built and helped
Google's OS fight back against the might
of the iPad now adventures in tech
explains how Google's first tablet got
it right
the iPad wasn't the first tablets but it
was the first tablet people actually
wanted to buy launched in 2010 off the
back of the successful iPhone Apple sold
three million in less than three months
there was golden then their tablets and
everybody wanted a piece soon we were
treated to a barrage of iPad rivals
trouble was they were all terrible the
high profile failure of HP's webOS
touchpad and BlackBerry's playbook left
Android as the only platform with a shot
at taking on Apple to Google's dismay
however what was unleashed was a
veritable flood of Android tablets many
of which were too expensive or hobbled
by unrefined software the sheer number
of these would-be iPads was staggering
presumably they all ended up in some
landfill in the desert for future
archaeologists to find and use to make
assumptions on how we live the dig
taught as much about life in the
primitive 21st century experts now
believe the find was intended as an
offering to a great and terrible God
known only as
there was one good Android tablet out
there Amazon's 2011 Kindle Fire was
smaller than many of its rivals he was
also very cheap the problem was it used
a heavily modified version of Android
that didn't have Google Play so it
wasn't any use to Google the search
giant realized that if it wanted a
proper Android tablet done right it
would have to do it itself Google
enlisted Taiwanese tech giant Asus to
build the Nexus 7 giving the firm just a
few months to get the device completely
ready asus is chairman Johnny she has
said the process was like torture for
its engineers and sort of work has moved
closer to Google for a 24 hour
development cycle the work was worth it
the Nexus 7's crowning glory was a 7
inch 1280 by 800 pixel display while
beneath the surface HMDA quad-core
processor
a fresh version of raw Android made
Google's tablet uncluttered and easy to
use but in Google Play front-and-center
Google had realized that when it came to
tablets we cared about apps movies and
games and less about hardware of course
we also care deeply about cold hard cash
Google made the Nexus 7 very cheap
knowing it would make money when people
started downloading things and they're
getting Android gadgets into people's
homes would lead to more cash in the
long run it was also a chance to give
Android tablet app development a shot in
the arm
it was compact it was powerful and
aggressively priced if the iPad was a
lumbering Tyrannosaurus the Nexus 7 was
the Velociraptor smaller but just as
lethal
oh cool a Nexus 7 the Nexus 7 went on
sale on the 13th of July 2012 met with
critical acclaim including a CNET
editor's choice award is sold out in
many shops by the end of the year the
Nexus 7 was estimated to have sold 4.6
million units nowhere near Apple's iPad
sales but certainly respectable the
Nexus 7 had managed something more
important than sales figures though for
the first time Android was making its
mark in the world of tablets and this
time it was Apple that had to react
the iPad Mini was a clear sign that for
the first time Apple had spotted a
threat to its tablet dominance the
success of the Nexus 7 also upset
Microsoft which was just months from
launching Windows 8 and its larger
surface tablet the Nexus 7 showed what
an Android tablet should be and since
its arrival has inspired many imitators
Apple still rules the world of tablets
but thanks to the Nexus 7 it's clear
that the playing field is now much more
level what would you want from a new
Nexus 7 and who's better at tablets
Apple or Google let me know and check
back next time for another adventure in
