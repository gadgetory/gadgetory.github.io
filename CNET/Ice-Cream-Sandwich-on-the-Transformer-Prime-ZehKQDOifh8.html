little present for you the asuste
transformer prime running ice cream
sandwich ICS is the latest version of
android and so far had only been
available in smartphones this is the
first time anyone's seen it on a tablet
in the wild so we're going to dive in
and see what if any difference is there
are from honeycomb the first thing we
notice is that the lock screen now
allows you to go straight into the
camera app if you want making the
prospect of getting a shot of that super
cool thing that's happening right now a
little bit more likely on the home
screen the biggest difference is how we
access widgets honeycomb had a little
shortcut at the top of the screen or you
could press and hold the home screen but
now widgets have been grouped with apps
making them feel less hidden before
moving down the screen to notifications
one of the annoying things about
honeycomb is that if your notifications
start to fill up you have to close each
individual one now ICS allows you to
kill them all in one fell swoop let the
tablet God sort it out also instead of
simply showing you the last message
you've received ICS consolidates all
mail notifications into one showing you
how many new messages you have moving
into settings you'll notice right off
the bat that things are suddenly
different settings have now been split
into four sections wireless and networks
device personal and system beyond that
there aren't really any huge changes to
find here just a few useful refinements
there's now a data usage section that
details just how much overall data
you've been using as well as individual
app usage there's also a specific
battery section showing more detailed
battery information than we previously
seen adding a new google account now
gives you options as to which specific
Google services you want sync and new
developer options allow you to access
things like CPU usage pointer location
and my personal favorite allowing you to
kill apps as soon as you leave them
performance wise we didn't notice much
difference from the previous version GPS
still works great in our testing but web
browsing is still slower than the iPad
overall the biggest new feature is
probably the built-in
photo editing tool which offers some
pretty good options well we'll see what
my cat thinks at least I also like the
fact that recent apps can now be closed
with just a quick swipe well that's
pretty much it ICS feels like a step up
from honeycomb if only a small one and I
definitely recommend installing the
update check out the full review of the
transformer prime for more details on
these and other changes once again i'm
eric franklin and this has been a first
look at ice cream sandwich on the
transformer prime</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
