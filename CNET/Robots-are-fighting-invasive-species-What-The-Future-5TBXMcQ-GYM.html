help protect marine ecosystems and chew
bubblegum and they're all out of
bubblegum welcome to what the future on
today's show the fish hunting robot made
to Cullen invasive species a satellite
targets and takes down space junk for
the first time and an unemployed robot
gets a new job at Dodger Stadium let's
jump right into the deep end where
lionfish are running amok lionfish are
what's known as an invasive species
meaning they have few predators outside
of their natural waters so when they
showed up in the caribbean sea and
atlantic ocean they gorged on juvenile
fish with stomachs that expand up to 30
times their normal size lionfish can
reduce some fish populations by as much
as 90% in just five weeks
lionfish need to be hunted to give the
ecosystem a chance to balance itself and
that's where the Guardian lf1 comes in
the underwater drone was designed by
robots in service of the environment to
stun lionfish and suck them into a
storage chamber so they can be brought
to the surface and sold for food I know
what you're thinking yes lionfish do
have poisonous spines and yes they do
have a pretty fearsome ugly mug but you
can totally eat those lionfish meat is
high in protein and omega-3 fatty acids
and low in cholesterol and heavy metals
are ESI's goal is to make the lf1 robots
economically viable for fishermen so
they can make a living while helping the
environment more Chester Polytechnic
Institute is also developing a lionfish
hunting robot
unlike RSES remote-controlled robot this
robot will be autonomous and untethered
finding and spearing lionfish without
human assistance these robots could make
lionfish more affordable and popular as
a food source
so if you see lionfish on a menu
somewhere give it a try you might like
it and you'll be taking some of the
burden off of species that are being
nets aren't just for the ocean anymore
they're also being used to clean up
space junk more than 300 kilometers
above Earth the remove debris satellite
tested its net capture technology for
the first time it deployed a shoebox
sized objects for target practice then
fired a net at the space garbage and
successfully captured it for this test
the piece of space trash will fall to
earth on its own and burn up during
reentry in the future developers say
that tethered Nets could be employed for
controlled junk removal there are
millions of pieces of space debris
orbiting our planet posing a significant
threat to spacecraft and satellites
remove debris still has more
technologies to test including a garbage
harpoon a camera to track and monitor
space junk and an experimental drag sail
which will use the Earth's upper
atmosphere to bring the remove debris
satellite down to earth where it will
burn up during reentry and avoid
becoming space Johnny itself our last
story for today is a story of triumph
over adversity flippy the
burger-flipping robot from Mesa robotics
was fired from his job at Callie burger
earlier this year because he was
throwing off the rhythm of the kitchen
we're happy to inform you that he found
a new home at the chicken in tots and in
Dodger Stadium since July 30th flippy
has cooked up more than 10 thousand
pounds of chicken tenders and tater tots
serving up an average of 80 baskets of
food per hour
despite being fast on the fryers flippy
is only employed on an experimental
basis the team is gathering data and
will likely have more information on
flippies future with the Dodgers once
the season comes to a close it's time
for a question from one of our viewers
Dan host asked us on Facebook why don't
they just net the lionfish thanks for
the question Dan
most large-scale net fishing results in
the capture of unwanted fish and other
marine creatures also known as bycatch
which does further damage to marine
ecosystems the most precise way to catch
only lionfish is to catch them one at a
time using spears handheld nets or
robots the robots can go deeper than
your average human divers hence the push
to make them economically viable for
fishermen what makes you say WTF let us
know in the comments that's all for this
week thanks very much
for watching I'm Jesse we're all filling
in for Andy Altman we'll see you next
time on what the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
