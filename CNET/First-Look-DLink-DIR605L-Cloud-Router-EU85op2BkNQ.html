from where Maya where else the clown and
I did bring something back with me this
is the very first cloud router from
dealing the dir sick L Phi L now this is
a very special router for two reasons
number one is both compact and bulky at
the same time it's compact because the
router itself is quite small fit round
my hand right here which is medium size
is bulky because of these two antennas
sticking on the back here they are non
detachable and they are huge now the
second reason it because is both low end
and high end at the same time now it's
low end because this is a regular single
band wireless router with almost no
bells and whistle on the back here in
fire all of its port including for LAN
ports and one one port and all of them
are regular Ethernet not really fast on
the front here inside the traditional
array of LED light that show the status
of the port on the back also of the
connection to the internet and the
wireless connection on the side here
unify the WPS button that helped quickly
hook up client to the network now is
high-end because it's the first from
dealing and I've seen that can be hooked
up to the my dealing portal the mydlink
port used to be used only for dealing
camera for use two more to your home
remotely but now you can use that to
also monitor the router it also come
with mobile apps for you to do the same
thing on your mobile phone for example
on my iPhone right here I'm running the
mydlink Lite apps and let's check on my
network right now so here I see two
devices connected to my router right now
and one of them is see that laughs which
is important and the second guy is a
chronic fake Booker who is this guy let
me block him the ogre is blocked hey
what's the deal oops sound like my boss
for us sorry let me unblocking there you
go it works you can do more with the app
such as changing the network's name or
even rebooting the
completely remotely while you are under
go now in my testing this router worked
really well to it offer very decent
performance good range and very stable
signal for a router of this size now the
most important thing is of course the
pricing and is great very friendly at
chess around $40 now for somebody who
didn't need a high-end network this
router is worth every penny
for more information on the router check
out my phone with us calm you could also
ask me questions via Twitter on my
Facebook page there you can also find
out what happened to me in the last
three weeks once again my name is Domo
and this has been the first look at the
very first cloud router from dealing the
dir sick of I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
