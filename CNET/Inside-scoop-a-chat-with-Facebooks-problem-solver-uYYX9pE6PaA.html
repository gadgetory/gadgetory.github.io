Charlie Cooper here with my colleague
Paul Sloane Paul you've just been down
to Facebook it turns out that there is a
person who makes Facebook we're on 24 by
7 and his first name is not mark who is
he Jay parekh is his name he runs a team
of six hundred people he runs the
infrastructure and engineering group so
he's not one of these people you see
sort of as a public face of Facebook but
super important super important right
it's sort of mission-critical stuff
right if the if the site goes down he
along other people but he gets the calls
at three o'clock in the morning yes he
prides himself on never getting the
calls that's his goal and what's
interesting a correct me if I'm wrong so
far Facebook has avoided the really big
outages the ones you know in the news
last week we had Twitter in the past
ebay has gone down for periods of time
same for salesforce com you know they
won't talk much obviously about why
things happen that go wrong they haven't
had any real problems in a couple years
of the you know minor things but what he
did stress to me is that they're
incredibly diligent on following up and
they have a weekly meeting in which they
go over any problem that happened any
kind of hiccup even the ones that
probably go unnoticed by the always
always hunting tech press but he you
know they'll go over everything and then
they assign tasks and tickets to it and
make sure it's followed up and fixed and
so it never happens again and they also
they look at it on every little piece of
technology so it's not it's like if the
site goes down that's huge but there
might be one little part of their whole
stack of technology that has an issue
that the public never sees the users
never received but they know happens so
they'll work to fix that to make sure
that doesn't happen and so all these
things added together keeps you know for
a site with 900 million users it's
pretty incredible for a side with 900
million users that's also public so
they're they're doing the job yes the
public factor matters a lot that they
keep going and don't have any down time
great stuff thanks very much for seeing
that it's inside scoop and Paul Sloane
I'm Charlie Cooper
