lot of money to get good sound quality
but the cue acoustics 30 20 pixels
beakers and yet another example of a
kickass product at a budget price for
$299 the 30 20 packs a lot in including
impeccable bill quality for example in
order to minimize distortion the
one-inch tweeter is decoupled from the 5
inch driver and the cabinet the speaker
itself is small only 10 inches tall and
it features a rear port for better bass
it also includes gold-plated binding
posts but they're cited a pretty funky
angles the key acoustics come in a
choice of finishers including white or
black gloss we ran these speakers with a
fairly decent AV receiver but you don't
need to go overboard to get the most out
of them
the first thing you'll notice is how
immediate they sound it's difficult to
ignore them so if you find yourself
dozing off with your current sound
system choose these voices sound ultra
clear and very natural but unlike some
more expensive speakers this doesn't
mean they overemphasize treble or make
bright recordings difficult to listen to
the sound is quite balanced and suited
to almost any genre could think of as
they are small speakers they don't
produce much bass if you like crazy deep
electronic music for example you might
want to add a sub as well for most music
and movies though the Q acoustics 3020
gives a clearer dynamic and enjoyable
performance and very few speakers at
this price can say that
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
