Pichai chai is the chief executive
officer of Google's chairman Goodlatte
ranking women adler distinguished
members of the committee thank you for
the opportunity to be here today more
than 90% of all internet searches take
place on Google or its subsidiary
YouTube and they are curating what we
see google has long faced criticism for
manipulating search results to censor
conservatives conservative individuals
and organizations have had their pro
tunc content tagged as hate speech or
had their content reduced in search
results so what are you going to improve
that situation congressman thanks for
the question if I may
some of the studies you mentioned we
have investigated those there are there
are other studies which have looked at
it we have found issues with the
methodology and the sample size and so
on but let me step back and say
providing users with high quality
accurate and trusted information is
sacrosanct to us it's what our
principles are under business interests
or natural long-term incentives are
aligned with that we want to serve users
everywhere and we need to earn their
trust in doing so Ileana Murillo is
Google's head of multicultural marketing
does miss Murillo do good work I'm not
directly familiar with her work but
she's an employee of Google and you know
we're proud of her employees through her
head of multicultural marketing said you
were pushing to get out the Latino vote
paying for ride to the poll to the polls
for the Latino vote only in key states
and you're saying that's not accurate
yes that's right they be haven't found
any evidence to substantiate you she
just made it up out of thin air the day
after the election I wrote this email to
your top executives and it's not true
congressman I'm happy to follow up but I
think the employees today do their own
active we don't want to follow up I want
the real answers right here in this
committee as I said earlier we've looked
into it we didn't find you push to get
out the key vote and and I would say the
two most populous states for Latinos
would be California and Texas did you
push to get out the Latino vote and pay
for people to go to the poll
in California in Texas we as a company
didn't have any effort to push out words
for any particular demographic that
would be against our principles we
participate in the civic process in an
in a in a nonpartisan way and we think
it's really important we do it that way
I have an iPhone and if I move from here
and go over there and sit with my
Democrat friends which will make them
real nervous
does Google track my movement does
Google through this phone know that I
have moved here and moved over to the
left it's either yes or no not by
default there may be a Google service
which you've opted in to use and if so
Google knows that I am moving over there
it's it's not a trick question you know
you make a hundred million dollars a
year you ought to be able to answer that
question does Google know through this
phone that I am moving over there and
sitting next to mr. Johnson which would
make him real nervous
it's his question it's yes or nope I
wouldn't be able to answer that I'm
looking at yes say yes or no without
knowing more details sir I have a
concern concerning China in 2010 Google
left the Chinese market place due to
concerns over hat hacking attacks
censorship and how the Chinese
government was possibly gaining access
to data I'm interested in what has
changed since 2010 and how working with
the Chinese government to censor
research results are part of Google's
core values do you understand my
question congressman we right now there
are no plans for us to launch a search
product in China we are in general
always looking to see how best it's part
of our core mission and our principles
to try hard to provide users with
information we always have evidence
based on every country we have operated
in us reaching out and giving uses to
more information has a very positive
impact and and we feel that calling but
right now there are no plans to launch
in China
to the extent that we we ever you know
approach a decision like that I I will
be fully transparent including with
policymakers here and and engage in
consult widely so anticipating what took
place in 2016 happening again and and
this is specifically regarding what
Russia did to foment racial tensions in
the United States and wanting to know
how you are responding to that were they
called for you know fake protests either
to get African Americans to turn out to
protest something that was fake or to
have white supremists be ginned up to
attack communities of color so
specifically what is Google doing to
respond to that we mainly saw with
respect to Russia limited improper
activity on our ad platforms but in
general you know we are not a social
networking company across the products
we do it's an area we haven't done well
as a company so we typically are in
connecting groups of people and that's
not how Google mainly works today and so
we haven't seen that kind of activities
on our platforms but we are vigilant and
you know I'm happy to share any findings
which come through as we look into it
more the operating environment in China
has deteriorated with respect to
surveillance censorship and the like
since Google first made the decision in
2010 to leave so I want to ask very
specifically are any employees currently
having product meetings on this quit on
this Chinese project and when if not
when did those end we have undertaken an
internal effort but right now there are
no plans to launch a search service in
China as I said earlier are there any
current discussions with any member of
the Chinese government on launching this
app currently we are not in discussions
around launching a search product in
China are there any current discussions
with members of the Chinese government
about this yeah you know this effort
currently is an internal effort and you
know I'm happy to you know consult as
well as be transparent to the action we
take steps towards launching a product
in China
and who at Google is leading the
dragonfly effort it's a you know our
efforts around building search you know
it's it's it's undertaken by our search
teams but these are distributed efforts
it's a limited effort internally
currently will you mister which I rule
out launching a tool for surveillance
and censorship in China while you are
CEO of Google congressman I commit to
engaging one of the things which is
important to us as a company we have a
stated mission of providing users with
information and so we always we think
it's in our duty to explore
possibilities to give users access to
information and you know I have that
commitment but you know as I said
earlier on this will be very thoughtful
and we will engage widely as we make
progress this is now the fourth hearing
in a series of ridiculous hearings on a
free speech of Internet companies a
significant portion this hearing was a
waste of time because the First
Amendment protects private individuals
and corporations free speech rights so
I'm gonna search for consequence Steve
King i'ma hit the news tab first or if
that pops up some ABC news it says Steve
King's racist immigration talk prompts
calls for congressional censure that's a
negative article but you don't have a
group of people Google City they're
thinking and trying to modify search
results every time Steve King because it
comes up a negative article appears
that's not what's happening right we
always operate for any query with the
same set of principles we are trying to
reflect what is currently you know if it
is newsworthy what is currently being
discussed about that that that phrase
thank you so let me just conclude here
by stating the obvious if you want
positive search results do positive
things if you don't want negative search
results don't do negative things and
just some of my colleagues across the
aisle if you're getting bad press
articles and bad search results don't
blame Google or Facebook or Twitter
consider blaming yourself did Google
design a prototype for a search engine
that
would be used in China to censor content
congressman we have undertaken an
internal effort they did you create a
prototype that there was a report in the
intercept that says a prototype for the
censored search engine was designed we
have a world what search could look like
if it if it were to be launched in a
country like China and that's what we
explored and how many months was their
project ongoing we've had the project
underway for a while and there have been
other projects which we've undertaken
for a while and we've never launched
them - so it could be a constantly
exploring how many how many people the
estimates you know Chipman sorry the
number of engineers and the project have
varied over time at ten at one point
we've had over a hundred people working
on it it's my understanding who makes
the judgment calls regarding content
moderation at Google chairman it depends
on the area so for example if it's
YouTube we have you know very clear
teams which are responsible for YouTube
content policies and they identified is
it possible for a customer to write to
them and say hey here's here's a concern
I have
we give clear channels for content
creators to you know to raise concerns
back and we have clear avenues and and
we also have had people who are
responsible for these platforms
including content moderation appear here
you know and and and and I think they've
consulted widely here here - thank you
well you've gone for about three and a
half hours and it's about what we
predicted isn't it yesterday when we
talked so we thank you very much for
your participation today this concludes
today's hearing and without objection
all members will have five legislative
days to submit written question for the
witness or additional materials for the
record and with that this hearing is
adjourned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
