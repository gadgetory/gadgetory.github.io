when the solar state drive SSD that is
when hit the to tell by my stone the
answer is now I know because I have here
not one but two the Samsung SSD 850 bro
and the SSD 850 Evo now respectively
these are the high-end and the budgets
solicit drive for consumer but now they
are both the highest capacity drive on
the market now I have reviewed these try
separately when they first came out with
up to one terabyte capacity so for more
information check out those review the
new drive here will not bring any more
performance or feature they just close
the gap between SSD and regular hard
drive now both drive here share the same
set of future they use Samsung 3d
vertical land flash memory
they support encryption and also have
very high endurance the pro dry is a bit
faster also have a doubled entrance of
the Evo and also double the warrant
attack ten years versus five years now
the endurance is a total amount of data
you can write to an SSD before the drive
becomes unreliable and with this tutor
by Evo drive here if you write 50
gigabyte per day and every day will take
you more than 80 years to wear out this
drive with the pro drive you take you up
to 16 years now 50 gigabyte is a lot of
data and every day is it kind of
discipline even I don't always have so
it's safe to say that you can have to
replace a computer way before you have
to worry about the endurance of these
drive what I have to worry about however
is the price now they are not crazily
expensive but they're not cheap either
the pros are going to be $1000 the Evo
drive it knows now those are the
suggested retail price so the strip
price is gonna be maybe lower but never
low you know really now I'm not sure who
do I need a 2 terabytes instead drive
but I know that we all want one and if
you're cool in app you get not one but
- at the same time before anybody else
as you can clearly see here and that's
because I'm W and this has been a short
quick lyric show off about the very
first two terabytes it drives on a
market the SSD 850 Pro and the SSD 850
Evo from Samson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
