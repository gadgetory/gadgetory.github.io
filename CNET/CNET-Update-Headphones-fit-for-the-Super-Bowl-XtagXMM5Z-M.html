Super Bowl shuffle with headphones that
cost more than a car I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your scene at update the war
between AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile is getting
more heated than usual this week as the
two carriers continue to fight for
customers by essentially bribing them
with money AT&amp;amp;T is offering a 100-dollar
credit for every new line opened two new
and existing customers ATT also is
paying 450 dollars for t-mobile
customers that switch to 18 t now
t-mobile started using cash to luring
customers a few weeks ago when it began
paint the early termination fees for
anyone that cancelled their contracts to
switch to t-mobile but if money is no
object to you then perhaps you would be
interested in these limited-edition
beats by dre headphones designed for the
football players heading to the super
bowl this sunday the price tag for these
models adorned in gold and diamonds 25
thousand dollars apiece I don't know how
the sound quality can be any better for
25 grand but perhaps you can find out
for yourself when someone from the
losing team eventually sells their swag
on ebay in other music news that may be
actually useful to you the streaming
service are do and the song recognition
apps Shazam have expanded their
partnership to 35 countries so when you
use shazam to get the name of the song
that is playing it will link you to a
full-length version of the song on rdio
for free but it's only free for a
two-week mobile trial after that it will
cost ten dollars a month for unlimited
mobile access on your phone or tablet
however listening to our do on the web
from a desktop remains free and last.fm
an internet radio website that
recommends music has partnered with the
streaming service Spotify now last.fm
will have a Spotify play bar on the
bottom of the site to access any song
and spa defies catalog I should note
that last.fm is owned by CBS interactive
which is also the parent company of cnet
and in the same fashion that you would
pay a monthly fee to Spotify Rdio to
listen to unlimited music you can pay
for access to
Limited ebooks scribd is one such
service it likes to think of itself as
the netflix for books and it launched an
app on the kindle fire tablet for nine
dollars a month you can access more than
a hundred thousand ebooks now that
sounds like a lot of titles but it's
just a tiny fraction of the books that
amazon offers the scribd apps for iOS
and Android also got a refresh with more
features that's your tech news update
