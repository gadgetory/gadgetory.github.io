welcome to the Apple buy for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
let's get to it an apple looks to be
taking even more control over the iPhone
after reports claimed Apple is building
its own chips for future iPhones now
according to Bloomberg Apple is working
on its own power management chip for the
iPhone that has been previously sourced
by uk-based company
dialogue semiconductor the chip manages
the power requirements of the different
components in their battery-operated
devices but this chip won't make it into
the iPhone until 2019 but it's happening
see Apple has been building up its chip
making capabilities over time giving
them more control over pricing and
timing now we know the big a built its
first wireless chip with the w14
wireless headphones we know about its
series a processors for the iPad and
iPhone the S series chip for the Apple
watch and even the t1 chip that provides
an extra layer of security for their
touch bar in MacBook Pros see that's a
whole lot of apple chips and I love
apple chips mmm now imagination
technologies is the next company to fall
after they announce the relationship
with Apple has ended they were
responsible for the iPhones Retina
graphics and image processing but moving
forward Apple will now be making its own
GPU that stands for graphics processing
unit and not grandpa splat underwear not
that I know now surprisingly or not
surprisingly both company stocks took
huge hits since Apple makes up over 50%
of their business they won't be the only
ones this happens to in the future and I
know that's just business to take over
when it benefits you but still that
feels like a bad apple
cannibal all right an iPhone 8 rumour
report from Cowan and company claims
integrating the under glass fingerprint
sensor directly into the display remains
the biggest obstacle for Apple's iPhone
right now the report adds that it's
resulting in low yield rates and Apple
may consider one of their alternative
designs like putting the sensor on the
backside well now we know Samsung had
similar issues with their Galaxy S 8 and
this is just a rumour report so we'll
have to wait and see and a more follow
up to the Mac Pro news last week as if
it was a surprise OS news reports that
constant negativity from Pro users led
Apple to develop the modular Mac which
could ship by the end of 2018 or even
2019 now negative feedback towards the
MacBook Pro with a touch bar was also a
major factor as orders for older MacBook
Pros saw a surge according to their
sources and this is my favorite part of
the report the decision to go ahead with
the modular Mac Pro was made in recent
months and development started only a
few weeks ago that sounds more like a
2019 released if you ask me yikes now it
shows how lost they are so you know I
guess we can thank the touch bar MacBook
Pro for giving Apple a kick in the butt
they needed but it also makes sense when
they tease that the iMac will be getting
features that pros will like because
they had absolutely nothing plan for the
new Mac Pro this year nada
wow that's a bad apple and that pro
display Apple T's would be coming with
that modular Mac Pro there were no
details given but Pike's Universal
believes it could be an 8k display
especially if they want to truly cater
to the pros like they used to Dell
currently has a 32 inch ultra sharp 8k
display that currently retails for
$5,000 in the US right now and let's go
back and speaking of that new iMac
Pyke's Universal also leaked the
purported specs of the new machines from
their reliable sources the report says
the 2017 IMX will feature new pro grade
Intel Xeon e3 processors that support
ECC RAM and haven't even been released
yet with 16 gigs of ECC Ram configurable
up to 64 gigs also a faster non-volatile
memory express PCIe flashed based
storage drive for up to two terabytes
and
d graphics card options and Thunderbolt
3 ports that's power and with everything
we know now you know this was what Apple
was hoping to tout as their new Pro
machine for 2017 and you know what also
guess what Apple might be petty because
Apple has never been known to be petty
wink wink
Apple is suing swatch over their use of
the phrase tick different on certain
watch models that Apple claims is a play
on their think different ad campaign
from the 1990s and guess what Apple
you're right but who in God's green
earth bought a Swatch watch that has
that take different slogan on it nobody
and if you did reveal yourself all right
that's going to do for this week you can
email us at the Apple bite at cnet.com
or tweet me at brian tom thanks so much
for watching we'll catch y'all next time
for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
