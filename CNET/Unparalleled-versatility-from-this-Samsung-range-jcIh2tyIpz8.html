appliances here with another range this
time we're looking at the samsung dual
door flex duo so we've already looked at
a flex to arrange in the past but this
is a new addition to Samsung's lineup it
is in 1899 dollar ranged a little bit
less than the last flex duo we looked at
and it doesn't have as striking of a
design but it has a really interesting
feature that I think you'll like so if
you haven't looked at our flex do a
coverage in the past this is an
interesting feature that Samsung has
done that lets you insert a divider to
convert a large capacity oven into two
separate compartments without the
divider you get a 5.9 cubic foot
capacity range when you stick the
divider end the top oven is 2.7 cubic
feet and the bottom oven is a slightly
larger 3 cubic feet that way if you want
to cook three racks of cookies for the
holiday season you can use the larger
oven and if you just want to cook a
pizza quickly and efficiently you can
just use the top oven aside from the
added flexibility of being able to
convert this thing into two ovens in the
first place it also has a hidden lever
on the inside of the handle so that you
can access just the top oven otherwise
this model was easy to use it looks
pretty nice and the performance was also
pretty good for the small burner boil
test it did pretty well not great not
terrible for the large burner boil test
it got next to last and for broiling
hamburgers it actually scored the best
out of all the electric models in our
comparison all in all I really like this
samsung dual door flex to a model its
performance usability and design we're
pretty on point but its features are
really where it shines thanks for
watching this review of Samsung's dual
door flex duo range be sure to check out
