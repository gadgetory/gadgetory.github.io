trouble on its hands or its face screen
whatever you guys get the idea
nucleus a touchscreen enabled intercom
system released in August of 2016 claims
Amazon quote probably copied us unquote
I know I know this seems a little bit
like Amazon announced a product and now
I want to get in on that action by
saying Amazon copied us but there's a
bit more to it than that
not only does nucleus tap into Amazon's
Alexa but after selling out its initial
run it received 5.6 million dollars in
funding from Amazon's venture capital
arm Alexa fund making Amazon the prime
investor in nucleus and opening design
information and roadmaps to the online
retail giant that's definitely raising
some eyebrows it's also possible the
outcome of this particular brouhaha
could scare off third-party developers
if Amazon happily crushes smaller
companies with their own versions of
Alexa enabled products it might
discourage startups from prototyping new
devices
yikes so what's Amazon have to say about
all this company's spokesperson Don Brun
said in a statement quote we didn't get
the idea for Ecco show from nucleus
Alexa is already on screens Fire TV and
Fire tablets we're always thinking of
what will benefit our customers we know
our customers love to have choice in
form factors and that's a goal of ours
on the Alexa team unquote nucleus CEO
Jonathan Frankel says he's considering
all options for his company going
forward but in the meantime hopes to
band together with other companies
experiencing similar disruptions due to
products like the echo show so for now
we'll have to keep an eye on it for more
