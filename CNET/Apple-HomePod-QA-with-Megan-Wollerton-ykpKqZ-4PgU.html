voice enabled Siri speaker is now
available for purchase at Apple comm and
you all have a lot of questions about it
so we went to Twitter and asked you to
send us specific questions that we would
answer in this video so that is exactly
what we're gonna do right now
so first up we have a question from
Peres neeti I'm so sorry if I'm
mispronouncing your name you are at
Indian fandom and your question is how
does it fare against the Google home max
so that is a great question they're
really really close which makes it a
little bit difficult as far as a buying
decision but the Google home max is a
little bit more expensive it's 399
versus the Apple home pod which is 349
also you have to decide if you want a
serie or a Google assistant enabled
speaker so that's another big question
but also the sound quality the home pod
sounds a little bit better than the
Google home max but the Google home max
has a lot more conversational smart
Google assistant integration so you can
do a lot more with it it has voice
training and has calling a lot more
features so that's something you
definitely need to think about next
question from RJ at r.j. 1975 what are
your thoughts on waiting on the second
generation so if you're an iOS person
and you really want a smart home speaker
and you're into the superior sound
quality I wouldn't wait it took Apple
six years to come out at the home pod
and they are basically way behind Amazon
and Google already so I wouldn't hold
your breath on a new generation honestly
I wouldn't wait and if you're
particularly wondering if some of the
new features that are coming out won't
be available on this first gen model you
don't really need to worry about about
that stuff like stereo and airplay to
are going to be released for this first
gen home pod sometime this year they
haven't said exactly when but that's
stuff that will be released through a
free software updates you can expect
that a lot of that stuff will you know
additional features we'll be rolling out
to that too on a free basis without
having to wait for a second general
another question we have that is a
really really great question from Mary H
she's at HMS studentship her question is
are you able to create scenes through
homekit that play music along with other
homekit tasks playing energizing music
with good morning relaxing music with
good night etc that is a great question
so unfortunately the short answer is no
currently you can't do that with scenes
home pod is not an accessory in your
home app to create smart home automation
integrations with that speaker so you
can't have it play energizing music in
the morning and relaxing music at night
Apple hasn't confirmed that that's
something they will bring but I really
really hope they do because that would
be great Mary each had a follow-up
question - that was also really good is
it possible future software updates to
this first version of home pod will
include multi-user audio and
opportunities for developers to create
apps for it so this is sort of similar
to what RJ was asking about waiting for
a second gen model or not I would say
that it is definitely possible that
future updates will include other
features I can't say for sure if it'll
include multi-user audio and also I'm
not sure if I multi-user audio you mean
voice training like Alexa and Google
assistant currently have because Apple
definitely won't commit to an answer on
that yes so if you say that if you say
the wake words to Siri she won't be able
to differentiate between you and your
roommate or whoever else do you live
with which is definitely a limitation
right now and I can't say if that's
going to be brought through a free
update anytime in the future as far as
developers creating apps if you're
talking about home kit that's a definite
yes so through iOS 11.3 you will be able
to have home kit as like a more open
platform so they're trying to do more of
the Amazon Alexa and Google assistant
thing where more developers can come in
and
create integration so that it's not so
limited because homecare right now has
far fewer integrations than their
competitors a final question that that
was really good is from let's see from
James James rebury James Ribery sorry
James it's at James Reeb okay here's
what he says big question buy or wait I
think I want to wait used to be a me
first with Apple stuff but lately I'm
waiting I even chose an A+ over the X so
this is a really nuanced question with
not a great yes-or-no answer but if you
are an iOS person if you are sold on
home kid if you want superior sound
quality if you're willing to pay 350
bucks because that's a lot then I would
say yes go ahead and get it if you are
not sold on smart home stuff if you
don't want to spend that much if you're
not really if you don't really care
about the superior sound quality because
again like the Amazon echo is a hundred
bucks and it sounds pretty good so if
you don't really care that much then I
would say definitely not if you are
waiting to see about new features then
again I would say just hold off if
you're not sure and give it a second but
again I wouldn't be waiting for that
second gen model to come out right away
or a less expensive one like Amazon did
with that go dot or Google did with the
Google hominy so that's just a brief
overview of some of the questions you
guys are asking about the $349 Apple
home pod that is available starting
February 9th which is today the day that
we're filming this feel free to reach
out to me on Twitter at Megan bulletin
that's wo ll eat rton for any follow up
questions I'm happy to answer them
thanks for watching right now it doesn't
support voice training or anything like
that so if you say the wake word to Siri
hey Siri I think she's going to respond
to Wi-Fi issues look in the home app
associated with this home for more
