episode 349 of the 359 you know me I'm
BVG and we are finally back I apologize
for the chaotic schedule we're back and
here we go with Alfred Inge and Ben
facts really we survived without you
yeah at all arguably better off not
really but anyway welcome back thanks
for coming in we've got a loaded show
today because we're in the middle of
tech earning season so we're gonna start
off with Facebook's earnings talk about
some of the troubles that they're having
trying to retarget their website trying
to make it a little bit friendlier and
nicer but losing some some usage in the
meantime while they're trying to
retarget their audience and retarget
their their site we'll also talk a
little bit about Twitter BOTS
Alfred wrote a story about IOT home
security that we'll jump into and then
we'll wrap up with intel light show
drones you might remember them from the
Superbowl which is coming up on Sunday
what's a Superbowl this is a curb owl
the superb owl which is my favorite
apparently we're gonna get sued for
saying Superbowl because you're not
allowed to say Superbowl unless Super
Bowl Super Bowl Super Bowl anyway send
in your questions and comments BBG we'll
get to as many as you can at the end of
the show and let's get to the podcast
all right stick around we're gonna
record the four in a podcast feedback
join you in the chat in three minutes
and 59 seconds from three to welcome to
the 359 I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm alfred
hang all is not well in the land of
social media facebook reported earnings
yesterday Sayle saying daily active
users dropped in the US and canada for
the first time ever also people are
spending less time on the site how far
do you think that this is just kind of a
bump in the road that Facebook is facing
while they're trying to retarget their
site and trying to change things around
a little bit I mean if this is a bump in
the road this is a big bump in the road
I mean I would say this is more like a
dead deer that kind of jumped on their
windshield or something I think that
there's gonna be a continuation of less
usage on Facebook and you know some more
problems that they're I think they say
people are starting to move away from it
I think
it's left all these fake new stuff and
political discourses left a bad taste in
a lot of people's mouths and you know
it's one of those things where a lot of
people that I know and this is purely
anecdotal like I can't say this reflects
for all of America but you know most
people I know like are basically only on
Facebook for like messenger and events
now like they don't want to be left out
of somebody's birthday party but I don't
think they really care like what people
have to post on it anymore and you can
see that from what facebook has been
doing for to drive up engagement you
know you get these texts and are like
hey did you see the comment that your
friend made on this other photo by the
way you're having a birthday party I
didn't I didn't get the yeah I don't use
Facebook oh okay all right that's that's
a little awkward but that's okay do you
do you what what would you like to see
Facebook actually do to change things
around or do you think that it's it's
just not really working and maybe people
are moving on to like other other
concepts well they're trying to turn the
car around now they're trying to bring
it back to you know what it was kind of
started on with like this is just for my
friends and my family and talking to
them but I think you know they've gone
too far now and down this road where
they really can I mean like people have
come to know Facebook is like a service
for this and you know and I think the
direction that a lot of people on social
media are going toward which is why you
see snapchat and Instagram which
Facebook owns is so popular in in the
sense of you know they are insular it's
like snapchat isn't about having a
million friends it's about having like a
small group of people that like you
taught us a smaller note yeah yeah
tighter connections we also wanted to
touch on Twitter they're grappling with
a BOTS problem but do you think that
they can fix their BOTS problem or do
they even want to in some ways it
inflates their numbers they get to say
that they have over 300 million plus
users a lot of those folks are BOTS so
they would take a significant hit to
their reputation and they'd have to say
that they had negative numbers if they
did kick off all their BOTS
I think BOTS will be around on Twitter
as long as influences assigned to
follower count you know you can be
extremely smart you can have a lot of
great insight but if you don't have like
the follower account you know you're not
people aren't gonna like think much of
you and I think that's where this BOTS
industry really thrives on okay so
Alfred you also
wrote today about the hassle of managing
the security updates for all your
Internet of Things devices tell me a
little bit about that so the issue of
you know the rise of IOT devices is that
you're gonna have so many in your home
and it's gonna be you know really
difficult to maintain updates for all of
them you know it's gonna be your TV your
toilet that talks to you for some reason
your refrigerator a toaster all this
stuff that's in your home that's
connected all needs to be updated yeah
and it all needs to be updated at all
time think about how annoying it is read
update just your phone we're just your
computer yeah
it's extremely frustrating nothing about
that with all your devices so and but
that's a major security risk because
there's so many IOT devices that can be
hacked for that for botnets so a lot of
security companies have now come out
with these routers that it all connects
to that one router and then it
automatically pushes out the updates for
them but it's gonna cost yeah so I mean
the idea is would you want to pay $10 or
$15 a month to give up that hassle a lot
of people have said yes a lot of people
said I would much rather pay for that
convenience yeah Marie it's kind of like
insurance
okay last I wanted to touch on a story
that I wrote about about Intel's drone
light shows and they made a big splash
at the Super Bowl last year expect to
see a lot more of them this year I got a
chance to see the mini drones indoors at
CES and definitely there were there a
lot of videos of this online check them
out do you know if they're performing
with Justin Timberlake I don't think
they're gonna be back at the Superbowl
but it would definitely be pretty cool
if they were oh yeah I saw them outside
the Bellagio in Las Vegas which I was
very cynical about it but it did look
pretty cool in person yeah so if you
want to read more about these stories
check us out on CNET I'm Ben Fox Ruben
I'm alfred Aang thanks for listening so
I got this new smart device is called a
smart spoon I don't know if you guys we
got this in the lab yet or not but I was
like if you're eating well it tells me
what's in the spoon it'll send a text to
my phone and tell me what I'm eating
don't you have to take a picture of the
spoon first though you do yeah
for and then you have to pay a $13
subscription fee annually so that they
can keep that in the database but it's
all totally worth it and it only takes
seven hours to charge mmm
like I love where we're going with our
log of
you're eating later on exactly I think I
forgot what I ate at 11:53 this morning
spoilers it was bacon not with the spoon
though I have a smart spork
at home and it did get hacked and now
somehow I can't eat well I can't eat I
can't eat and some hackers have all my
credit card information and my social
security number but I would say that
it's worth it because yeah it's usually
you want to keep it offline and if you
do have to get our online plug-in
ethernet cord to it so all my device all
my utensils our utensils have a Ethernet
port I'm good good that's that's really
get the dongle for here plates
I think ok so we're making fun of this
but I think I've talked to enough people
in the industry and I think it is true
seeing year over year how much how many
things end up getting a wireless
connection in your home how many do end
up going on Wi-Fi that this is an
inevitability so what you wrote about it
is important I don't know if it makes
sense to do that like 10 or 15 dollars
yeah rip shin sir I was generally
frustrated by this whole notion everyone
that I had talked to kind of pitched it
as this like humanitarian effort kind of
that's like we have to make it money we
have to protect everybody we have to
make sure that all these IOT devices
don't get hacked because there could be
a crisis also give us a lot of money to
do it ok like you can I'm glad to be one
or the other kind a lot of security
companies do that they're just trying to
scare you to a certain extent but if it
is a worthwhile service that does help
people out I mean I I know it's it's a
lot of people have a hard time updating
stuff just the basic stuff yeah so if if
something just kind of does it for you
and it's out of sight out of mind then
maybe it is worth them I wonder if I
don't or alone if I can offer that
myself as a service just like they
wouldn't or like you wouldn't be able to
work here anymore but yeah if you have
any devices I can update for them for
you for a fee right get Inc this move
how about we take some questions from
the chat
first and foremost Matthew dashers
asking if we have loud neighbors in the
studio today yeah we always have
neighbors oh these are these are our
buddies at Giant Bomb and yeah they they
play video games and they play them very
loud
and we're very hot as you should as you
should very happy to have them as
colleagues but especially this week
they've been very very enthusiastic
about the games that they've been I
think they're still playing Super Mario
Sunshine they've been run along yet long
running project but yeah don't blame me
I didn't build this studio I just have
to deal with it the insulation is
lackluster the studio though huh didn't
you didn't you build videos I didn't
like put the walls and drywall up by
hand there's no solution so yeah like
lair of I was doing audio for the past
three days and if you listen very
carefully you will hear the giant bomb
people yelling very loudly at certain
parts during our podcast we're trying to
be very serious and talk about Apple and
they're like oh my god I made it the
next level yeah I call it an easter egg
Josh Boyd has got a really good question
how is paying a monthly or how was
paying monthly for a secure router that
different than paying monthly for your
ISP yeah so Comcast actually has
something like this that they're
planning on launching for their x5 tier
of customers where you you do you know
how like you pay you pay for your router
depending on what internet servers you
have right you're renting it from yeah
so they're doing that there it's gonna
be some new router that's coming with it
that is like a security router they're
partnering up with Kujo which is a smart
firewall company and an angry dog yes
but yeah sounds expensive but you're not
buying the router though you're
technically renting the router so you
which is which could be more expensive
yeah no longer so it'll kind of be like
you're paying your ISP for the internet
service itself but then you're paying
another like 15 I don't they haven't
determined the price yet but based off
of patterns that I've seen with other
subscription services there let's say
like 10 to 20 dollars so on top of like
they already $80 a month that you pay
for internet that it's gonna be like
this much for security now so and just
to understand it correctly so I have a
smart fridge and a smart toaster and a
smart television the router is gonna
take care of the updates for every
single yeah so if it's because it's all
gonna be connected to your router and
then it like scans online every day for
like updates to all the devices because
all the all your devices have like a
certain fingerprint
on it like it knows that this is like a
samsung fridge or like and what model
and stuff and all it is that I can
totally see the value of that yeah I
don't know that I would personally spend
$15 a month on it but I can and it is
it's more than just updates to I mean
there there are devices out there that
have like default passwords on them so
you had and you you don't know that you
can change them or something like that
so some routers will scan for all like
devices that have default passwords and
it'll tell you like hey you should
probably change this and here's how you
can do it kind of thing like through our
app as opposed to like having to type in
your IP address in your like browser and
then like going through that and go
sifting through all your devices and
stuff that way it is a nice kind of
headache saver but ultimately this is
another one of those we made this
problem for ourselves in situations very
good point
- points out that he owns his own router
and modem some ISPs don't let you do
that yeah I know I actually had two
recently I had my own for a long time
and had to take it out of the chain
because they disabled it I don't know
why or what their logic or reasoning was
behind it but I actually had to go back
and put the deposit down for their
stupid box my I bought my in through
Verizon FiOS and I think that's
generally if you plan on keeping a
service for several years it does
generally make more sense to just buy it
outright and that's what I did my ISP
actually does let you buy your own
router but they won't tell me which ones
are compatible with their services
totally cool of course a great thing to
do and I'm still renting mine only
because I thought I'd have been out of
that apartment in like a year yeah it's
been like almost two years now so I mean
I I might as well just get my own I just
keep forgetting about it Wow two years
that's tough
here's an interesting thought and it
might be a little presumptuous but kin
pill I think that's how it's the name is
pronounced uh do you think that Facebook
would go out with a bang now again
presumptuous hmm I mean if myspace has
lived of this long I don't think
Facebook's going anywhere in a hurry
granted it's a downward spiral
that's not something any website has
ever gone out with a bang though I like
most of them just kind of like fade out
and then like they've been too obscure
yeah and then no one uses it and then
Geocities it's still there yeah
I think Geocities is completely gone but
III think so too
didn't even go out with a bang so do
okay to add some additional information
to what we were talking about the usage
numbers are really important related to
Facebook because that's how they make
their money they generate money almost
entirely through advertising so they
need a lot of eyeballs the thing is is
that a lot of their general financial
metrics were very good we highlighted
the ones that were problematic because
those numbers tend to go up all the time
and so it's very notable when they go
down but sales were up nearly 50 percent
to 13 Oh nearly 13 billion dollars
profit rose 20% monthly active users
were up 14% to 2 point 1 3 billion and
daily active users were up also 14
percent to 1.4 billion so Facebook's not
going anywhere no it's definitely not
going anywhere but it is kind of like a
pretty widespread feeling amongst users
whereas like this isn't what I used to
be yeah I don't use it as much yeah but
like Facebook like my mom's on yeah they
did a really good job though basically
just worming their way into your life
whether it's through messenger events
you want to see how your friends are
doing
maybe announcement wedding announcement
whatever there's something that gets you
to go on phase me whether it's every day
or every month or every week or whatever
III think that the better question to
ask though is you know do you think that
you'll live to see the day that Facebook
like is no longer like the premiere like
social network it's a great question
because yeah he's probably definitely
amazing if they somehow existed in there
like as a social media company as
opposed to something else by the time I
died like a long time from now
devil's advocate I stance on Facebook
but I don't invest in it as much I don't
interact with it as much it's like you
said messenger and events that's where I
can stay in touch with people that you
know friends I have that are far away
the this is the easiest way to you know
keep tabs on them check in on and say hi
yeah that kind of thing and for that I
still appreciate it but as far as like
entertainment value it's garbage
yeah for me it's more of a Leanback
experience where I do kind of like
filter through to see what's going on
there
see what people are talking about most
of the time I find it kind of annoying
because if I'm talking to my actual
friends I'm talking to them on whatsapp
or text message it's the same thing that
you were talking about with snapchat
where it's smaller nodes creates like
more material converse and that's why
Instagram is so popular now too because
it's not it's literally you just look at
photos it's really none of like the
whole you know packaged PS that comes
with it of like this is why or countries
it's awful like oh I love I love my wife
happy anniversary now I see anniversary
photos on on Instagram though yeah well
I find those also annoying whatever it's
like if anybody if anybody does that I'm
not gonna not gonna trash you for it
it's fine well I already did how dare
you enjoy the company of your loved ones
we have a perspective from an isp
technician actually in the chat right
now frame out thank you for chiming in
this is actually good information and
you kind of forget that there's always
two sides to every story and he says hi
guys I'm a technician for an isp company
the advantage of leasing a modem is that
the modem if it goes bad the company's
gonna replace it for you free of charge
as opposed to you know what's on your
own bankroll and also yeah they and and
I remember the ISP tech that installed
mine did say that if they do update it
then you just rent the updated version
as opposed to you're holding the bag
with with the old one that you've
already purchased so those those are
very good point and thank you very much
for I love ISP technicians I've always
like I always really appreciate all the
advice that they give them and I feel so
bad I mean there's social media as well
III just think that like ISP technicians
get a bad rep because of the companies
that they work for I think most people
are angry at the companies and not like
the text themselves yeah thank you for
watching
yes thank you for joining us did I don't
want to go into detail on it so but
Danny Green made a comment about some
shady business going on with a very
specific ISP provider and oh yeah
they're being sued for it we're going
through Danny there's literally a New
York City like
prosecution case against them for it
really I wrote about them we got I hate
him so much
wait why can't we met if we
we've written about it we can go for the
attorney general's office like yeah its
spectrum the Attorney General's Office
put out a statement against originally
it was Time Warner Cable that there
throught they were saying like you can
handle the speed but they're totally
rattling on you yeah yes yeah I I
remember reading through the court
documents and it would basically be like
it's completely impossible because the
modem that they give you it like doesn't
even isn't even capable of reaching this
speed so it's just so they were forced
to like issue replacements and stuff but
you had to be aware that they were
offering it it's not like they were
going around saying like hey we're being
sued by the way do you want a new free
router it's kind of like you kind of had
to know that it was going on to get one
this might only be in New York though
because it was the New York Attorney
General's Office that was doing it so
yeah yeah and then they wonder why
people hate and don't trust them so I
swear spectrum and like live nation
should just get into bed with each other
and like that would be a terrifying
combination we got a couple of comments
about Facebook from Michael Brown our
old buddy Michael Brown has anyone
notice how Facebook is switching to be
more like Google+ he expands hmm Google+
is interest-based has been for years
hence still having a strong niche user
base and there's a conversation going on
about trying to get people more involved
with groups not to mention third-party
logging capabilities of Facebook and how
it's just kind of like bled into every
little bit in corner that has less and
less to do with you and your personal
interactions and your actual friends
mm-hmm but isn't that what Zuck said a
few weeks ago how we're gonna like Reath
tool the the news feed so that it's more
about people in your life not the places
yeah and more more impactful or more
important conversations the problem is
to me that seems incredibly forced
because doing it on Facebook which is a
very big platform where some people
follow or they have they have friends
with like thousands of folks you don't
really want to like spill your guts
every day about how you feel or whether
you feel good or bad on any particular
day it does kind of make sense that if
you are gonna share certain things like
that you would with a smaller group of
friends and that's been Facebook's
problem I would say for a long time
whether they're gonna actually
successfully do that they make it more
interest based as Michael Brown
mentioned
I don't know they would they would have
to find a way to have people use groups
a little bit more often I mean they had
been requests they had been prioritizing
Facebook groups for a little bit I don't
know if that's still their mission now
but there was a period of time where
like Facebook groups were like the thing
that Facebook was like trying to go
all-in on we're right because that's how
social interactions yeah yeah you know
like it's that's whatever I mean I I
would I guess you guys can come to like
Thanksgiving but it would be a little
strange you know so whatever all right
we got one more before I call today
imagine soggy says it's basically
criminal that Twitter doesn't capitalize
on the tons of free advertisement with
TV shows and movies and ad campaigns use
hashtags that is I never thought about
that before I've totally thought about
that
I totally wait what do you mean I'm
sorry I don't get it what's the issue I
think he's trying to say you look
everywhere now every billboard in New
York has you know the Smurfs movie
hashtag Smurfs Rock and yeah and how
Twitter doesn't actually monetize that
and every single why would they be able
to like right sighs I don't know and I
don't know like I know newsrooms do like
the ad you know this is yes they don't
yeah but they don't own every
newscasters got their Twitter and their
handled the present company included
yeah they don't yeah they don't own the
hashtag early at symbol no they don't
but they have I mean I don't know it's
like saying like all these people that
have like email addresses it's or like
Gmail addresses sorry whereas like what
they should be monetizing off of that
too I don't a minimum they should be
capitalizing and benefiting from the
fact that they get so much free
advertising for it I mean like it really
is like your publisher like people are
using these hashtags on like Facebook or
something which they do have hash out
but it's not like people don't don't
don't like think like when they see how
hikes I'm like oh I should look up this
hashtag on Facebook most of the times
they're probably going on Twitter for it
yeah I don't know I don't I think they
get the free advertising all right I
mean like people go on their website and
it can boast like these numbers and then
they can get money from advertisements
based off of that yeah and they should
be doing it and they actually have been
monetizing the hashtags bit with the
little like a custom emoji thing that
you get on like certain hashtags like
they pay Facebook Twitter for that
service so they are
okay well that is fairly recent and
hopefully they're making some money
doing it we got one for the road that
just popped up Joey brows says is it me
or is Facebook completely lost its
appeal what is the next big thing in
social media and I feel like we need to
have Brian Cooley in the room to answer
this but there's a thought we've seen
the very brief flutter of snapchat we've
seen Instagram kind of hold tight even
though that's the technically Facebook
now we've seen Twitter somehow stay
ahead above water what would be the next
big thing in social media Alfred I feel
like this one's for you I mean I like I
said I think it's it is going toward
more like a temporary content and like
closed off content I think that's why
even though Instagram complicit anti
social media kinda yeah even though
Instagram completely stole you know
snapchat stories concept like I think
people resonate with that idea a lot of
like this isn't gonna last forever this
isn't gonna be like as a part of my
identity because I think a lot of young
people now that are like growing up with
technology all around them or stem and
realize that you know everything that
you do online is logged forever kind of
thing and in the sense of you know it's
not I I look toward like the young crowd
when I try to see like what's gonna be
happening next online and or like what
the next big trend is or something like
that and I think yeah they're moving
towards something like this isn't logged
forever and the idea of why do I need
like three thousand like something
friends when I only talked to like maybe
15 of them seven yeah and there is there
is a potential for somebody to take that
crown but I would probably say that one
of the one of the ones that's in the
best position to do it is whatsapp and
whatsapp is owned by Facebook so because
I use I tend to use whatsapp a lot and
I've been using it for especially
beneficial in international right
absolutely that's why I started using it
one of our friends moved to Israel and
it was really easy to stay in touch with
them with without extra fees yeah
exactly so but that's the thing is that
Facebook was smart enough to gobble up
some of its potential competitors before
they've got big enough to really
challenge the come well yeah they also
tried to buy snapchat yep and then when
they said for the same reason yeah
I mean yeah they know who's coming after
them and they have the money to just say
like you know we'll pay you this much to
be out be our friend and yeah I'm like
socializing on virtual reality by the
way Facebook also has a lock on that or
they've definitely like cornered that
with oculus all right
I think Zuckerberg is very smart and
recognizing certain places where you
know this is this is where we are today
but where might we be you know three to
five years from now he's certainly had
some good foresight with that Scott
things that the next big thing is gonna
be a brand new never before seen
platform that's still to be determined
kind of situation I think that might be
the case I think we are on the hook to
