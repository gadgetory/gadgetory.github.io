to Samara daily it's a pesky talk show
in their own universe I'm Ashley
together
Jeff Kannada is out on a shoot for today
and tomorrow you can check out some of
the behind the scenes stuff on his
Instagram but for now let's hit the
headlines fingerprint technology in
mobile phones is huge right now but what
if we could do away with the button that
you need LG initech presented a module
called FPC 1268 that sounds a little
boring but instead of using a
traditional button mechanism to house a
fingerprint scanner this module would
exist under the glass cover of a display
making a button unnecessary
waterproofing a device would be much
easier with this type of configuration
and not worrying about a broken home
button is always a plus especially for
an iPhone owner even better unlike much
of the futuristic stuff we talked about
on this show we'll see devices using
this technology as soon as later this
year kind of amazing so we love drones
and we love fireworks
what about drone fireworks sky magic
showed off a delightful performance of
twenty choreographed drones in front of
Japan's Mount Fuji recently over 800
LEDs decorated each drone and a group of
musicians played traditional Japanese
instruments as the quad copters formed
coordinated shapes in the night sky this
sort of show will likely become more and
more commonplace
also it just looks awesome and with
entertainment like man-made meteor
showers rumored to show up at the 2020
Tokyo Olympic Games we wouldn't be
surprised to see a little drone firework
action - so these are really good
stories I have to choose one for
Thursday because Jeff isn't here and
honestly I think I'd like to talk about
drone fireworks because they're the best
that is it for our headlines if you guys
want to talk about drone fireworks tell
me what you want to see what you want
drones to be able to create in the sky
use the hashtag hey TD on Twitter and if
you like treats they'll end up on our
Thursday long show well that being said
let's check out our phone talker for the
day
our photographer of the day today is
Adam who shot this on his iPhone 6's
Adam says Ashley and Jeff loved the show
I've been waiting for a spring theme to
send this awesome panorama of a double
rainbow I took in my neighborhood on my
iPhone 6s my five-year-old daughter
loves rainbows draws them constantly and
even as a rainbow song she loves singing
but this is the first time she's ever
seen a rainbow she loved it please feel
free to use the picture on the show
cheers Adam well first of all
congratulations to your daughter on her
very first rainbow because that must
have been a very exciting moment for her
also you did all the things right you
sent us a picture you told us what
device you took it on you told us a
story about it and you gave us
permission to use the picture on the
show if you do all those things and you
email tomorrow at cnet.com you too can
potentially be featured on photogra for
the day
and the theme this month in May is
spring so if you have an older picture
if you live in the southern hemisphere
you got an older picture laying around
from your spring or if you are in the
northern hemisphere where spring is
happening right now and you just snap
something cool send it on over and we
might feature it on the show that is it
for today's show you guys I will be back
tomorrow again without Jeff I miss his
dad jokes I'll be honest with you but I
will be back tomorrow and then Jeff will
rejoin us on Wednesday and we will still
as always dive into wonderful science
fiction meeting science facts like a
delicious delicious sandwich but until
then vegan humans see you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
