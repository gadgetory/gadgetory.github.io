your home from the lighting to the
drapes to the theater system is all
automated and controlled by the tablet
in your hands home automation is a big
trend that's getting less expensive
every day the simple nest thermostat
brings energy savings and remote control
to an entire house companies like
Phillips and lutron offer remote
controllable lighting that can integrate
with heating cooling and security and
there are even reports that apple and
google are getting into home automation
maybe in a big way but all-in-one
options are coming along slowly one new
choice is Xfinity home and full
disclosure comcast is currently a
sponsor of our show you have things like
you're able to control your thermostat
you can set it for a certain temperature
you can turn it off and on remotely
using your iPad iPhone or any Android
device you can also do things like you
know control the lights in your home you
can plug these little wireless adapters
into any actually any kind of device so
you can use crock pots curling irons I
mean there's a lot of uses people get
really creative the system also
integrates security so you can set
cameras and sensors throughout your
house and keep an eye on things like
your garage or your front door this door
right now for instance has a sensor that
will tell you as soon as the door is
opened the alarm would trigger that's
just a regular door sensor the Xfinity
system is a little pricey it's a few
thousand dollars for installation you
pay for individual hardware add-ons and
the alarm and monitoring fees are thirty
to fifty dollars a month plus you have
to have Comcast broadband internet
service can you say bundle but in a
world where price really is no object
consider a whole other type of home
automation like the kind that hides TVs
in your mirrors
Wow I don't wanna lose any mirror real
estate but I really want a TV in my
walk-in closet you can have both we're
here to say yes technology has a way
engineered environments develops
teksystems for people who want their
tech to be integrated motorized and
totally invisible inside the design of
their houses anything so you can just
put a TV in like any old piece of
furniture yes you're such a matter of
fact wizard here is the ability to bring
up your apple TV through a wall a wall
of Rolexes look at that area no not not
not one of them is good okay good ooh I
love that wherever we can put an iPad in
the wall we will put an iPad put a black
one year this is a concept by Studio
Becker which is taking the toaster and
your espresso machine as well as a lot
of your utensils that you use for
cooking and it motorized is it directly
into the kitchen Wow if you want to
maintain views and you don't want to
have a wall full of cabinetry you don't
have to compromise and our kitchens will
also have multi-panel touch-enabled
screens everywhere obviously so the
browser enables us to bring up a browser
window do any web surfing maybe we want
to do as well as share it among the
different video panels so if you're
cooking with somebody on the other side
of the kitchen and something interesting
happens over here you can shoot it over
there like Minority Report oh I guess
we're on this side send it back to you
we could play an elaborate game of pong
yes home automation is still new it's
still harder more expensive and more
difficult than it needs to be but it is
getting closer and I and my Rolexes will
be waiting
