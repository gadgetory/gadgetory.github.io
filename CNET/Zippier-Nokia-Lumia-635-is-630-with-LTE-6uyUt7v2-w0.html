budget windows phones and now it has
another one to add to its lineup
I'm Jessica doll clerk for CNN and this
is the Nokia Lumia 635 now this is the
exact same phone as the Nokia Lumia 630
except that it has 4G so that means
you're gonna find an interchangeable
back cover a microSD card slot and eight
gigabytes of internal storage that also
means you're gonna find a 4.5 inch
display with an 854 by 480 pixel
resolution if you're a pixel hound then
you will find that that is a little bit
less crisp than what you're gonna find
on the motorola moto G 4G luckily the
1.2 gigahertz quad-core processor inside
works very well and the 5 megapixel
camera on the back doesn't have a flash
but it will give you pretty decent
photos another teeny tiny difference
between the 635 here and the 630 is that
the 4G LTE radio will drain your battery
a little bit faster you have an 18 30
milliamp hour battery to begin with this
phone does have Windows Phone 8.1 on it
as its operating system so you've got a
lot of themes to work with you can
change around the tiles and the size of
the dynamic tiles on the front there's a
new pull down notification menu and of
course the Cortana voice assistant it
does come in a variety of color options
and again you can change out the back
plate so you can change the color as
well one thing that I will point out is
that it's got these angled sides I feel
makes it a little bit harder to hold
because it makes it a little bit smaller
in the back than it is in the front but
I do like the matte finish and that is
easy to grip overall this is a pretty
nice little phone it will do exactly
what you want doesn't have a lot of
whistles and bells but I do think that
it matches the price the closest
competitor is going to be that Moto G 4G
with an Android experience but for a
Windows Phone I think this is a good buy
for CNET I'm Jessica Dahl Court you can
