right on time welcome to Cairo guys hi
welcome to California dialing in from
Egypt over skype for a cultural exchange
through a new project called the virtual
dinner guest how much trust do you have
in giving up your vote there's more
criticism towards the candidate not the
process sonoma california based Francini
richardson and listed her family in the
project as a way for them to break bread
and gain a better understanding of
people in conflict-ridden countries what
i felt from those young people was more
powerful than anything i could read in
the news in preparation of the chat she
prepared fool a typical egyptian
breakfast food it's fava beans with
tomatoes and garlic and cumin it's
refried beans of the Middle East virtual
dinner guest founder Erik Maddox says
the goal is to eat with your mind full
as simple as having a video monitor at
the end of a dinner table and a decent
internet connection and some food
Richardson's grandchildren Emma and
Creighton even got to take the day off
from school for this teachable moment
the family rules in Egypt are they
different from here I thought it was
really cool that we could talk to
someone on the other side of the world
the idea is that it's something that
immediately allows us to see the
humanity and they in our co participants
as for the Richardson family the
dialogue is just beginning in San
Francisco I'm Kara Tsuboi cnet.com for
