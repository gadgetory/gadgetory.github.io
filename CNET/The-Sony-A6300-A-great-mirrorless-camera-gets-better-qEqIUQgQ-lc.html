you know how quickly you can go from
smoothly zipping along green lights all
the way to stop and start gridlocked
traffic I'm Laurie grinning and while
that might be a bit of a hyperbole it's
really not very far from what it feels
like for me to shoot with the sony a6300
the camera flies with a beefed-up
autofocus system excellent 4k video with
high level supporting features and
improved low-light photo quality over
the Asics thousands already great images
it has some of the best photos in its
class with accurate automatic white
balance nicely rendered detailed decent
tonal range and an above average noise
profile Sony's updated autofocus systems
much better for continuous shooting
bringing it up to about the same
accuracy as similar DSLRs in the
thousand dollar range as well as the
fast systems in Olympus and Panasonic
mirrorless models the new sub segmented
clump of 15 small AF areas which it uses
to track does significantly improve the
experience of using continuous autofocus
but the group of AF points does get
easily distracted by other elements in
the scene I did get a few good shots for
most of my bursts though and you'll
probably find even the slightly out of
focus ones can pass at smaller sizes
basically it's only a bit different from
the a6000 but all for the better I wish
Sony had made more changes though and
added in body image stabilization
combined with the size advantages of
mirrorless interchangeable-lens model
there's a lot to appeal to enthusiasts
who might otherwise buy a fast
general-purpose DSLR so where's the
gridlock Sony didn't fix the frustrating
operational issues of its current a
series models for those details you'll
have to read my review on Sina
