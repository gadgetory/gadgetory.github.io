we've seen it and this is a look at
Nikon's android camera the coolpix s 800
see now the camera is basically one of
my cons existing point-and-shoots the s
6300 which has a 16 megapixel backside
illuminated CMOS sensor and a 10x
optical zoom in place of that models
physical controls you have this large
3.5 inch OLED touchscreen turn it on and
you get the interface you'll find on
most coolpix cameras designed for touch
with a handful of shooting modes and
access to settings and playback and as a
camera it performs like the s 6300 which
for its current 150 dollar price is good
but nothing special what makes the S 800
see different is that when you hit the
home button
you're popped into an Android interface
albeit an old version of it with that
you get what Android offers so you can
play games check your email or stream
movies or music and it has bluetooth so
you can connect wireless headphones but
perhaps most importantly you can upload
photos over Wi-Fi to your favorite
sharing sites as well as take advantage
of any shooting or editing apps when you
don't have Wi-Fi access you can use an
act to connect to an Android or iOS
device and send photos to it to upload
the biggest downside to all of this is
battery life it's short when you're just
shooting photos but add in anything else
and the battery just empties out fast
price is a barrier too with this
starting at $350 and again it's photos
are like those from the less expensive
s60 300 it's a decent first attempt
though if you want more shooting
flexibility than your smartphone offers
I'm Josh Goldman and that's the Nikon
