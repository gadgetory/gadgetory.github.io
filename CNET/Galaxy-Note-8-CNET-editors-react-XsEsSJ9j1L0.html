Park Avenue Armory right up to the
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 unveiling I'm
Scott Stein this is Jessica del Court
and we're gonna talk about the no date
so Jessica you used it I used it a
little bit so this seems pretty similar
to the essay in the essay Plus but what
are the key features here that make it
worthwhile yeah I mean this phone really
is a combination of last spring's Galaxy
s8 plus and last year's note 7 because
there was that double recall in the note
7 there are a lot of features in this
phone that people didn't actually get a
chance to use especially if they were
still stuck on their note 5s so what
makes it really different from the s8
plus it's not really the size to be
honest it's not things like the
processor but there is a second camera
on the back and that's what you're gonna
be able to use to take portrait mode
like Apple's iPhone 7 plus and then
there's that S Pen Stylus that you can
use to write draw and navigate around so
you really have to be I think like a fan
of the note series to get this phone
over the s8 plus or maybe even the s8
which is a little bit cheaper I like the
idea of that stylus I think the dual
camera seems like a really useful
feature especially for getting that
depth of field effect which you can now
do but at that expensive price
comparatively to where the s8 and si
plus are now available for four
comparably less you know is it really
worth that
that's step-up I don't know I like the
things that you can do with the pen like
maybe spot translation or the ability to
bring up special customized apps but I
don't know how much of a pen person I am
yeah I mean I guess you won't know until
you start I mean if you were to buy it
you would make it part of your routine
then I think it would come to either
rely on it or come to decide that you
don't really use it and it's not for you
and in the past there have been other
features beyond that have differentiated
it today you wouldn't even need to use
the pen and you would still feel like
you had a completely fresh different
phone and with the exception of that
second camera I just don't know that
that's really there this could backfire
for Samsung or it could move in
Samsung's favor for a number of reasons
especially based on price because we've
got these other big phones coming out
right there a lot so yeah we're in the
middle of a big phone season LG's got
its phone there's the next pixel phone
the next iPhone so you know and it
sounds like a lot of the prices for
these may be increasing so you know is
this gonna feel too expensive compared
to the others do you want to wait
is it gonna feel like the best feature
set right exactly it might feel like the
most powerful most advanced phone that
you can buy on the market depending on
what Apple brings to the table right and
also Google and LG we just don't know
that yet also really interesting for me
as what Samsung is doing Samsung is
actually acknowledging original note 7
owners and giving them great an
opportunity to get the phone for less so
whichever phone you have now if you were
to pre-order the note or buy the note
from Samsung's website specifically then
they'll give you an instant rebate on
whichever firm that you have and it's
pretty sizable so I was really excited
to see that because I was really
convinced that Samsung wasn't gonna do
anything that that was it they had a
party and everything they were gonna say
about that at 7 and then we're gonna
make any other efforts to sort of like
put the whole note 7 fire disaster
behind it and I'm really glad that the
company did and I'm hoping that you know
for the gun-shy buyers that that's
enough for them to turn the tide if they
just weren't sure and is an extra little
incentive well that also brings the
point for me like how essential is the
note 8 at this point because it does
feel like its feature set has creeped
closer to the galaxy line and it's great
for the galaxy line but it just makes it
feel more like an extension and to the
point where if you opted for the Galaxy
phones the Si and si plus you wouldn't
really miss all that much and so maybe
they're trying to provide an extra
incentive there to consider this model
as well yeah and that's what they're
doing for anybody who pre-orders the
node 8 bundle where you can get a gift
do you have your choice of one or the
other it's like the gear 360 camera or a
wireless charger and an extra micro SD
card for storage but I do think also
what's really interesting about this for
Samsung is that they are competing
against all these other phones that are
coming this is the premium phone it's
something that they have traditionally
done every single time but I feel like
Samsung has played it safe
Samsung has held back a little bit I
feel like that opens the door to Apple
if Apple has this real like giant killer
feature that we're all hoping for and
expecting and it's anniversary edition
phone then you know what is that gonna
do for Samsung in the note
I understand why they help back I'm
saying it's safe they cannot have a
repeat but at the same time is it
exciting I don't know it's interesting
because Apple is talking all about AR
with the iPhone while Samsung is not
talking about AR right now but they are
still bringing up VR which requires its
own new headset now to work with the
note 8 so it looks so similar I thought
it was the same one but you actually
have to get a slight variation upgrade
that's backwards compatible but you
can't take your old one to stick your no
date in its that's frustrating but a
full review of the Samsung Galaxy Note 8
is in the works coming soon so stay
tuned for that and more with a lot of
other phones here at CNN</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
