to experience what it might be like to
hang around the surface of the Sun
facebook is introducing its very own
Facebook graveyard oh yay way to bring
it dark and Google is working with some
interesting data trees with their brand
new feature knowledge graph we're going
to tell you all about it I was really
nerdy so it's not really
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily I'm co-host
ashley's gather join me as always kill
anonymous it's our face it's a
Valentine's Day episode hey don't wear
my red sriracha shirt because love is
hot it's technically our Valentine's Day
of choice because because it's the day
Friday we don't work saturday we don't
so we didn't team it in anyway so I were
read as much as I just said is the
all-inclusive amount of Valentine's Day
there is in this episode yeah yeah so
yeah with this Facebook graveyard thing
so let's yeah we're gonna we'll listen
you could gift somebody the gift of a
legacy moderator as done that is like oh
darn yeah that's that's very good as
getting a toucan your apartment that is
true um all right guys let's hit
headlines okay so I saw this and I
thought it was so cool and I now I want
to immediately booked a flight to
Maryland to go check this out this is
called solarium and it's from NASA so
nASA has had what is called the Solar
Dynamics Observatory it's been up in the
sky for five years it has been taking
pictures about every second of the Sun
for the last five years so they just
released this video and it's it's super
super high definition like the
resolution on these pictures is insane
so this is you know all those videos of
like those beautiful high res videos of
the Sun moving and all that other stuff
that you've seen online over the past
years sure usually compiled from images
from the SDO so amazing yeah so
basically how it works is it keeps tabs
on all the UV light that's coming out of
Sun snaps a picture like I said about
once every second and each picture is
about eight times the resolution of an
HDTV so it's pretty it's like eight
thousand pixels Wow we are comparing it
to 4k anyway so yeah yeah so um so the
cool thing about this is there the
pictures are actually in black and white
and because they actually the sto
records the images in binary code and
then they bring in the code and then it
can create these images and then actual
people scientist that now is that color
eyes the images yeah and show us what
different things look like so they
colorized base there's like a whole
color code based on like oh if this is
UV then it would be this color and if
this is this it would be
color it's really really interesting
okay so now that we've established the
sdl let's talk about solarium so
solarium is the exhibit that they're
going to be doing this is a huge video
art installation that allows you to
stand in the middle of basically the Sun
erupting like look at that crazy little
girls is like whoa that is what it's
like to be on facebook check that out
just what do you mean stand in the
middle so they have a full a full like
three wall installation where you
basically walk into the middle of it and
then it encompasses you it's not all the
way around it's not 360 degrees but they
have this whole exhibit where you're
able to walk through and then there's
like a huge video wall where you stand
there and it'll show you all of these
crazy beautiful high-definition images
like right in the Sun and I just I love
all the pictures that they show to this
one minute of footage for this is about
10 hours of work Wow to colorize and get
all the data and create the image all
that stuff so there's a lot of work
that's gone into this and so two
different places where you can see it
right now it's on display at the NASA
Goddard Visitor Center in Maryland as a
permanent installation so it'll just be
there and admission is free there I
found that out on the website which is
very cool if you live in the area i
highly recommend you go see this and
then it'll also be shown in tucson
arizona until May seventeenth as part of
the it's part of at the center for
creative photography as it's going to be
traveling installations there's nowhere
hotter than tucson arizona and that's a
fact and that's why it's basically side
surface of the sun it is like the
surface of the sun so they're like let's
just put it there because people won't
even know the difference they'll come in
from outside and be like oh it's just
like being outside i'm on the surface of
the sun yay but yeah i just thought that
was so cool that they were doing that
and i love those um you know whenever
they have the all of the different
coronal mass ejections and stuff from
the Sun I always liked watching all
those videos because they're so
beautiful and fascinating me that we can
see the Sun in that amount of detail
it's just so cool it's terrifying it's a
little bit Tara beautifully terrifying
it scare citing it is so speaking of
scare citing okay it's a little weird so
we're gonna bring it down in a way
facebook today has turned turned
facebook into kind
the cemetery alright so in Rosie's Liam
so previously when someone passed away
there was no way to kind of curate what
showed up on their Facebook well now
they're allowing the ability for a loved
one to kind of take over your account
after you pass right and and cure rate
for you this is called legacy contacts
and basically what happens is you get to
select one person who will be able to
post on your account not as you but as
you as you as their themselves the
content or leaf memorial posts and they
can pin it to the top of your page and
basically just give you a nice place for
all of your friends a nice digital
send-off yeah to kind of leave their
comments and whatnot they can't access
your private messages but you can grant
them permission to download an archive
posts and photos and stuff like that you
can only pick one person though so
choose wisely because when you pass
that's gonna be the person that's
responsible for creating the crank your
content it and I think this is great I
think it's cool it's scary though wow
it's scary that that Facebook is like
yep people are gonna have facebooks and
they're gonna die well this has been a
actual problem so when people pass away
traditionally on Facebook they were very
adamant that no our user privacy is is
paramount to us and I just rolled my
eyes if you were just listening the show
but they said you know no our user
privacy is very important to us and
we're not going to allow people into
these accounts if we find out they died
we lock the page and we turn it into a
memorial page which you can do like you
can submit like to Facebook and say this
person has passed away and then I think
you have to actually send in like a
death certificate to like have it
converted because here's the thing you
don't want some troll going over me like
I heard kill anonymous died yeah it's
real terrible like you don't want that
would I care someone's takes over my
account rest in peace game it's not
gonna be any worse than it is now so um
but that was one of the things that a
lot of grieving sort of family members
and friends would say they're like well
how can we even you know if someone gets
a friend request or like how can we
manage this page without you know
obviously we're not gonna want to troll
we just really want to manage this page
and we want to make this memorial or
whatever and so Facebook finally kind of
caved in on this which is really
interesting
but I think it's one of these super
fascinating areas of like future tech
that we don't consider is like what
happens to all of our social media
profiles when we die and what happens
you know what do you do with all that
stuff like and now being able to
delegate like you can actually will your
your profile information to people like
if you put it in your will like Facebook
will give you legacy control over that
account like if you if you just will it
which is so weird and super mal ittle
bit morbid but the thing is it's also
something you just don't think about man
you are super into this I really am it's
a super fast again I get it I thought it
was very interesting it's just should be
interesting to see what happens it's
such an inevitable I mean obviously like
I know not to be a downer only a step
forward in and how we how many deal with
stuff it's so weird it's like really
rocking your world what's just these are
part of your affairs now like these are
things that you have to get an order you
liked gosh what am I gonna do with my
Twitter page like what am I gonna do
with my Twitter handle like can you will
your Twitter handle to somebody it's
just so weird I hate it honestly because
I think that it's quite jolly the life
you live and the people you know in
person are the things that should matter
to kind of like fair kind of have that
like digital space be an important thing
to you is a little unsettling it's very
important these days but to me it's just
kind of like the you know getting the
initial out there but like having to
worry about it that much it's just it's
so stressful well the other dress off an
out enough later this is something like
smelly poop oh you know without having
to worry about like Who am I gonna put
in charge of this thing if I suddenly
died about yeah I don't want to worry
about that now I want to go home and be
like well better hope the people like my
poster i'm dr. picture and kayla and a
coffin like like like like I'm just like
it's fine your legacy creator could just
look like LOL kale still God my slow mo
mo like whatever um no I just I find
this really fascinating it is a little
creepy I'd like to think about but the
thing is is it also is one of those
future problems that we're now starting
to have there's a certain amount of
people you can't reach because you know
there's always certain amount of people
you can only reach because of the social
networks yeah there you go so super
interesting find that very fascinating
um you just love the dead that's it's
really all it is I do it's so true um so
I
have been like a like a medical examiner
in a prior life or something um all
right I got to tell you about knowledge
graph so data is not necessarily the
most exciting thing ever but I found
this to be really cool so Google
announced knowledge graph this week I
mean they have this video and it's super
interesting and basically knowledge
graph is going to try to bring your
searches into context so um and Link a
bunch of things together so remember
when we saw the galaxy for Wikipedia yes
okay kind of reminds me of that so let's
say so they're going to add this panel
to the right side of your search that
actually utilizes knowledge graph so
let's say you look up something that
you're interested in but maybe don't
know a lot about like peripheral topics
around it or people around it so
knowledge graph is going to help you
find that information much much easier
as opposed to continually typing in like
okay so you type in like da Vinci and
then it shows you a bunch of search
results or da Vinci and nothing else and
it might say like related searches like
somewhere yeah okay now you're going to
get this panel on the right side of your
google search it almost reminds me of a
Wikipedia entry um which i think is a
little bit clever and also kind of it's
a little bit of an undermine on
Wikipedia but I I think it's a really
good idea they're doing this so now
let's say you type in Leonardo da Vinci
you've never heard of any other
Renaissance painter you have no idea
what you're looking for now it'll say
here's all these paintings by Leonardo
da Vinci here's other Renaissance
artists they already have this with like
movies and whatnot yes and tigers and
like when you have an actor it's like
here are the mindy be rather related
yeah so now the news is that they're
doing there are disbanding this well
they're just expanding it for its called
knowledge graph so it's gonna be
everything so they're even so they're
working with um the thing that I found
really interesting was uh if you look up
like measles for example it's like been
a big thing here in the news like in
California because it's at Disneyland um
if you look up measles on the right hand
side on that panel it'll tell you like
symptoms and what it is and blah blah
but it's all double fact-checked by like
places like the Mayo Clinic so it's like
very good solid information it's not
just like well I'm not really sure I'm
clicking here in this like list of links
so they're giving really good
information that's actually been
fact-checked by different organizations
depending on the topic which I find very
I think I think it's great and I think
it's much easier to search visually
through something like Google yeah I
think it's really smart of them because
the thing is is like sometimes you type
in a search phrase in your psyche I
don't even know what I'm looking for
like sometimes I'll type in something I
just I need like either a visual
reference or something to like give me
that context so I think this is really
smart and they're saying for me I think
this might actually change the way that
we searched like that we use search
engines because instead of just giving
you you know text right links they
already have like I said I already have
this written stuff like that people know
it's just it just creates that rabbit
hole that you follow the search rabbit
hole just like you to Wikipedia yeah
wikipedia and youtube so they're trying
to do that now with search which i think
is really interesting and I'm also very
smart on Google's part of a good kind of
a good move forward for them in terms of
search engine so all right guys we are
gonna take a quick break we'll be right
back with a rounded into it because it
is Thursday and then also we have your
user feedback because came up was a
really good user feedback about those
sheep and we also have our phone tog
refer the day so don't click away it's
tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show it's finally
happened ladies and gentlemen keel
Anonymous has consumed too much sugar it
wasn't that much weight was like a
bucket the surge remember I had this
urge on this episode of you're like that
wasn't even as much sugar as that iced
coffee that you no good like a little
kid ate too much candy so what are we
doing now oh well it's Thursday which
means we have to tell everybody all the
cool stuff that we like which means it's
time for into it Cal what are you into
okay so I actually do like to find
something and then get obsessed with it
and then move on to something else okay
so i actually have never really listened
to podcasts cuz i was like i'm gonna
start at the top work my way down gotta
install start of the cereal and so I'm
into the Nerdist podcast I know this is
nothing new but i'm really glad i waited
this long to get you to you yeah i'm
really glad i waited to get into it I'm
only talking about the audio podcast on
iTunes and I'm only talking about the
interviews okay like because what this
has caused me to do is look at this wall
of like all these people and find out
hey who really inspires me who would i'd
like to know some some stuff and so gabe
newell i just listen to metallica this
morning during my workout which is super
interesting yeah it's great the listen o
gara mo del toro the demos now or a good
one yeah so it's really cool to kind of
like get some insight into because we're
in this industry into how people think
and everybody has a different path
that's always what's crazy um yeah it's
really interesting to me and i'll
probably go on to something else very
soon but yeah it's been super
entertaining their bide your time very
well and I know nobody's new to podcast
but if you haven't listened Nerdist
podcast in a while try to a cool just go
back and see if there's anything that
interests you so that's one thing I
really like about the Nerdist fog is in
other party house as well as they're
very evergreen like you can just go back
and listen to and it's not super timely
or otherwise like oh you got to listen
to it this week otherwise you're gonna
miss out like you can listen you can go
back like yours and be like oh hey like
I really like
that director although some of them some
of that they're evergreen but there's
one I listen to Kevin foggy mm-hmm and
he was talking about guardians of galaxy
they had just started filming it oh I
really think people are gonna like it I
really think it's gonna just gonna do
okay like we were scared cial
everything's gonna do okay it's like
he's like we're just worried that like
if we make this and it fails will not
get to do another one just like this is
great you don't know it's gonna be so
good you're like I love the future and
I'm gonna tell you it works but it's
it's really cool um it's it's also great
that Hardwick lets them talk which is
like you know he's nice usually anybody
that hosts a podcast they're like that
well I'm the host I'm gonna text so that
that's what I just like let them adjust
the information is what's important so
anyway that's what I'm really into and
that is a good into and probably next
week a von Bulow setting a podcast
anymore well yeah yeah you're just gonna
be done with it um so do you into I ok
so PlayStation Plus has a few free games
this month and among them is this game
called apathy on that I've been playing
is awesome and I like there are it's not
a you know it's not a 10 out of 10 it's
an it's a little indie game there's some
there's some control issues like here
and there like sometimes but it looks
like you are on a grecian like earn like
the entire game has this beautiful to di
peggio Grecian painting like it just
looks so awesome and you pick up it's
kind of like an action RPG you can pick
up different weapons that are all kind
of appropriate for the time frame that
this takes place in you have to like go
up to Mount Olympus and fight the gods
and like all this stuff that is a
beautiful looking game it is gorgeous
and it's actually pretty intuitive like
it's it's pretty straightforward it's
fun I like I've just been having a
really good time playing it and it was
free because I have playstation plus so
I was just like yeah awesome like I was
really jazzed about that I'd have to pay
for it so um I mean I pay for my
playstation plus but but yeah like this
it's it's actually it's so good and
there's so many different like weird
little mechanics like there's um you can
throw stuff like javelins and you can
craft they even have like crafting and
you so like today he's fighting the gods
right now he's a really big gods that
you're fighting and you go up to Mount
Olympus it's it is really really cool
so that's a paw Fionna and I've just
been having a really great time playing
that and it's it is really beautiful
yeah I love those indie games you know
it's like they have they have a chance
to like try out some new stuff yeah like
something that you would never see in a
full-length like you know 2050 our game
like this is the perfect like sort of
indie game is exactly what's cool about
indie gaming it's really neat so apathy
on its on PlayStation 4 you can get it
on them I think you'd on steam as well
oh it's available there we go as well so
