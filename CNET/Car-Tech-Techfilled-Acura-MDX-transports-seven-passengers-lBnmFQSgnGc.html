HDMI rear seat entertainment system
actor throws a lot of tech into its MDX
SUV and for the 2016 model year we have
a 9 speed automatic transmission and an
idle stop feature for fuel saving
there's a lot of things I like about the
2016 MDX and some things I definitely
don't the MDX is acura 7 passenger
premium SUV but to my eye it prints a
little bit smaller it looks more like a
lexus RX or a BMW x5 with five passenger
suvs the third row is actually not that
hard to get into even for adults
although you will need to be a little
bit flexible
now let me get this out of the way right
from the start I really hate this
infotainment interface I've got a button
and dials here they just control this
upper LCD plus I've got a touchscreen in
the middle these control some of the
same functions but in a completely
different format it's very confusing and
for navigation the maps are stored on a
hard drive so they refresh quickly plus
I've got live traffic here that's pretty
good one thing I don't have though is
any sort of real online destination
search and that's something or Acura is
a little bit behind the times of course
I've got a hands-free Bluetooth phone
system and four audio sources I've got
quite a few here
satellite radio I've got a DVD Drive
I've got a hard drive in the dashboard
where I can store music I've got USB
ports iPod support and Bluetooth audio
and Pandora got my iPhone paired to the
car I can actually browse its music
library using the Bluetooth interface
that's not something you see on a lot of
cars so that's pretty convenient fully
Wireless music library browsing for the
sound system we've got the Els premium
audio system that's by music producer
Elliot shiner with hardware by Panasonic
12 speakers two in the ceiling actually
that sounds pretty good I like the sound
of the system for the transmission you
don't see a shifter on the console here
you see the set of buttons that's like
inaccurate our LX model this controls
the 9 speed automatic transmission got
Park reverse neutral Plus this bride's
sport button I hit it once I go into
Drive I hit it again I go into sport
mode
plus I have paddles on the steering
wheel here and these let me shift
manually
now under the hood of this MDX we get a
3.5 liter v6 engine that's got direct
injection 290 horsepower 267 pound feet
of torque it does cylinder deactivation
so that knocks out three of the
cylinders if you're just cruising down
the highway they'll save you some fuel
it also has this idle stop feature so in
the city or when you stopped at a
stoplight you also cut off the engine
that'll save you some gas there - it
should get low twenties average fuel
economy it's not bad for a 7 passenger
SUV I've got it in Drive right now set
this button labeled IDs stands for
integrated dynamic system it's a really
light action on the steering wheel
fairly normal throttle input if I bring
it to sport mode that sharpens the
throttle input and makes the wheel a
little heavier to turn I like how the
system works and I can actually leave
this in sport all day I'd be pretty
comfortable to drive now one thing I
really like about the MDX is the super
handling all-wheel drive system this
system can put 90 percent of its torque
to the front wheels that get you your
best fuel economy just for the highway
crews or it can push 70 percent of
before to the rear wheels an actor does
a really good job of sound deadening in
the Caviar's I'm not hearing a lot of
engine noise I'm not hearing a lot of
road noise this is really a comfortable
ride and I think that's where the MDX
excels I've got the advanced package
here too and that brings with some
driver assistance systems I've got blind
spot moderating that lights up I've also
got adaptive cruise control so I can
just set my speed and the car will
automatically slow down for slower
traffic ahead it's got Lane Keeping
Assist I'll actually move the steering
wheel to keep me in the center of my
Lane pretty impressive
okay let's price out our 2016 acura mdx
base price for a front-wheel drive model
is forty three thousand seven hundred
eighty five dollars that's with
destination add two thousand dollars for
the super handling all-wheel drive
system now we have the top dog model
here with advanced package technology
package entertainment package this goes
for 58,000 even I like that this holds
seven passengers I obviously do not like
the infotainment interface here it does
check off all the boxes for driver
assistance features that's good I like
the super handling all-wheel drive
system for performance
I like the suspension for comfort
it doesn't really hit a good compromise
at both is it a luxury car performance
car not really sure
