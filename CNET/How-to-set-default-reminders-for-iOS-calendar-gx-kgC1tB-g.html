an event into our calendar assuming the
reminder was set relied on that calendar
appointment to remind us once the event
was going to occur and then only found
out later on that the reminder was never
set for that event and we ended up being
late or missing yet this is Jason
Cipriani was seen at how to and today
I'm going to show you how to set up
default reminders in your iOS calendar
what we're going to do is we're going to
go in and inner settings we're going to
select mail contacts and calendars and
then we're going to scroll down until we
find the calendar section where we'll
see default alert times go ahead and tap
on that and here we have three different
types of events that our calendar holds
for us and it will allow you to set the
default alert times for these events
your birthday calendar you can set
reminders either a week out or on the
day of at 9 a.m. and any range in there
between same thing for regular events as
well as all-day events going forward
once you set your default alert time
your calendar will automatically enter
an alert at the given time that you
select here in the options and it'll
automatically remind you for you
allowing you to have peace of mind and
not have to worry about setting that
reminder once again this is Jason
