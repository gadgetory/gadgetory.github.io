if you're missing the punishing world of
Westeros here are our picks of what to
try next game of thrones draws
inspiration from real moments in history
so why not settle in with a drama based
around actual characters and events
six-part British drama Wolf Hall
recounts the rise to power of Thomas
Cromwell in the court of Henry the
eighth another blend of history and
fantasy the screenplay for 2004 straw
was written by David Benioff the
co-creator and showrunner of Game of
Thrones this ancient epic is far from
flawless but has the swords and the
grandeur to suit anyone pining for The
Adventures of Daenerys and pals you go
to war with me brother if you like Game
of Thrones is unpredictable plots and
frequent shocking surprises you might
like the twist filled sci-fi show the
outer limits which comes in either
original 1960s or 90s reboot flavors as
an added bonus the first episode of the
reboot the sandkings is based on a short
story by george RR martin arguably the
finest creation in HBO's impressive
stable of shows Sopranos is pure
polished drama it may focus on New
Jersey mobsters rather than dragons and
White Walkers but at its core this is
still a story of warring families and
strained loyalties Game of Thrones plays
on our genre expectations by setting a
fantasy story in a world that's cruel
and bitterly down-to-earth the
unsettling and tragic Pan's Labyrinth
plays with the same ideas placing a
young girls exploration of a fantastical
realm within the brutal world of
post-civil war spain there should be
enough to tide you over for now but can
you think of any other shows that would
be perfect for a game of Thrones fan let
us know and happy viewing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
