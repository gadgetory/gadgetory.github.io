making the chips are going computers and
smartphones but chips aren't very
interesting to look at so on the actual
stand here at CS they've got loads of
really really crazy technology on show
that uses Intel tech so let's take a
look at what we've got first up here
we've got just getting set up now is a
virtual reality game I believe a
volleyball using oculus rift if I can
just talk to this guy is later hey is it
is it Bruce Bruce isn't it Bruce yes
absolutely I'm ahead of developer
relations for all space we are amazing
so what is this what's happening what's
going on so what's going on is all space
we are we're a ball about social VR
communication looking at people in VR
nodding your head shaking your head and
what we got real excited about was a
partnership here with Intel with a real
sense 3d camera you can bring your hands
into we are just holding them up there's
a camera embedded in these laptops bring
your hands right into the scene in 3d
and so everyone's like having a good
time talking to each other making
gestures peace signs waves but then they
get some crash course training for some
virtual beach volleyball that's gonna be
cool sounds good if we take a look at
the display there which I think you've
just seen that'sthat's what yeah that's
what that's what the people with wearing
oculus up that's what they're seeing
yeah so they're volley bots on this
beach scene and the person that's in the
front of the screen there actually isn't
here in Las Vegas that's our referee in
San Francisco really you're beaming in
the referee from San Francisco you don't
trust anyone here is that the problem
that's right with this is a very shady
city we need him to come in from SF I do
the referee tell them all the
instructions NVR so we'll see people
looking at their hands making fun
gestures making jokes singing songs in
there whatever he's doing to entertain
them and explain the game alright sounds
good and just finally how people have
been finding it I mean it looks a little
bit funny from the outside to play too
kind of people wearing these things that
weight in their hands around looks and
looks looks a little weird but is it fun
and they have people having a good time
oh yeah are the most common response is
awesome and now we've had a few people
almost dive out of their chairs today
you're trying to go after volleyball so
that's very cool well that sounds like a
liability nightmare I think
I think you should be careful with that
one all right thank you very much Bruce
Cheers take it easy all right now moving
along let's see what else intel has to
show so over here there's a huge queue
for this because it's something that
clearly has captured the imagination of
everyone at the booth it's a 3d scanning
thing we're going to go take a look and
see what that is exactly so what happens
here we move through the crowd
communication for them so this is a
program that Intel's put together that
scans your face so what happens is
someone kind of stands in the middle
I've just had this done and then
somebody walks around you with a tablet
and they scan you they get a 3d map of
you and then they send that in to here
so we can so what exactly is happening
here can you tell me what the process is
what's going on we are actually about to
do a demonstration using the realsense
camera technology in the tablet that we
have tablet is a prototype so we are
going to take an image of this gentleman
let me find him really quick song where
is it as you can tell there's a lot of
excitement so I got a high-tech place oh
you come here with me sir I'm gonna have
you stand right there and then I just
need three feet around him here we go
and I'm gonna have you always stare
straight and keep that beautiful smile
that you have you can do that yeah bring
it in closer to you perfect stay right
there don't move so now what I'm doing
is I'm using the realsense camera or the
laptop that's a wicked folks we got
going on while this guys getting scanned
let me ask you once that scan happens
what happens to the data what's going on
in this big orange box in well so this
is just doing a visualization of what
the 3d data looks like once once it's
printed out I can show you total
speaking to each other this is just a
geometry that that comes off of the
camera it's really nice to look at it in
3d and because we can't really 3d print
every every attendee here we thought we
would toss these in and we think lay
them pretty nice so you're making people
basically paperweights of themselves and
there's a huge queue for that 3d
everyone wants a crystal selfie of
themselves that little vein do you think
oh who cares who cares that's right
anyway it's really good fun thank you
very much thanks for talking us through
it okay next up let's go through this
tunnel here to calibrate the things are
getting even busier so bear with me
wacky okay so in this corridor we've got
what Intel cause it's real sense
technology now this is really
interesting because it's the kind of
thing that we've seen before with stuff
like Microsoft's Kinect sensor bar but
it's been taken to a ridiculous degree
here today so if you look up here
they're quite hard to see but along the
top there are all of these cameras here
you can see they've all got the Intel
logos up there and what they're all
doing they're scanning everyone here and
you get this kind of massive projection
if I if I sort of strike a pose here you
can see it's freezing me and ice there
we go look at that I could have chosen a
better pose I've just got my arm in the
air I'm not a very exciting snowman all
right so let's break that okay right
moving on
cameras are short-range 3d cameras were
being shivered with our partners and
their devices
now what I want to do is I want to talk
to a guy I've met in here his name is
cool if i remember correctly i hope it
is that's going to be an enormous folk
are if it isn't that and he's going to
tell us about how that debt sense
technology works dan my debit is here in
front of his face let's go ahead and
type all i'm really sorry to interrupt
luke from cnet here i know you're in the
middle of a demo go ahead and type in
your email from you right yes I so for
could you tell me what let everything in
this corridor what exactly is it doing
and why is it good well so right now
we're looking at intel realsense camera
and we're in the tunnel so you're
looking at the same camera that you've
been throughout the entire way but this
camera my demonstration here is clearly
showing how the the camera has the
ability you sophisticated 3d data to
really capture rod depth the great thing
about this camera is it's rendering in
real time so the user when they're in
front of the camera which is short range
you want to be anywhere from seven
inches 23 feet but it renders so it
knows the users in front only includes
the user it excludes everybody behind
him all right thank you bowl it's very
very cool i can see you got really close
detail you can even see inside people's
mouths which is a little bit weird</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
