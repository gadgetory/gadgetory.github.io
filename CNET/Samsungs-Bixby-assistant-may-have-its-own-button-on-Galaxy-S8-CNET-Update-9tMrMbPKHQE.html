something even smarter reuters reported
that Samsung is debuting its own
artificial intelligent digital assistant
in next year's galaxy s a phone and the
Wall Street Journal added another layer
to the report saying that early
prototypes of the sa phone have a button
on the side edge that's just for
launching the assistant samsung told
Reuters that outside developers will be
able to create programs to work with the
assistant you can also imagine that
Samsung would have it work with its
other home electronics maybe you'll see
this assistant inside a Samsung
television or the samsung fridge and who
wouldn't want an assistant in the
dishwasher right it also looks like
Samsung has some extra time to tinker
with the assistant on the s8 the company
usually unveils its flagship phone
during the Mobile World Congress trade
show in February but the journal reports
that executives are looking to delay the
launch maybe until April the company
could use the extra time considering it
still is looking into what caused the
note 7 phone to overheat so how good
will this be compared to other AI like
the Google assistant Microsoft's Cortana
and Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri well
oddly enough Samsung say I will be
series sibling back in October Samsung
acquired viv lapse it's an AI startup
company co-founded by the folks that
created Siri so I guess it'll be like
series half sister or brother the
assistants name will likely be called
bixby because Samsung recently filed the
trademark for the name Bixby to be a
digital assistant what kind of name is
Bixby like the actor Bill Bixby who
played dr. Banner aka The Incredible
Hulk is Samsung trying to tell us
something I guess we better not make it
Angry they may have a hot temper I'm
