schoolgirls might not be the first
people that come to mind since 2010
5,000 girls from 45 countries have tried
to change that by taking part in the
Technovation challenge through a period
of three months girls learn how to
identify a problem in the community and
then create a mobile app that solves it
but most importantly actually launch a
business or a start-up real-world
problems that team solve include
anything from helping students give
feedback on assignments to an app that
can help diagnose concussion when we
actually looked at the Apple apps on the
market we saw that they could have been
a lot more developed and made a lot
better than they were so we decided to
create own one girls taking part in the
challenge don't need to have any
previous coding experience programming
through app inventor which is what we
use to make class connect was a first
through me and I definitely learned a
lot through that while many other
programs teach girls to code

entrepreneurial skills like business

that women make up fifty-nine percent of
the total US workforce but only thirty

companies are female we did a look-back
survey and seeing where are the girls
now that went through Technovation and
almost fifty percent of the girls who
are now in college intend to major in
computer science because of techno asian
girls don't just want to have fun they
also want to help change the world in
