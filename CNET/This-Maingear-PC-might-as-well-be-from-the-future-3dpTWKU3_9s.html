gaming PC makers these days we all know
this so it's really tough to find
something truly unique
now back at CES 2018 I met with a
company called main gear and they showed
me their brand new f1 31 system which
you know if you catch it from the side
it looks like just any other ordinary PC
tower but when you turn it around okay
now if I seem a little excited it's
because inside this thing is something
I've never seen before because main gear
with the help of a company called bits
power invented it okay it's called the
apex integrated cooling system and
together with this custom-designed f1 31
chassis represents I'm not joking the
most impressive piece of PC gaming
engineering tech that I've kind of
frankly ever seen there's a lot going on
inside now the apex is a fully machined
acrylic block that was engineered
specifically to fit inside this actual
chassis the coolant flows from the
inside of the reservoir cools the CPU
then the GPU and what's called a loop
system because the liquid is constantly
traveling through this circular thing
that's why it's called a loop get up in
there nice and close and check out all
that close quarter piping I mean this
machine is using every last cubic inch
to ensure that there's barely any wasted
space inside
now look main gear sent us this machine
sparing very few expenses there's a 1080
Ti in there being water-cooled and
there's plenty of shiny chrome fittings
and acrylic tubing throughout it's
rocking 32 gigabytes of RAM and it even
has one of those brand new nvme SSD
drives as well now this is not for the
casual PC gamer at all I repeat not for
everyone but the Machine I'm holding
right here is roughly $6,000
and it goes up from there this machine
has only one graphics card but there's
actually room for two of these if you
want to do so minge also has an
automotive painter in house that used to
paint cars and now paints PC cases you
can choose whatever kind of paint you
want I chose this powder blue one
because it's really sexy now also
because of the loop system that's going
on in here with all these pipes the GPU
is modular so main gear can upgrade your
card down the road which is actually
pretty appealing because in video just
announced all those new 11 Series cards
so obviously I'm going to play a lot of
games on this thing I'm gonna see how
well it does with 4k stuff I needed to
share with you because it is a damn
engineering achievement that absolutely
has to be seen to be believed
look at this thing it's from the damn
future thanks so much for watching I
hope to see you again very soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
