it's episode 321 of the 359 podcast I'm
BVG and your host today are Alfred Inge
and Ben Fox Ruben hi yo what up episode
3 2 1 let's jam that worked out way
better than I expected at 321 oh yeah
thanks everybody for joining us yeah we
don't expect anybody on everyone's
traveling for holidays but you forget we
have fantastic international
representation and thank you to
everybody around the world watching the
350 probably should have prepared better
Alfred you're gonna lead us off so give
us a rundown yeah God there was so much
news yesterday before turn yeah
yesterday when we started this show the
net neutrality orders had actually just
come in so we weren't able to talk about
it on the show yesterday but we had a
lot of time to prepare for it we took a
look at the order and we'll be talking
about on today's show plus right around
the tail end of Tuesday uber had some
pretty big news regarding a breach from
November 2016 oh I was hoping it was
good news about Hoover for once and then
Ben has a very interesting story about
Black Friday shopping and virtual
reality so we'll be talking about all
that be sure to send your questions over
in the comments and we'll get to them in
3 minutes and 59 seconds not really
though because we never meet that mark
in the best of efforts we'll see it back
in the chat in roughly 3 minutes and 59
seconds from 3 to welcome to the 359 I'm
Alfred Inge I'm Ben Fox Ruben so net
neutrality has been an ongoing battle
for several years on Capitol Hill and it
feels like every time the proposal is
struck down it comes back even stronger
yesterday's orders by the FCC
Commissioner Ajit PI maybe the closest
we've seen net neutrality approach its
death if you're out of the loop killing
net neutrality with but it would
essentially mean the end of the open
Internet with net neutrality you can
expect to pay a flat fee for access to
everything online without it highest
peace would be able to choose what
speeds certain
sites would get you know imagine having
to pay extra if you wanted to watch us
on YouTube or a startup website never
getting any traffic because its speed is
limited pi issued his order on Tuesday
and the FCC will vote on it on December
14th there's been massive protests
online about this as there is every time
but do you think that you know this kind
of it for net neutrality yeah probably I
mean like the Republicans are running
things at the FCC right now they have
three votes versus two votes for the
Democrats and essentially under the
Trump administration there's been a big
push at deregulation so I would
absolutely expect net neutrality to die
off at least under this it was extremely
frustrating because it's almost as if
literally everybody outside of the FCC
and ISPs all are in agreement on this
that net neutrality should stay the way
that it is you know you see these
massive protests online nearly every
time the proposal is brought up the FCC
has their own like comment section that
got flooded with people just saying
don't do this this is a terrible idea
and it just seems like what was the
point of all of this if you're just
going to ignore it anyway
that's a good point but I'm personally
of two minds when it comes to net
neutrality it's obviously pretty easy to
say hey new net neutrality which also
sounds really positive is a good thing
but at the same time I think that the
ISPs do at least have some argument here
as far as saying that having too much
government regulation when it comes to
the Internet is stifles innovation
stifles investments and they they have
an argument there and to at least listen
to their side I think is reasonable yeah
well in northern other news uber
announced yesterday that it had suffered
a breach affecting 57 million accounts
in November 2016 yes this happened a
year ago and uber is only telling the
public about this now the company said
they had paid the hackers $100,000 to
delete the stolen data and said that it
had assurance that the data was
destroyed there's a lot of issues with
that rubriz based in California which
does have breach disclosure laws which
that you're supposed to inform the
public within a certain amount of time
not a year this is a company that has
kept
hidden from the public like it's great
ball program which help block police
meant to catch their drivers and their
help program which tracked lyft drivers
the company's new CEO Jericho's Raja he
said it was wrong for the company to
have kept this a secret for so long I
mean do you think this is kind of the
final nail in uber his coffin though Oh
scandal after scandal after scandal
of the old CEO this is the new CEO new
CEO gets kind of this honeymoon period
to air out the old dirty laundry and I I
think people are actually celebrating
the new guy saying way to go way to
reveal this bad practices from the old
uber you're now the happy
I know Renly new I know a lot of people
in the security community were basically
saying you know you should never pay
hackers because this happens a lot I
mean the hacker behind HBO's breaches
during the summer just got arrest not
arrested indicted yesterday and he
demands six million dollars for that and
they didn't they didn't pay him either
so Ben you also wrote a story about the
future of Black Friday shopping and
augmented reality and in virtual reality
does this mean you know am I am I
getting crushed by like a suburban mom
that like really wants that discounted
toaster in VR now yeah absolutely I
think that there's a very good
possibility that that could happen and I
certainly look forward to that future
well that's all the time that we have if
you like what you heard here check us
out on CNET I'm Alfred Inge I'm Ben Fox
Ruben thanks for listening I don't thank
them for listening but in its
patronizing what patronizing how is that
patronizing thanks everybody for
watching by the way I think I'm for
watching you thank them for watching but
not for listening yes that's super weird
cuz it's an effort to watch it alright
alright you know what that one of the
many things that we disagree on on the
show but that's fine I don't celebrate
Thanksgiving either and I hate net
neutrality so let's start off with an
easy question from the chat
first and foremost from Chuy 909 why is
it called Black Friday actually no this
one do you know this one go ahead go
ahead I think I mentioned it on a
previous podcast okay I'm gonna let you
do it so like in in the business world
in the bra wear ties so if I'm wrong
like feel free to correct me at any time
this is what I had heard so like they
they they recorded their like prophets
flight as by colors where if it's like
dipping it's red and if it's like good
it's black and the idea is that like on
this Friday where all these sales go on
and stuff it's like all their profits go
into the black and it's like it's it's
not for the year yes you're basically
right it's it's retail is a very
difficult game and it actually takes
until Black Friday very late into the
year for some retailers to actually
start seeing a profit because most
retail doesn't actually happen until
Black Friday it's like this entire
holiday window is when most people open
up their wallets and start spending yeah
crazy so what color is Cyber like for my
nail it's orange it's an orange it's you
know we're a chartreuse and I suppose
they've gone plaid yeah something yeah
expect to like just keep buying stuff or
get bothered by retailers constantly to
keep buying stuff because this is this
is when they make all their money so
they save a lot of their ad buy be fair
I am I am planning on buying like a ton
of crap yeah the next week same here and
like if you want to buy a TV now is
almost certainly the best time to do it
like starting either this week or Black
Friday or Cyber Monday when there are a
lot of very good deals for for that
neutronics I feel like we don't have
enough time to talk about your VR story
though and I feel like that's okay I
talk about it more I mean I just like
talking about e-commerce again to me the
the interesting thing about this is is
that like right now it's like not very
interactive to shop online it's not that
much fun it's just basically like a grid
of stuff with a white background and the
idea of potentially I don't know if this
is actually gonna happen but potentially
putting on a VR headset and you know
like shopping in the VR world like one
of the concepts that was mentioned by
Marc Laurie from Walmart was let's say
you're looking for a 10 you go and you
put on a VR headset you're transported
to a campground you can go inside the
tent you can walk around the 10 you can
even ask your voice assist and questions
like as if there are sales rep it's kind
of like a cool concept
we're way beyond what ecommerce is today
yeah I usually when I'm shopping online
I really just have to rely on the old
imagination yeah and that is that it's
failed me plenty of times I almost and
and you know what I think it would be
really help before like flying out sizes
of things yes I almost bought a Kinect
four set the other day where and it was
like the travel size yeah I almost
bought it and I read through the
comments like this is the pocket-sized
one don't don't write so VR is probably
gonna come the from from like talking to
a lot of folks that are in retail and
also analyst VR is expected to come
later for a lot of things they are you
should see baked into a lot of phones
much more not just for games and you
know stuff like google lens but also for
retail where potentially you'd be able
to shop like at a mini a arson or like
if you're just kind of like hanging out
in the office or whatever
all right let's divert back into our
original topic about net neutrality hot
pizza do you think the internet will
change completely and how can we all get
involved and help out because lo and
behold a lot of our listeners are not in
favor of the repeal of net neutrality
sure um look I personally don't like
some of some of the things that are
being thrown out there right now and
this is not a fashionable position to be
taking our gloom and doom scenarios that
may not show up the problem is is that a
lot of ISPs are essentially monopolies
in their specific regions where I live I
have two different options I have
Verizon FiOS which I'm a customer for
and also the cable company in that
scenario the likelihood that one of
those providers all of a sudden starts
doing an ala carte internet service
where you start having to pay more for
Amazon video or Netflix would be
significantly reduced due to competition
the problem is is that there isn't that
competitive landscape in a lot of areas
like mines and and I think that's what
people are especially worried about yeah
so this is specifically for the u.s.
there's plenty of countries out there
that don't have net neutrality and there
was a tweet in October that got viral
basically showing what it looks like in
Portugal that
doesn't have net neutrality I remember
those I'm sending it to you right now so
you can pull it up on the stream but
it's basically like it's different
package that you can buy for access to
the internet so there's a certain
internet web so it's basically like oh
if you want the entertainment package
where you you want to pay like this much
so you can get like top speeds for like
Netflix and it's almost like different
cable bundles it's basic you list there
yeah and nobody nobody in the United
States wants to see that yeah I'm just a
little hesitant or skeptical to
immediately say that this is definitely
what's gonna happen because they're
gonna strip away net neutrality it is
possible and I think I think both are
that scenario is much more likely to
happen than you know the doom and gloom
scenario that you're talking about where
everyone says the Internet it's gonna be
really slow now unless you pay like a
million dollars for these kinds of
things I don't I don't think their
purpose they're gonna be slowing down
the internet so much per se as much as
it is gonna be you're gonna have to pay
like way more if you want like only
access to like these websites because
actively yeah this is up on the screen
right now this is where'd you say from
Portugal yes yeah so if you look at it
just in passing the dollar signs don't
really add up too badly on the surfaces
but that's not to say that things will
change quickly and it's something to
just be on awareness for because this is
now the ball is completely in their core
you're not gonna have any argument and
there's no going to be no control from
the customer anymore this is completely
giving like God control to the
corporation's these ISPs and broadband
companies and yeah yeah if anything it
makes it extremely more complicated yeah
than anything else and as far as this is
if this is the scenario for which we're
gonna end up in I think we're a long way
away from something like this and I
think that if a major provider were to
some at some point start to offer
something like what's offered in
Portugal people would lose their minds I
I think that it's just not something
that Americans yeah would want to see
and I think as far as like what we can
do about this I think that's you know
the big question everyone's been been
wondering about like I said you know you
look at websites with you go on reddit
nearly every post is about net
neutrality is it their Twitter on
Twitter that has its own hashtag with
the emoticons YouTube launches campaigns
like every year or so you know basically
saying we dislike we don't agree with
this it should be stopped and it just
seems like you know unless this reaches
the ears of somebody who's like in power
it's reaching the because you but the
thing is is like the people that vote on
this are FCC commissioners who are not
publicly elected like officials mm-hmm
like we don't vote them into office so
like they're like you know there's not
that many consequences to like what they
do and what can you do at that point
yeah at mr. Ajit punch in the face was
appointed by Obama into the Commission
however it was Trump that made him the
chairman the Chairman mm-hmm and boy
this guy he's gonna have a rough life
going forward well I it's it's he has a
different philosophy for how the
Internet should be yes regularly
especially interested yeah I wonder why
I mean maybe it's because he used to be
Verizon's top lawyer okay Tom wheeler
who was the previous chairman was also
like came from that world as well and
he's the one that actually helped push
forward net neutrality so I wouldn't I
wouldn't immediately like you're right
there's no mutual exclusivity however
there is a question of character and the
interpretation of the values that you
bring with you and this is sheer
exploitation in my personal very
personal non-si net affiliated
perspective
I hate as you tell us how you really
feel just did and I think okay and going
back to like what what should people do
I mean anybody that you know lives in
the States can and should get involved
in the democratic process
people have been vocalizing this not
just on reddit but through you know the
FCC channels and yeah they don't have
any comments anytime there are public
comment sections you know whether you
agree with net neutrality or not like
that's just I'm not here espousing like
if you're if you're throwing that
neutrality go there and you know argue
that point like people that actually
think that this is too much regulation
should also have
their voices heard that's what the
public comments are for you know and
yeah and on that note in the notes of
today's show when it goes up on demand
we'll put the link in the description so
that you can go to the FCC page file in
your your your opinion your points will
include all the right information I
forget which order it is the numerical e
but we'll put it all in in the
description so you can get involved in
voice have your voice heard yeah instead
of just ours yeah absolutely do we have
other comments about neutrality yeah so
let's kind of sure that's what all the
comments yeah this is gonna be a huge
effect on literally everybody stellar
tech what exactly would be the benefits
of letting go of net neutrality do we
see any benefits
well the main argument that a G PI has
been making is basically look how
innovative like we were before all these
regulations and you know basically these
regulations are stopping innovation on
the internet I don't know what any of
these animations that he's talking about
yet has he cited any specific on cept
about innovation but also investment you
know one thing that Maggie Reardon who's
a reporter that's been covering net
neutrality for years mentioned in her
story from yesterday she said that a lot
of ISPs and internet providers are now
more reluctant to go into rural areas
out of concern that their enormous
investment to go to those harder to get
to areas they're essentially going to
spend millions or billions of dollars
and then their pipes are going to be
treated as if they're a utility yeah
that is a disincentive for them to go
and it really vibes me up at night when
I'm thinking you know those poor billion
dollar companies man it's just I really
would like I told them you know look
that's how markets are structured you
know like that's the they're not they're
not charities this isn't the government
providing this stuff if the government
wants to build pipes going to rural
areas that's a different situation
sometimes I just saying you know how
come the government's not looking out
for these billionaires out there I gotta
make more money it's it's come on they
all they want to do is be richer than
rich okay i I think also yeah it's so
that's that is a
benefit of this actually you uh ISPs
make even more money so I think that's a
pretty nice benefit if you're a
billionaire
oh man that must be great all right
moving on
Pele which companies are supporting this
net neutrality repeal and which aren't a
lot of times to me I I don't know any
companies out of publicly like spoken
out other than like Verizon I would say
saying you know this is probably a good
idea no no Verizon AT&amp;amp;T III I think a
lot of the major but I'm providing most
of the the Silicon Valley like Giants
have spoken out against this Google has
been like very vehemently like against
repealing net neutrality read it
Twitter's like publicly made statements
against this I don't think I've heard
anything from Apple on this yeah Apple
isn't really internet service yeah
Facebook's also spoken out against I
would probably imagine that like Netflix
too but like I never get like super
against it right and and the reason it's
important to mention that Google and
Netflix are very much opposed to this as
I'm I'd imagine Amazon would be is
because they probably know that this is
going to cost them more money to there's
obviously a huge concern that this could
cost customers more money but word you
know kind of piling on the ISPs here and
saying they're just gonna make more
money the thing is is that when Netflix
goes and starts providing 4k video but
doesn't have to pay anything extra to
start sending those through the pipes
then that's a concern for the ISPs and
you're basically asking the ISPs to
shoulder that burden completely through
net neutrality again I'm just trying to
provide both sides of this and Netflix
is obviously making more money in the
current regime than they would without
net neutrality yeah but I'd like to keep
my stuff cheap so ok put it on the ISPs
they're billion dollar company sure but
like so is Netflix in Google yeah I mean
like this is this is a battle between
multiple billion-dollar multinational
companies and like it sucks that
consumers could potentially end up
getting stuck in the middle of this yeah
and like in some ways it reminds and
then it was blackouts that used to
happen on
you know with cable channels and then
the other concern is basically you know
with if a you know and that neutrality
is repealed imagine there's a company
that wants to be like the net Netflix
the next Netflix re and they they want
to stream like 4k video and they can do
it much cheaper and all this stuff but
you know they don't have the funds to
pay for like their stuff to get through
at the soil that it deserves to be
I think that's easily one of the
strongest arguments yeah preserving that
neutrality if I can let my inner
conspiracy theorist now I think this is
all about the restriction of information
and the general trying to dumb down
society I mean like that's interesting
however the major internet providers
like the major Internet companies like
Google and Netflix are fighting actually
they maintain there was a point no no I
get that
I get that but the entire effort not the
entire effort because mostly it's
probably fueled by money but a large
portion of the effort behind any kind of
corralling to the access to information
is to try to dumb down your audience
well there was actually a point brought
up that I had been seeing uh flowing
around Twitter yesterday basically
saying if this repeal goes through that
it would actually stifle like fake news
spread just because you know these are
these are the same startup like websites
that we're talking about startups where
you know that's like you know like this
guy that like only makes fake news to
make like a quick buck and then it's
basically well it's not worth every I'm
gonna have to pay extra for it to like
get like the bandwidth that it deserves
there's an interesting notice I mean
look at that I got you to actually say
something
that was not you at all I did I got into
your brain all right let's fly through a
couple more questions real quick because
we're getting almost out of time here
Frank Paul Masson Oh even without net
neutrality would package pricing setups
even really work especially in the
wireless space when there's so much
competition wouldn't people just switch
providers I've I saw that packaging like
argument I'm like that's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard because they're
basically taking it the inspiration from
it from like TV like what cable
companies do right words right that's
worked out so well for that I only want
to watch sports or I only want to watch
the news that coming that's not like the
internet dudes like nobody
nobody's like oh yeah I only go online
for email like that's not hard tech news
that's like absurd like nobody does that
it's so it's so dumb it's the problem
with that argument I would say is that
too many Internet service providers are
monopolies in their region it's like
there aren't the competitive pressures
that would normally exist like if I
opened like a buffet and I'm like ok do
you want like the vegetable deal do you
want like or just right it's dessert do
you later yeah that makes no sense for
the internet it works I guess in
Portugal I haven't been to Portugal I
don't think I don't think people like
that I don't know if they're doing we
should fly to Portugal and interview
people there and find out that might not
be a parable the internet terrible road
trip next time around you're seen it
definitely from a Pusa car and
reinforced by Pele how will this affect
users outside the US and specifically
Pele wants to know how it's going to
impact in Europe that's a good question
I don't know do you know I think it
would affect you know if the website
that you're going it is based in the US
which last time I checked a hell of a
lot of them are including cnet.com the
probably one of the better tech news
websites out there I like it it's fair
but anyway but the point is that like if
the website that you're trying to access
is based in the u.s. even though you're
not like affected by net neutrality and
where you know where you are if it's
based on the US and that website doesn't
want to pay more to like increase the
bandwidth on something like that you
like it might be a raw deal for you sure
I I think another point to add to that
is that the United States because of its
stature in the world is an influential
regulator and so if the u.s. decides to
take a specific regulatory regime
it could have influence beyond its
borders as well and that's how you know
again hypothetically that could end up
influencing Europe or other regulators
out there oh what an ugly time we're in
here let's switch gears real crappy
Thanksgiving yes before we call it a day
and talk about hacking
quick Matthieu dieter the - in the chat
is etch is there a point to hacking
people's information anymore it seems
like all of our informations already out
there it's a great point
I would say so because most of the times
when these hacks happen like these
massive breaches at least the people
that are stealing the information
primarily aren't the ones that are using
them most of the times they get sold
online and you're right that you know a
lot of it is like already out there but
I think the the premise is like you can
always sell it as new information
because people when they're buying these
like you know millions of Records and
patches they're not looking to see like
oh these are these have already yeah
let's take that I don't want to buy that
one like you buy it in bulk and then you
basically use that there's several
programs out there it's like when you
bought pokemon cards and you got like 14
Ratatat yeah yeah so basically like
there's there's like programs that you
can use that basically it's it's called
credential stuffing where you you take
like all these records and you stuff
them into like every website imagine one
and eventually you get one in return and
the thing about these like ubers
preaching in particular is that even
though there were no passwords or
anything like involved in it so from
what I understand it was the name email
and your phone number which through some
legwork can actually end up getting you
like a lot of information on somebody
including their password like all you
really need to do a password reset on
Facebook is like an email address and a
phone number and if you have I think
it's a lot of things going and going
back to what - mentioned - is that it's
it's I think it's so easy to get
desensitized to all of these hacks
especially this year there have been so
many of them and Alfred I'm sure you
would agree that like it's important to
stay some level of vigilant and not walk
around with your social security number
on your t-shirt or do is probably
already out there that's not like a
really millennial thing to do and
protest we've seen how that can go
horribly horribly wrong for the LifeLock
guys so somebody did try that as an
idiot it really didn't work all right
I wish we could keep talking about this
all day because this is an utterly fast
and it's not terrifying topic but we are
out of time we will be talking about
this in detail for weeks and weeks and
months to come undoubtedly as long as
the internet still there we'll see what
the next coconut brings we're gonna try
to get Maggie in the office she comes to
visit pretty regularly and she knows way
more about net neutrality than I would
say most people in the United States and
we would love to get her in front of you
guys and ask whatever questions you want
about net neutrality
yeah please we should definitely have
her in for an extended period of time
just griller yeah she's you know she
knows this stuff in and out she's been
writing about it for years so definitely
check out her story from yesterday
because it'll probably answer some of
your questions about what the impacts
are as always it'll be in the
description of the show until they shut
us off behind the paywall that's gonna
be it for us for the week because we are
gonna be on Thanksgiving holiday until
Monday and just as an FYI warning to
everybody Monday will be a later show
due to some other scheduling conflicts
and I do want to leave us on a bit of a
good news note today since it's been
