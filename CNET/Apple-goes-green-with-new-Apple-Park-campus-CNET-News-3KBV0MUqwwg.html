our new home
we'll start movin in Apple Park later
this year but of course such a large
move it's really more of a process and
the first big step is the opening today
of the Steve Jobs Steve Jobs theater
it's the most state-of-the-art
purpose-built theater ever built for
events just like this one
Apple Park has been built to reflect
apples values for both technology and
the environment it connects to connects
extraordinarily advanced buildings with
a rolling Park land to form an open and
inspiring environment for our teams to
create and collaborate the park itself
was converted from a sea of asphalt into
a hundred and seventy-five acre green
space with over nine thousand trees
it's powered by a hundred percent
renewable energy thank you
and in fact we have one of the world's
largest on-site solar installations
right here we've got a great visitor
center which will be open later this
year where we will welcome everyone and
inside the visitor center you'll find an
incredible augmented reality experience
where you can learn more about Apple
Park its design and its innovations
you'll also find a fantastic new Apple
Retail Store as you know Apple Retail
has always been about more than selling
it's about learning inspiring and
connecting with people now our stores
are also the best place to go discover
explore and experience our new products</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
