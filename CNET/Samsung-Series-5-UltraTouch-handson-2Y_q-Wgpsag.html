look at the samsung series 5 now we've
looked at series five laptops before I'm
sure we're gonna look at them again that
this 13-inch model however is a little
bit different and that it is the first
one we're seeing with Windows 8 and a
touchscreen on it which means that
Samsung has taken its existing series
fine line which has been perfectly nice
and updating it so it goes toe-to-toe
with pretty much every other current
laptop out there the nice thing about
this particular system is it sits right
in the middle of kind of the price band
we've seen a lot of 13-inch Windows 8
laptop Center $1,300 it's even $1,600
very nice machines we've seen a bunch of
Windows 8 laptops that are under $600
and for the money that you spend they're
actually pretty good although a little
bit more plasticky not quite as high-end
the series 5 here even though samsung
has higher-end line like the series 7
and the series 9 this one is still made
almost entirely of metal feels very
solid nice brushed metal sort of accents
on the back of the lid on the keyboard
tray here you definitely would not be
embarrassed to pull this out at a coffee
shop even though it's Samsung's mid
price line this particular configuration
has got a Core i5 processor it's got a
standard 500 gig hard drive with a
little SSD cache on it and it's 850
which is a pretty reasonable price
especially when you consider the design
and the construction the workmanship is
definitely a little bit above average
from what you normally get for that
price there are a couple of things that
make this feel like a little bit more of
a budget product number one is the
screen resolution is only 1366 by 768
that still works for a 13-inch laptop
any bigger and it sort of starts to look
a little bit dated and you've also got
the touchpad with the separate left and
right mouse buttons in most moderate or
more high end laptops they're all moving
towards that single pad click pan design
where the buttons are sort of integrated
right into it other than that however
you pretty much get all the bells and
whistles that you'd expect from a
current Windows 8 laptop including the
the 10 input touchscreen for 850 bucks
you're probably not going to find
something that's quite as solid quite as
roadworthy as this I'm Dan Ackerman
and that is the samsung series 5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
