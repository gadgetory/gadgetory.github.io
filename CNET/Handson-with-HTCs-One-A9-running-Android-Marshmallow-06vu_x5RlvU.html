manufacturer to announce a phone running
Google's latest Android marshmallow
operating system and here it is it's
called the HTC One m9 now it's part of
the wand family but it sits a little bit
below the existing one m9 phone as part
of the one family it has a full metal
design and it's a design that is
unquestionably quite reminiscent of the
iPhone 6 particularly when you look at
things like the raised camera bezel and
the inclusion of a physical home button
on the front however it is a very nice
design and it feels very comfortable to
hold now that home button doubles up as
a fingerprint sensor as well which
allows you to unlock the phone very
quickly about having Steichen pins with
Android marshmallow onboard you'll find
features like Android pay although only
in the US for now not in the UK as well
as Android doze now what those does is
help regulate battery life in standby
mode hopefully giving you generally
better battery life throughout the day
HTC has put its scent software over the
top so it looks pretty much the same as
the m9 we've already seen you'll find
things like customers or themes and of
course the blinkfeed news and social
media aggregator on the back you'll find
a 13 megapixel camera which has features
like roar shooting as well as actually
being able to process those RAW images
in the phone itself on the front is the
same four ultrapixel camera that we saw
on the m9 and I can say from personal
experience can help you take some very
embarrassing selfies there's no official
price tag for this phone yet although
HTC has said but it should cost a little
less than HTC One m9 due to go on sale
though globally from the beginning of
November I'm Andrew Coyle for CNET and
this is the HTC One a9</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
