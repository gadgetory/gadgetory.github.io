Megan Willerton for CNET here with the
review of the Hamilton Beach smoothie
smart blender this $40.00 blender is
cute and it's on the smaller side so it
won't take up a lot of space on your
counter I really like the presets that
it has it has a smoothie button and ice
and pulse button and it's really really
easy to read and use one thing I really
like about this little blender is that
the pitcher is made of glass that way it
feels really sturdy and the other ones
even the four or five hundred dollar
ones are made out of plastic overall it
did really well in the performance tests
especially for the more simple things we
tested it did really well blending the
smoothies and the other soft foods we
tested but it had a little trouble with
the harder items like the nut butter it
did a really great job making almond
flour in fact better than many of the
more expensive models but it didn't make
it all the way to almond butter but for
forty dollars it really excels at the
basics it makes a great smoothie and you
really can't go wrong it's really great
for small jobs but if you want to make
more complex foods or blend something
like peanut butter you might want to get
the Breville hemisphere control blender
or the ninja Ultima blender both of
those are two hundred dollars so you
really need to be committed to that
almond butter but this is a great great
product for forty dollars the bottom
line is that it's cheap its durable and
it's easy to use when you're blending
those basic foods thanks for watching
