launched by BMW it looks much like a
mini it has all the hallmarks mini wings
front and back Cooper stamped on its bum
an interior design of using only a
compass and a cheeky chappie look it's
clearly related to the car that was
launched at the turn of the century
which was also clearly related to the
car that got written motoring way back
when but because it's not exactly like
the car it's again is created all those
years ago
lots of people hate it it's too big they
say German they moan it's not as good as
the original they shout it's just not a
proper mini they bluster and they're all
right in their own little way but
they're also utterly utterly wrong allow
me to explain why take this the all-new
2 litre turbocharged a Mini Cooper S it
has a hundred and eighty nine brake
horsepower 206 pounds foot more on
overboost will hit 62 miles an hour from
rest in 6.7 seconds and will manage 146
miles an hour as well as that you can
guess up to forty 9.6 miles to the
gallon out of it the fact that it's new
four-cylinder engine gives it a greater
breadth of ability better mpg and a
smooth that drives great I mean the
drive is really really good fun if I'm
honest I've spent most of this morning
hammering this thing round the mountain
it handles really really nice there are
no mini nights to bang on about go-kart
handling and that's you know not true
because this isn't a go-kart but it is
very much a sort of point and square
bang it into a corner turning off you go
kind of cut it feels great and this
engine is so happy to rev really really
high and with the turbo there's bags of
talk available the gearbox is a
particular highlight the shift is a
little bit light for my liking but it
has a party piece
it'll rev much for you which is a great
thing so when you change down the gear
the engine will pop up to where it needs
to be so you get a smoother change and
it's brilliant for two reasons one you
will look like a hero to all your mates
as you're going along break down up
the engine goes and they think wow he's
a really good driver really good at heel
and toe and two you won't destroy your
clutch that's a good thing that's very
clever on minis part not only do you
look brilliant you don't break your car
inside it's a properly luxurious hatch
there's every mod con available stuffed
in here now there con Bluetooth dab
everything really
you can even speck a touchpad so you can
write postcodes directly into them now
that's something you only really expect
to find on bigger more BMW ish stuff
there is one question that had popped
into my mind was driving this though the
Fiesta ST is the king of the hot hatch
aristocracy at the moment everybody
loves it myself included is this new
Mini Cooper S better than the Fiesta ST
though not quite if I'm honest the
Fiesta ST it's a little bit sharper just
feels a little bit better set up to be a
proper hooliganism machine but the Mini
has something that the Fiesta doesn't
this has got character by the pocket
mode it's a happy smiley little thing in
the way it looks and the way it drives
the way it feels the Fiesta is a very
serious car this it's it's bit less a
fare but come on let's go and have fun
like a happy yappy little puppy or a
toddler that really wants you to play
with it's Lego where's the Fiesta
brilliant car though it is just lacks
that little bit of character so well
yeah it's better dynamically I'd say I
prefer this one because I think it'd
make me smile more
and if all the power and speed of the
Cooper S doesn't appeal then how about
the Cooper D yeah it may not be as quick
as the S but what it lacks in pace it
gains in economy if you drive like a
saint you can manage 80 point 7 miles to
the gallon it's still no slouch mind
it'll hit 62 in 9.2 seconds which if
memory serves is about the same amount
of time the first new MINI Cooper
managed detail
the Cooper day is gonna be the big
seller because not only do you get
classic mini driving dynamics you also
get awesome efficiency and you don't
lose out in performance this is really a
no compromise hatchback you can't
honestly lose with it only personally I
prefer the speed the noise and the drama
of the Cooper S but this thing's great
it's got a brand spanking new 3-cylinder
diesel engine that it's really smooth
quite refined and not too noisy as well
so the cars drive well they're fast and
efficient so what is it about these new
minis that people don't like well it
could be the look in pictures this
meanly does look a little long in the
nose a little bit snotty but in the
metal it's a good-looking well
proportioned car and you've got to
remember that yeah the mini is big on
the outside but underneath its skin
there's loads of safety tech and
legislation dictates how high certain
things have to be in and all that so
that in the hands of a true idiot in the
worst case they don't end up as a puddle
in the footwell
so the people that dislike the new mini
because it's too big not British enough
or not in line with the original mini
ethos are really gonna hate this thing
and they're gonna hate it even more when
they discover that unlike the original
mini you can't buy one with the chains
you find down the back of the sofa no
you've got to drop nearly 14,000 pounds
to get the keys to one of these
they're right this is nothing like the
minis they know and love frankly I'm
glad of that they were great then get me
wrong but they were small inefficient
and were designed in the 50s so I'm not
too sure how I'd fare in a crash I
wonder what the reaction would be if it
was launched today and has anybody
actually considered that for some people
this will be the only mini they know
someone will in the late 80s or early
90s would have been growing up when the
original mini was slowly dying they will
have seen the new car become the card
the jaw and keep an interpretation of
that iconic shape rolling down the road
for them a mini isn't a car you can
cheaply buy and easily fix on you drive
right now
for them it's a small good-looking car
to aspire to the mini is evolving and
that's a good thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
