Google ishes for everything google you
can think of samsung's galaxy SI and
announcement is just a couple weeks away
but my favorite phone from 2016 had to
be the google pixel but a report from
droid life claims google may have a
third larger phone in the works beyond
just the pixel and pixel XL now android
police reported the two code names for
the next gen pixels will again be named
after sea creatures this time is muskie
a freshwater fish native to north
america and member of the pike family
and walleye a freshwater perciformes to
most of Canada and the northern us it's
also commonly known as the pike perch
and see that's your fresh water fish
lesson of the day thanks google now
reports claim that musky will be the 5.5
inch pixel and walleye will be the 5
inch device droid-life reports the third
larger phone is codenamed time in which
is a eurasian giant trout and the
world's largest freshwater fish now this
phone will have a larger screen than
both muskie and walleye taemin is
believed to be a separate project from
the other two and could also be a whole
new product it's still unclear if this
will be a pixel XXL or a nexus product
or something entirely different but
that's what we know right now and I also
know a whole lot more about freshwater
fish now in some samsung galaxy s 8 news
if you want to see what the home screen
on the new icons of the s8 will look
like here you go it's not the highest
res of images but ass and mobile reader
pulled them from samsung's Smart Switch
app and confirms that Samsung will no
doubt be using their own skin on top of
Android which you know we have always
expected we've also seen leaked images
in how Samsung's fingerprint sensor has
been moved to the back of the phone
after multiple reports said that it
would be embedded into the screen
sammobile reports that samsung and the
fingerprint sensor supplier synaptics
we're running out of time even after
Samsung poured resources into the tech
last year but they say the results were
frustrating the report also says the
company had to make a decision as it had
to start mass production of the essay
which resulted in moving it to the back
Samsung's official galaxy s 8
announcement with all the real details
takes place on March 29
US carriers are also starting to reveal
the pricing and availability for the
upcoming LG g 6 the phone will be
available on April the 7th t-mobile will
sell it for 650 dollars verizon will be
slightly higher at 672 over 24 months
for twenty eight dollars per month while
AT&amp;amp;T will reportedly sell it for twenty
four dollars per month for 30 months
which would add up to a price of 720
dollars which is the highest we've heard
up to this point the other big bonus for
consumers all three carriers will be
offering a free google home for anyone
who purchases it between its launch date
and April the 30th you know not too
shabby if that's a combo of gadgets
you're looking for ok we've talked about
YouTube's live streaming feature which
was previously limited to channels with
10,000 subscribers or more but several
users online even those with just two
thousand and seven hundred subscribers
are reporting that the feature is
available to go live on mobile so keep a
lookout you could be getting it pretty
soon and both Android and iOS youtubers
are seeing this but there's been no
official word about a change by YouTube
themselves and then some cool news
coming out of South by Southwest we
finally got to see Google's partnership
with Levi's called project jacquard in
action the idea is to give textiles
touchscreens functionality 925 Google
got to demo it and the video shows how
you can map three gestures on your phone
that can be performed on the cuff of the
jacket to either skip music tracks pause
or play music even take a call it's
limited to taps and swipes right now but
they expect to add more gestures in the
future now it will be priced at three
hundred and fifty dollars and is
expected released later this year but
this is one wearable that I have to get
on board with all right that's going to
do it for this week you can email me at
Google licious at cnet com or tweet me
at Brian tongue thanks so much for
watching we'll catch you all next time
