probably associate with a car that your
grandmother drive they make old people
cars but recently they've been making
strides with vehicles like the Regal to
be more youthful this 2014 Buick Enclave
on the other hand isn't one of those
it's still kind of a grainy wagon let's
take a look at it and check the tech now
it's gonna separate this Buick from
something that's wearing say a Chevrolet
or GMC badge it's gonna be chrome lots
and lots of chrome we've got this big ol
grill up here we've got optional 19 inch
chrome wheels and like every other Buick
model in the lineup we've got this sort
of chrome porthole thing happening on
the hood sort of indicating power but I
mean this isn't a particularly powerful
vehicle it's a big doughy 7 passenger
SUV but if you want to fit people in
there with plenty of space this is kind
of the body style that you're stuck with
now one of the nicer features of this
top-tier premium model are gonna be
these HID headlamps now they're gonna be
underneath an LED strip that's gonna be
your daytime running lamps but when you
turn the steering wheel you'll see that
the projectors do steer a little bit
with the front wheels to help you see
around corners better now the Buicks
cabin has a lot of neat technology but I
can't shake the feeling that it feels
kind of like a 5 or 7 year old car
that's got new tech tacked on to it
first of all you look at the dashboard
particularly at night you've still got
that sort of sickly green glow to the
instrument cluster in all the dashboard
illumination you've also got a couple of
interesting things happening here for
example you've got a small LCD in the
instrument cluster where you'll control
a couple of vehicle settings you'll also
see your trip computer information but
rather than putting the controls for
interacting with that up here on the
steering wheel they're actually down
here at the bottom of the dashboard a
couple of buttons here which means that
if you want to switch from your current
fuel economy to your range to empty
you've got to look down at the dashboard
and then back up and down the dashboard
and back up it's terribly distracting
that's a six point five inch color touch
screen which is decent size but we're
living in the time we're seeing eight
inch or larger screen than the dashboard
and what that means is with this smaller
screen you get tinier buttons the text
is a little bit more difficult to read
and that means that you spend more time
looking at the screen and hunting for
your touch points than you would with a
bigger
screen where you can kind of more
casually point and shoot the interesting
thing about this touchscreen also is
this not as responsive as I'd like it to
be if you're used to using a touchscreen
tablet or a smartphone where you just
kind of casually touch your buttons
you're gonna be disappointed to find
that you're gonna have to really get
into it with this thing in order to get
it to respond to your touches now what
you're gonna get for your trouble with
the IntelliLink system is hard drive
based navigation system that's pretty
good
it's got traffic that comes down from
Sirius XM divided our nav traffic system
and hurlimann give you updates on
upcoming traffic jams as you drive down
the highway the problem with that is
that it pops up every five minutes even
once you've confirmed that you know the
traffic is there and this is the route
that you want to go down so if you get
tired of a thing traffic in 30 miles
traffic in 25 miles you're just gonna
end up turning the system off and then
you don't get any benefit at all you've
also got a pretty decent suite of audio
option that's gonna include a DVD player
in the dashboard for this that also
accepts CDs you've got mp3 playback via
an iPod or a USB storage device from a
USB port which is weirdly located up
here at the top of the dashboard in a
cubby hole instead of down here or in
the center console where you can reach
it easily
you've also got bluetooth for hands-free
calling and audio streaming and if
you've got a compatible Bluetooth phone
sync to it when you get a text message
it will pop up on the screen and give
you the option to tap one button and
have that message read aloud to you and
then you can fire back a canned response
and if you've got a compatible
smartphone paired with a Pandora app on
you've also got Pandora control over the
dashboard so you can access those custom
stations with thumbs-up and thumbs-down
controls now at our premium trim level a
lot if not all of the safety checks is
just gonna be rolled in so we're gonna
have a Ford collision warning which is
going to let you know if you're
approaching a vehicle ahead too quickly
and a collision imminent it will flash
the little red light on the dashboard at
you and let you know to get on those
brakes before you run into somebody
you've also got blind spot monitoring
with rear cross traffic alert so if
there's a car and your blind spot at
highway speeds you get a little red
light and if you put your turn signal on
and will beep to let you know someone's
there and if you're backing out of a
parking spot and the cars coming across
traffic it'll sound a little alert to
let you know to keep your eyes up and
watch for those vehicles coming it also
got a standard rear view camera at this
trim level that does have the trajectory
lines that move with the steering wheel
when you're reversing and there's a rear
proximity sensor to let you know as
you're approaching a vehicle or a person
or pet with an audible alert now
underneath the enclaves a really short
hood there's not a lot to see because
there's a lot of plastic cladding here
and that's gonna be part of this
automaker sound deadening technology
which we're going to talk about in a
little bit but if you just pick that off
you'll find somewhere underneath all of
this hosing and tubing there 3.6 liter
v6 engine now this direct-injected
engine is gonna get you 200 new t8
horsepower and 270 pound feet of torque
it's also the only engine option
available for this vehicle now 288
horsepower sounds like a lot but not for
a vehicle of this size a big seven
passenger vehicle this is gonna give you
decent acceleration and pretty good fuel
economy that power is gonna exit the
engine via a single option automatic
transmission with seven speeds but you
do get a choice between drivetrains
you can either get the enclave of a
front-wheel drive vehicle or for 2,000
extra bucks you can get it at an
all-wheel drive like this example with
their Stabilitrak technology fuel
economy is gonna be decent at about 16
miles per gallon city 22 highway I'm
averaging about 20 but I'm doing a lot
of highway driving during my testing now
when you settle in behind the wheel of
the Buick Enclave
and take it for a spin you immediately
realize that maybe technology and gee
whiz gadget Reed isn't exactly the
object of the game here what Buick is
trying to do is give you a car that it's
very comfortable
that'll get people where they're going
with minimum fuss and this car does a
pretty good job of that they put a lot
of technology into the suspension tuned
into the wheel and tire package into the
deadening in the body of the vehicle and
the engine bay they've even like trip
eliminated the
windscreen and glass all these things
kind of come together to give you a very
quiet ride but then it doesn't really
feel inspiring the 7-speed automatic
transmission doesn't really want to give
you access to all the power that it has
and even if it did I'm not really sure
that it would really make this vehicle
feel sprightly but the engine is really
smooth and the transmission is also
smooth you can barely tell that the
shifts are happening there is a little
bit of oddness to do with the 7-speed
automatic transmission and that is that
it has a sort of secret kind of hidden
manual shift mode in order to get into
it you'll pull your shifter down into
the L selection and that's normally on
most cars where you'll find your low
gear ratio but in this case it's your
manual mode once you're there you'll use
this little rocker switch a little bit
you'll activate with your thumb that's
on the side of the shifter to shift up
and the shift down it's not really the
most efficient way to do it but if you
ever find yourself a net maybe once in a
lifetime situation where you need to
manually shift this vehicle that's where
you'll find it now comes the time we
figure out how much is this gonna cost
you the 2014 Buick Enclave is gonna
start at thirty nine thousand six
hundred sixty-five dollars but that's
the entry point if you want the safety
check that we've talked about you're
gonna want to go at the premium group
with all-wheel drive and that's going to
bring you to a starting point of fifty
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
five dollars plus about nine hundred
twenty five bucks to get it to the
dealership now our model has three
thousand six hundred and forty bucks and
text that's gonna include the
IntelliLink dashboard check the rear
seat entertainment sunroof and that's
gonna bring us to our as tested price of
fifty two thousand eight hundred eighty
bucks but if you want to do it seen that
style skip that rear seat entertainment
that's gonna bring you down to about
fifty grand even fully loaded up like
this the 2014 Buick Enclave isn't a tech
powerhouse but it's got pretty good
safety tech and a decent amount of
dashboard technology it's kind of a
vehicle for people who want to get from
point A to point B but aren't
necessarily in a rush to get there they
want to get there five to seven
passengers there's comfortably and
quietly as possible
