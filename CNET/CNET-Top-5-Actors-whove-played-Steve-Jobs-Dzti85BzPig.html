kinds of things i'm your host is apt are
unless you've been living under a rock
you've probably heard of Steve Jobs who
my kid even if you do live under a rock
you probably have heard of him anyway
there's a new movie about the founder of
apple penned by Aaron Sorkin and
starring Michael Fassbender how many
people have played jobs check out this
IMDB page today we're counting down the
top five for trails of steve jobs you
might be wondering what criteria are you
using the judge how jobs like an actor
was he's got to be intense passionate
and kind of a jerk I'm basing this on
what I've read and seemed so let's get
to it at number five Justin Long and I
Steve you know Justin long right he was
the guy who was the mac in the i'm a mac
and i'm a pc series of ads he also
starred in I Steve how was he well
less-than-subtle since this was a movie
made by Funny or Die it goes for laughs
case in point in the scene where jobs is
ousted from Apple he attempts to
convince people to come with him instead
of using his personality and passion
this Steve Jobs attempt to pick a person
up physically to take with him as the
movie progresses he does start
exhibiting Steve Jobs salesmanship at
number four Fred Armisen in various SNL
sketches yep i'm putting fred armisen on
this list at a time when apple products
were exploding into the public
consciousness you could tell Armisen
watched lots of keynotes led by Steve
Jobs there's a bit of that Steve Jobs
intensity but mostly it's an impression
of the reality distortion field that
gets him on this list everything armagh
sins jobs presents his revolutionary and
game-changing even if it's not at number
three Ashton Kutcher in jobs he bears
quite the resemblance to the man himself
Kutcher did a great job capturing Steve
Jobs kate's he's also got a ton of
intensity so many scenes have coaches
staring down others and boy did he pull
off the I'm holding all the cards face
he shows very little softness but he
does show an affinity for Steve Wozniak
played by Josh GAD Kutcher also shows a
look of betrayal over jobs removal from
Apple that it creates such sympathy for
a character who's pretty much
jurkat time at number two Michael
Fassbender and Steve Jobs all right at
first glance he looks nothing like Steve
Jobs the Fassbender was excellent in a
few flashback scenes Fassbender
disappears he shows a lot of range of
Steve Jobs when it came to wooing John
Sculley away from pepsi become the CEO
of Apple Fassbender completely sells the
concept of running at the theater
company and the rest of the movie he's a
quick talking intense and mercurial
character right before a product launch
Fassbender effortlessly says horrible
things and beings then switches to being
funny without it seeming unnatural at
all he was awesome but narrowly defeated
by one man at number one noah wily in
pirates of Silicon Valley I rewatched
pirates of Silicon Valley to make sure I
wasn't just remembering the movie
through a biased belton i'm pretty sure
while it is the best steve jobs on this
list he's smug and passionate while
having an air of ease around him
throughout the movie while he has the
look in his eyes that he knows more than
everyone else in the room the
performance caught a lot of attention
while he even appeared at mccool's 1999
as steve jobs before the real steve jobs
interrupted him to tell him he's being
steve jobs all wrong there you have it
that's top five actors who played Steve
Jobs if you think Trey Parker of south
park should have been on this list let
me know on Twitter i'm at is for more
top five like this and some that aren't
like this check out top 5 cnet com
thanks for watching and we'll see you
next time
