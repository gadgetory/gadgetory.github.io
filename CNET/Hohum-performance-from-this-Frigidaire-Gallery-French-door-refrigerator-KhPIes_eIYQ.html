here with the Frigidaire Gallery French
door refrigerator model FG HB 2 8 6 6 PS
this is a 27 point 2 cubic foot capacity
model with this nice smudge proof
stainless steel exterior now that
doesn't mean you can't leave
fingerprints on if you try hard you
definitely can just like that but it
does mean that it's pretty easy to clean
just a quick wipe with a paper towel and
it's back to looking like it's fresh
from the factory floor now turning
inside the fridge you see plenty of
options for customizing your shelving as
well you can take this top shelf and
tuck it under for large items you can do
a sort of similar thing with this shelf
and fold it up against the icemaker
the icemaker is located inside the
fridge and not in the door that's sort
of bucking a recent trend of indoor ice
makers and you lose some space because
of that so overall a fairly spacious
interior we're able to squeeze in our
entire load of test groceries inside of
it
along with a couple of large items that
we test fit to sort of stress it out a
big cake tray a casserole dish extra
large pizza box with a little bit of
reorganization and sort of moving things
around strategically we could get almost
all that inside of the fridge that said
the refrigeration performance was not as
good as we hoped here we test for
72-hour stretches at various temperature
settings so at 37 degrees
we got readings that we didn't like
especially here on the top shelf for the
hot air can sort of rise a little bit
don't want that from the interior of
your fridge maybe the doors might get a
little warmer but the actual body of the
fridge should stay nice and cool
definitely below 40 testing again at 33
degrees everything stayed well below 40
degrees definitely food safe definitely
good to use if I own this fridge I'd
probably keep it down at 33 and I
wouldn't feel comfortable going up much
higher than 35 and that takes away some
of your flexibility to save energy
this Frigidaire Gallery French door unit
sells for $2,600 though you can find it
for a couple hundred less we're finding
it about 2200 at various retail outlets
here at the time of this video but keep
in mind that you can get French door
units for as low as 1500 nowadays and
also once you're spending more than
2,000 you can start to find some pretty
cool features like door and door and
food showcase fridges from Samsung those
are interesting and they merit
consideration there's nothing quite as
exciting or sexy with this fridge that
makes the rush to recommend it thanks
for watching check out the rest of our
plants reviews cnet.com for seen at
appliances I'm right Chris
