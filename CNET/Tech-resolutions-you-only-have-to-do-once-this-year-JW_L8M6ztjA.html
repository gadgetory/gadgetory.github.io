keep here are some tech resolutions you
can do once that will keep you covered
for the rest of the year
for starters set up the service to
automatically backup your files you can
backup in two ways
by an external hard drive and use
software to schedule regular backups you
can also backup to the cloud with online
services like Dropbox Microsoft onedrive
Google Drive or if you're a Mac user
there's iCloud drive each offers some
free storage but you'll need to pay a
monthly fee for more storage at the very
least you can backup your photos on your
phone for free Google Photos app can
automatically save a backup of your
pictures and video as you take them it's
unlimited but it may not say the file
with the highest resolution also Amazon
Prime subscribers have an unlimited
backup of photos and videos with the
Prime Photos app and five other people
can also share that unlimited backup you
should also guard your accounts from
hackers by enabling 2-step verification
on all your personal accounts for social
media and email and if one year
resolutions is to connect more with
family take some time to help your
relatives set up Skype or another video
chat service on their phones and tablets
that way even if you can't see each
other in person you all can hop on video
calls anytime throughout the year for
CNET I'm Bridget Carey happy new year
