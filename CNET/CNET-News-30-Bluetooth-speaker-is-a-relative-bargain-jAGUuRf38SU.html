cambridge soundworks oontz curve I'm not
sure why it's called the curve but in
case you haven't guessed already it's
another tiny wireless bluetooth speaker
what's special about it well like other
cambridge soundworks own speakers it
sports a direct-to-consumer bargain
price tag while the list price for the
curve is 59 99 cambridge is selling it
on amazon for 2999 which is about as
affordable as it gets for a bluetooth
speaker these days what I liked about it
is that it's got some heft to it it
doesn't feel like a cheap speaker and
seems well built I'm not sure how much I
dig the design it's a bit shiny but if
nothing else it is eye-catching and the
speaker comes in a couple of different
metallic color options with additional
colors coming soon if you read the
reviews on Amazon people seem to love
this little guy and it does sound as
good and plays as loud as competitors
costing twice as much however that
doesn't mean it's not without some
shortcomings some tracks I played it
sounded fine with others the curve got
bent out of shape and distorted badly at
medium to high volumes it just doesn't
handle certain bass frequencies well it
can also give more complicated music a
harsh edge that will make more critical
listeners cringe these speakers can
output some base but not surprisingly
they sound thin compared to larger
speakers the Strongs in the mid-range so
vocals in acoustical material tend to
sound the best it's also worth
mentioning that there's a built-in
speakerphone which works well and a set
of transport controls on the unit itself
most people use their smartphone or
tablet to control audio playback but
some users like having a pause play
button on the speaker itself finally
battery life is rated at five hours
which is only ok that you can do better
if you play your music at lower volumes
the speaker doesn't come with any sort
of carrying pouch which would have been
a nice addition considering that if you
want to preserve the shiny finish you'll
probably need to protect it when you
stick the speaker in a bag with other
items that might scratch it don't get me
wrong while I sound a bit critical I
think that one's curve is a decent deal
it isn't head and shoulders above the
rest of the tiny budget speaker pack if
you're not going to do too much better
for thirty bucks
don't come in expecting to get
incredible sound for that money and you
should be happy with this speaker I'm
David Conroy and that's the UN's curve
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
