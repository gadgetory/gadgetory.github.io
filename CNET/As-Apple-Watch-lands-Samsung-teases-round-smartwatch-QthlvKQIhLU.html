landed but not all of them make sense
I'm Bridget Carey and this is your seen
that update the very first Apple watches
are now being delivered to customers
landing on the doorsteps of the Apple
faithful that pre-ordered online two
weeks ago they were up at the wee hours
of the morning to be among the very
first with a new iphone accessory but
even some of the first to pre-order we
still be waiting a few more weeks for it
to arrive many customers are facing long
wait times and if you go online to buy
one today you could be waiting until
July the Apple watch app store is now
live with more than 3,000 apps keep in
mind most of these apps have been
created by developers who have not owned
or lived with an Apple watch now anyone
with an updated iphone can browse the
store it's located inside the Apple
watch app these watch apps are in
categories such as healthy living games
news work yes you can do work on the
watch like keep a to-do list or control
your PowerPoint slides from the watch
screen there are also apps for cooking
or ordering food and going shopping you
know in case you wanted to shop on
amazon or etsy on your wrist yeah
obviously not everything makes sense as
a watch app but all the big app makers
are experimenting while the hype is hot
Samsung is also working the Apple hype
it just announced a new SmartWatch well
we don't know much beyond this teaser
image of a round screen this would be
the first round screen SmartWatch from
Samsung which already has sold six other
smartwatches and in other news relating

meeting in italy as reported by The Wall
Street Journal the CEO confirmed that
luxottica is working with Google to
build the next version of glass you see
the first version of glass is no longer

gear out of the research lab switching
gears to cable news comcast has
officially cancelled its 45 billion
dollar merger plan

facing opposition from us regulators the
company said in a statement that the
deal was structured so if the government
