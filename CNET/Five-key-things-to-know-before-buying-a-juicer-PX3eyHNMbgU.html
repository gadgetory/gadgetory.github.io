a couple really important things to keep
in mind number one how much money do you
plan on spending you could spend as
little as forty dollars all the way up
to a few thousand dollars depending on
what you want to do figure out your
budget and what you want to spend first
number two what kind of juicer do you
really need if you plan on juicing say
citrus and apples you probably have to
spend that much money but if you want to
process leafy green vegetables like
spinach and kale then you're gonna spend
a little bit more on a fancy cold press
machine number three how easy will it be
to clean a lot of these products have
parts you can toss right into the
dishwasher but some of them don't and
that means you're gonna do a lot of hand
washing and that wastes a lot of time
and is definitely frustrating number
four how many speeds does it have some
of these juicers have more than one
speed depending on what kind of fruit or
vegetable you want to juice number five
do you like the design some of these
products can be big heavy and hard to
move around the kitchen you should
really think about that before you make
your purchase
keep these five things in mind and
you'll be sure to buy a juicer that's
just right for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
