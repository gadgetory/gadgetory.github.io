maybe you just got an iPad is that why
you're watching this video in that case
what do you do to set it up what happens
next well whether you got the large
Retina Display iPad or the iPad Mini the
steps are the same because they've got
the same operating system underneath and
here are the most important tips I found
the ones that I use when I set up an
iPad to review or when I purchase one
for the first time get to know iCloud is
my number one because iCloud is not just
a way to backup stuff from your previous
iPad if you've had one but it also
connects all of your iOS devices or even
your Mac and brings your contacts your
photo stream if you have a photo shared
notes bookmarks in Safari and so it
instantly makes your iPad feel like your
own connect that iCloud account
immediately and learn to power use it
and I recommend that you learn to backup
in the cloud if you want to pay for
those services alternatively you could
use Google Google has a ton of apps
available for the iPad and you could put
your email your calendar information
your Docs and be able to live on the
Google cloud all the time on your iPad
and really not have to use Apple's
built-in suite of apps to get your free
stuff there's a ton of free content you
can get on your iPad depending on
whether you have magazines real
magazines newspapers your cable TV
account all of these things have iPad
apps in many cases that provide free
content right off the bat for you and
you can just enter your digital
subscription information and boom you've
got content to go you may already be
subscribing to Netflix you may be
subscribing to Hulu Plus or you may
already have a bunch of iPhone games
that already have iPad optimized
versions so check looking you're already
downloaded apps that you can access via
the App Store and take advantage three
store your media on the cloud I know
cloud is a hot topic but when it comes
to the iPad you really don't want to be
syncing back in with your computer all
the time although you can it's going to
get frustrating for music there are a
variety of services iTunes Match Spotify
is a great subscription service for
streaming
you've also got google music and Amazon
Cloud music both of which work with the
iPad in some capacity take advantage put
all your music up there for video the
same thing you've got not only iTunes
but Amazon Instant Video Netflix a lot
of different ways to rent and access
videos and for books same thing Amazon
the Nook Google and iBooks number for
get into your settings and add Facebook
and Twitter you can actually activate
that now in iOS 6 and having that baked
in is going to enable you to easily
share photos that you've taken or other
content webpages for instance without
having to switch apps it's very easy to
use it's very fun though I'd recommend
in Facebook turn off contacts and turn
off calendar sharing with Facebook
because it suddenly gonna spam you with
all sorts of random invites and contact
information that maybe you didn't
necessarily want in your contacts you
can turn off and then deactivate that
number 5 tweak your orientation lock
this little switch on the side of the
iPad it looks like the iPhones and it
defaults to a silence mode which is not
really useful on an iPad change it over
in the settings to orientation lock
which means that when you activate it it
won't actually turn when you turn the
iPad which is great for reading if
you're reading any books or magazines
see otherwise it turns like this small
tip very helpful number 6 make folders
it's a very simple thing in iOS 6
you can drag apps into shared folders
they all gather together in one icon to
use and then you can pull them up in a
snap
you should make these based on
categories that you're going to use
music video maybe kid apps things that
you can get at a touch of a button it's
not perfect but it's a lot better than
having to navigate through page after
page of apps in number 7 get a case get
a bag you know this iPads are beautiful
but they're a little bit delicate and
they're something that you don't want to
scratch and dent and when you get them
out of the box they don't come with
anything now the smart covers are a
really nice way to cover up the top but
they don't protect them back I like to
get a back cover as well or
can go with slipcases also a great
direction to go is maybe some sort of
iPad friendly small bag that you can
then put the iPad in to check out
another piece I wrote recently on what
makes a good iPad case or iPad bag we
have a ton of those listed at CNM that's
really depending on your taste but get
something as soon as you can if it's not
already in your little holiday gift
basket
I'm Scott Stein and good luck with your
iPad check back and seen that for a lot
