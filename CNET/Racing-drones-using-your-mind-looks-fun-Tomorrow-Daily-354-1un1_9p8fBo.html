best geek talk-show in the known
universe
I'm Jeff kanata flying solo today cuz
Ashlee a skater is out but that doesn't
mean we don't still have you covered
with headlines we talked a lot on this
show about drone racing but are you
ready for drone racing where you control
the drones with your mind researchers at
the University of Florida held the
world's first brain drone race last week
pilots where brain computer interfaces
on their heads and then stare at a
computer screen displaying a floating
object by imagining moving the object
forward the program can figure out how a
pilots brain patterns work and creates a
custom navigation system based on them
best of all it's not just a fun activity
to enjoy it can also give researchers
important information that would help
develop brain controlled devices for
people like prosthetics and wheelchairs
yeah let's make that happen
speaking of anime concepts are you ready
for a giant swimming snake robot
Kongsberg maritime is a Norwegian
engineering company with yes that's
right a giant swimming snake robot
methods for monitoring and surveying
seas are limited in many ways and
sending a flexible large robot under the
surface could be a much better way to
keep an eye on what's happening on the
seabed the goal is to someday create a
robot sea snake that would live
permanently on the bottom of the ocean
and keep an eye on underwater equipment
and perform simple maintenance if needed
potentially costing much less than
current sub aquatic operations so you
know when the eventual robot uprising
happens they will literally be up rising
out of the ocean to destroy us all yeah
sorry giant sea snake hey if you want to
be part of our conversation and I think
since I'm all alone today I get to
decide what story we'll be talking about
on our deep dive on Thursday I think I'm
going with brain controlled drones so if
you want to be part of that conversation
and contribute to all of the stories
that will be deep diving in on Thursday
you can use our hashtag on
Twitter hey TD if your hashtag hey TD we
know you're talking to us and we'll
incorporate your comments into our deep
dive discussion all right let's get to
our phone tog refer the day today's
phone tog refer is Moises who took this
photo on his iPhone 6s plus
he writes hey Ashley and Jeff my name is
Moises big fan of the show these are
pictures of spaceship earth in Epcot at
Disney World I took it with my iPhone 6s
plus and of course you have permission
to use it on the show really cool shot
of Epcot I've never really seen that
angle before but we really appreciate
you sending it in hey if you want to
send in your picture and be our phone
tog refer for a future episode send it
to tomorrow at cnet.com be sure to tell
us what device you took it on give us
permission to use it on the show tell us
how to pronounce your name and a little
story about why you took that particular
photo is always fun as well
well that's gonna do it for today's
episode we'll be back tomorrow and every
day on tomorrow daily and also stick
around on Thursday for a deep dive I'll
see you then until that time good
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
