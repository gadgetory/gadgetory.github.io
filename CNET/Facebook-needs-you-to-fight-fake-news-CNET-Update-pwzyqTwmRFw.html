Facebook's chief executive Mark
Zuckerberg wrote a post addressing the
recent outcry over the amount of fake
news that thrives on the network
Zuckerberg said Facebook is exploring a
few new solutions now currently Facebook
relies on users to report fake news bet
you didn't know you have that power did
you because Facebook doesn't make it
clear but here's how it works when you
report a story select the option that
says you think it shouldn't be on
facebook when asked why select that it's
because it's a false news story but in
the next step Facebook suggests that you
just block the account it came from or
send a message to the account that you
think they should take it down which is
awkward but behind the scenes Facebook
is keeping track of these actions and
the news feed algorithm pen eliza's the
post so it doesn't show up as often in
other people's feeds Zuckerberg says his
team is working on making this reporting
process much easier the network is also
creating tools to spot the fakes before
they're flagged and work with outside
fact-checking organizations Facebook is
also exploring another option putting a
label next to a story that has been
flagged by others as being fake facebook
is also making it harder for fake news
to hide inside of advertising solving
the problem can be tricky Zuckerberg
said he doesn't want to go so far as to
censor free speech during the u.s.
presidential election a number of
made-up stories spread online and had a
large volume of shares on Facebook some
critics suggested this may have tipped
the election for people who believe the
fake news or that it fed into Facebook's
algorithm problem of creating a
political bubble filtering posts so you
only see things similar to your own
worldview based on other things you've
clicked and commented on I'm Bridget
