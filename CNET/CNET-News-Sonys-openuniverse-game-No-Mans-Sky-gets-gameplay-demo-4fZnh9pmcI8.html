a video of this crazy game we're making
called no man's sky this year I guess I
really just wanted to show you how it
plays
so this is a giant sandbox that were
making a universe size sandbox it's full
of choices
like here we're at the boundary between
two warring factions I could join in I
could take sides
but battles like that are taking place
across the universe by pull back a
little bit you could see the other stars
nearby that I can reach with my current
hyperdrive and I'm going to pull back a
little bit more to give you sent to the
size of the game when I do I really need
you to keep in mind to understand that
every one of these points of light is a
son number one of those sons has its own
solar system with planet-sized planets
orbiting around it those have life
ecology and I can either go a little
faster
now most of these places have never been
visited many of them never will be and
I'm going to do something really stupid
I just go to pick one of these at random
and we can go there
beacons where you upload discoveries
that's it over there behind that rock
and and this is the planet that we've
just found just an alien world that we
found together this is planet III and
it's not like the prettiest planet I've
seen better but I've also seen a lot
worse so I could do a scan and it's like
whatever there's no alien life but I
could show you this so every planet in
every solar system is fully destructible
those guys are the Sentinels they
protect the planets from explorers like
me
hey Dad I'm underwater and this fish the
Savitri fish
cool so now I need to find that beacon
and I can upload those discoveries
that's just a little glimpse of no man's
sky it's got trading fighting exploring
survival and it's a huge game thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
