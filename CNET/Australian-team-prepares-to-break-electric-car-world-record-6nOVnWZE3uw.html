here with an Australian University team
getting ready to break a world electric
car speed record our solar car here it
has a top speed of 140 kilometres an
hour
it has a range of 800 kilometers and on
a rainy day with no solar power it has a
range of 500 kilometers in 2007 the team
broke the transcontinental record from
the trip from Perth to Sydney and in
2011 the car previous to this one broke
Guinness world record for the fastest
solar car hitting a top speed of 88
kilometres an hour the University of New
South Wales Sun Swift team is
Australia's leading solar racing team
they're going for a new world record of
the highest average speed over 500
kilometers now for this race they won't
be switching on the solar panels it will
just be an energy race based on a
battery charge I've also had a chance to
get in and feel what it's like to drive
this solar car from my experience in the
car you can see why it needs a lot of
work to make it street-legal you have to
cross your legs in order to get your
foot to the mechanical brake and all of
the main controls are up on the steering
column it's difficult to get in and out
but this is the kind of challenge that
is a lot easier than everything else
they've done to build this car so far
the efficiency of our car is quite
impressive when you're travelling on the
freeway you know freeway speeds 100 110
kilometres an hour you're looking at the
car using the equivalent power as a 4
slice toaster you'd find in your kitchen
in terms of the motors we have on the
car their efficiency is up to 97% which
is how we improve the overall efficiency
of the car and maintain our high speeds
another big part of conserving energy
and making use of our energy is the
regenerative braking systems we have in
the car where we can get up to 80
percent of the power back when we brake
the two biggest concerns people have
with solar and electric cars are that
they don't travel very fast and that B
they don't travel very far so this is
really about curing people's fear of the
lack of speed curing their ranging
and kind of showing that this car is not
only quick and can travel quite far but
it's really the best of both worlds so
we can travel at high speeds for long
distances which is really what everyone
wants</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
