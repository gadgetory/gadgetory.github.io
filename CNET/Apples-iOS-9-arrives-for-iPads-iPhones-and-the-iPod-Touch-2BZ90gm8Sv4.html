available today for your iphone ipad and
ipod touch and it's packing a bunch of
new features it should spruce up life
with your Apple devices I'm mate we've
seen it and today we're checking out iOS
9 available today is a free update from
Apple if you bought a mobile Apple
gadget in the last few years you should
be good to go with iOS 9 the new
operating system is compatible with the
iphone 4s ipad to the original iPad Mini
and the fifth generation iPod Touch and
all the devices that came after you'll
be able to grab it as an over-the-air
download or through iTunes today there's
a lot to see in iOS 9 so I'm just going
to hit the highlights some of apple's
built-in apps have been tweaked the Maps
app for example now includes transit
direction so you'll have a few more ways
to plot your trip and then there's notes
you can now create checklist add images
and even do it with some relatively
sophisticated tools there's also a news
app and it's exactly what it sounds like
headlines from publication your fan of
or relate to a category you're
interested in will show up on the app
some of the biggest changes are coming
to the ipad with iOS 9 you can multitask
on the ipad just slide your finger in
from the right side of the screen and
you'll see a list of apps you can switch
if you own an ipad air 2 you can use
that devices extra muscle to run two
apps side by side there's even a picture
in picture mode so you can watch videos
while you're supposed to be getting
things done these creatures are going to
make a lot more sense of the massive
iPad pro but they're still very much
appreciated here and there's a whole lot
more things feel a lot smoother series
got a lot smarter and apple claims will
see better performance and better
battery life if you're curious about how
true those claims are while you're
waiting for your own updates to download
head over to my full review on cnet I'm
