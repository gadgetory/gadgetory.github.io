with the sharp LC 847 you series this is
the highest end sixty and seventy inch
tvs that sharp makes this is the 60 inch
model and it does have sharps quattron
technology as well as 240 hertz and 3d
talked about both of those in a little
bit but first we'll look at the styling
of this set around the edge you'll find
a really thin bezel it's actually made
of metal which is a step from the other
plastic bezel you typically find on
these TVs it's actually really nice
minimalist look we really liked it also
this TV has a swivel stand that's not
available on the 70 inch version however
I also appreciated the stands nice sort
of textured look here which is again a
departure from the standard glossy black
you'll find on most TV stands i
mentioned sharps quattron technology
that adds a fourth yellow sub-pixel to
the standard red green and blue
sub-pixel arrangement used on most tvs
it really doesn't affect picture quality
however when you adjust the TV properly
so i consider quattron kind of a wash on
this television like most active 3d tvs
this sharp does not include the
requisite 3d glasses those are about 50
bucks apiece and you can't use Universal
3d glasses from other manufacturers
because sharp does not subscribe to that
standard yet other features on the sharp
include a smart TV suite that offers a
good selection arlo not the very best
does miss Amazon Instant although sharp
did add a couple of audio services
including Pandora there's also a web
browser on this TV so it does have a
pretty complete Smart TV system picture
settings are also extensive that
includes a full color management system
as well as ten-point grayscale control
and gamma so it's right up there with
the very best in that category I also
liked sharps excellent help selection
which includes an on-screen manual as
well as a live help feature if you get
lost among the TVs many options round
back you'll find a complete selection of
four hdmi inputs a component video input
there's also a pc input and a pair of
USB ports so all told you can pretty
much connect anything you want to this
television while the styling and feature
set our highlights on the 847 you one of
the lowlights is its picture quality
Stevie's picture isn't any better than
actually a lot worse than some of the
other large screen LED tvs we've tested
that includes sharps much less expensive
640 use series black levels were the
main weakness on this set the sharp
can't deliver the nice deep inky blacks
that we've seen it a lot of tvs at this
level color accuracy was solid in bright
areas although a little bit blue but
that blue crept in significantly in the
darker areas to the set was also unable
to produce a 1080p 24 cadence which film
buffs really appreciate so all told the
2d picture quality wasn't quite there
one highlight whoever with his bright
room picture quality the TV did reject
ambient light relatively well in terms
of 3d the 847 didn't perform all that
much better than in 2d we saw plenty of
crosstalk image it was actually a little
bit dimmer than we expected for an LED
TV so considering both 2d and 3d the 847
you wasn't among our favorite performers
in high-end LED TVs this year that's a
quick look at sharps best 2012 60 and 70
inch television the LC le 847 you i'm
