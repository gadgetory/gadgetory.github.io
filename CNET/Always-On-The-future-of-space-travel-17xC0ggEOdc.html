SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket launches into
orbit
why do I
in case you're not familiar with SpaceX
it's the company founded by tech
entrepreneur and Tesla CEO Elon Musk his
goal is to revolutionize space
transportation with the ultimate plan he
says of enabling people to live on other
planets seven billion people on earth
now it will be 48 billion by the
midpoint of the century so even if one
in a million people decided to do that
that's still 8,000 people the Falcon 9
rocket was designed and built under a
1.6 billion dollar contract with NASA
the rocket is a hundred and fifty seven
feet long and twelve feet in diameter
the capsule on top of the rocket is
named dragon and it measures 14 and a
half feet tall Falcon has nine engines
which generate 850 5,000 pounds of
thrust at sea level it tops 1 million
pounds of thrust as the rocket bursts
out of the Earth's atmosphere
the spacecraft can also carry up to 7
thousand pounds of cargo and here's
another piece of trivia the Falcon name
is an homage to Han Solo's Millennium
Falcon love it
when I visited Cape Canaveral Florida
home to NASA's launch operations spacex
was gearing up for its launch to send
their capsule for a historic first
delivery the Dragon capsule will ride
into space on top of SpaceX's Falcon 9
rocket it'll deliver a thousand pounds
of cargo to the International Space
Station including ice cream and more
importantly it will return with cargo
that's something that previously could
only be accomplished by a shuttle 3 the
launch pretty much went off without a
hitch
dr. dine has cleared the tower one of
the nine engines failed during blast-off
but it still arrived safely at the
International Space Station to deliver
its payload weeks later the Dragon
capsule returned to Earth and splashdown
off the coast of Baja California this
mission marks a major shift in the way
that we travel into space in the future
from government fun to travel to private
enterprise and SpaceX and other
companies have no intention of stopping
at just delivering cargo eventually the
company wants to send people into space
with the same Dragon capsule their goal
is manned test flights in 2015 and
SpaceX is not alone in this endeavor
billionaire Richard Branson has formed
Virgin Galactic he's designed spaceship
2 and has plans to take space tourists
into suborbital flight as early as next
year spaceship 2 will launch via a
larger aircraft instead of from the
ground and passengers will be able to
fly 60 miles into space and feel the
sensation of weightlessness
so while NASA and the space shuttle have
been grounded the future of space is now
in the hands of private enterprise and
it looks like these companies are off to
a pretty solid start</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
