dynamic DTX
350 p and affordable on your headphone
from a company that's known more for
making high-end and pro monitor
headphones lately however it's been
rolling out impressive models aimed at
more of a mainstream audience than the
dt x 350 p which retails for around $70
online is arguably one of the best
sounding on ear headphones for the money
available in black or white the
headphone is designed in Germany but
made in China and cosmetically speaking
it's pretty ho-hum the mostly plastic
construction on the plus side for a
lightweight 4.6 out headphone it does
feel reasonably sturdy and more
importantly is very comfortable for an
on your model with nice soft leather at
ear pads it folds up for storage in a
compact pouch which looks more like
something you'd store sunglasses in then
headphones this closed back 3200m design
features 34 millimeter drivers and the
headphone is geared for mobile use
unfortunately the flat cable lacks an
inline remote and microphone for cell
phone calls and the cable isn't user
replaceable but that's my only real
gripe with the product as I said sound
quality is excellent and you'll be
hard-pressed to find anything that beats
it at this price point the richly
balanced taut base and clear mid-range
are superb and for an on-ear model
stereo imaging is spacious we pitted it
against the highly rated audio technica
ath m50x which costs around double the
price and is an over-the-air headphone
the m50x Essbase was better to find and
went a bit deeper the mid-range in
trouble were more transparent but the dt
x 350 put up a good fight and the two
aren't far apart in sound balance
resolution and imaging bear dynamic is
going to be releasing other affordable
on-air models in 2015 and we look
forward to comparing them to this
headphone but for now the GTX 350 P is a
strong value and easily recommendable so
long as you can do without the
integrated microphone for making cell
phone calls I'm David Carr joy thanks
