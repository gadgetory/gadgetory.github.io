welcome to the Apple buy for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
and there's a whole bunch of both after
Apple's iPhone event a few days ago in
Cupertino now last year Tim Cook said
Apple was doubling down on secrecy but
nothing could be further from the truth
after every new feature color and model
name was leaked by the rumor mills
months before the event let's do a recap
of what Apple just announced in case you
missed it now the iPhone 5s is here on
September the 20th starting at $1.99
with contract it comes in gold white and
Space Gray I actually didn't know space
had its own color of gray until
yesterday now you won't find a bigger
screen or new design like we expected
but there's a lot of features I like
under the hood with an all new a7 64-bit
processor in industry first but we won't
really see major benefits from it in the
near future there's a new m7 coprocessor
that captures motion data for fitness
apps doesn't use the a7 and requires
less battery power
now that feature doesn't affect me as
much unless it can measure the size of
my guns now the all new improved iSight
camera remains 8 megapixels which is a
little letdown and we know megapixels
don't completely matter but keeping it
at 8 compared to what's out there
now there's a dual LED flash made up of
one white and one amber flash a first on
a smartphone and that's pretty sweet to
give you even better photos with a flash
so I'll report back to you on how this
works at the club's there's a new camera
app with features like 120 frames per
second slow-mo video and a burst mode
feature for action shots that plays
catch-up to other phones but it can only
be used on the iPhone 5s
sure it can and that's a bad apple and
the feature they just couldn't keep a
secret which is kind of ironic since
it's for security it's the touch ID
fingerprint sensor that can be used to
unlock your phone or approve purchases
through the iTunes and App Store's now
it's just those two things for now I'm
really digging it and there's a lot of
potential here for your finger to be the
password for all your apps and services
and to get people comfortable with the
behavior of using your finger for
actions but Apple won't give developers
access to the feature initially which
deserves kind of a crappy Apple but they
left it open a change in the future and
really they better open it up sooner
rather than later now my take on the 5s
is that 4s users you're gonna love it
combined with iOS 7 you guys are really
in heaven right now but a lot of iPhone
5 users are let down because they really
wanted a bigger screen we already knew
what to expect and that's if you watch
the show and shame on you if you don't
even though you can't hear me shaming
you
I think the jump from the iPhone 4 to
the 4s was weak and I did an upgrade but
I'm excited about the fingerprint
scanner all the other improvements
there's actually new tech inside here
and yeah I wish it had a bigger screen
too and you might not be in the same
boat but I'm gonna get a 5s and can you
guess what color it's going to be uh huh
oh but no pre-orders for the 5s Apple is
going to make us wait in line so it
looks like their stores have big lines
again and that's a bad apple now I draw
with this phone but I don't want it that
bad so I'll just order it online on the
20th now the biggest letdown from the
keynote was the iPhone 5c I'm not even
its target market but it was supposed to
be the cheaper iPhone alternative
instead Apple showed they won't play on
the low cost space and it's basically an
iPhone 5 with the same internals and
five fruity colors so here's what Johnny
I've had to say iPhone 5c is beautifully
unapologetically plastic plastic do you
really just say plastic come on
was there like a trap door under
Johnny's seat if he didn't say plastic
we're talking about plastic now the 5c
is selling for the same price the iPhone
5 would have been once a new model
swooped in $99 with the 2-year contract
29 more bucks if you want a case with
holes to show off two colors together
now this phone unlocked is 549 bucks
which is on par with other flagship
phones internationally so this is not a
cheap phone now I know people will get
the 5c for their kids in school
I have several girlfriends and let me
make that clear they're girls who are
friends who we're excited about a
colored iPhone
I told them it's not actually a new
phone and yeah they'll sell a bunch but
this is just an iPhone five with a color
wrapper
this isn't innovation and this might be
Apple's most deceptive phone for the
general consumer and guess what's the
first thing that pops up on Apple's
website not the 5s which actually brings
new tech to the table
it's the 5c I'm not even throwing out a
bad apple from now on I'm just gonna
call this the iPhone 5 crap alright got
that out let's get back to the happy
thoughts and iOS 7 is really the bright
spot of this event it'll be available as
a free download on September the 18th
and will be compatible as far back as
the iPhone 4 iPad 2 and iPod Touch 5th
generation now we talked all about the
features like control center and iTunes
radio which Apple still says is coming
soon but you want to know about the new
stuff I found well check this out more
new wallpapers like this one of Planet
Earth
or maybe this cool one of the Northern
Lights or this one where winter is
coming but even better new text tones
and ringtones check this they even
improve the original tritone from this
to this Wow in other new stuff come in
All Things D is reporting that we can
also expect to see an Apple TV software
overhaul on the 18th the same day when
iOS 7 comes out one new feature will
allow people to play content they've
purchased themselves on the iTunes Store
and play it back on someone else's Apple
TV using airplay so you can stream
content you own to any Apple TV box
which is typically set up with just a
single user account and Space Gray is
here to stay
apple also announced the iPod Touch iPod
Nano and iPod shuffle will be available
in that color but before we move on
let's take a moment to remember the
Apple products we've lost but we're so
good to us
all right now we said we get to some of
your impressions and emails from Apple's
event so check this out on Twitter dead
access says can't wait to get a 5s my
phone isn't slow yet but can't wait to
be a Ferrari on the digital highway
well vroom vroom to you now Mark Owens
writes in with this was the time Apple
needed to wow us all back in love with
the iPhone I broke up with my iPhone 4
and haven't looked back Tim Cook is not
the leader Apple needs right now all
right mark I think the days of really
being wild buy any phone are gone people
want to be romanced back because Steve
he did it so well but the reality
distortion field is gone and guess what
reality can sometimes suck all right B
Wyman asks I was wondering with the new
iPhone 5s and 5c chips and antennas will
it allow for simultaneous talk and data
with Sprint and Verizon well in LTE
areas all right now you won't like this
but the answer is still a no we asked
Apple and they said Verizon's network
tech prevents voice and data and that it
isn't a problem specific to the phone
but there are other phones that added an
extra antenna to make it work but you
just won't find it here on the 5s or 5c
so there you go keep sending us your
emails with your impressions and
questions to the Apple bita cnet.com or
tweet me at brian tong and we'll show
some of them off now we'll also be doing
another email episode in a couple weeks
and I want you guys to really dig deep
and ask me anything any question you
have ever wondered and we'll answer them
all right that's gonna do it for this
week's show
i'm brian tong thanks for watching and
we'll catch you guys next week for
another bite of the Apple
you talk about plastic we sittin here
apples supposed to be the leader for
innovation and we in here talk about
plastic I mean listen we talking about
plastic not a new iPhone not a new
iPhone not a new iPhone we talking about
plastic not a phone not the phone that I
go in live for and cry for and pay every
penny I save like it's my last day not
the iPhone we talk about plastic man
