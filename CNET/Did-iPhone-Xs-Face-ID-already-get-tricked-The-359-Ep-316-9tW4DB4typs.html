it's time for episode 316 of the 359
podcast my name is BVG and your host
today are alfred Inge and Roger Chang yo
yo yo Alfred 3:16 says he just pawed
your cast I have no idea what you just
said that's from Stone Cold Steve Austin
Austin 3:16 just so floored by just
break the unusual introduction and huh
he's also wearing cutoff shorts dear
that is how dedicated he is to Stone
Cold Steve Austin all right so we're
gonna be talking about a couple things
there were some reports out yesterday
and I guess today as well about face ID
potentially getting fooled either by
mask or your sibling or son we'll be
talking about the LGV 30 scene that's
got its official review on it and it's
surprisingly a worthy rival to Samsung's
best and brightest eye laughs they will
be talking about Firefox 57 also known
as Firefox quantum and why you might
want to give it a shot as a as a browser
give it a shot
yeah see as always if you have any
questions about these topics live in the
comments section Brian will pick out the
best and we will try to answer them in
three minutes to 59 seconds from 3 to
welcome to the 359 I wrote your chant
I'm Afra dang someone may have already
cracked Apple's vaunted face ID system a
Vietnamese security software company
claims to have created a mask that was
able to unlock the iPhone X's facial
recognition lock Albert you dug into
this story and you end up with more
questions than answers let me should is
this something we need to be worried
about no I don't think so I'm very
skeptical of it so there's a few caveats
to this so they didn't really show their
process of it so we don't really know
what was registered on the phone to
begin with right and then
article from Reuters today from a
reporter in Vietnam that visited the
company they explained that it takes
about nine hours to make the mask adjust
adjustments to the mask it takes about a
week to make the mask itself well and
then nine hours to make adjustments to
it and if you from according to Apple's
white paper if you don't unlock the
phone without face idea to begin with
mm-hmm for at least four hours then it
like you have to use a password right so
it kind of destroys the whole purpose of
it anyway
so there's really no point to you know
their whole all we made this mask that
takes nine hours but right have about
four hours to two days ID on it right so
I mean a thief would basically have to
steal your phone already have the mask
already gave you and they'd also have to
have your facial dimensions because it's
right before it sensor actually to make
some math yeah and I think a lot of
people who read the article basically
made this point where if somebody went
to all that trouble to steal my phone
and scan my face and you know make a
mold out of it they probably you know
like they can probably do a lot more
than just steal my phone for that yeah
no definitely I just it seems today
there was a youtube video going around
of a mother showing off her iPhone X and
showing off how her son is able to
unlock the phone yeah it was her 10 year
old kid and if you watch the video they
actually look similarly and Apple has
made this point before they in their
white paper about face ID they've talked
about how for family members
specifically twins right or even
children under 13 because their facial
features haven't fully developed yeah
the odds of it fooling face idea are a
lot higher and the idea is again if you
if you're in putting your passport here
kind of staring at the phone it's
learning yeah it thinks that you're this
person and it's starting to learning to
accept you as a as the original person
yeah so the way that face ID is able to
learn who like you know even when you
put on glasses or when you have a scarf
on or when you're growing a beard or
anything
we get a haircut is that every time
you're unlocking it and and you put your
password in yep that new scan like it it
learns based off of that new scan so
some of the argument can be made where
it's basically okay well maybe when
you're unlocking it with your password
and the kids on it then it's able to
learn based off of that and like assume
that kid is like the new person or some
way it's basically if it meets a certain
threshold but it doesn't meet it
completely so they have to still look
somewhat similar for it to train based
on like my wife and I could really it
could be fooled by that I don't know if
your wife looks like you we don't look
okay all right next up LG isn't a
company that's got a lot of buzz on the
phone front lately but see that it has
its official review of the LGP 30 and
editor Sean Hollister calls it a worthy
rival to Samsung's Galaxy s8 plus as
well as Google's pixel to excel this is
a jumbo phone like the iPhone 10 like
the Galaxy S 8 Note 8 is very slim
bezels big screen I think the 6-inch
display it's a big phone it's it's still
a phone but it's it's packed it with a
lot of sorta latest features dual
cameras on front and the back you know
very comparable I think it's just a
little sad I don't think it's gonna do
that well just because a lot of people
kind of had their minds of getting a
Samsung phone or Google phone or an
iPhone yeah oh gee does not have the
brand recognition that the other that
its competitors do but I will say it is
definitely a solid looking phone yep and
you know camera wise I think it a shot
does knock it a little bit for slow
autofocus especially during low light
conditions it is a but otherwise like
the camera takes some really sharp
photos it's just not quite up to par
with some of the others and I'm also
gonna knock points off for also being
$800 plus because you know how cheap I
am yeah well there is that I mean it's
definitely part like the jumbo class of
premium photos lastly Firefox 57 also
known as quantum promises a speedier
browser our own Steve Shanklin did a
whole big profile a few months back on
Firefox and it's come back this is sort
of the big come back initiative for
Firefox is this gonna get you to try it
out I mean I
I guess we'll have to find out but I
mean one of their interesting points
that they brought up is if you use
Chrome you know that it's like a serious
battery drain yeah yeah and I think
that's one of their points that they're
trying to say like this isn't gonna be
like that we're not gonna take up that
much of your baby yeah so we'll find out
you know I'm gonna test it Allison I
mean I think that's data load but make
it a pretty attractive it doesn't kill
your battery all right for those stories
a boiler chickens on CNET I'm Roger
Chang I'm out for ding thanks for
listening I think you really need to
decide whether it's the iPhone 10 or the
iPhone eggs because you flip-flop or
part of me sort of want to stick with X
but then I kind of stuff correct every
once in a while I don't know also our
timer was I was set to 9 hours for 359
so the record we have done 316 episodes
of this and they still can't do 4
minutes on the nose
nope no we try probably could add so I
have a question yeah why does the new
Firefox mascot logo thing look like
Batman I think that was just art for for
that specific story
no no it was art that they supplied yeah
but for the original story right yes
rebuilding Firefox part of Firefox's or
Mozilla to copy hi Firefox their their
attempt but I don't think that's their
new logo I don't think their new logo is
the photos of a big sort of an internal
point to their own team yeah exactly
like we're rebuilding Firefox from
scratch this is a brand new browser
faster it's leaner it's meaner
I do like that art though because if you
look closely in it there's a small
screen of Rick Astley this like actually
this image this is just a giant rick
roll yeah we actually rick roll'd
just thousands of readers did we recrawl
them but Fox sent us the image so
wouldn't they rolled yes into we also
been Rick Rolled ception yes Rick Ross
we're like three degrees into it it's
pretty it's pretty dead stuff so any
questions or still sure we've got a
conspiracy theory from sky it says face
ID hacked this is
clearly a publicity stunt as the company
are holding a press conference soon and
looking to get into that mobile market
yeah they're having their press
conference later today at 9:00 p.m. to
mark our time 9:00 a.m. vietnam time yep
and bkv by the way is a software company
but it also is has built phones there's
like a lady right right and just try to
get in the phone business so you know
this is this could definitely be I think
I think there's a reason why they're so
when they first announced it I looked
into their like research of it yeah
usually when there's a big you know data
breach or when they're not data breach
but when there's like a big
vulnerability like with the crack
vulnerability or blue born or anything
like that there's this whole like long
technical research paper this is how we
did they did like a small QA on their
blog right and like there was no like
actual concrete evidence there was no
like here's how we did it or anything
like that it was just one of the
questions like oh how did you like make
a mask to fool this one you know people
that wired Wall Street Journal's CNET
weren't able to do something like this
even Apple if their Hollywood mask
makers and they said because we know the
AI and then they did like a winky face
I'm like oh that's that's legitimate I
take that as a good explanation yeah the
Windy face had so much context and then
I also think there's a reason why their
demonstration was a minute long video of
this this groundbreaking discovery where
it's only a minute long and it's like
look it unlock the Massa unlock with me
we did it like that the whole thing yeah
can you really do I mean it for the
record this is not hacking no we should
not use a term no this is this is
tricking or fooling yeah and it's a
really X or being method of tricking or
falling it's an impossible crap we don't
know for sure if it works that if it
does it's super impractical because like
the odds of someone knowing like your
dimensions to create a mask and like
your actual facial features to create a
mass have makeup artists like basically
paved down so it looks like a human face
and then getting their hands on your
phone and then also being able to do it
within the time constraints that face ID
has yeah so like like I was saying on
the podcast face ID unless you unlock it
with face ID every four hours it goes
back
using your password so if they made that
risk there's like after four hours long
like it's not gonna work and if it you
only got five attempts to with face IDs
after that you have to type in a
password so if it fails like five times
you're also out of luck if the phone's
been just turned on for the first time
so the battery's like dead you also need
to put in password there's so many
things I like this makes no sense it's
completely ridiculous to think that this
is like a plausible like attack method
they slightly outsmarted it for half a
second yeah although I won't say the
other example the YouTube video the kid
with the kid that is a bit more
worrisome as a parent I mean I kids
aren't enough to use a phone now but if
my kid is able to unlock my phone to
start paying for things using face ID
from I mean that's the whole reason why
we lock our phones from our kids so they
they don't use it they don't buy crap
with it
I think use face ID that kid could use
facial ID to make purchases or whatever
that's the entire process there was a
point where he mentioned in the LinkedIn
article that the the kid's dad wrote
yeah like explaining how he found this
and all this stuff he was all like yeah
you could get on the phone and by
himself
I scream if he wanted to but he's a good
boy so you want to do that by ice cream
I mean I relate to this a little bit cuz
I mean I look at the ice creams bear the
porn right I look exactly as an example
I look exactly like my dad though
so like this is a situation that I can
relate to right what your dad would
probably unlock your phone instead of
you like the other way around
no I can trust him my dad wouldn't
figure that out well you know as long as
you don't enter the passcode like the
camera system doesn't read his face and
yeah it's people have exploited the twin
thing and it's like okay yeah that kind
of makes sense but simple genetics where
you tell it if we are not identical to
but you're close enough if you look at
the video
the kid does look a lot like mother like
facial but that shouldn't be enough
right barely do we think we're gonna see
any kind of patch or software upgrade
out of apple sometime soon
two defunct this I don't know I think as
it learns more it will probably be able
to pick up the differences much better
like I remember when touch ID first came
out everyone say look I tricked it so
easily yeah I think just like touch ID
face IDs gonna get better over the years
I don't know if it's there's a near-term
fix required but I think it's gonna
evolve and become more reliable over
time as anything just like as all the
the smart home voice assistants they
learn yep oh so creepy to say that out
loud oh hey here's here's a thought too
we talked about how face ID works would
something like a facial tattoo have any
weight on that while it would continue
to learn based off of that I mean that's
not the kind of thing that you develop
that you yeah so the thing is it's like
you can type in your last weird you type
in your password if like it doesn't
recognize your face and if it meets a
certain threshold so like if I just get
a scar but like it recognizes like the
rest of my face like let's say let's say
it meets like a 75% threshold like they
would learn based off of that I think it
was like under I don't know what the
exact number is but it has to meet a
certain threshold for it to say like
yeah that's probably the same person
something else like probably just
changed about them so we're gonna like
learn and based off of that that would
be interesting to learn a little bit
more about how that yeah software does
work yeah but on your point about you
like your kid being what being able to
unlock your phone like if he if he looks
like you or anything like that Roger
does have a baby face that's uh it's
been a really funny like pain point for
adopting biometrics that I've seen a lot
lately like there was that story that I
wrote like last Christmas wears a some
girl like her her mom was sleeping so
she put like crazy and just ordered a
bunch of like Pokemon stuff well didn't
Scott Stein here accidentally order an
Xbox ones Apple yeah there was a story
that shows like they they had to like
land a Qatar Airways flight on Sunday or
so because a girlfriend found out that
her boyfriend was cheating on her while
he was sleeping
because she put his fingerprints off the
phone and like started reading through
yeah I mean that's that's a smart
girlfriend not a dumb phone there are
some scenarios where it's basically your
passwords probably like much more secure
than your face or your yeah often with
my wife none of them are perfect I put
the phone up to her face all right here
we go Ben Fox Reuben in the chat where
is Ben Fox Reuben today I love that guy
he's a serious question from Josh boy
that does Apple give you an option like
smart lock on Android where you can just
push a button on the screen to lock the
phone and block face ID they have the
emergency a sponge you tap the power
button five times really fast then you
have to use a password in I think that
was a way to get people it's like if
cops pull you yeah they don't Apple
doesn't like flouts say that they'll say
hey here's a feature that we did a block
police but yeah yeah five times though
like I don't know someone's coming
you're like oh god what I wonder how
this is gonna affect further we hear a
lot about even recently court cases
where smart devices have been involved
in our technically witnesses and yeah
how that's going to weigh in and with
the encryption and if face ID is gonna
perform but I provide another obstacle
to this or I mean you can get around it
just like anything else though
yeah biometrics are not as protected as
your password is by the law so there was
a court case there's been several court
cases where they've said we can force
you to put your fingerprints
mm-hmm to unlock your phone where it's
interesting it's like your passport is
it's like because it's something in your
mind it's it's the Fifth Amendment where
you can't self-incriminate with your
password because that's like knowledge
like that's something you can keep like
to yourself but they can put your face
in your fingerprint that's not like that
because in the by the same logic you
know when you're arrested they can take
your mug shot and they can also ask you
to put your fingerprints in it's kind of
the same logic where it's like okay if
we can legally ask you to do that we can
definitely ask you to unlock your phone
the same way yeah yeah question about
setting a password from
can you set passwords with letters
instead of numbers on the iPhone 10 like
on previous phones that's an interesting
thought I've actually never not used
numbers myself so if you were able to
use and say they haven't updated that
interface I don't know it's one two
three five even though you could use
letters apparently you can cuz Scott's
done it yeah alright thanks God for
education is still in the chat I think I
can go find him do we know we don't want
that in here
get out Ben yeah ban him from the chat
so we've only got a few minutes left and
we haven't talked any more about the the
V 30 I myself and sporting a v10 right
now yeah I've actually quite enjoyed it
I'm interested in this phone I want to
learn more from mr. Hollister but could
you guys maybe expand what were you
talking about earlier with the camera
regarding the lenses the show has a dual
lens setup both of the front and the
back and they're like iPhones and unlike
the Samsung those which have zoom lenses
this is more wide super wide angle and
like a regular camera lens and so yeah
you could do like large I guess kind of
panoramic shots versus more standard
shots Sean says the photos are great
they come out Chris to come out clear
they look great on the P OLED display
but in terms of in low-light settings in
certain cases its autofocus is a little
bit slower than your iPhone I thought of
the door lens would help fix that no
because it's still operating up it's not
using both lenses at the same that's
frustrating yeah so great camera is just
not quite as good or as polished as the
ones you get from say pixel or or I
thought the Samsung I say it's a shame
that they don't offer more size options
like with iPhones like would give me at
everybody else because like that's my
biggest gripe about this v10 is its
uncomfortably large yeah and this one is
just as large yeah
this is this is not I mean Sean kind of
comparison to the Galaxy s8 or si plus I
mean the other comparison to me would be
the note 8 it's kind of similar in size
of a digital stylus but that's sort of
maybe they're going maybe it's a phone
maybe the phone is so big that in the
promo image that's that's not them
trying to show the phone out of the
pocket that's literally just how large
it is that it won't fit in the pocket
like go to it like the article bringing
it up it's one it's one of the photos
where it's like they're pulling it out
of the pocket bonus you get to see an
adorable photo of Sean's daughter yay so
I'm still looking for you guys gonna
have to vamp it's on our front page if
you just go to see Netcom what's that
website again
CNET that's maybe the phone is actually
just so long it is that is how I feel
when I walk around the s7 in my pocket I
hate carrying this in my pocket cuz like
every time I bend over like stabs like
my abdomen or something don't bend over
oh oh I'm sorry I'm like that's why I
like I prefer the wintertime because I
actually have a coat that I can just put
this in because I'm that kid that wears
the trench coat everywhere there you go
bring back the fanny pack yo my friend
actually has one don't don't
straight your friend lives in Brooklyn
right yep I think it's a good phone it's
a decent option I just think it is gonna
get kind of you know lost the shuffle
with the eight pixel all those phones
out there right now that's been the core
dilemma for LG for a while one more
question from Josh boy to the MVP today
do you think a 30 will have the same
screen issues as a pixel to excel that
is a very good question well we'll just
have to find out now why why would that
be are they from the same screen
manufacturer I believe so yeah the P
OLED display is that is the same type of
display got A's have
issues with the pixel to that cell oof
yeah all right
time will tell see I mean if if you pick
up a V 30 you know and once it wins a
street date on the V 30 is it out
already
okay I'm I'm obviously not the the tech
reviewer here I'm just the butcher I
just I just read stories I just judge
people mostly just that all right it's
probably about time to wrap it up that
is about to wrap it it's nice to see
that we've got some competitive phones
again albeit they're all overpriced but
there's some decent phones on the back
then underwhelmed for a while and now
we're like Oh cameras a little sad that
like in order to get that
competitiveness they all have to be like
yeah stuff that's the reality I'm sure
some people do all right all right the
few ideas are heard here check this out
see that our podcasts also available on
iTunes tune in stitcher SoundCloud
feedburner and Google Play Music see you
all tomorrow
thanks everyone here joining file see
Netcom except Ben Fox Ruben no bf ours</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
