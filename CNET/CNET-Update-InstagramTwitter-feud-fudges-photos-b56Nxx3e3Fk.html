Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update there's drama brewing between
Instagram and Twitter the two companies
are competing for your attention and a
recent change is causing some Instagram
photos shared on Twitter to appear
cropped Instagram suddenly stopped
supporting a photo preview feature in
Twitter it's called Twitter cards and
when you pulled up someone's tweet you
could see a photo already nicely loaded
on the page it still looks fine if
you're on the desktop website but tweets
on the mobile app are showing photos
cropped this has created a bad user
experience because not only do you see a
cut-off photo but you have to take
another step to click the Instagram link
to see the full photo of course
Instagram wants those clicks now that
it's building its web presence sure it's
all part of business but don't they
understand that this drama just annoys
and pushes away users and I hope you're
sitting down because get ready for this
we already have rumors about the next
iPhone I know the iphone 5 just came out
in September but a French website is
posting what appears to be leaked images
of iphone 5s parts the outside looks the
same but oh my gosh the screws inside
are in different places what could it
mean Netflix just made a huge movie deal
with Disney in three years Netflix will
be the only u.s. subscription TV service
to show Disney own movies this is the
first time netflix has made a deal with
a major Hollywood studio and netflix has
struggled to get quality movies in its
lineup most movies won't be on the
service till 2016 but they cut a deal to
get some older titles on there right now
like Dumbo Pocahontas and Alice in
Wonderland amazon just launched a new
children's service on the kindle tablet
it's called kindle freetime unlimited
that gives kids access to a wide library
of books games apps and videos but
parents will have to pay a monthly fee
Prime members can get it for three
dollars a month for one child and non
Prime members the cost starts at five
dollars a month its aim for kids between
three and eight years old for those of
you with a sonos speaker system and an
iphone or ipad sonos updated its app for
iOS 6
dream music saved on your apple device
it's kind of like airplay and there's a
new feature coming to the Wii U google
street view users will be able to pan
around a map by holding up the gamepad
controller and moving around it'll be
available as a free download in the wii
u eshop starting in january but after
march it won't be free to download
