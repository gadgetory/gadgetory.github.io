we've tested are pretty limited in the
features department but this Kenmore
Elite for one five eight to front load
washer is a little bit different it has
slightly more features than your average
front loader for this price 1,100 bucks
so you're gonna get 14 cleaning cycles
you'll get a steam setting you'll have a
drum light that illuminates the inside
while you're filling up your clothes but
that's pretty much all that this washer
does right everything else is just kind
of men or not great at all so the
display is nice I like the the blue LEDs
but this side over here is a little too
cluttered given that it doesn't actually
do a lot on this side you're really just
controlling the temperature you're
setting the spin speed and you're
setting the soil level so it's a little
bit hard to locate what you're looking
for
I also wish the display here was a
little bit larger and it's a little bit
difficult to see from certain angles so
if you want to know how much time is
remaining on your cycle it's a little
tough to do so this model didn't do
poorly overall but the Electrolux model
we reviewed recently did a lot better in
terms of performance and also nailed all
the other basics features design and
usability so if you're in the market for
a front load washer this one is okay but
I definitely look at the competition
before you buy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
