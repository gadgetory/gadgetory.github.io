had to double check that i'm BVG and
it's the 359 podcast episode 343 and
today your hosts include Joanie soles
when Roger tank and Ben Fox Reuben good
morning everybody
so what are we talking about today Roger
we're gonna be talking about a home pod
home pod finally coming finally coming
Apple finally confirmed the gates
February February 9th and you actually
begin to be able to pre-order it
starting this Friday just in time for
Valentine's Day yeah super romantic for
the for the Apple fanboy in your life
that's true I don't love anyone $349
really whoa that's your threshold 348
we'll also be talking about Netflix and
it's a blowout quarter all really thanks
to Will Smith I'm just just giving it to
Will Smith and this little thing called
stranger things what what and then just
lastly a little tease to our Katie
Collins story on sleep tech so as always
if you have any questions on these
topics please leave them in the comment
section Brian will pick out the best and
we will get to them in three minutes and
59 seconds from three to welcome to the
359 I'm Rutter Chang I'm Ben Fox worried
but I'm Johnny salzman Apple finally set
a launch date for home pod with
pre-orders opening up this Friday and
smart speaker hitting stores on February
9th now this was supposed to launch last
year obviously we've talked a lot about
the delay and since then we've seen a
Lexington goggle assistant going
everything right refrigerators
televisions cars toilets CES was all
about Amazon yet again yet again so then
I get asked like does Apple have a
chance here yeah absolutely it's Apple
okay
I mean look I understand that there are
a lot of people in the tech industry
that see a lot of the limitations of
home pod and Siri and just one of
say that this product is dead on arrival
the thing is is that Apple can sustain
this product for years and lose money on
if it feels like it needs to to break
into the smart speaker market I mean
like they literally have more money than
God well I checked with God before I
said that true gods like yeah yeah
Apple loves its margins it loves its
profitability and it it's never taken an
Amazon like strategy where it will
willingly lose money to be in this
business so will it be losing money on
something that cost that much no I guess
not I mean that's yeah to Ben's point
about the idea of like losing money and
the fact that like no one's gonna buying
it for a while losing like cachet or
cachet or no it's actually if it doesn't
sell as well as it's not it's just like
what would the point of Apple sunsetting
the product after a year or two because
like even if they get a couple customers
in the door then they can start building
out the ecosystem building the software
and actually like get a foot in the door
and smart speakers so it's just I think
that people are being a little like
they're they're they're jumping the gun
to say that the home pot it's already
finished it's not so I'm gonna let me
ask you both this like I have to Amazon
that goes like it's kind of committed to
that ecosystem at this point I don't
know if I really want to switch to
another one what do you do that you have
an echo I have three echos and a Google
home but this is what I write about
right so but that's the thing like
you're you're an echo user would you be
willing to switch to Google home or
switch to home pod
I mean purely as a consumer my calculus
is that I am satisfied with the product
that I already have I paid one quarter
of the price for that product and I
wouldn't ask to pay for this new one
even though I do use I use Android and
iPhone I use iPhone for my day-to-day
life even though I'm part of that
ecosystem already yeah I don't see the
value in having something not as well
replicate what I already have for much
less money right I think that's the
initial hurdle that I can't to wrap my
head around is like how does Apple get
past the idea that people have already
committed to certain smart speakers okay
if they have any traction whatsoever I
think the expectation
from some folks in the industry that
they would come out with a home pod mini
like a tiny a tiny version that would be
a lower pricepoint it still wouldn't be
around $50 which you would get with the
Google home mini or the Amazon echo dot
but it wouldn't be 349 dollars I next up
Netflix posted another blow out quarter
thanks in part to Will Smith's bright
what stood out for you from those
results well you're right
Will Smith had Will Smith's bright
blockbuster flick it was Netflix first
attempt at a blockbuster popcorn style
tentpole film and it really resonated
with viewers from what we can tell it
helped contribute to Netflix reporting
it's the best quarter of new member
additions ever wait still there's a
little there's a little show called
black mare big hit at all like reread a
stranger that came out in the same
period yeah all those things that's
that's the thing that they're going for
they're going for this constant cadence
of new stuff that's gotta watch it sort
of things even if bright wasn't the
thing you gotta watch maybe stranger
things was right interesting or they
dropped interesting comment about rate
hikes or the lack of rate hikes going
forward right yeah so everybody always
wants to know when their precious bill
for Netflix is gonna be going up and the
there was an increase last year and what
they said last night is that there's no
more increases on the horizon but then
they got sort of wishy-washy about the
circumstances that would allow them to
raise and create raise rates again and
it sounds a lot like what's happening
right now so what they're I think what
they're saying is we're not planning on
hiking rates but I think we could if we
want to do mmm
okay so how many people how many new net
additions were there in the United
States in the US there are almost two
million new like who I thought that
market was already saturated so who are
these folks so that's a great question I
don't know exactly who they are I'm sure
they're they're definitely not people at
that like first half of the tech adopter
new adopter wave like the first half of
that pyramid or that wave they've
already got that it's the second half
Netflix has said like years ago that
they believe that the US market is sixty
million to ninety million people for
them and they're at about 55 million
so they still have runway they still see
having runway before they even meet the
meet the lowest threshold of what they
see is being you know there are places
in America where like Internet broadband
connections are still getting up to par
with actually holding the service like
places that Internet access isn't great
isn't like something when we take for
granted so the market lastly if you have
trouble sleeping you might want to check
out a feature from our own Katie Collins
and just how effective sleep tech can be
she runs that runs down a number of
different devices and just sort of
talked about her own personal
experiences and how it actually calls
her to really stress out of our sleep
it's just a read check out that store
and more go and seeing it I'm Roger
Chang I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Joanie
sauceman thanks for listening dibs on
the sleep tech stuff I'm always
interested in that but wait a minute so
she was looking into sleep tag and it
stressed her out about no so she lost
sleep so if you read her intro she she
actually did lose sleep over it
she used a misfit shine sleep tracker
and you know for a while she stressed
out because she has to do this for a
paycheck no no no no she was doing this
I serve though I was an experiment she
was looking at her sleep sleep cycles or
you know how much good sleep she got and
she start stressing about the amount of
good sleep she got like she felt like
she was constantly like her Dan you know
her sleep debt and so that that was kind
of like that was sort of her intro of
the story like why some of this stuff
may not actually work I mean there she
doesn't laid out some products that are
more effective than others but I think
that lead kind of is a great example of
like the core dilemma when you use tech
to solve you know you know what sleep
tech I like there was a thing at CES it
was a pillow that just breathed it was a
breathing pill you hold it and it's it's
like you're holding a dog or a yeah and
it's just like you you hold it you turn
it on and it breathes
very nice I feel like I could get does
that make a breathing sound was it just
the motion I don't think so but you
could probably buy something that will
snore actually if you joke about that
but my
my kids got like a little stuffed baby
that does makes those sleeping noises -
like emulate her mother his mother's
yeah obviously is it is it your wife's
actually no no standard loves it the
crib is like baby the baby yeah Rogers
like backing up from the crib Kobe yeah
[Laughter]
it's like some kind of technology that
replicates the experience of being like
on a moving vehicle cuz I seen an
airplane and a bus like you wouldn't
believe I mean there's so much a crap
it's so much baby tech but does that
really really well not so much but I can
think I'm like can we hand it to adults
what is that technology is he you
literally put the crib track that's the
only thing you could fit in the room we
were heading to CES and I was out before
we were off the tarmac like thank you I
can't I can't sleep on planes just yeah
there are too many snakes yes please
shout out to some new friends and new
fans that are joining us namely we got
CRO videos joining us live for the first
time videos Joan talking about Netflix
he said stranger things is their
greatest hit and I don't Kontest that
but what was Orange as a new black was
their first and then streaming things
you surf
so like infamously Netflix doesn't share
details but what you can glean from
outside information is that
house of cards was its first get people
talking necklace was making originals
that you want to watch hit that in terms
of number of viewers was usurped by
oranges new black and then stranger
things was just like and out of the
ballpark kind of now at the top level of
the thing that of Netflix subscriber
base and the largest portion of the
square face watches that one show rather
than any other that make sense yeah it's
a good show and it's a that bright one
of their most large titles including
both movies and yeah which is impressive
concerns have been around for a little
while yeah well and they also put a ton
of money into it if it was like a
million dollars I mean like Marco Polo
the film was also marketing I think
marketing might be separated but you
know it's a different calculus between
like marketing a film the marketing
expenses are giant Netflix did on it's
like for for a Netflix property they did
a lot of marketing for bright but it's
still nowhere near like I mean imagine
like a Star Wars nowhere near like what
a normal studio would be doing right and
a lot of the marketing is done like
exactly free free yeah basically for you
to wonder how much Bill Smith made yes
he's probably like oh I can probably
find out then 90 million was all tells
me what dollar movie I like that the
Michael Browns is why aren't nap pods a
commercial thing I'm getting into that
I'd have pods I'm thinking that like
must be some kind of chamber that
replicates whatever sleeping environment
like it's about yeah I feel like you'd
probably find that in SF like I'm sure
I've seen an office in SF that's
something like that I think they have
them in a lot of airports these days
right possibly I don't know I think I
feel like I read something about that
also I want to give a quick shout out to
looker LA 69 who says you guys are
really funny not so congratulations on
keeping that in 1995 zinger alive
melody Lane wants to know how exactly is
the home pod going to differentiate
itself from the election now we've
raised over this in the past and we all
know that Apple goes on
about their speaker quality right but as
Michael Brown so graciously pointed out
in the chat series hot garbage I
wouldn't disagree yeah I mean look that
they're gonna be pushing the the fact
that it's gonna be very tightly knit to
your iPhone
but yeah audio quality Brian you got it
right
I know quality's a big one but I imagine
going forward especially as they're
going after hardcore Apple users is is
we're gonna sell this thing is like this
is the this is the smart speaker that
will be most closely tied to your iPhone
yeah for Apple people yeah for Apple
people but it's good question because I
don't really know if it's just audio
quality that that's not enough for a lot
of people are deciding smart speakers
for audio quality like so no generation
so many people don't care about audio
fidelity and I don't buy high-end
speakers yeah we're already going that
yeah we connect to other smart speaker
you're not gonna meet us in the middle
on that right so the Sonos one which
works with Alexa and I believe also
Google assistant is is definitely one of
those higher-end speakers and the home
pod is seen as a bigger rival
specifically they're just so knows then
it would be to the echo or the home line
the problem is is that yeah Siri does
need a lot of work and it's really just
a matter of Apple actually spending the
money and you know hiring more staff to
do it it's not like they don't have the
resources to they just haven't you know
put the time and effort I believe into
actually making Siri more worthwhile and
you know a lot of the partners that
already partner with Google home and the
echo of course they'd want to partner
with that well because it's Apple so
yeah we want to take some more questions
we got little time left yeah it's - okay
just making sure
sir enjoy did you guys see the home pod
illustrations in a white soulless room I
died a bit on the inside
I did not see these I didn't see that no
but I can sort of imagine enjoyed knows
more about the show where are you sir
enjoying yes New York maybe we can bring
it on Skype or something yeah gonna
figure that one out
moving on Michael Brown Apple home pod
will sell and will probably sell right
over so no sand right
under Google home and Amazon echo I
think that's yeah I feel like that's a
pretty safe bet I mean it's you know
Sonos is still kind of an itchy brand
watching into audio equipment Apple at
this point has such a dedicated basis
they can actually measure but think it's
gonna get this and that they can't move
the volumes because it's not like a
fifty dollar speaker like the Google
home yeah not only that but like I think
that that's leaking down walls with this
there's a good measure of schadenfreude
I think that's that's going on here
we're like Apple is the highest valued
company in the world they have all this
money people are waiting to see one of
their products failed just because also
like Apple fanboys aren't really they
don't really ingratiate themselves to
other people I would say Soho when it
overgeneralize man well I know some very
nice boys
I wonder who they are yeah let's get a
couple more in here before we call it a
day
oh I lost my place I lost my place a lot
of people are talking about the Sonos
speaker oh yeah that's a good point yeah
that's a great alternative very
cost-effective scott maya Apple bought
Beats now entering the smart speaker
market would it make sense for them to
buy out so knows next Joan what do you
think of the beats acquisition and why
isn't this called like a beats speaker
that's a good point well I think for the
last question I think it's because the
Apple brand is stronger than the beats
brand people are much more invested in
buying an Apple product than they aren't
buying a beat spot yeah that's true but
in terms of the beats acquisition itself
I think that ultimately it was they
bought it because they wanted to have a
music service and not necessarily
because they wanted to have the
headphones even though the headphones
are the thing that from the ground
running made it not a completely stupid
acquisition you know like you know the
actual thing that made money it actually
makes money it makes money well it
dominated the premium speaker premium
and so it wasn't like it was the sort of
like you know undercurrent it's like
okay that's a lot of money I think was
three
to buy meats it's a lot of money it's
the biggest acquisition Apple has ever
done but at least there's something in
there that actually makes money and so
yeah so I think that was sort of the
reason why beets didn't now and now you
know who knows whether and now they're
kind of like stuck with this like they
got their banana they've got Apple music
but like it just seems clear to me that
you know they don't have any like beets
related integration into this or like
they didn't even play ball anything like
these are beets woofers or something
like that it just means to me that like
they're they're just not emphasizing the
beets brand at all and like that I guess
shouldn't have surprised me but whatever
you don't let beets as a hardware brand
just continued trucking along the way
that it expanded more beyond what the
money makes scheme of yeah alright it's
good just a couple more quick ease in
here before we call it a day Jamie Young
is Siri going to be improved when home
pod is released I'm a google home user
recently purchased an iPhone trying to
get into the Apple ecosystem I can only
suffer to use Siri instead of Google you
gotta wonder is that going to be the
case will Siri actually stop being hot
garbage thank you and Michael Brown
because like when we all got Alexa in
her homes yeah and I mean all of us
pretty much yeah she had to learn she
had to get smarter she had experience if
they're basically kind of forcing that
into an Apple users home will then
inevitably actually improve the
performance of Siri due to more usage oh
definitely right like just just having
more interactions will definitely have a
didn't Apple promise though that's you
would get a whole bunch of new features
and upgrades yes yeah a lot of them are
gonna be music related so when you ask
for like specific you know artists or
titles or okay I think I think a lot of
those Syria additions are gonna be
related to playing music in your home or
like I want to hear symphony or I want
to hear jazz or whatever I don't think
that you're gonna see other stuff like
buying a Domino's Pizza ordering an uber
ride
that might come later but at least for
now really the third-party stuff that we
saw that they announced today are like
third-party messaging services like
whatsapp you'd be able to use Evernote
for like to-do lists it's very limited
and herds of what you can do with Alexa
or Google assistant alright we are right
down to the wire here you want to give a
quick shout out to dinosaur Dimas I'm
not sure if I'm pronouncing your name
right doing your homework good luck with
that in Indonesia our listener base is a
dog asks do you think Apple will make an
HQ - like Amazon I've been labeled at
that yeah I mean at this point they're
looking at you know Amazon's blueprint
not necessarily to do it publicly a bit
like they're saying how I cities are
just falling over themselves offering
money and tax benefits to to open a new
business they're open new campus like
why wouldn't Apple take advantage of
that yeah like that's really I mean it's
good PR and it's also good for like in
terms of like Tim Cook getting on
president Trump's good side we're
talking about jobs jobs jobs and Apple
you know Apple comes out with this
announcement like we're gonna bring new
jobs and create whatever we're bringing
a new facility in some city in America
jobs are always good they're not playing
it up the same way Apple organizations
is that they didn't label it HQ - I said
they're building a new US campus but I
think they're still gonna be like their
their mothership is still very much
gonna be in Cupertino oh yeah yeah I
mean like I said this is partly as much
PR as it is you know opening a facility
and you know taking advantage of
whatever tax benefits cities are gonna
throw at them I'm sure they're gonna be
pretty generous dead sprint to the
finish line here Scott Myatt do you
think that they will ever Apple will
ever open up Siri to other devices along
the road are their phone device I meant
imagine the opens since we see Alexa
performing with the Sonos do you think
series gonna start sneaking into other
place it's a good question it's great
question okay so it does work it will
the home pod will work with other smart
home gadgets so you'll be able to like
operate your thermostat right
you know you're connected lights because
obviously everybody expects to be able
to do that with a smart speaker I think
whether that's who
Siri actually moves from Apple it's not
a very Apple thing to do but we've seen
Google and Amazon already do that with
their assistants you don't know it's a
it's a good question and I don't really
see it right now but it's certainly
possible
it also will depend on how well these
you know Alexa and Google assistant
power devices actually sell right like
people bind them no one's buying them
because Alexa's in it right which one
like I don't know lights or
refrigerators or all these other
products you see with assistants
built-in like you're not that's not why
you're buying them yeah it's a value-add
right now for sure so I don't know if
Apple actually needs to alright and the
final question of the day coming from
our good friend Michael Brown I love
this do you think sleep tech should be
built into furniture beds lazy boys mmm
etc yes what the sleep tech is right I
mean what do we really have on the
market now we got things like there are
a lot of those are sensors the sensors
and timers only there's like sitting
there little speakers are like know when
delight when you're about to sleep in
either place soft music whoa that would
be cool if my couch did that hanging out
in the couch watching TV new stars like
those and the couch back and forth it's
like an award shows when the orchestra
starts playing smart couch like talk to
your netflix account like it noticed you
were binge watching stranger danger like
all right it's like seven episodes days
you probably gotta get some sleep and
like it boost you have a couch and a
brush your teeth that would be a very
jessica thing to do oh my god that is so
Jets and I would love that if I could
rush my teeth how much $10,000 Wow easy
easy and I would buy it tomorrow no
problem oh my goodness
alright we are just about out of time
and that's a some good food for thought
I'm going to literally sit around and
like draw what I wish trans and put it
on the fridge in the office that's more
stuff smart couches just tell you I'm
calling they're gonna sleep CES 2019
yeah we saw a bunch of the bed stuff
couches though it's a next frontier all
right
