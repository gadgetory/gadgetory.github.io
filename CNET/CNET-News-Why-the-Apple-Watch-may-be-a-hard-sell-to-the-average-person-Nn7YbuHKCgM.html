the Apple watch the time has finally
come first released this April cnet
senior editor Scott Stein has been
trying it out it's one of the most
feature-packed ambitious smart watches
but it's doing it at the expense of
elements like price and battery life
with prices ranging from several hundred
dollars for the sports version to
several thousand dollars for the 18
carat gold edition it may be a tough
sell to the average person it's really
up to people to decide whether they want
to spend three hundred fifty dollars to
seventeen thousand dollars on an
accessory or whether they just want to
stick with their phone the watch works
with newer iPhones it lets you stay
connected track your fitness play music
and use Apple pay as well as tap into
numerous apps it's really easy to send
texts audio messages make speaker phone
calls the fitness app in particular
seems pretty well thought out but the
battery only lasts a day while other
smartwatches can last up to seven days
it's less like a watch you'd wear every
single day without interruption and a
little more like a powerful computer
they've got to learn to charge more
while smartwatches aren't new they're
far from mainstream Apple's entry could
be a big boost to the market all of that
is going to make a lot of competitors
step up their game but it also may open
the door for a lot of lower priced
products with longer battery life if
you're thinking of getting one aside
from price and functionality here's
something to consider how you interact
with your phone whether you really want
to keep it in your pocket and use
something on your wrist instead for the
