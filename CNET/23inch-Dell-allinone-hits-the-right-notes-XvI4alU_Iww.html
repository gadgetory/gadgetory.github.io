today we're going to take a look at the
dell inspiron 123 30 so this is a fixed
configuration 1199 all-in-one from Dell
it's a 23 inch screen 19 by 10
resolution and as you can see it runs
Windows 8 so this is a touchscreen
it's got 10-point touch screen works
pretty well there's a little bit of drag
it's not as good as say an iPad or a
higher-end smartphone but it's good
enough for probably most of what you'll
do on the system
the stand is also less adjustable than
some other all the ones we've seen it
only lets you tilt the screen about 40
degrees back that's convenient if you
want to walk up and use it but we've
seen other all ones that lay down
entirely flat and this system does not
do that notice for the rest of the
system it's actually similarly
bare-bones
it has a core i5 CPU eight gigs of RAM a
one terabyte hard drive and an embedded
graphics chip from Intel so while it's
not a gaming PC by any stretch you can
certainly do most day-to-day
applications with no problem but looking
around the rest of the system there
aren't that many unique features here it
has a standard DVD drive so its core
specs are pretty straightforward for PC
in this price range and the rest of its
features aren't really that exciting
either there's some USB 3 ports and an
SD card slot here as long as some audio
jacks over the top there's a webcam you
can see it actually has a nice little
dial that lets you adjust the angle
that's useful but the one really
standout feature set are the ports in
the back of the system that give you a
nice array of audio and video inputs so
you can see there's all kinds of jacks
back here there's composite video HDMI
IN VGA in VGA out as well as an optical
digital audio output as well as a
standard digital audio jack now we've
seen HDMI in on plenty of other
all-in-ones but the VGA and the
composite video especially are really
rare for systems in this class so that's
nice it gives you some flexibility to
connect all kinds of devices to the Dell
including some older monitors or older
pcs so you know this could be sort of a
useful home entertainment hub if you
want to really turn it into that
otherwise the system doesn't really have
any of the unique our higher-end
features we've seen some on ones
there's no blu-ray drive there's no NFC
sensor there's no discrete graphics card
or super high resolution screen for the
most part this is just a straight ahead
commodity system and that's fine for its
price that's about all you can really
expect
so if you're interested in a touchscreen
all-in-one Windows 8 PC and you really
just want to straightforward computer
behind it this is a pretty great choice
and it's fairly priced so I'm rich Brown
this is the Dell Inspiron 123 3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
