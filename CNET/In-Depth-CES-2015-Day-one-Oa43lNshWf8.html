continuing coverage of CES 2015 on
Donald Bell this man is Jeff Bakalar and
welcome to CES in-depth we're going to
recap the major announcements from today
and even the minor announcements that we
found interesting today was the first
official day as CES 2015 let's jump
right into it Jeff let's get into it
let's get into home security systems I
don't own a home I know so you could you
could protect your hovel I can secure my
box right there was a bunch of home
security cameras like too many to list
here I just got to pick a few of the
tour the more interesting ones but
really like this I feel like CES today
could have just been defined by all the
home smart home technology that got
shoved out the business I feel like this
is the first year we're home automation
sort of stuff is permeating through that
mainstream red tape if you will yeah
last year we like every company kind of
came out with their their kit their dev
kit for with the Google system or the
apple/system right whatever it was that
people were going to adopt to make all
the smart stuff talk to the smart stuff
exactly to most people that's just like
why right but once you see products it
starts to make a little more sense well
if nothing else for ninety nine dollars
there is the guardzilla coming out at
best buy in just a few weeks it is a has
a cool name first of all it does it is a
security camera has night vision you can
just plop it down works over Wi-Fi it
works with iOS and Android to get a
glimpse of what's going on in at home I
don't think there's any subscription
service involved in it right it's good
to go out of the box I'm not thrilled
with the resolution it's like vga RS
it's pretty bad so it's it's like 2005
resolution but uh it's also not very
subtle like that's not a hidden camera
that's that is clearly a camera it's
like the fake home security box that you
put out
from your own right right the next one
is canary now Carrie we heard a lot
about last year was there's a big
IndieGoGo campaign for it got all the
all their funds raised for it but it is
only now just shipping it's a
crowdfunding story we hear time and time
again remember last year I'm really
excited about this thing while shipping
now one hundred ninety nine dollars you
get 720p video quality wide-angle camera
I can even sense like temperature
changes and moisture in your home a lot
smarter and at least the canary doesn't
look like a camera right right it looks
like a beverage warnimont sure it looks
looks cool absolutely you'd have no idea
another thing I like that's in that home
that smart home sphere was thus League
smashing Plaza schlag it could could be
sloshed I think it's schlosser if no
there's no accents on anything you may
okay you're reading into it this leg
sense it is one of the first Apple home
kit compliant items were seeing out yet
that's going to be iOS controlled
deadbolt right so you can say hey Siri
unlock my door and Syria will hopefully
do that or look it up for you hopefully
but it's cool to actually finally see
something coming out from that SDK yet
seem to generate less than a lukewarm
reception now you can trust Apple with
your deadbolt oh you're already doing it
with your credit cards in your life and
everything else might not let them have
the keys to your freaking huh don't
weigh hitch on this one is this
bluetooth only so the range on it you
got to be pretty close to your door it's
not gonna if it's not the the deadbolt
that you'd have to rent out your home on
Airbnb or something right exactly in
Mexico and say yeah sure go away but
isn't there some like Bluetooth kind of
works 30 to 50 feet right that's far
away from my front door I don't want
that unlocking a lot of these of a lot
of these are sold to like the people who
want to just have remote access to
unlock the door for renting out their
home daughter but that's that's part of
the market that there is something
exciting about leaving the house and
sort of just doing the remote beep like
you would your car like poopoo yeah
that's your
I'm into that all right so that that
covers a home security stuff that i
found interesting today that a lot of
our editors found wearables let's also
talk wearables again there were many
many many variables that got pushed out
today I didn't see too many that is that
interested I think 30,000 products
launched today you can buy any of these
30,000 and the wearables sphere it felt
like a lot of Fitbit clones sure got
shown off today but there was the
Martian guests connect SmartWatch now
Martian we've seen a couple they're
smart watches before Scott Stein's been
a fan they are big and chunky but they
look beautiful yeah they're they're bit
chunky is a very good adjective and they
you know they resemble the most sort of
traditional wristwatch at your you know
with with a hand and minute hour you
know sort of yeah minute and hour hand
what smart about them is a very kind of
just a fine little screen down the
bottom but they can connect over
bluetooth to your phone they can do a
lot of the same capabilities you you
look for in a high-end SmartWatch but
they keep it keeps it classy so what is
there something special about the guest
connect or is it just the next one it's
the next one it can act as a remote
shutter for your camera right if you
want it to I know that one thing that
has shown up oh that's good because
there's always like one instance where
you'd need that where you just have your
camera on the tripod and you're over
here you're like oh that's gonna work
out good little spy finger right I think
so phono kaufman aside then you're
talking to you know dr. no and you're
secretly taking photos is that like a
what kind of references of a shark tank
Oh Sees dance mom reference James Bond
reference alright sorry whatever man
it's not hockey no I i know i only
understand hockey it's nice to see them
expanding their horizons with a whole
sort of new palette of design choices
and stuff they only had like one or two
I think before and hey they've got
enough money to make more so you know
this for sure but I have to suspect that
this is one of those smartwatches that's
gonna last a little bit longer on a
charger is there's less scream to have
the power right right says the all
scream giant watches that seem to last
about a day sure sure all right now
speaking of wearables for the first time
this year CES is expanded a lot and
taken over the entire sands expo center
across town known this week Aztec West
we've got our own Sharon Profis Yosemite
Sam tech West I'm sorry I haven't been
there I just I picture this sawdust on
the ground which is a flea market that's
what it is it's like the flea market or
so yeah we're live at Tech west where
the show floor is full of entrepreneurs
who are hungry get to get attention
about their new products we have
everything from wearables to robotics a
3d printing and the show is such a big
deal over here this year that seen it of
course had to be a part of it we have
our own booth at tyco West it's petite
but it's got a lot of manpower the point
of it is that entrepreneurs can come
through pitch their product and then we
can decide whether or not they're worthy
of you getting a little bit of attention
on cnet so behind me lexi is showing a
smart Wi-Fi connected thermostat that's
only forty nine dollars so its
innovations like this that we want to
show off here at Tech West small
companies emerging technologies worthy
of some attention one of the companies
that I was super impressed with this
year is called Toby Toby isn't new but
they have some of the most accomplished
I tracking technology they're working to
build it into gaming but they're also
working to build it in
new computers so that every laptop has
this eye tracking technology built into
it for gaming for even doing things like
opening folders all you have to do is
stare at the folder and a couple seconds
later it'll open so as are you playing a
game okay this guy just finished
calibrating his eyes so now what they're
going to do is launch a game and he's
going to be able to control it entirely
with his eyes when you're doing this it
actually feels a little bit like mind
control because so as you can see he
needs to get the targets the red dots
are good texts are bad and here we go
let's turn around Charlie this guy has
got it going look he's just standing
there it's insane so he's just looking
at the screen and the tracking
technology is so fast so accurate and
this game is a really good example of it
or
Oh
what do you think it's cool yeah that's
cool it's whatever so I were just
awesome technology okay guys stay tuned
we'll be back with more CES in-depth
after a very quick break all right
welcome back to tes in-depth let's get
right to today's news now one other
treat I saw today came from dome know
our senior editor for all networking
data storage technology he got a
hands-on look at USB type-c or USB 3.1
and it's a new connection standard that
works a lot like a lightning cable where
it can work both ways USB can finally be
flipped around upside yeah no matter
what you're not having to plug it in the
wrong way first and then plug it in the
right wait a while yeah what took a long
time now and the best part is you've got
better connection speed so it's what is
it 10 I believe it's ten and gigabits
per second so twice the speed of what we
can currently get so it but does it look
like it it's got to be like a hybrid II
sort of look in USB thing right like in
terms of like what the interface itself
looks like it just sort of it doesn't
matter just like slides into one or the
is this it's this slipping is this kind
of universal little connector here it
really looks a lot like the inversion of
a lightning connector like it still is
ready and surround it so yeah yeah not
just like a card you slip in right so
Emma sighs already committed to making a
laptop a gaming laptop with a with USB
type-c kind of like three point oh
that's barely had its day yet you know
you're living in the past yeah I guess
3.1 is the future this is a big deal to
me I do a lot of transferring yeah with
between me now is gonna be faster yes so
the takeaway here is faster USB what I
understand is I think it's confusing to
the general sort of public once you
change what USB looks like especially
with the fact that three-point 0 is
compatible has a whole legacy
compatibility thing when you pipe in 31
then it changes everything I know it's a
weird thing to be a set of this may be
the mobile connection standard for it
just like a like a
USB you know micro USB standard but all
right it's I'm excited for USB to
finally be able to flip around do some
gymnastics it's it no longer will you oh
and you never get it right on the first
shot it's always a hot I think your best
casting is always wrong and they even
sometimes some of them have like little
dots on them to feel your way around and
there but it doesn't work no doesn't I'm
sorry we write we have real problem in
the in the PC world we also saw the dell
XPS 13 an eight-hundred-dollar Windows
machine that we're very excited about it
looks like it's a solid machine it's a
pretty impressive machine it's got a
3200 by 1800 quad HD display which I
mean kind of seems wasted on a 13 inch
screen nevertheless it's what they claim
to be the smallest 13-inch laptop ever
ever ever ever not these knock the earth
no yeah so we'll see how that pans out
um but yeah it looks super thin and you
know I've played around with a lot XPS
machines they're really solidly built
and we'll see how it pans out alright
yeah you also put in here the razor
Forge TV right this is the harder one I
feel to describe but this is tough
because it's it's it's sort of there's
many different sort of branches to this
they have a micro console that will go
for a hundred dollars and the greatest
thing first off the fact that razors
actually gonna release up like teasing a
product that's going to come out knock
on wood all you want this thing is
coming out they've sworn up and down to
us it's going to be an Android micro
console obviously it's going to come in
around the size of a s what is that like
an apple TV sort of size you can hook up
a wireless razor controller to it play
android games but then they're sort of
entering the idea of streaming pc gaming
through a service that will not really
limit itself to something like only from
at a steam or like what end video has
been doing with their shield stuff this
is going to play nicely with any kind of
game that you might be playing on your
pc so if you're playing on origin or
through steam whatever its console
is in your home where I mean are the the
gaming pcs in your home right but maybe
in a different room and you want to get
your TV that's sort of what it sounds
like they're going after okay I again
it's tough i've played around with the
shield a lot the Nvidia shield and it
just something doesn't feel a hundred
percent right yeah uh you know your get
your place shifting stuff it's the
latency is a big issue so I have to see
how this goes you're going to need a
pretty dope router it to make it plainer
that the gaming the android gaming alone
hasn't been able to take off I feel like
with no II and the other systems we've
seen right no one remembers that thing
and there's really not too many games as
a few here and there couple of diamonds
in the rough but android gaming as a
platform when it opposed to pc stuff in
console it's just not there yet we also
saw some some silly phones or maybe
amazing to somebody grabbing that the
greatest phone so far CES has been like
that LG G flex 2 right yeah people are
some real flagship phone which is a rare
sight at CES then there's the other
phones the Lamborghini 88 Tori Tori yeah
that's her a six thousand dollar android
phone wrapped in leather emblazoned with
the Lamborghini logo what what you're
not gonna get one probably not for me
and apparently it's not even that well
SPECT like it it's running like KitKat
that's not the fastest processor around
it breaks down a lot on the side of the
road yeah but if you are really into
having flashy overpriced things this is
what out like I was the flashy guy
that's like I want a really high-end old
Android Lamborghini brand your phone
this is weird it's gotta be Lamborghini
collectors I can't imagine you're buying
this phone if you got a VW golf Victor
driving around no no it's a way outdated
version of KitKat but it's 6 grand so if
you're spending six grand on a phone you
don't care about which version of
androids popping on that thing but a
going on the same vein of brand power we
also saw the Kodak I m5a 249 smart phone
geared towards seniors really bare bones
bones best so many jokes to me like it
uses film writer than use it doesn't
useful no you don't a developing you
have to wind it after each photo no but
apparently house like a back door where
like tech support can can take over your
phone and actually troubleshoot any
problems you might have with it this is
what the jitterbug wished it could have
been it does have like a quick button
for ordering prints from the photos he
takes it really does so is integrated
print delivery solution for taking the
photos on your phone and then not
knowing what to do is a button that
calls your grandson and he picks you up
and brings you in jewelry and that's how
that works it could be but it exists
yeah all right so that about does are
those are the the highlights of the best
tech our editors have uncovered today
day one a CES 2015 but let's not forget
about all the press day announcements
