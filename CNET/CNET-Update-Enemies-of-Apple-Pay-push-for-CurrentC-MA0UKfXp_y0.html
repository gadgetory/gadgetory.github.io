technology consumers lose I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update Apple
pushed mobile payments forward when it
launched Apple pay a week ago but now
several retailers are pushing back and
blocking the service from being used in
stores over the weekend pharmacy chains
Rite Aid and CBS have turned off the
technology that was used for Apple pay
and Google Wallet customers with
smartphones that had NFC chips could
just tap a sensor to pay at the register
the sensors were suddenly deactivated to
promote a competing service called
currency but this isn't just a drugstore
fight about 50 major retailers are
supporting currency including chain
restaurants Airlines gas stations and
grocery stores walmart and bestbuy are
the top stores leaving the battle using
currency isn't as quick as Apple pay
because it doesn't require an NFC chip
you have to unlock your phone open up a
nap and then scan a QR code at the
register now there are a few reasons
that retailers rather use currency over
Apple pay stores can track your shopping
habits with data on what you buy and the
app would incorporate coupons and
loyalty card programs Apple pay keeps
your purchases and anonymous and it
doesn't work with points programs now
saving money on coupons is nice but it's
a shame that stores are taking sides by
blocking already installed NFC
technology from customers with different
stores using different systems consumers
will be confused and it will slow
progress for this technology and to add
to the drama currency doesn't even
launch until next year in other news
amazon has a brand new way to stream
video to your television for cheap it's
called the fire TV stick this plugs into
the HDMI port on the back of your TV and
when you set up a Wi-Fi connection you
have access to Amazon's library of shows
and movies it also can be used for a few
other services like Netflix Hulu or
streaming music but it does not have HBO
Go amazon already has the streaming fire
TV box and that costs a hundred dollars
but this stick seems to be a better deal
at forty dollars but if you have prime
you can buy one for
he bucks and that price is only until
early Wednesday morning it ships
november nineteenth Fitbit also unveiled
three new fitness tracking wristbands
there's the charge HR and the surge both
which have all day heart rate tracking
but these won't come out until next year
the only new one out in time for the
holidays is a simpler model called the
Fitbit charge and it costs 130 dollars
and speaking of holiday shopping
Microsoft lowered the price of all xbox
one models by fifty dollars until the
end of the year starting Sunday you can
get the xbox one for three hundred and
fifty dollars that your tech news update
