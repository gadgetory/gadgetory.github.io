the Sydney Harbour Bridge lights up with
LEDs controlled by you on the ground in
the harbour cruise ships and ferries
also have LED lights that change color
depending on their location
I'm Lexy CBDs foreseen it let's go take
a closer look at the tech behind the
scenes there are two thousand one meter
LED tubes we have 140 high output LED
cans 1.1 kilometers of fiber optic
cabling we've got eight point five
kilometers of six cabling three and a
half kilometers of power cabling nine
hundred and fifty meters of three-phase
twelve distros and twenty thousand cable
ties we're running about
the way that we determine what color our
boat goes when it's in a certain zone is
we just have a simple gps chip which
determines a location to within
approximately 5 meters and then we have
a table which simply decides which color
is which for those different areas of
the harbor
so the go below board is a development
board that's been designed by Intel and
what this is it's the first x86 based
processor to fit into the Arduino
ecosystem the Arduino ecosystem is
fantastic in terms of accessibility for
beginners there's a ton of documentation
out there and plenty of people have
written libraries that make it really
easy to use
we've actually built a custom PCB that
is what's called a shield on Arduino
board and what that does is it provides
us with a gps chip which can interface
through the standard arduino
input/output systems and allow us to use
sort of standard libraries that already
exist in terms of testing I had a few
sort of odd nights where I was driving
around my suburb in a car lift up five
about 200 LEDs and making quite a
spectacle of myself I would say
