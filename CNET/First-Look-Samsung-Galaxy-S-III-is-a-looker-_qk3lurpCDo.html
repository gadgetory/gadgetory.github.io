here at CTIA 2012 in New Orleans where
I've got in my hands the Samsung Galaxy
s3 devices and these are the world phone
so they are unlocked they come in two
colors marble white and pebble blue but
I think it looks a little bit gray
myself so we're gonna take a look at
this phone so this is quite a large
phone it's got a really sleek and glossy
surface on it feels really nice in the
hand conforms really well just feels
really good to hold the screen is rather
large it's four point eight inches here
it's got an HD display so it's HD super
amoled it's pretty the colors are sharp
it looks really nice and it makes other
sites look really nice when you're
looking at them so it really shows off
websites movies photos and the works so
it does run Android 4.0 Ice Cream
Sandwich on here that is the latest and
it comes with a lot of fun apps on it a
lot of things that Samsung added so
there's something on here called s voice
which is sort of like a cereal like
presentation and adds a couple of
enhancements to an app that already
existed with voice commands hi galaxy
you can talk to it you can program in
some commands for instance what's the
weather like and it will return those
results for you so there is a little bit
of a limit it's into what you can say
but it is a pretty fun thing that I
think a lot of people are going to like
using there's also an app on here called
AllShare Play and if you load all share
onto other devices like your computer or
other phones then you'll be able to
connect to them and see their content
send your content over there as well so
there are many other sharing apps on
here as well
for example you can go into the camera
select a photo and when you share that
photo you will be able to share it to
group cast which is related to all share
than anybody else who has the group cast
app right now just sim side
galaxy s3 phones will be able to get
your picture as well
other camera software on here that gets
a makeover or we get first shot and we
get HDR on here plus there's some
sharing as well there's also something
on here called s beam which is a lot
like Android Beam except that it's been
enhanced so you can now share files as
well as URLs for internet sites and apps
basically just tap the phones together
press to beam and you can send your file
let's talk about some of the phones
other features it's got a 1.9 megapixel
camera up front and that also captures
720p HD video on the back there's an 8
megapixel camera that captures 1080p HD
video there's also a flash here under
the hood it runs a 1.4 quad-core Samsung
Exynos 4 processor so that's going to be
really fast speeds this is the global
version we're not sure what its gonna be
for the US yet so actually there's gonna
be a lot of variation on capacity at
least with this global version and will
come in either 16 gigabytes 32 or 64
gigabytes and there's even room for a 64
gigabyte card for external storage so
this phone is coming to the UK first
that's going to be May 29th and there's
no pricing yet an LTE ready version
should be coming to the u.s. sometime
this summer so taking a first look at
both colors of the samsung galaxy s3 for
CNET I'm Jessica's all court here at
CTIA 2012 you can take a full look at
these phones and all other coverage at
