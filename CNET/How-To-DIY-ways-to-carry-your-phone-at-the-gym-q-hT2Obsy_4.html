trying to get in shape you know that
your phone is your best workout buddy
with all the apps for tracking your
fitness getting free workouts and free
tools like timers you're going to want
this by your side at all times
I've seen people do everything from
shove their phone in their sports bra to
putting it in their waistband or just
holding it in their sweaty hands while
they workout that's gross
instead I have a few better solutions
for storing your phone while you work
out including a couple of Duty Yourself
solutions the most obvious and expensive
solution is a dedicated armband for your
phone they usually cost about twenty to
thirty bucks and involve an elastic and
some sort of case but that can be a
problem because every time you use that
armband you need to remove your phone
from its original case and put it in
this one instead over time that will
damage your case plus it's just annoying
to do so instead of buying one of these
you can make your own armband out of a
sock to make this armband just grab an
old tube sock you have at home the tube
part needs to be at least eight inches
so it can accommodate your phone then
grab a pair of scissors and cut off that
tube part now turn the tube inside out
so that the decorative part is facing
outwards when you wear it now slip it on
your arm fold it in half and place your
phone in the pocket as you can see it's
pretty secure you can't access the
screen but you can plug in your
headphones listen to your favorite music
or follow along to a workout app now
there is one more solution it's created
by a company called under fuse which
started on Kickstarter it's actually an
iron-on pocket that you can add to your
existing workout gear eight bucks gets
you one pocket and twenty bucks
- three of these guys it works best on
tight-fitting clothing like these shorts
place a pocket where you want it to go I
recommend putting it on the front thigh
area of your pants or shorts then set
your iron to the cotton setting which
should be medium or high and you want to
iron just the edges of the pocket not
that stretchy material it'll take you
about a minute for the pocket to
completely adhere make sure you get all
the edges and the corners because you
don't want your phone falling out while
you're working out when you're done wait
about 10 minutes to let the pocket cool
and then you'll be ready to use your new
shorts or pants now with my under fuse
on my shorts I can put my phone in the
pocket and work out without having my
phone get in the way so as you can see I
can move around freely while the pocket
keeps my phone nice and secure while I
work out this is my favorite solution
but try any of these tips and figure out
which one works best for you if you have
any questions hit me up on Twitter or
