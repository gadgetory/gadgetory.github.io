brand new Mac Mini in one of my recent
videos I showed you how to replace the
hard drive in Mac Mini model from 2009
and earlier a number of you have reached
out to me about the process for newer
models like this one believe it or not
Apple actually made it a lot easier to
swap out the hard drive and even the
memory to get the job done you'll need a
replacement 2.5 inch hard drive or
solid-state drive and also a t6 and t8
screwdriver as always be sure to work on
a static free surface like this wood
table and to discharge any electrostatic
build-up before handling any internal
components you should also transfer your
old data to your new hard drive using a
program like time machine or superduper
which can be used to clone your old
drive to start flip the Mac Mini over
and remove the black cover by twisting
it counterclockwise if you're only
interested in replacing the computer's
memory simply spread the clips that keep
the memory sticks in place and swap them
out to access the hard drive we need to
remove the three t6 screws that keep the
fan in place gently lift the fan out of
the case and remove the cable connect it
to the motherboard on the left hand side
you'll see a plastic cover this is held
in with a t6 screw that is located right
over here remove the screw and shimmy
the cover out of the case once that's
done we remove the antenna grow by
unscrewing 48 screws
be careful when lifting the girl out of
the mackaninee because the attach to the
case the hard drive is located under the
antenna grill before popping it out you
must disconnect the drive from the
motherboard once you've got it out
remove the 2 t8 screws from the side of
the drive and screw them into your new
one gently peel the black protective
cover off the drive remove the connector
and attach them both to your new drive
getting the drive back into the Mac Mini
can be tricky if you look there are two
slots the screws sit in you want to make
sure the screws are in the top two slots
and not the bottom try using a pair of
tweezers or another small tool if you
are having trouble after getting the
drive in place don't forget to reattach
the connector to the motherboard
replace the 48 screws
and then antennae grow followed by the
plastic guard and the t6 screw that
keeps it in place reconnect the fan to
the motherboard and secure it in with
the three t6 screws then just simply
replace the cover and turn it clockwise
to lock it in for more information check
out my article on how to Nazi Hakam as
always feel free to reach out to me on
Twitter with any questions or comments
I'm dan Graziano foreseen it and that's
how you replace the hard drive end
memory in the aluminum mackaninee thanks
