thermostat in the CNET smart home but
let's revisit that topic shall we
picture this I'm sitting in the CNET
smart home writing I don't know probably
something brilliant and I want to turn
the temp down to degrees by my phone on
me great
I changed the temp and I'm done now
let's say I don't have my phone on me
time to turn to voice controls Alexa
turn down the thermostat
let's see how it plays out with the Nest
Learning Thermostat there I am again
writing the next Pulitzer winner it's
too hot
reach for my phone it isn't there
there's echo fantastic Alexa turn down
the thermostat to degrees but it's a
nest thermostat so that command won't
work so I stopped writing I open up if I
make a recipe as a go-between for nest
and Alexa but I'll have to set up a
different recipe for each separate
temperature I want then I have to use
the exact phrase trigger the thermostat
to some exact except I don't remember
what temperature I have it set to I just
know I want it down to the grease I have
to just suck it up get up walk over to
the thermostat and do it manually now
let's see that same scenario with the
Eco be three smart thermostat there's me
I'm riding it's amazing to hot reach for
the phone it's not there eka Alexa turn
down the thermostat to degrees and I'm
done back to my masterpiece they could
be voice commands with Alexa earn to
ative and they don't require if does it
go between which makes the whole process
fast it could be also comes with motion
sensors so say I'm writing my
masterpiece in the family room the
thermostat in the hallway
isn't going to forget I'm home and set
the temp to a win this is all a long way
of saying that the nest is out and the
eco bees in with better voice controls
and motion sensing in the room where
I'll actually be present the Eco b3 is
our choice for the CNET smart home
