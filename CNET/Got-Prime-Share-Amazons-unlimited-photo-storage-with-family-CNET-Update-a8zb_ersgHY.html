to the whole family amazon has added a
new feature to the prime photo service
it's called the family vault which lets
a prime account holder invite five other
people to share unlimited photo storage
everyone also gets five gigs of storage
for video and other files for free now
I'm sure some of you with prime
subscriptions are watching this and
thinking wait I didn't even know I had
unlimited photo storage well yeah that's
one of the many perks of the $100 yearly
Prime membership you'll find all of this
inside the Amazon Photos app and you can
also manage your photos from the web on
amazon.com / photos everyone you invite
has a private backup of photos and they
can choose which ones are shared with
the group in the family vault the idea
is that it makes it easier to share
photos especially for things like a
family vacation so everyone can quickly
access the photos and order prints or
books of what they want Amazon even lets
you make special cards with the photos
and delivery is free for Prime members
there's another perk instead of
scrolling to find the photo you want
Amazon is able to use image recognition
so you can type in a keyword to find
photos with a specific object or person
it's similar to how you could search
images on google photos but that's not
all that's new at Amazon the company is
also launching a new type of Kindle
paperwhite it's called the manga model
targeting fans of the Japanese graphic
novels you can find this version on the
Japanese Amazon site it has eight times
more storage than the normal paperwhite
which can get you about 700 volumes of
manga it also has a better processor so
it can load those graphic heavy pages
faster meanwhile Amazon rival eBay is
also busy trying new things to stay
ahead of the competition such as
creating shopping BOTS for facebook
Messenger yeah
now you can chat with the eBay shop bot
as if you didn't have better things to
do with your time tell it what you're
looking for and it will pull up some
suggestions or at least it will attempt
to I tried searching for a Pikachu baby
costume and it pulled up some adult
inflatable elephant costume that's a big
fat nope but thanks for trying shopbot
that
for your tech news update I'm Bridget
Carey stay on top of all of the biggest
stories at cnet.com slash an update</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
