and a human hamster wheel plus our
special guest miss jessica dual-core hey
guys all that a moron crave hey guys
welcome to crave the show where all
things cool have been happening in tech
we talk about it right here and you can
check out our blog at crave cnet com
because that's where you'll find all the
things we talked about today so Jessica
things coming back it's great to be here
again all right now one of the items
that I checked out on a crave blog was
this cyborg gaming keyboard and it has
these three LEDs behind it that are
different colors you can blend them and
have the keyboard look have a different
backlight technical it has like metal
caps for the keys if you're like too
rough on it but I think it just kind of
looks like Darth Vader's like chess box
but does it talk to you in that tinny
voice it futuristic it doesn't it's
pretty much just a really nerdy device
oh okay well perfect for you thank you
the second thing I've got is from a
company called Brando it's called the
ultrasmart cable it is a cell phone
strap that doubles as a USB charging
cable now there are bunch of these on
the market John Chen from cnet Asia
found this one what makes it extra cool
is that it's also got a microSD slot so
you can store data and also sync between
your phone and the computer that is
extra that's only 14 bucks and I totally
wouldn't use it I got something cooler
so on a crave blog there's this clothing
with LED lights basically it's for
bicyclists at the moment and it has an
accelerometer in the in the clothing
that talks to these LEDs and so if
you're going really fast it's green as
you're slowing down these three lights
like on the cuff turn yellow and then
when he's stopping it turns red I think
that's the best thing for the club yeah
well okay let's say we take this
technology into dating yeah I think it
would help guys out if girls wore this
clothing but it wasn't like
accelerometer base would be like green
like yeah baby talk to me yellow like
slow your roll I don't know what color
it is right now for you and me and I
read like stop that now if you applied
that tech to there it's kind of cool
that would definitely you know help you
out now we always have trivia for you
guys and this week jessica has the
question what was the final sound
effects you heard and last week's do not
crave good one now what's really cool
about it is this
if you're the 10th person email us at
driving me crazy at cnet com check what
we got for you we have the sansa fuze
mp3 player we're not messing around
we're going big this time so email us
and you might be a winner and now it's
time for a segment that you guys all
love you know what's coming do not crave
converging technologies like cell phones
and watches are already happening but
what about converting different aspects
of your life well that's what turn on is
trying to accomplish this hamster wheel
contraption claims to be economical with
space and the idea is to roll the wheel
into the position you need for a
particular room or setting so a kitchen
check bedroom you got it now part of the
wheel is a wet cell that's proposed to
house the bathroom toilet and shower are
you for reals like do you really want to
use the bathroom and then rotate in a
heating up mom's leftover meatloaf no
you don't this idea is definitely
thinking outside the box but come on now
we just got to say do not quite all
right what do you think about that
absolutely disgusting so you do the shoe
and then you eat is that cool with you
okay you know I think I wouldn't buy
that yeah that's like nightmare ikea
yeah it's gross as long as you don't
have to assemble it i think it's alright
alright thanks for coming on the show
awesome thank you next time right
alright cool but only if I get one of
those cool accelerometers okay yeah
that'll that will help me now you guys
