product in a year isn't what you would
call a revolution after reports that the
company was quote dysfunctional and the
departure of co-founder Tony Fadell Nest
is releasing its first ever outdoor only
camera the nest cam outdoor that's the
official name will go for $200 when it's
released this fall and feature a 130
degree field of view 1080p camera
two-way talk night vision and some more
it's basically a lot of the same stuff
the current indoor cameras can do but
now the Wi-Fi only camera is housed in a
casing that can withstand the elements
it will also come with a magnetic
backing and 25-foot power cable and
don't worry if you don't have anything
magnetic to mount it on included is also
a standard bracket the one really
interesting software feature that the
outdoor cam is boasting though is facial
recognition technology which should
allow for the camera to tell the
difference between a person and say a
passing car but not the difference
between actual people users will have
all the same access to the cameras feed
via their phones and computers and can
pay more for premium monitoring services
just like the current nest pricing setup
