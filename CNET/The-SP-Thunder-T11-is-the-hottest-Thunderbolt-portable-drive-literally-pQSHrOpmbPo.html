t11 a purple drive from silicon power
let me go see the point in before you
steal my thunder this is the small it
thunderball / bow dr on the market in
fact it's so small it has a different
name that is SSD palm drive and that's
because well it fits right on the pump
just like that it was so very very light
it's about two ounces now the case is
made of aluminum and on the inside come
with hundred twenty gigabyte of
solid-state storage not huge but not too
bad either considering how small this is
now over here it has a 1 a thunderbolt
port and that's all you need to make it
work it also come with this very short
Thunderbolt cable right here that's a
great thing because considering how
small this is you don't want to use the
standard six-foot-long cable-- like this
that'll be kind of ridiculous right now
the cable here is all you need to make
it work just plug it into this port like
this and connect to my computer and then
you are done that's because the drive
here is bus power meaning the cable take
care of both power and data at the same
time now when plugged in this drive here
takes about 10 or 15 minutes to start
being very smart like me that's right
hot that is but in this case that's very
bad things now it's not hard enough for
you to cook an eggs on it but it is hard
and I cannot rest my finger on it for
more than 10 seconds and I do have very
thick skin it gets even harder in
operation so after about 30 minutes even
I would hesitate to touch it that's how
heartaches now the heat is that might
not be a huge deal but unlike me the
harder it gets the worse it performs and
for that reason the score fluctuated
hugely from between 230 megabyte per
second to choose 60 megabytes per second
so generally you can enjoy its fast
performance for about 10 or 15 minutes
before you start to get very hard and
slows down significantly and that means
you can use this one here for some quick
copy job on the go or when at home this
is a good drive to have for two hundred
thirty dollars but you cannot expect to
use it for a long time on ends unless
you want to put a backs of eyes on it
now if i move the drive here check out
my full review etsy.com but trust me
under
our knees don't go around touching
things or people to find out it might
get hurt and then you can't get away by
saying and that because I'm don't know
and this has been the first look as the
Thunder t11 purple drive from silicon
power</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
