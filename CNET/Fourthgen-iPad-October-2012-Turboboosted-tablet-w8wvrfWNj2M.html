IPAN odors I've unfortunate news yes
there is a new iPad a fourth generation
iPad and what does that mean well it
does seem that in one calendar year
we've made two generational leaps
instead of one and if you bought a third
gen iPad I'm sorry because you don't
have the cutting-edge iPad anymore if
you have not bought an iPad it's
actually really good news because this
is an improvement over the third gen
iPad at least in terms of the processor
there's an a6 X instead of an a5 X and
what does that mean well the last I
phone the iPhone 5 made a leap from an
a6 from an a5 previously and it was
about double the speed and so far using
this that seems to be the case here too
the system boots faster apps load faster
even games play faster on it for the
most part this looks exactly the same as
the other one it still has a 2048 by
1536 Retina display and has the same
thickness the same weight comes in black
and white on the street you couldn't
tell them apart and they feel pretty
similar now there are a few key
differences one there is the lightning
connector so that these are all part of
the same iOS family the other difference
with the new fortune iPad is that
there's an HD front-facing camera it
takes crisper FaceTime videos shoot 720p
and crisper still photos of yourself is
it the iPad 2 get now that's the
question because now there are two iPads
there's the fourth gen and those there's
this little iPad Mini floating around
which is incredibly convenient very
light and very fun to use now I imagine
these are going to be two very different
use cases because the iPad Mini really
feels almost like a Kindle or a book and
it has an iPad 2's guts inside
essentially but you don't really notice
that if you're caring about reading or
video playing now the 4th gen iPad this
thing is a powerhouse and it's the
fastest iOS device that's on the market
right now it eclipses the iPhone 5 and
it provides the best combination of
power and performance for those who want
that this is the way to go if you're a
pro user if you're using this for
photography or if using this for video
editing if you're using this as a laptop
alternative
and the fortune iPad is the way to go
and if you were thinking about buying an
iPad before if you're on the fence if
you were waiting to see well then this
is absolutely the right time to get it
because let's face it I don't really
know when the next iPad is going to come
out now would that happen sooner or
later odds are that would be later and
this iPad now is the iPad for a
considerable time and starting at $4.99
the same as before for 16 gigs going up
to 32 and 64 gigs and with additional
LTE capabilities you know it matches the
price that we've seen before LT is a
little bit different this now works
better internationally whereas a third
gen iPad did not and that could be part
of the reason why this is going to be a
lot more appealing globally for markets
that weren't able to use LTE before so
why all of a sudden everybody suddenly
get a little less excited about the
large iPad well I think the iPad Mini
has a lot to do with it because it's an
exciting new design but let's not forget
that earlier this year this was the
premier tablet to get and still is
because of its act collection and
because of its performance and the
faster processor means this is a better
product all around this is an
improvement on the third gen iPad
although it's really not enough to
consider buying for that upgrade but if
you haven't bought an iPad before and
we're looking for a new fast one the 4th
gen is absolutely the one to get on the
other hand if you want something that's
more portable something that's maybe
your second iPad even or something
that's more affordable go for the iPad
Mini it's a difficult decision to make
but I think it's really about
portability versus performance this time
with the two new iPads that are on the
market I'm Scott Stein and that's a look
at the new fourth-generation iPad from
Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
