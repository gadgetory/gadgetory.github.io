we're walking let's go
clever girl so you want to be a Raptor
trainer it's not gonna be easy but if
you have the patience and discipline to
learn well it's a lot of fun say hello
to Mattel's newest robot toy alpha
training blue this is a fully
interactive Velociraptor that you
control and trained just like Chris
Pratt's character in the new jurassic
world movies this is one advanced Roy in
fact the lead designer told me this is
the most complex toy Mattel has ever
made seven motors give fluid realistic
animation to the neck and head while
also letting you walk it around it's
very responsive to controls and it has
the same Raptor grunts and squawks from
the movie blue likes being petted she
has touch sensors under her jaw and on
the top of her nose she also has a
microphone and can direct her attention
to where she hears a sound there are a
few ways to play she's got different
modes that you switch between indicated
by lights on the controller you can move
her like a puppet and be in complete
control
look how her neck moves with how I hold
the controller you can even shift her
eyes and there's fine control of the
eyelids driving mode is pretty smooth
too there's also a guard mode motion
sensors will alert you when someone
comes close so you can make her move to
scare them off
or you can enter training mode to teach
her to obey your commands with how you
click and move the controller and this
is the real fun of the toy you're not
staring at a screen you're studying
combos of flicks and your clicks and
watching for her to respond yes like any
good trainer you have to toss her a
treat when she does well you click the
treat button and she'll follow your hand
until you toss her an imaginary snack
blue this one's for you the more you
train the more she levels up and the
more she'll follow your command but she
can never be trained a hundred percent
the designers purposefully made sure of
that because hey she's a wild animal ok
playing with blue reminds me of plane of
video game where you have to study and
practice your combo moves I had to
master the combo of clicks and flicks
with my wrists just right to pull off
the tricks the guide book gives you
hints but you still need to figure out a
lot yourself through trial and error a
short buzz and a red light will tell me
if I did it wrong it's not hard but it's
not so easy that you get bored and if
you do get bored and you put her in a
closet well then you're just a heartless
owner and she'll forget your training
over time there is an internal clock
inside and over the course of a month
she will start to forget her training if
you don't keep playing with her you can
get about an hour playtime out of it
before it needs a recharge but it seems
to recharge fast in under 30 minutes and
owners can download software updates if
needed with a USB connection which means
bug fixes and new tricks could be added
a girl egg blue doesn't come cheap as
you may have expected you can adopt her
for 250 dollars arriving in the fall
it's for ages 8 and up and it's the
coolest robot toy I've seen yet this
year to be honest it's just fun to play
with something so detailed and fluid
she'll do what you want but she can also
be a little bit unpredictable
ain't that right sweetie I'm just
kidding it's just a toy
hey guys thanks for watching so be sure
to subscribe and ring the bell to catch
other flim tech toys and let me know
what you think of me in the comments and
if you're hungry to see this kind of
interactivity brought two other toys
okay time to go bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
