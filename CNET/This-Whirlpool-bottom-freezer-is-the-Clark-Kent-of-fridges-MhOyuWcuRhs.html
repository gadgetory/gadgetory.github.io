get it but this one the whirlpool WRB 3
- 2 DM BB is actually a deceptively
interesting one now this is a $1400
bottom freezer fridge with the freezer
down below the fridge compartment cost
an extra hundred dollars if you want it
in stainless steel and there's not much
going for it on its cover it's very
basic looking and inside there aren't a
whole lot of features the only bells and
whistles of note here really the spill
proof shelves and the crisper humidity
sliders and the excess number of spots
to put those into our shelves into not a
lot to get excited about but take a look
at how well it performs here on this
heat graph we've got it at the default
setting and all those temperatures come
in nice and cold below 37 degrees you've
got 35 s and 34 s and thirty Six's none
of those temperatures are gonna freeze
your milk but they are gonna keep your
groceries nice and cold and if you look
at that graphed out the temperatures are
very steady whenever we open the doors
during the test temperatures only rose a
little bit couple degrees and then came
right back down these are all very very
good results very impressive performance
some of the best performance we've seen
from any fridge we've tested and that
includes models that sell for thousands
of dollars more than this now there are
things I don't like about this fridge -
especially these crisper drawers they're
really flimsy to the touch and they
rattle around if you pull them too hard
they come right out which is really
annoying I wish they did a better job
designing them that's really all there
is to talk about with this fridge like I
said not a lot of features not a lot to
talk about in the design but that
performance is so good I think you're
gonna want to put this at the top of
your list if all you need is an
unassuming icebox that does the job
exceptionally well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
