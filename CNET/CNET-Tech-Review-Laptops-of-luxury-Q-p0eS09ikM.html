laptops that will make MacBook Air
owners think twice how to keep your
deepest secrets from falling into the
wrong circle zon Google Plus find out if
it's time to dust off your blockbuster
card in a video rental prize fight and
let everyone know what disc you're
watching with get clue it's all coming
up right now
hi everyone I'm Molly wood and welcome
to the CNET tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer our own unique
tech wisdom in the form of the bottom
line let's start with the good if you're
among the extremely vocal minority that
think we spend too much time shoving
Apple products down your throats this
one's for you
although the MacBook Air is arguably the
prettiest laptop ever made a number of
notable specimens from the windows world
are available for a price
the MacBook Air it's helping make Apple
the hottest laptop maker on earth so
that begs one question isn't there
something else
I'm Brian Cooley with the top five
alternatives to a MacBook Air these are
all Windows machines by the way but
that's fair since the MacBook Air runs
Windows just fine through boot camp
number five is the Lenovo ThinkPad x1
now like most thing pads and unlike a
lot of other Windows laptops this guy
doesn't feel like it's made by Mattel
it's rock solid with a clean look and
Intel Core i5 CPU like some of the new
MacBook Airs solid-state drives
available and it has a webcam that works
really well in low light you won't
realize how much you'll like that until
you have it for all those little nasty
videos you shoot that I don't want to
see on the downside that solid
construction gives this 13-inch machine
kind of a porky weight about 3.8 pounds
versus 2.3 for the same size MacBook Air
and the battery life on this guy is
weaker as well number four the Dell XPS
15z this is the thinnest 15-inch Windows
laptop out there with an available full
1080p display to take advantage of that
big screen size and a nice metal case to
give you that luxury hand feel that
Apple MBAs have in spades now a MacBook
Air trait you won't get here is battery
life
we got a mere three and a half hours in
our video playback test compare that to
six and three quarters from the 13-inch
MacBook Air the sweet spot price for
this guy though is pretty good around
1,200 bucks
number three the toshiba portage a r 835
it's also powered by the Core i5 Intel
chip as a battery that lasts three hours
longer than the last model for a full
seven hours that's even nosing out the
13-inch MacBook Air also the price is
pretty good for this guy about 800 bucks
that's cheap for this class what it's
missing is sexy this is not a machine
you'll ever have to wipe any drool off
of number two is the samsung series 9
this little hottie has one thing even a
MacBook Air doesn't have an even more
outrageous price at 1650 list this
machine requires a commitment
and probably a second shift to pay for
it it's the most direct assault on the
MacBook Air though with the same weight
solid-state drive five and a half hour
battery life stylish lines and a really
good display and it's all powered by the
latest Intel Core i5 but you know even
for this money it doesn't quite have
that machine from an ingot feeling of
quality still it's hot but make sure you
shop aggressively for price if you're
gonna buy one of these always check the
links to the best merchants prices in
the CNET review okay here's the number
one ultra portable you want to carry
when you don't want to carry anything
with an Apple logo it's the Sony Vaio Z
thin light powerful blah blah blah
that's basically par for the course at
this point but two things set this guy
apart this interesting docking station
that graphs on an optical drive
including blu-ray ability a bunch of
extra ports and a dedicated AMD Radeon
66 30 graphics processor we've never
seen anybody create an ultra-light with
that kind of range that we'd actually
want to own oh the other big difference
it's a fortune a voz starts at 2 grand
well you asked for number 1 Dan Ackerman
and Scott Steiner are busy every week
digesting the latest ultra light laptops
and you're gonna want to find their
reviews at CNET's laptop review section
it's right there on the front door and
for more top 5s like this and links to
all the reviews of these machines go to
top-5 dot cnet.com i'm brian coulis
thanks for watching
or maybe you're not worried about thin
and light and portable maybe big and
thick skin hefty is more your speed
if that's the case Alienware has you
covered with the m18 X of beast of a
laptop that has all the bells and
whistles you're looking for plus pretty
flashing light I'm going to acronym we
are here taking a look at the brand new
Alienware and 18x now I'm sure you're
all familiar with these super high-end
gaming laptops that this dell subsidiary
puts out they've got the m11 X which is
an 11 inch laptop the 14 X - 15 X the 17
X so I think pretty much guess what's so
unique about the 18 X it is an alienware
with a massive 18 inch screen now it's
still got the same 1920 by 1080
resolution that the 17 and even some of
the 15-inch versions have you can't
really get much higher in a laptop
screen but just adding that little bit
of extra screen size really makes a
difference this is the ultimate sort of
home theater in your face laptop screens
like all alien where's this guy's super
configurable it starts at 2 grand this
particular version it's about $5,000 and
it comes with a quad core Intel Core i7
CPU it comes with 2 Nvidia 580 graphics
cards and 16 gigs of ram there are all
kinds of other options like for blu-ray
drives and solid state hard drive so you
can really spend a lot of money building
the perfect gaming laptop and of course
like all alienware is it's got that very
distinctive ailing whereas style that's
based on a couple of things it's got
these cool kind of automotive drills in
the front and it's got this backlit
keyboard and backlit touchpad and a
couple of other lights right here that
you can actually go in and adjust with
the alien FX software package that comes
with this it's got a couple of different
tabs within it the first is Alien FX and
that lets you actually change the color
of the backlighting underneath the
keyboard in four different sections and
of course the touch pad and the quick
launch buttons and even the Alienware
logo and the little lights in the front
you can actually just pick the section
you want to change let's say I want to
change my mind
make a different color
and I will make it blue and it just
changes on the fly and of course you can
set up all kinds of different weird
effects doing this
there's also alien fusion that's
basically a power management utility and
it goes through you know the same power
management options you can get through
Windows but dresses them up nicely and
gives you access to a whole bunch of
options that it may be hard to find when
you're just going through Windows and of
course this alien touch that controls
some of the options for the touch pad
you can change obviously the color of
the board of the touch pad the
sensitivity where the scroll bars are
for your finger and lastly you can
control the macro keys along the left
side of the keyboard you can again
change the background color and also
assign each key to something different
whether it's launching a program or
doing a particular combination of
buttons and again of course you're not
gonna go carrying this thing around in
your backpack or to the coffee shop it's
just too huge but if you do want to set
it up let's say in a dorm room or in a
den as your home entertainment center it
not only has an HDMI out jack it
actually has an HDMI in so you can
actually use this big 18 inch screen and
hook other things like game consoles and
blu-ray players or other devices up to
it of course if you're in the market for
nailing where you kind of already know
who you are this is not a laptop for
somebody who just wants to surf the web
and check their email it's really
designed around high-end PC gaming and
of course that's more than enough power
to do anything else a high-end PC user
would want to do like HD video editing
or anything like that of course you are
gonna pay dearly for the privilege but
at least you're gonna have a laptop
that's a little bit different than
everybody else I'm Dan Ackerman and that
is the Alienware
m 18x since that computer folds in half
I guess it is technically a laptop but
if you fork over the dough for that big
boy I'll be surprised if it ever leaves
your desk when it comes to controlling
your privacy on social networks like
Google Plus the golden rule is to not
post anything you don't want anyone else
to see but sometimes it's not that easy
luckily Sharon Vaknin has a few tips for
locking down your info in Google Plus
hey everyone I'm Sharon Vaknin for
cnet.com and today I'll show you how to
customize privacy settings for posts
photos and your profile on Google+ the
main feature that sets Google+ apart
from Facebook is circles which lets you
selectively post to different people you
need to know a few things about how this
works first any posts you make public
are indexed by Google so anyone who
searches for your name or something
related to those posts might find them
in Google search but most of the time
you'll probably post a limited circles
the problem is that if you're not
careful anyone in your circles can
reshare your post to their audience but
there is a way to prevent this once you
publish a post click the arrow and
select disable reshare you also have the
option here to disable comments if you
want now that you understand how posts
work let's tweak privacy settings for
photos how did the Photos tab in your
profile and hit view all albums if
there's a globe next to the album its
public a lock means it's private and a
couple heads means it's limited to
change your sharing settings for any
album click it then hit the link next to
visible to and under circles or email
addresses of people who can view it
Google+ also lets people tagged you in
photos which are added to the photos of
you album but if you don't want just
anyone tagging you in photos go to
Google+ settings then scroll down to the
bottom and select which circles can tag
you here in this area is another
important privacy feature the Google+
app for Android and iPhone has huddle
which lets you chat with people in your
network by default anyone can start a
conversation with you which is really
creepy to disable this from happening
change the setting to just your circles
unfortunately there isn't a way to block
it altogether but I have faith that the
option will come in time now head to
your profile and hit edit profile we're
gonna make some changes here you can
basically select any element your
profile and decide who gets to see it
but I'll point out a few important
options scroll to the bottom of your
About section and check out an option
called search visibility if you don't
want your profile to show up in search
results click the setting and uncheck
help others find me
in search results now look at the left
sidebar when people visit your profile
they can see who's in your circles and
who has you in theirs you can hide
either or both of these modules by
clicking change who is visible here and
unchecking the boxes once you've made
all the changes in your profile hit done
editing then see what your profile looks
like to the public by clicking view
profile as and selecting anyone on the
web if you're satisfied hit done and
enjoy Google+ without worrying about
your privacy as always if you have
questions ask me on my Facebook page and
visit how to see Netcom for more videos
like this for CNET I'm Sharon Vaknin and
I'll see you on the interwebs now that
you've got that all sorted out
ready for another network to join this
week's edition of tap that app
highlights a service called get glue and
Jay marca BB has all the details
what's up folks i'm jay mark BB and
welcome to tap that app the show where
we cover the hottest apps on planet
earth this week we're checking out an
app for a unique kind of social network
called GetGlue now I know some of you
might be thinking what is the point why
should I care about checking into yet
another social app well first get glue
is an awesome place to discover new
forms of entertainment you see it
processes all of your check-ins your
likes favorites reviews etc and uses
them to recommend other things you might
enjoy new shows in the movies books and
honestly it's pretty on point where
there's recommendations at the same time
you can check out trending shows or look
at your friend streams to maybe discover
new things from them and of course
there's a game element to the app kind
of like four squares badge system
GetGlue gives you stickers for your
activity you can unlock hidden stickers
or limited edition stickers and post
them all on your GetGlue profile it's
it's really addicting but what sets
these stickers apart from say four
squares badges is that you can actually
have physical printed copies sent to you
for free so if you really want to
represent you can stick them on your
computer your phone Locker whatever but
in order to get them for free you've got
to earn at least 20 stickers first so
get cracking get glue is available for
free in the Android Market and the
itunes app store or if you like you can
also access it through your desktop
browser that's it for this week if you
know of any apps worth tapping through
this up tap that app at cnet.com I'm J
Markham BB thanks for watching
oh so it's basically Foursquare for
people who never get off the couch I get
it all right the time has come to take a
break but stick around we still have a
lot more tech review right after this
welcome back to the CNET tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at CNET TV
continuing on in the good the folks from
rim kept our cell phone editors busy
this week with three new BlackBerry
handsets for three different carriers my
favorite of the bunch is the blackberry
torch 9810 418 t with its slide-out
keyboard here's Nicole Lee with her
first look I'm the totally senior
associate editor for cnet.com and this
is a first look at the blackberry torch
9810 for AT&amp;amp;T the blackberry torch 9810
is a successor to the blackberry torch
9800 from the previous year as you can
see the design is very similar it's in
fact it's almost identical the key
differences between the two devices seem
to lie within the brighter and cleaner
display as well as a slightly wider
keyboard one key difference is that it
has BlackBerry's latest OS 7 BlackBerry
7 offers a number of different
improvements over OS 6 for example it
has improved html5 video support and has
a new liquid graphics technology that
promises fluid animations instant
response times to taps and improved
graphics it also now has voice-activated
Universal search another improved
feature with OS 7 is augmented reality
this is enabled with the digital compass
and accelerometer aside from that OS
seven looks and feels the same to OS 6
you get the same menu interface for
example you can switch from different
home screens and the home screens can be
collapsed down to a smaller invisible
tray some of the improved apps that come
included with the torch 9810 include a
premium version of Docs to go bbm 6
blackberry balanced and Blackberry
protect the torch 9810 as you can see
here is a very nice and bright 3.2 inch
display very nice and colorful as you
can see here but if the display are the
usual shortcuts for the menu the back
key as well as the senate end functions
if the touch pick isn't enough for you
you want more precise control you can
use the optical trackpad as well
the phone up and you get the very
infamous a blackberry keyboard it's a
little shallow to our taste and you
might not be comfortable with it if you
have very large thumbs but generally we
found it decent and easy to use
another key upgrade over the old torch
is that the torch 9810 has a 1.2
gigahertz processor this makes
navigation and really speedy really fast
the phone also has Wi-Fi and support for
the AT&amp;amp;T HSPA+ network on the back of
the phone is a 5 megapixel camera and
for the first time the torch 9810 can
record 720p HD video the torch 9810 is a
gigabytes onboard memory but if you want
more is always a micro SD card slot on
the back for pricing and availability
please check out my full review on CNET
com I'm Nicola this has been a first
look at the blackberry torch 9810 isn't
the right blackberry for you check out
the torch 9850 for Sprint which does
away with the keyboard or the bold 9900
which offers the more traditional
blackberry form-factor that we all know
and love
we've got reviews for both right now
it's seen at tv.com but before you do
that let's see what showed up this week
in the bad
if you haven't noticed already I have
had a bit of a cold this week so Brian
coolly filled in for me on the buzz
report and boy am I glad he did cuz it
meant that I didn't have to look at this
atrocity for very long
the gadget of the week is Jesus
something too hideous to live and too
crafty to die a robot head that can read
music with its cold dead camera eyes and
OCR brain and then sing it to you you
know it's sings the way a corpse
whistles this thing in Taiwan also has
facial movements so it can interpret the
message of the song oh great I'm sure it
works really well as long as the message
is always I want to kill you so I can
more readily access your gallbladder
with my teeth the inventors at a
university in Taiwan hope that can go
into production replacing receptionists
in some businesses in China very soon
and they said nothing could stop that
economy
yikes that thing is just wrong on so
many levels in fact let's try to forget
that ever happens as we move along to
this week's bottom line as you might
recall from previous episodes I like
many of you was less than pleased when
Netflix announced the recent changes to
their pricing scheme and as many of us
started looking for Netflix alternatives
blockbuster emerged as a promising
contender let's see how the two services
stack up in this week's prize fight
what's up prize five fans
I'm Brian song and what changes the
Netflix is pricing people are looking
for alternatives so we're bringing you a
Throwdown showdown with two discs in
streaming subscription services it's a
prize five watch out
we Netflix and blockbuster our judges
for this fight are senior editor John
Game of Thrones Falcone executive editor
David the bad-boy car Noi and myself
ring-a-ling and dating Tom now we'll
take all three judges blind scores and
average them out to the nearest tenth
each round the final prize five score
will be an average of all rounds using
the same decimal system these two
services aren't exactly alike so we'll
help break it down for you
but hold on to your butt's round one is
all about the disk encryption plan
Netflix has the largest physical disk
collection with over 100,000 TV shows
and movie titles with a plan that starts
at $7.99 now if you want blu-rays you'll
pay two more bucks a month blockbusters
this plan brings its library of over
ninety five thousand movies and TV shows
but you'll also be able to rent video
games from a collection of more than
three thousand and there's no additional
cost for blu-rays with plans starting at
$9.99 but on the fact that blockbuster
gets many of its new releases 28 days
before Netflix and its blockbuster that
takes round one with a perfect five and
Netflix gets a 3.7 next round of
streaming subscription plans neither
company has released specific numbers
for their streaming collections but
Netflix is $7.99 streaming plan is
packed with older movies and it shines
when it comes to catching up with TV
series from the past but when you're
done with that what's left its biggest
drawback is its weak library of new and
current content that we all care about
now blockbuster doesn't offer a monthly
streaming plan instead it's an on-demand
service with little to no TV show
content where you can rent new movies
for 399 a pop or purchase them as well
its advantages that it still brings new
titles 28 days before Netflix but the
cost will add up fast
Netflix takes round two
seven and blockbuster gets a 2.7 dr.
averaging two rounds walk what to lose
by two tenths of a point round three is
device support Netflix is supported on
nearly every major connected device from
phones to game consoles to TVs and add
it all up and it's over 200 pieces of
hardware it really feels like it's on
every device blockbuster support is
growing you can access it on laptops
some phones and more but it's still way
behind and when 50% of Netflix viewing
is done on game consoles you probably
want to get in on that action
Netflix takes us round with a perfect 5
and blockbuster guest of 3 next round is
overall convenience Netflix brings a
clean user interface across all its
digital devices that feels familiar and
getting people to trust and mainly diss
because of its ease and reliability was
pretty much created by Netflix now
blockbusters web interface needs a
little streamlining but it's not
horrible it's flexible dissed by mail
program is solid but the differentiator
here is the ability to walk into a
physical Blockbuster store and swap out
your rentals
now that sounds great if you're close to
one but there aren't that many left
Netflix takes another round with the
floor and block what we get at 2.7 after
averaging four rounds the tables have
turned and Netflix now leave 7/10 of a
point the final round that will decide
it all his combined value
things have cooled to a simmer after a
hot boiling period with the new price
changes that split Netflix is streaming
and dis rental plans but let's do the
math even after the split if you add up
both the disk plant and the streaming
plan at $7.99 each you're spending just
under $16 a month now let's look at the
blockbuster plant it starts at $9.99 for
dis rentals and yes that includes
blu-ray and games but if you watch just
two on-demand movies in a month you're
already at $17 now these plans come down
to what kind of content you care about
but Netflix looks like the more
compelling of the two and it takes the
final round with the 4.3 and blockbuster
gets a three let's average out all five
rounds and enterprise fight where
blockbuster took the lead after two
rounds Netflix fought back and takes
this prize fight for point one two three
point three and is your prize fight
winner we know these services aren't
exactly alike
and even though Netflix is king of the
Ring your best bet might be getting the
combination of Netflix is streaming for
$7.99 and blockbusters this rental plan
for $9.99 where you'll really get the
best of both worlds i'm brian tom thanks
for watching
we'll catch you guys next time on
another prize fight
the bottom line this week always bet on
red if you want to quit Netflix just on
principle blockbuster can be a decent
alternative but I like Brian's
suggestion of splitting the difference
streaming from Netflix and discs from
Blockbuster especially if you can get
them a month sooner alright folks that's
our show come back next week for an
all-new CNET tech review until then
there are tons of great videos available
every day at SEMA tv.com see you next
time and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
