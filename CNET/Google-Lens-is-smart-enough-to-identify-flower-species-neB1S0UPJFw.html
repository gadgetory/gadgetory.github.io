called Google Ads Google Apps is a set
of vision based computing capabilities
that can understand what you're looking
at and help you take action based on
that information we will ship it first
in Google assistant and photos and I'll
come to other products so how does it
work
so for example if you run into something
and you want to know what it is say a
flower you can involve google lens from
your assistant point your phone at it
and we can tell you what Florida's it's
great for someone like me with allergies
or if you've ever been at a friend's
place and you've crawled under a desk
just to get the username and password
from a Wi-Fi router you can point your
phone away and we can automatically do
the hard work for you or if you're
walking in a street downtown and you see
a set of restaurants across you you can
point your phone because we know where
you are and we have our knowledge graph
and we know what you're looking at we
can give you the right information in a
meaningful way as you can see we are
beginning to understand images and
videos all of Google was built because
we started understanding text and
webpages so the fact that computers can
understand images and videos has
profound implications for our core
mission</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
