families all of whom are desperate to
rule Westeros but when the dust is
settled who'll survive and who'll emerge
victorious we're at the game of thrones
exhibition in London to ask real Thrones
fans how they think the show will end
why isn't a woman a dynein it's just
gonna be like a graveyard everyone's
gonna die and what do you think pretty
much the same as out ideally ideally are
there any characters you would like to
see make it through that Massacre one
min tenaris fans I'm hoping that would
be like a big epic scene at the end I
think that everyone's mad I ordinary
between because she's the bestest I she
should be generis deserves it she does
deserve it I think she does she's
fighting Harland everybody hours and
she's the only one that doesn't have
like loads of armies behind her she's
gone around and readied them all herself
she's worked hardest for this well my
dad would like it if she married him and
run off of him she's told me before we
came today but I think with the sheer
power of the unsullied and sort of her
whole band of mercenaries that she's
amassing she's gonna be very hard to
beat for any of the other houses think
she's gonna kill her own dragon I think
so cuz I'm she has a good heart wood of
people and these dragons are killing
people so I think so yeah all right well
there may be the only fair thing to do I
think the Dragons having come over this
time to King's Landing I think this
season we're gonna see them come they've
grown to age and yeah get a flyover
definitely take the throne for a while I
think at least anyway I've until the
last season I was really rooting for
Daenerys but I think she's maybe making
a few bad decisions locking up the
dragons and maybe not ruling you know
quite a while so yeah I've really turned
from Denarius to Stannis the last
episode where he rode up and out the
wall so yeah yeah Stannis the Manus what
do you think about Jon Snow do you see
much of a future for him my husband he
could be my husband that's fine by me
hey could be my future husband he can
just leave
come by me i don't want more tyrion
steering's best Tyrion and Jon Snow and
Jorah Excel a jaw as well but everyone
seems to hate drawer and how how about
the about the Lannisters what do you
think they have a shot at Victory final
victory well not now Jamie's all chummy
with brianne and wanting to doesn't like
your sister anymore bit fed up I think
especially only got one hand about the
threat of the White Walkers north of the
wall how's that going to be dealt with
at the moment is to sort of attention
bubbling and everyone knows that
obviously they are going to present a
massive problem at some stage because
they're pretty unstoppable consume they
already did gotta be like some massive
showdown with dragons and White Walkers
and like everything is just going to
smash together like interest in the
middle of the kingdom there's no way
that they can't all meet up at some
point so that's what these fans think
but what are your predictions let us
know and stay tuned to seen it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
