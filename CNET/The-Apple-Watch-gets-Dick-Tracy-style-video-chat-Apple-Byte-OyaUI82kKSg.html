to the Apple bite for everything good
and bad inside the world of Apple let's
get to it and finally my dreams have
been answered videoconferencing is
coming to the Apple watch but it's not
my Apple now you know I've been wanting
this from day one and it's coming and
spring up next year thanks to a company
called camera who decided to spell it
like that so I'm gonna call them
tomorrow
now how genius is this two HD cameras an
outward facing 8 megapixel camera like
the first Samsung gear and a cell facing
2 megapixel camera built into the watch
band within all-day charge that
integrates with your iPhone are you in
love yet I am and if you didn't think
video conferencing on a watch is badass
you will now now the band is 249 but 149
for pre-orders right now on their
website I got one and no I didn't get
paid by them to talk about this but I
just got juiced about the Apple watch
again and hey Apple just curious if you
started working on taking this idea
because you should have done this a long
time ago
alright the public beta for iOS 10.2 is
out and new emojis are here five months
ago the Unicode consortium approved 72
new emojis that are part of Unicode 9
and that means we're gonna get new ones
like a shark or a gorilla that will
forever be Harambee out who doesn't love
a new creepy clown face or the bacon
emoji but when Apple giveth they also
taketh away
some emojis have been updated and
redesigned and the biggest offender the
peach emoji now goes from this to this
come on Apple what is that like what am
I supposed to use now when I'm texting
my round booty emoji that's not even a
peach
that's an apricot and first you take
away my headphone jack for my iPhone
then you take away all the ports on the
MacBook Pro so I could go fooled dongle
and now now you take away my big booty
peach emoji that's where I draw the line
and you're doing a bad after hashtag
rest in peach I'll write a new report
from the economic Daily News claims
suppliers are not expecting the recently
delayed air pods to ship until next year
as in January 2007
if true the product would completely
miss the holiday season and be pushed
back three months since it was promised
in an Apple statement they said the
early response to the air pods has been
incredible
we don't believe in shipping a product
before it's ready and we need a little
more time before air pods are ready for
our customers you know they also didn't
give any timetable not even a month of
when to expect them now Apple wasn't it
you who said the future of the iPhone
was Wireless that's part of the reason
why you took out the headphone jack
right because you wanted everyone to use
these air pods now early prototype
review units haven't had any major
issues but it's the lack of
functionality that hurts and makes these
really useless to me even worse than
that design now you can only either use
the air pods to prompt Siri or change
that in the settings to pause and play
it's only one or the other you can't
skip through tracks there's no volume
control it's not even an option you'll
have to go directly to your phone for
that functionality see that's courage
so I've ripped on these enough I'm gonna
just hold back and let you all yell bad
Apple instead okay you feel better now
make these just as functional as the
regular headphones add new gestures for
that in we'll see how you handle this
Apple okay now there's also a lot more
follow up with the new MacBook Pros
according to computer world's benchmark
test the new 15-inch pro offers the
fastest read and write speeds of any
stock computer available today Apple
decided to use not just solid-state hard
drives but the fastest PCIe drives with
the non-volatile memory Express
interface and it's the highest
performing system on the market in that
regard now most companies won't adopt
these drives until late 2017 giving
Apple a year lead and pro users with
large files will really see the biggest
benefit now even though 13-inch pros are
impressive and an eye fix-it breakdown
shows how the 2016 pros feature a
removable SSD with a custom Apple
controller and it's the first time
they've seen anything like that on an
SSD also a report from Korea's et News
says the OLED touch bar on the MacBook
Pros is made by their good good friends
at Samsung Apple is also currently
testing OLED panels for future use in
MacBook screens which is really a
no-brainer for power efficiency and a
thinner
design that doesn't require a backlight
like LCDs also pro users still are not
happy about the changes that Apple is
made with the new MacBook Pros it's
funny because when you're in the
building at an Apple event you buy into
what they're selling like look at all
the early videos with people that were
at the event Apple has that effect but
come on you don't have to suck the teeth
now you can't ignore that Apple's
obsession with thinness drove a lot of
decisions with this new MacBook Pro and
it's lost functionality sure you can
replace it with dongles if you want it
trails in CPU and graphics power
compared to others and you're also
paying that higher starting price now
Phil Schiller addressed one of the
biggest issues it's 16 gigs ram limit
saying that having 32 gigs wouldn't be
power fishing enough for a notebook but
a deeper explanation from a reddit post
explains that Apple's decision to use
Intel skylake processor prevented them
from using 32 gigs or even lower power
ddr4 Ram now getting to 32 gigs would
require them to use desktop Ram
which is a lot more power hungry and a
thicker form factor would be required
for this MacBook Pro to support it there
are also laptops that do that but it
would have meant a battery life of about
5 to 6 hours instead of 10 and let's be
honest you'd get even more or backlash
from consumers with that so if you're in
the market for a MacBook Pro and you
really want to get one you're going to
get one but in a year or so it's Intel's
Canon Lake processors support for 32
gigs of low-power RAM in this new slim
design that will be the real beast for
Apple all right now sometimes we talk
about all this but a picture is really
worth a thousand words and it brings us
back to reality if you're a MacBook user
how are you going to connect your iPhone
to your new Mac well it's going to look
a lot like this check this out a
splitter from Belkin allows you to plug
your iPhone into your MacBook to charge
well so having the ability to still
listen to it with your headphones you
could have used Apple's wireless air
pods but yeah those are delayed but then
you can't connect the Lightning port to
the MacBook or the new MacBook Pro so
you'll need another adapter for that
it all looks really elegant here and
this is one of the prettier setups
ladies and gentlemen boys and girls
children of all ages are you ready to
DOM good
I'm done and I could have held it longer
if I wanted to all right that's going to
do it for this week's show we'd love to
hear what you thought you can email us
at the Apple buy to cnet.com or tweet me
at brian tom thanks so much for watching
we'll catch y'all next time for another
bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
