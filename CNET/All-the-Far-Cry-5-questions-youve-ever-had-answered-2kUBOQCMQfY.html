like everything but the ceiling is green
in this room why do you think they did
that hey everyone welcome to another
quick question this week we're talking
all about Far Cry 5 whoa boy Far Cry 5 a
lot of baggage it's good game story just
not hanging anyway thank you so much
everyone who submitted questions about
this game I reviewed it you could check
out my review on CNET but for now let's
get to the questions
chase says first one I have played so
what do I have to expect from this game
well Far Cry 5 is this open world
action-adventure first-person shooter
game where you're slowly building a
resistance to take down a religious and
dangerous cult you grow your arsenal you
can hire people to help fight with you
you take down posts and you take down
sections of the map and then you go
after the main guy so that's what you
can expect if you don't like shooters
not gonna like this game if you don't
like violence and blood and awful things
you're not gonna like this game so I
hope that helps isn't this game just the
same thing as the other far crys is that
a good or a bad thing
it is a lot similar to the other Far Cry
games but it is the most refined and
streamlined and accessible one in the
series and I think in terms of just the
gameplay it's my favorite bill says what
would Far Cry be like if it took place
in New Jersey okay Far Cry 6 : NJ it
would just be hours and hours of
mindless bumper-to-bumper gridlocked
traffic making your way into the Lincoln
Tunnel and that's all the game would be
everyone would hate it or kill
themselves before they finish playing
Tony did I make the best Far Cry 5 gift
let's have a look what the oh no don't
judge oh my god
you might have I just feel like Far Cry
New Jersey you would get a hockey stick
so you can bash someone's taillights out
and that's the only weapons you would
have in your entire wheel all the perks
would just be like oh you're level six
are cursing at somebody Dom says hey
quick question Far Cry 5 is awesome so
far but how do you feel about NPCs non
playable characters sometimes capturing
areas independently of your own actions
it happened to me with falls end that's
crazy man that never happened to me I
finished the entire game I don't like
when these people just sort of take your
helicopter and fly away without you
inside it that's annoying but I've never
had anyone capture stuff without me that
is weird
I'd like to see that Shaun does a crying
fart have more substance than whatever
far cry 5s message is supposed to be
Shaun you're not wrong the story the
messaging all that in Far Cry 5 is kind
of a mess but for what it's worth I do
think it is very difficult to send a
specific narrative across in a huge open
world kind of unpredictable game you see
a cutscene and then hours and hours and
hours and hours and hours go by and then
another cutscene it's not as easy to do
that as it is maybe a linear game but at
the same time yes they dropped the ball
on the messaging it's a bad look Zack
says I drunk purchased the $90 version
with the season pass how much money did
I waste technically you wasted $30 but
there's DLC coming I just don't know if
it's worth it they're doing like a
zombie one they're doing one that takes
place in Vietnam and then one that takes
place on Mars so there's a range there
is it good I don't know I haven't played
any of it is it gonna be good I haven't
really seen any of it so you've
potentially wasted $30 but I think if
you bought it after the fact
it's gonna be more money so hold on I'll
let you know if you wasted money almost
everything I own the mused chunk will
this be the final Far Cry game ah
probably not they seem like they sell
very well I mean they've made 5 they've
made a six if you include Far Cry
primal so I don't think this series is
necessarily going anywhere anytime soon
he also asks what is the best flavor
combination of bagel slash cream cheese
- cinnamon raisin with the walnut raisin
cream cheese that's pretty good I
respect that
yeah you don't like that Nick I'm sorry
that this person's taste disgusts you I
like I'll go I'll do two things I like
in everything bagel with the LOX cream
cheese I'm a fan of that or you can go
down the route of it this is everybody I
realize that you can do sesame bagel
with strawberry cream cheese at Mount
Skullcrusher
far cry 6 has the celebrity antagonist
but they have to play themselves who do
you cast my pick is Jeff Goldblum good
pick I love it hmm let's go with Jeremy
Irons I think he could do it I just love
him as the villain in die hard 3 so I
just like I always want to see him do
that again oh you know you can do you
could do the the entire cast of the
Jersey Shore oh wait I think we've just
really actually created far cry sticks
New Jersey all right that's gonna do it
for another episode of quick question
