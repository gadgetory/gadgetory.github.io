been busy updating the Google home when
it came out last November the always
listening home showed a lot of promise
but it couldn't quit keep up with the
Amazon echo now though thanks to some
updates it's a pretty close match up
here's what's new the coolest of homes
new features it can now distinguish
between multiple voices hey Google Who
am I
your name is Andrew six different people
can sync their account and Google home
will actually give personalized answers
based on who's talking for cooking
assistance whole now gives step-by-step
directions on over five thousand recipes
google has greatly expanded the number
of smart home devices it can control
adding some of our favorites such as
August locks Belkin and Lutron switches
and life expulse
Google's also expanded the number of
streaming platforms home works with with
chromecast and home you can command vids
from Hulu HBO now Netflix and others on
your TV control Spotify SoundCloud and
more on your speakers and on top of all
that more upgrades are on the way the
home will soon offer proactive
assistance so it'll let you know if
traffic's going to be bad it'll pull up
search results on your TV and I'll let
you make phone calls it's even going to
allow you to customize commands for your
smart home like movie time or date night
the battle with the echo is getting
heated the echo is still a better smart
home controller and the $50 echo dot is
the best budget-friendly option but now
that the home's had a little time to
grow up it's catching up and fulfilling
its potential</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
