Bennett of Jeff Aguila humble santana's
this is the show where it's tough but I
was just waiting for us to get all
profession yeah coming up with a
Saturday lots of stuff but mainly
nothing worth we might talk about some
stuff like maybe I don't know get past
and suffer the rundown anything I've
never to get to any of this define
because it that's secondary we'll think
about it
most importantly Brian brushwood from
revision3 scam school drinks in the show
you're in person this week I am in
person you're the first back-to-back
back-to-back - evented you're talking
about so you do scam school people
shouldn't need another explanation
because obviously explain yourself
before really quick what's scam school
uh scam schools to show about social
engineering at the bar and on the street
does that sound pre-programmed with
melody like melodies his PR rep and
she's like you should say this in she
has his headphones directly okay school
it's a good show to watch on
revision3.com watch closely and you will
never need to pay for a drink again then
she's like sex iPod say those they're
SEO right you're not just a host so I
guess we should start again sweet it's
like you get free drinks a bar yeah yeah
basically basically everything from
learning how to cut in lines to street
cons and scams to scam a free drinks at
the bar which means you know teach a few
magic tricks tricks teach some pranks to
pull on your buddies that kind of thing
sweet actually just you once you said
you had one you want to teach us yeah I
kind of well I'll show it and and this
is one that this is the pilot episode we
teach how to do this and it has the
dubious distinction of being a magic
trick that may actually kill you
I don't I don't actually know this is we
didn't you might die I just dice hey
this is all this is all fire proof
insulation around us right
oh my god all right this is called the
human chimney it doesn't always work but
if it does work it's cool all right so
he lit up match he waves it out there's
smoke coming from in case you can't see
it he took something from it
and then he's breathing oh my god Oh
what the hell Wow oh my god what is
going on oh is that later you like that
I'm so confused so quick in case you
assume the show and podcast you just
litter - you're up Randall he picked his
fingers in front of it and then he put
it in his mouth
I'm checking out these men man there's
like an excessive amount of smoke that
came out these are real match that rate
they're regular man you just use like
hotel matches right right correct and
essentially the and by the way pretty
sure this kills you
for what this probably hurts you long
yeah yeah blow it out and you have to
and then you have to grab the top well
yeah I mean that's all you've already
missed the magic trick is how that works
that means everything I'm doing is a lot
just like you pointed the box and the
girl splits in half like it's not
working
here's the thing when you when you
strike a match you get a little bit of
smoke right and then when it burns you
get like no smoke but when it goes out
that's when you see the most smoke right
if you when you strike the match if you
strike it towards your face and inhale
yes whatever that poison is it can't be
good for you right somehow it becomes
like it bonds with the water vapor or
some and it becomes smoke inside your
lawful yeah but I just can't imagine
this at a show get cancer it's gonna
burn you got it in start inhaling right
as you strike it to his face and it's
gonna burn oh yeah because otherwise you
know if you do this if you go nobody
that won't fool anyone
yeah you guys Jeff you're on position
yeah position it under your nose and
straight punch away I'm saving the
microwave yeah yeah hail from your nose
right yeah yeah well that yes that's
very true
describe the burn burn what's the really
like the delicious all right this is
like a bomb unit did it did he do it
closer do it closer and take two if you
take two matches at the same time the
cancer closer closer
wow that tastes like nothing
high-five for you that's the first one
right and and okay if you want the full
explanation it says go to stamp so that
was the last game school and not to be
clear like okay we would write this is
this right here are we re on this is the
jack-o'-lantern this is an upcoming
episode here okay here we go
alright so he takes the match puts it in
his mouth bites down so how do you not
well there are different classes right
some things you got to do to grab
attention and have you oh show me
another show me another they starts
saying show me another then you set up a
puzzle to me like I'll bet you $800
exactly exactly will you set up a puzzle
and then you know when you when when you
get the puzzle people do anything to get
the answer and you're like I'll be happy
to tell you I just you know
Korona please have some money or beers
sometimes it come down to you know like
I'm a lonely guy so okay so that's cool
do you do I feel like we're going this
is the shows this is the best show it's
actually seven but that's so what's the
next Tom McCarthy all right you wanna
see some else yeah all right now we're
gonna go way is this a reaction are we
doing reactions this is these are nine
four-and-a-half-inch 30 penny nails
right they're like I'm not like this
hold on put my camera this is for real
like I'm not joking this is a nail like
when you want pick whichever one you
want and try to bend it make sure it
doesn't Bend I'm trying to burn banging
on the table make sure it's not all it
it hurts and here's the important part
make sure there's no chance for me to
make a switch or anything got it we'll
keep it in view the whole time I'm
watching I'm your this is called the
human block it's going alright alright
so now here's the important part I don't
know if we can get everything in here

in Randall's here I want you to reach
forward grab and that is a souvenir for
you

show on Ustream seriously I don't know

brushwood derails the foreign war that
was dude like Julie Alison came in like
ran the show and like she was taking
taken over that was the craziest moment
though take a break I'm gonna train get
some composure I think we're gonna get

I'm so Chuck we're gonna do calls from
the public because it's caution I love
that you respect the history of this
show it's great so this is one hey Bill
from Portland for a work crew what's the
best way to watch the show live anyway
it's hard to find on your blog site of

watch the show live is to not be blind
big blind guy from Oregon who doesn't
live in a shack no just kidding so fake
blind guy wants to watch the show live
the wet best way is the 404 Cena calm
yes 11:00 a.m. Eastern we start and then
11:15 s on the show actually like kicks
off like yeah there's also a website
that's a fan created one that they put
up it's called watch bol calm yeah
that's even though there's lots of
different ways like people in the news
oh is Ustream and lots of other
different ways that they didn't fall on
the X on we're going to try to get the
one dat one of these days we're gonna
try to get the the video of the podcast
on loop
on the will seriously so you don't know
yet by thing we forgot to play you guys
realize I haven't even done the nail in
the I bid okay next we're gonna come
from the public
Matthew Lee calls from Salt Lake City
I don't know him to a couple episodes
back and Reynolds basically talking
about how he wasn't sure if he's gonna
get an iPod Touch yep I wasn't sure like
I say I have a pod touch it is a 16
gigabyte model and it is freaking
awesome yeah it is accepted there was 18
key and I think that they suck unless
their service gets better like I mean if
you're just looking for a really really
awesome little device all right that's
enough 18 T's that's not ridiculous oh
so Wilson use iPod Touch right yeah I
love it do you like it it's great no
actually I saw something on Lifehacker
yesterday yeah where you can buy a
little microphone attach it to your iPod
touch and it turns out to it I'm this
guy that's like how do you plug it in
though the iPod I'll say because they
got someone hacked the access
you have to jailbreak it but now they've
made it so easy it literally takes like
a minute yet no I haven't done it
because I haven't bought the meta by the
mic but I'm gonna definitely do it that
would be awesome see that because for me
I phone that's what I wanted though I
don't I don't want the 18 t I want this
guy just want a nice I pod touch so and
I gotta say I want to get the iPod Touch
jailbroken because there's this program
called fringe now I keep hearing about
this and it's all the other ones used to
work with s IP yeah you kind of void
like so mississippi's sip is like a void
protocol that's right everybody use
standard and all that stuff but the
Skype isn't Skype fringe apparently uses
the Skype protocol oh cool so you seem
able to call Skype exactly you have an
iPhone right Brian yeah what do you do
I'm ready to buy it all over again I was
too much in two months yeah well and
that was the deal was was the missus was
like alright you could pay a ridiculous
amount of money for an iPhone even
though it'll get cheaper in 30 days or
whatever it was but but I get yours when
you buy the next one so that works
technologists yeah dude it's got married
