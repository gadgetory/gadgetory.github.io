bit briny I'm Bridget Carey this is your
cnet update scientists at NASA have
discovered there is liquid water flowing
on the hills of Mars suggesting the
possibility that there could be life of
some kind on the red planet but we're
not talking about a babbling brook you
see the evidence of water is in the
changes of color in the bedrock there
are these dark streaks that are showing
up when the temperature gets warmer and
they're flowing downward see the grayish
lines those are the streaks it was
observed from the Mars Reconnaissance
Orbiter and they even flow over time
scientists pointed a spectrometer at the
surface and it appears to confirm that
it's a very salty water and even if it's
super briny water flowing down it offers
a possibility that there is life on Mars
the Martian atmosphere makes it very
hard for water to remain a liquid normal
water on the surface freezes at zero
degrees Celsius and then boils at just
10 degrees yes 10 Celsius but the salt
keeps it liquid at a broader temperature
range so where do we go from here where
we're going to Mars NASA plans to send
humans there in the 2030s and in the
meantime there are several crafts
heading up there to probe more and do
more work to see what else they can
discover about the water and what it can
tell us about the planet's past water
could also be a resource for future
explorers but it's bit too early to say
for sure scientists believe Mars once
had a vast ocean that covered half the
planet if there was life millions and
millions of years ago maybe this water
can tell us if any form of that life
survived meanwhile back on Planet Earth
there's another phenomenon that baffles
many the iPhone phenomenon Apple said it
sold 13 million of the new iPhone 6s and
6s plus models from Friday through
Sunday that's the first three days of
sales it's a new record last year apple
sold 10 million iPhones over the same
period of time one difference is that
China was part of the launch day sales
this year and it wasn't last year and
Facebook is bringing new life to a
product once thought as arid and
desolate I'm talking about Facebook
notes the place where you can make
long-form posts facebook change notes to
look more like a blog post there are new
tools to add images
resize photos and format the layout
Facebook made some example posts and how
you could showcase a recipe or use it as
a personal journal the design may remind
you a bit of the long-form posts of
medium you can only create a note from
the desktop not from the facebook app
yet that's it for this segment is update
and you can explore more at cnet com
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
