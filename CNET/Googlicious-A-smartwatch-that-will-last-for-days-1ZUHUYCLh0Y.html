welcome to Google ishes it's all the
Google that we can pack into show each
week so let's get to it now are you all
ready for another SmartWatch well this
won't be the last one we see after
Qualcomm announced its talk SmartWatch
that's spelled t.o q and is not
pronounced taupe which is an honest
mistake that I made now the talk will
retail for 349 and will be available on
December second but what really makes us
watch unique is its mirasol display that
qualcomm is claiming will provide
multiple days of battery life now we saw
this technology years ago at CES with
ereader concepts by qualcomm just think
of it as a color eating touchscreen
which consumes a lot less power now the
watch will also support wireless
charging and is only compatible with
Android phones four point oh three and
higher it will take and accept calls
text messages and handle whether stocks
and other alerts now the talk has a
pretty slick design but qualcomm told
CNET in September that it intends for
the talk to be a limited run in the tens
of thousands to show customers what the
technology can do but that isn't a
ringing endorsement that this is a
platform to jump on one they're treating
it like a proof of concept either way
it's getting one thing right for sure
and that's battery life so if you guys
are thinking of the perfect SmartWatch
right now I'll take Qualcomm's Mirasol
display for its battery life with google
now functionality that's tied to Apple
the ecosystem so somebody make that like
right now okay thanks now last week we
talked about the chance of seeing the
new Nexus 10 this year well the timing
was pretty much perfect after several
images have been leaked for the device
since then between a thinner bezel and
what's believed to be a front-facing
speaker at the top now another image has
been taken down but was translated from
korean to english and it said LG
electronics nexus 10 november 22nd LTE
black and white now this picture leak
from telefonica hints at a price of 299
british pounds which converts the 480 to
US dollars but it's possibly just a few
days out so we'll see how this rumor
holds up and
sticking with what Google is doing with
their own devices a story from ARS
technica reveals Google is working on a
new camera API for Android that was
believed to be targeted for KitKat but
has been held back for now the biggest
detail points to raw image support which
gives photographers more flexibility
since the image is minimally compressed
and unprocessed Nokia's Lumia 1520
currently has this feature but also
offers the potential for more powerful
android on board photo editor other new
API improvements also point to face
detection support and burst mode which
are staple features on other phone
cameras now in more curved display
rumors a story from bloomberg claims
Samsung could be employing a wrap-around
display in its next generation of
smartphones using a newer version of
Samsung's youm screen technology that
was used with the galaxy brown
smartphone other sources say it could be
used in the galaxy s our note series or
it could be incorporated into their next
rumored flagship phone called the
samsung f now that might actually work
because they could call it the samsung
fu all right let's take a breather and
check out really one of the smartest
phones out there the Moto G dropped last
week and it's a real mid-range bone with
a real nice price I'm Andrew Hoff cnet
and i'm here at motorola event in london
checking out the new moto g physically
it looks very very similar to the
motorola moto x launched in the u.s.
earlier this year it has a 4.5 inch
screen rather than the 4.7 inch screen
you'll find on the motorola moto x it
does have the same 720p resolution
though which as the pixels are more
tightly packed inside it's running on a
1.2 gigahertz quad-core processor which
is an impressive engine for such a cheap
phone they'll arrive running Android 4.3
jelly bean which isn't quite the latest
version of Android which is called 4.4
KitKat or the motorola has said but it
will receive an update to it in January
around the back you'll find a 5
megapixel camera which has features like
HDR panorama and a slow-motion video
mode might not be offering a big
challenge of a smartphone elite but it's
got a great lineup of specs for an
extremely attractive price and becoming
two parts of Europe and Brazil from
today and we getting us shores in
January I'm Andrew hall for cnet and
this is the mode
rowlett moto g thank you for that Andrew
now let's check out some quick stories
amazon recently launched their latest
kindle fire OS 3.1 update that adds
goodreads integration it's an online
book reading and reviewing community and
even better their new feature called
fling that lets you watch movies and TV
shows from your tablet and onto either a
samsung smart TV or your PlayStation 3
console and not the four yet also if
you're a student pay attention sprint
and Best Buy are offering eligible
students 12 months of free talk texting
and one gig of data per month if you
sign up for a new android device with
them at best buy stores now you'll pay a
little more for the actual device but
saving about seventy dollars per month
for a year is going to make up for it in
this is a pretty sweet deal and if you
guys like hanging out at retail stores
because honestly who doesn't google has
opened up temporary pop-up shops called
Google winter wonderland six cities
that's New York City Washington DC
Chicago Los Angeles New Jersey and
Sacramento you'll be able to purchase
all the google gadgets you like but
let's be honest the highlight is going
into their dedicated snow globe room
where you can create slow motion videos
while animated snow falls down on you so
who wants to go on a road trip with me
anybody no one okay alright that's gonna
do for this we show email us at Google
issues at cnet com or tweet me up brian
Tong and i'll respond to you when I can
thanks so much for watching i'm brian
Tong we'll see you guys next time for
some more of that Google Isha's
