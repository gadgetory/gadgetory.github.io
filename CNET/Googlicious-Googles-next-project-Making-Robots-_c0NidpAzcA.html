Google ish asst it's all the google that
we can pack into a show each week so
let's get to it in you know sometimes
you'll get the unexpected that keeps the
tech world on its toes and Google pulled
one of those moves after it officially
acquired Boston Dynamics the maker of
animal inspired robots now if you
haven't seen what this company is
capable of these video cliffs pretty
much say it all they have robots like
the big dog that can carry and transport
400-pound loads or the cheetah that can
run over 29 miles per hour it's almost
as fast as me now the acquisition aligns
with former Android chief Andy Rubens
robotic push for google and it's pretty
clear this is his love of robots and
it's his new focus oh and this guy the
pet man that's a robot not someone
dressed up in a suit so we'll see what
Reubens team brings us in the next few
years but i'll just start worrying if
they named one of their buildings
Cyberdyne
the Nexus 5 has rated our top product on
the scene at 100 right now that's an
algorithm combining seen its own
internal and external data reviews and
input from our editors and really what's
hot right now to create text
first-of-its-kind leaderboard now the
Nexus 5 is only going to get better or
really just slightly adjusted after
pictures from the xda-developers forum
show subtle hardware tweaks to the phone
now if you guys look carefully you'll
see larger slightly larger speaker
grills because that's obviously
important and the volume and power
buttons reportedly have been made to be
stiffer with the SIM card tray
protruding less compared to initial
model so good for new users in and
that's so hot for the loyal early
adopters now the LG G flex phone with
its self-healing Wolverine like backing
still hasn't officially announced a US
carrier but Eveleigh expose of the pic
that is destined for sprint according to
them now there's no price and no
availability information and it really
is a unique device but we'll see if
consumers care about this flexible type
display also software updates are always
happening in the Google world we talked
about four point two point two rolling
out last week and now Google Play
editions of the samsung s4 and HTC One
are getting them as well including the
LG G pad 8.3 inch google play edition
that was rumored to possibly be the new
Nexus tablet but it's a google play
edition instead and a good sign over all
Google Play edition models aren't
getting the updates nearly as fast as
Nexus devices also netflix for Android
finally gets the multiple profile
support we've seen this on the set-top
box versions and iOS so is great to
finally see it on Android the update
also includes and enhanced search for
people and related titles as well as bug
fixes and Google is also adding a
feature called control room to Google
Hangouts on air that are starting to
gain popularity it will now allow you to
adjust the volume level and video levels
of other participants for yourself it
will be coming into the next few days
and the best part is muting people you
don't care about and a few quick stories
we don't have any moving shots so you'll
just have to use your imagination but
this is pretty awesome after a new
google glass game called glass hunt just
think of it as duck hunt without the
ducks or the dog you know that
and you'll be shooting clay pigeons for
google glass instead and the Moto X is
still a popular phone with customization
galore and they offered a teaser on
their Twitter account for a new wood
backing finally wouldn't you know it's
what everyone wanted in the first place
and check this out a little Easter Egg
for Google+ users the big googs added a
cool shake feature on Android just shake
it up and you'll see some awesome auto
snow in fact we added the same feature
to this show so just try it right now
just shake us shake shake us right now
keep shaking and look see how cool we
have Auto snow too all right that's
going to do it for this week's show now
we're going to be gone on a holiday
break and going to CES so we're going to
be gone for a few weeks and will return
in the middle of January we're not going
away but we just wanted to let you all
know and remember you can email us at
Google ishes at cnet com or tweet me a
brian Tong and i'll respond to you when
I can thanks so much for watching i'm
brian Tong and we'll see you next year
for some more of that Google Isha's
