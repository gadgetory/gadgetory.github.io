like being able to check the status of
the garage door and control it remotely
and that's what the Chamberland my Q our
original smart garage door opener
offered but in a fully integrated home
that's just not enough and that's why
this week I decided to replace my Q with
garage EO essentially Garagiola the same
monitoring capabilities but it also
works with Amazon echo and IFFT for
deeper customization first off I really
like that what if you can use geofencing
to automate your garage door now every
morning when I Drive up to the Sina
smart home the garage door opens
automatically no button presses no
fiddling with an app second I really
like having a few if Tressa peas that
send me notifications if my garage door
opens that way if I'm out of town for a
weekend I can activate those
notifications as an additional security
measure finally even if I step out for a
little bit just to grab lunch I can
always check the status of my garage
doors using that app just like with the
original my Q Chamberlain has refused to
let if automate my Q controlled garage
doors citing safety risks but after
working with Garagiola I'm just not
seeing those issues sure every motorized
garage has the chance of injuring
somebody but that's why they have
different safety measures in place and
sure users might accidentally create an
IFFT recipe that opens the door while
they're away from home but as long as
you're careful with it that really
shouldn't be a risk but each and every
user is gonna have to determine for
themselves the safety measures that they
want in place for now I like the
flexibility garage EO is offering
through IFFT
that its competitors just aren't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
