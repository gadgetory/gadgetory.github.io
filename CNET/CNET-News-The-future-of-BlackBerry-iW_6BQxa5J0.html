its new BlackBerry 10 mobile operating
system on two new smartphones
I'm Jessica Dahl court for CNET and I
caught up with rim CEO Torsten Heinz to
ask him about the future of blackberry
the reason why we built this new
platform was not just to build a new
smartphone OS or to build a new tablet
OS right I actually truly believe and I
see it a lot when I debate this with you
know economists and market constituents
is that we move into the new economic
growth curve of wireless and what is it
going to be it's going to be mobile
computing right because the devices that
you've just seen they have a computing
power that is close to a laptop already
right so you will move from some sort of
a static computing domain towards your
computing powers always at your help the
idea is not to just build in your
smartphone OS the idea is to move this
company into the leadership position
mobile computing
what attracts the people to blackery is
bbm on a competitive blackberry so it's
the whole package you have to look at
not just the device right and the way
the carrier and us we were marketing
this together so you know we're not
we're not clearly we're not just in the
low and me to phone game we cannot do
this right I can't build a $60 black boy
right that's not where I want to be this
is not where this company needs to be
right we need to be in the aspirational
domain we need to be in the mid here and
we need to have services associated to
blackberry that attract the consumers
and make their overall value proposition
good
a lot of speculation about when it's
really going to be in the shops well I
can tell you is launch date is January
30th right that's why we show the
devices to the press and then shortly
thereafter whatever that is you will see
it in the shops
Kosar we bring a QWERTY device out and
we bring a full touch - I thought we
owned the QWERTY segment nobody builds
physical keypads such as black bear it
does we will own and expand that segment
as much as we can that's the baseline on
touch our representation in the market
let's say US market right now is is a
minor representation to put it mildly
right so the full touch device will be
the instrument which which we will be
gaining market share back in the US
that's that that's the sales gameplan
we haven't built a new platform for just
a year I mean this platform is gonna
take us to the next decade so what they
get with BlackBerry 10 is a real future
approved platform and a whole new
innovative user paradigm that is not
this application grid anymore that was
very intuitive five years ago when it
was invented it was fantastic right and
it really caught on with the user but
now with the BlackBerry flow and with
the peek and with a hop concept it just
makes your it makes you more productive
with less stress and people will love it
think about this in vertical industries
do an example hospital right doctor hits
the patient room and if C hits the bed
of the patient gets all the data from
the hotel data repository knows who the
patient is then he goes to updates
updates and this terms means what was
the surgery what happened during the
surgery why was it done how was it under
da da da da he goes into activity and
sees you know all the medication all the
recent activities that were performed on
that patient and that's what we're
looking towards as a vision this isn't
gonna happen in the next six months
right but this is where the company is
moving because the industry is moving
that this is the the room of opportunity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
