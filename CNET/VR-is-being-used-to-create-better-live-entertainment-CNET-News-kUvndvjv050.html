that you're looking at projecting onto
the opera house which has it is a
sculptor in itself and it's this
dimensional canvas and all the content
was never designed to animate or to work
we had to recreate to build the
animation and build up the levels to
create that sense of depth and dynamism
when you're talking about projection
mapping it's not just content that's
being projected on the surface and you
go there it is it what's beautiful it's
done it's a transformation it's
transforming that space into something
else building moments that you feel like
you're about to take off somewhere and
then all of a sudden it shifts and forms
into something that you wouldn't expect
we needed these moments to work from
every angle that's where our virtual
reality and how we were able to rebuild
this in three-dimensional space became a
really big tool for us the jobs that we
work on if it's not a building
projection it's a ceremony or something
then the set will often not have been
built the stadium may not have been
built and so we can actually have a look
in real time try things out make sure
that our contents lining up make sure
that we know that from every angle
contents working for them and then we
can shift around and look from a
different audience perspective and go
okay but still look for them as well
it's becoming a real important part of
our workflow
