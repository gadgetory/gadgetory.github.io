driving capable of any Road maneuver you
can imagine and a number you can't him
the Aventador is the top of the stack
for Lamborghini at least in terms of
production cars leaving out things like
the veneno and some special models the
overall formula of the car is pretty
simple it's a two-seater with the engine
mid rear a b12 carbon fiber tub of which
you almost can't say too much the carbon
fibre tub was only about 325 pounds it's
incredibly stiff and everything else is
anchored to it including aluminum
subframes front and rear for suspension
and engine mounting on top of all of
that we have the roadster that means
you've got a pair of removable
carbon-fiber roof panels that also are
going to earn you some non-removable
stares of envy in public now the end of
the course is out back in the backyard
carbon fiber lid with these plexiglass
clear louvers and underneath there is
quite a work of art
it's a v12 six and a half liters but
after that the technology doesn't get to
modern turbo no supercharger no direct
injection no aside from being a v12 the
core trait of this engine is that it's
also over square that means it's
cylinders are short and wide it's a
trait of high revving engines they have
a higher ratio of valve opening in the
roof of the cylinder compared to the
total volume of the cylinder in other
words they Rev like hell and breathe
well now what's interesting about
Lamborghinis is the engine and
transmission layup all-wheel drive of
course in this car you've got the engine
sitting with the transmission ahead of
it the tail piece goes toward the
passenger compartment and then power is
transferred back through drive shafts to
the rear end and of course forward to
the front wheels
the transmission is a single clutch
automated manual with a numerous for
independent shift rods to carry at seven
gears the end result being those
extremely fast shifts and Lamborghini
says less weight due to having just one
clutch pack some numbers 690 horsepower
510 foot-pounds of torque a car that
weighs not that little actually almost
3,500 pounds in roadster form the
Roadster has got 110 pounds on the coupe
still it's not hurting anything 0 to 60
in 2.9 seconds oh and get to know that
little door over there in the corner
that's where the gas goes lots of it
10:16 is your rated mpg despite the fact
this car has some mpg technologies like
automatic start/stop which is exotically
powered by capacitors not the usual
lead-acid battery and even cylinder
deactivation now when you're barely on
the throttle it'll turn into an inline 6
and retire one bank and after 2 minutes
it'll refire the other one so it'll wear
evenly
like you're gonna mosey that long in
this car now inside the Aventador it's
not technology like we're normally used
to seen that style for example this is a
basically last generation howdy head
unit not a bad head unit but it's
nothing cutting-edge in terms of
connectivity or the way that it works
and you recognize these controls down
here from an Audi product we've been
watching our videos for long
all LCD gauge pack in front of me
including a massive digital tachometer
and then built in there just barely
visible as a speedometer your 4 in
Soleri gauges are around it then you've
got some partner info gauges on the side
and that brings us to these 3 drive
controllers here in the center of the
console strata is Street that's basic
driving sports gonna tighten up the
speed of shifts and how hard the RPMs
are run up also make the accelerator
mapping more aggressive open those
exhaust valves or baffles and dial back
some stability control go on more and
you're in the full red-blooded Corsa or
track mode manual only everything is
that its sharpest the quickest shift or
50 milliseconds you've still got your
wide open exhaust baffles and the
stability control is dialed back to just
the bare minimum to hang on to your car
by the way if you want to hear more of
that music from behind your seat check
this out that little transom glass right
there if I run this switch on the dash
goes up and down so you can hear the
whole mechanical noise of the valve
train and the intake sucking
I always feel a little silly giving you
impressions of a supercar they're all
amazing and this one makes almost
everything else on the road feel like a
moving van
yeah I prefer to leave the breathless
love letters to other LS the difference
between strata sport and Corsa is like
the difference between hitting a 10 20
or 50 million dollar lotto the center
differential sends anything from a high
of 30 to a low of 10 percent of total
output power to the front wheels as you
work your way toward more aggressive
drive modes and while the steering ratio
remains the same all the time the amount
of assist drops off as you move to Corsa
I did find the single clutch is our
gearbox to sound the only occasional
false note when you've got your foot in
it it's fast and tight but around town
it can bulk a shift once in a while and
leave you and your passenger with your
heads bobbing it did so seldom enough to
be memorable however which I guess means
seldom enough in no cases at a cutting
edge tech machine in the cabin by our
standards but that's not the point
you buy it because you like it not for
any rational reason and of course you'll
need to like it a lot base price with
destination and gas guzzler tax is
nearly four hundred and fifty thousand
dollars I definitely pop 7,500 for the
transparent engine cover 4200 gets you
upgraded Lamborghini audio and
multifunction controls on the steering
wheel are about 1500 more and we're just
getting started that will sound absurd
to most of us but remember what David E
Davis told 60 minutes about Lamborghinis
decades ago I firmly believe that
everyone
who is worth anything at all should only
at 12-cylinder car before they die
because there's nothing else like it
it's just one of the great operatic
experiences of all time it's a real
noise and there's nothing else like it
it'll take your breath away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
