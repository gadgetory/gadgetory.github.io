smartphone from LG and it has freaking
laser beams I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your C net update when it comes to
the top-of-the-line smartphones Apple
and Samsung hog the spotlight it's just
hard for other phones to get consumers
attention and part of that is because
Samsung just spends more money on
marketing but LG hopes new tricks will
help its phone stand out the LG g3 is
packed with unique features and some of
them sound like they belong in a James
Bond movie there's a laser guided camera
the 13 megapixel camera is paired with
something called laser autofocus which
uses a laser beam to measure the
distance between the camera and your
subject so we can focus quickly even in
low-light there's also a secret knock
that you can program to unlock the phone
with a pattern of taps activating the
kill switch yeah that disables your
phone remotely if you lose it but if
someone's borrowing your phone you can
hide certain files from being seen even
when it's connected to a computer now it
will be hard though to lose this phone
because it has a massive 5.5 inch
high-resolution screen and it'll give
your fingers a little bit of a stretch
but at least you can adjust the height
of the on-screen keyboard now if you
need to be discreet there is this quick
circle case cover and let you use the
phone without opening the cover flap
from the circle you can do things like
take a photo play music or handle phone
calls and like every good spy it has a
helpful assistant although it's not as
chattiest Siri or as inventive askew the
LG smart notice will offer suggestions
throughout the day so if the weather is
bad it'll remind you to take an umbrella
it's packed with power there's a large
removable battery and a quad-core
processor plus you can get more storage
with a micro SD card slot which was not
in the g2 it goes on sale in South Korea
Wednesday and then it will be sold in
more countries the UK and the US will
get it sometime in July but for some
reason LG is keeping the price top
secret
meanwhile over at the World Wide Web
there has been another hack yeah
this time it's Spotify the music
streaming service warned it's 40 million
users that there has been unauthorized
access to its systems but you don't need
to change your password because it seems
only one unlucky person had their
account hacked but do keep watch for an
update to the Android app it should make
it more secure that's your tech news
update you can find more details on the
g3 and the Spotify hack as cnet.com from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
