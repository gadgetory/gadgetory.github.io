I'm Brian Tong and the smartphone season
is getting hot and heavy so we're
bringing in a new contender it surprised
five-foot out between the HTC One and
Apple's iPhone 5 our judges for this
fight are senior editor Jessica the
people's dual court senior editor Brian
boom-shaka-laka Bennett and myself can't
go wrong tom now we'll take all three
judges scores and ABB's them out to the
nearest tenth each round the final prize
fight score will be an average of all
rounds using the same system let's get
it started
round 1 is designed the HTC One is a
really unique piece of beauty with its
contoured aluminum body polished metal
edges and the highest build quality on
an Android phone we've ever seen and
let's not forget about its four point
seven inch screen with super sharp 468
pixels per inch
now Apple's iPhone 5 design was one of
their best ever but it's not the best
anymore it still looks great but the
industry copycats have made this design
stale and it's 4-inch Retina display
looks like a shrimp with its pedestrian
326 pixels per inch that's still thinner
and lighter than the HTC One you might
call it the one that took down the
iPhone and HTC does it with a perfect 5
and the iPhone 5 gets a 4 next round is
user interface and controls HTC brings
our next generation of its Sense UI that
runs on top of android jelly bean and
it's a clean and easy to operate
experience for an Android device now a
new feature is the blink feed that shows
you all your social media updates and if
you like it it's nice but if you don't
there's no way to hide it or get rid of
it and it lives as one of your main home
panels now you'll still get all of
androids customizations for creating
folders and widgets and the
notifications pulldown is still right
where you expect it now Apple's iOS is
still the easiest OS hands-down and
there's no surprises here
it's intuitive enough for kids and
adults you can create your own folders
but there's little to no customization
it's ease-of-use vs customization but
really it comes down to what you want
and we don't all agree here and the
iPhone takes round two with the 4.7 and
the HTC one gets a 4.3 softer averaging
two rounds the HTC one leads the next
round is features I don't think we
really have a list long enough for
everything the HTC One brings but guess
what
I'll try now it starts with its blazing
quad core 1.7 gigahertz processor its
power button doubles as an IR blaster to
use your phone as a TV remote ACC brings
what they call boom sound with dual
frontal stereo speakers that sound
better then let's just add on all the
Android jellybean features like Google
Maps for the best maps with turn-by-turn
and speech the text for search and
directions there's NFC for sending
content from one phone to the other and
Google now for happenings around you now
they're single piece aluminum body
design means no removable battery and no
expandable memory but guess what you
might not care now Apple's iPhone 5
brings a dual-core a6 processor that's
fast and snappy and Siri can do more
with sports movies and food
recommendations but it's still not as
accurate and it still takes way too long
to get information back from its servers
Apple Maps is more than a step behind
Google Maps right now and passbook still
remains rarely use and the phone doesn't
have any kind of built-in NFC can you
guys guess who takes this round it's the
HTC One with another perfect 5 and the
iPhone gets a 4.3 next round is web
browsing and multimedia the HTC One
comes pre-loaded with Chrome and the
default browser with Flash support now
we'll take chrome as one of the best
mobile browsers with incognito mode
synched bookmarks and a sweet tabbed
interface Apple bring Safari which is
also an excellent mobile browser but you
can install chrome and others on the
iPhone as well now most of the time with
multimedia people want to know about the
cameras and the HTC One takes a
different approach with a four megapixel
camera but they call it an
Ultra pixel that's able to gather more
information and handle lighting
situations better with similar results
as the best phone cameras now we know
megapixels don't really matter and the
iPhones 8 megapixel camera has been one
of the best so here's the breakdown in
our camera test both cameras can take
1080p video and both cameras took great
pictures but the difference is that
specifically in low-light situations the
HTC one excelled with more image detail
and handled dark conditions better
compared to the iPhone 5 in our examples
but then at normal daylight situations
the iPhone had an advantage with
slightly sharper and more saturated
images compared to the HTC one that
still took great pictures but they were
a little duller with color temperature
pretty much being the same for both
now the other advantage the HTC One has
is a more expensive camera that can take
pictures with different filters and
really extensive editing features for
retouching people's faces different
effects transforming the images in
different ways and then the ability to
remove objects from a picture with their
Zoe feature that is Krait now the
ecosystems are extensive and Google Play
has done a great job of catching up as a
legit option and movies look and sound
amazing on the HTC one but we also know
Apple still has the advantage for more
exclusive content on iTunes and apps
that come out on the platform first now
the HTC One has really raised the bar
with what a camera can do but a lot of
people would still rather take the best
camera overall this one's a toughy but
the HTC One gets up 5 and the iPhone 5
gets a 4.7 so after averaging 4 rounds
the HTC One still leads but by a smaller
margin the final round that decides it
all is performance
both phones are snappy performers and we
always tell you the same disclaimer that
your call quality will vary on your
carrier and location but from our
testing both phones sounded great the
battery life is going to be different
for everyone but the ACC one has a power
saver mode that's handy to turn off
functions to save you juice over time
now in our battery video drain test both
phones were close to 10 hours of juice
and that's pretty much a push these two
are great performing phones but we're
handing out 4.7 points to each phone
because there's still better performing
ones out there
so let's average out all 5 rounds and in
a prizefight with the ACC one jumped out
early on Apple it stayed on top with
three perfect rounds taking this battle
for point eight
the four point five and is your prize
fight winner the smartphone world is
only getting more competitive and we'll
find out how Samsung Apple Google and
others step up their game with their
next flagship phones
i'm brian tom thanks for watching we'll
catch you guys next time for another
prizefight
