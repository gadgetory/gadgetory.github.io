Dreyfuss and welcome to rumor has it the
show where we round up the week's
biggest tech room and then we vote on
what sounds legit and what seems like it
will never ever happen and remember that
you can vote on all the rumors too so
keep your eyes out for the pole in the
interactive player if you're watching on
cnet first up is this a weird mysterious
fifth-generation iPad as 9to5 mac claims
it is is your new new iPad already
obsolete again of course it's obsolete
it'll always be obsolete as Apple
releases a new version every year but
you already knew that my first
generation iPad has been obsolete since
like a month after I bought it is this
slightly scuffed and taped up back piece
and actual part of the new device though
nobody knows if it is the new iPad is
going to have a thinner bezel even
thinner than the ipad for something akin
to the ipad minis however that's an
obvious change if you can eliminate a
bezel you do an apple is definitely
trending toward edge to edge screens so
this could just be a very well executed
and not particularly insightful great
guest by an accessory maker next
according to the site Ad Age YouTube is
aiming to offer paid channel
subscriptions this year the paid
channels would likely be created by
large media companies that already have
channels and lots of subscribers the
channels would cost between one and five
dollars a month a YouTube rep told CNET
that they've been looking into a
subscription model for years YouTube is
supposedly also eyeing a plan to charge
for other items including entire
libraries of videos live events and
advice shows the pay channels which are
rumored to launch next quarter would
still have ads in them so now you'd be
paying to watch videos plus you'd get
ads so sounds exactly like cable TV only
cheaper or Hulu Plus the only good thing
about this though is that it would
encourage higher-end better content on
YouTube even though nobody wants to pay
for YouTube moving on the rumored low
cost new iphone will be a cross between
the iphone 5 the 5th generation ipod
touch and the classic ipod says apple
news site I lounge I can feel your eyes
rolling from here you're thinking what
I'm thinking aren't all iPhones
cross between a phone and an ipod and
what does throwing the classic in there
even mean that it'll be thick and
plasticky yeah that's exactly what that
rumor alleges by going plastic Apple
would achieve that cheap price we've
been asking for and that cheap look to
this is one of those we have absolutely
no information about this but we really
want to add something to the story kind
of rumors credibility zilch desirability
a hundred who doesn't want a hundred
dollar iphone don't you guys want a
cheaper new iphone will it be made out
of plastic don't forget to vote in our
poll while we see with the cnet council
things the cnet council is composed of
five editors who cast their votes
anonymously their opinions are not an
endorsement by cnet or CBS interactive
obviously because these are rumors folks
and the cnet council's verdict is
absolutely not wow we had four editors
who said no Apple is not working on a
cheaper plastic iPhone in fact one of
them said heck no with four exclamation
points but one lonely editor did say yes
we have some sad news Emily's time on
rumor has it is coming to an end after
this shall only be with us for two more
episodes as she's moving across the
country to live in Harvard Yard sad
faces for everybody guys this is truly
very sad for me I'm so proud of the show
and I'm gonna miss talking to you every
week and getting to hang out with Korean
but it's not quite over yet let us know
what you want to see me do in my last
two shows do want me to juggle phones
that would be dangerous our talk and my
old lady voice or juggle while talking
to my old lady voice send us your
suggestions and share your rumors that
rumor has it at cnet com or call us at 1
800 750 cnet and tweet us and tune in
next week for more tech rumors
