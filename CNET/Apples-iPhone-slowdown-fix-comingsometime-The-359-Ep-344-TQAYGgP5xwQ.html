January 24th I'm BVG it's episode 340
friggin four of the 359 podcast and
today we've got our host of Roger Chang
and special guest what's his name Scott
storm Scott storms way cooler he's brand
new today Scott storm he's brand new to
the staff welcome to season aboard I'm
our new weather reporter weather tech
good to see you
I would loosen the weather tech weird if
you send chance of what that's all right
that's what we've got a limited time
today that's why we're starting a little
early so let's yeah stop screwing around
I think it's Scott screwing around ah
Roger what's on the dock right so we're
gonna be talking with god Scott on
specifically to talk about Apple's new
iOS 11.3 update when I'm talking about
advancements to or enhancements to a
arkad the whole dreaded battered a
slowdown controversy over the holidays
Apple has a fix for it but it's not
coming for a while we don't actually
know when it's coming
and then lastly Scott wrote a nice piece
on virtual reality finally cutting the
cords and we're gonna talk about what
that actually means and whether or not
you know it finally gets some mainstream
attention yeah but with that as always
if you have any questions live in the
comments section pick out the best
answer them in three minutes and 59
seconds standby and 3 - welcome to the
359 I'm Roger Cheng and I'm Scott Stein
Apple got into hot water over feature
that slowed down your iPhone to prevent
prompt with an older battery discovered
the discovery which led to massive
consumer backlash and anger
now apples teasing a fix for this
feature you so be able to turn off this
battery management system how big a deal
is this Scott it's really big because
the battery issues over the over the
past year were a big problem people were
concerned about their batteries
functioning and also older batteries
slowing down
which Apple admitted to slowing down
your the speed of your older phones
right and now it sounds like the new
update is gonna allow you to basically
have the option of not slowing down your
phone or giving you maybe more
diagnostic feedback right and we need to
replace your battery we don't know how
how well this is gonna work but it's
gonna be in the next version yeah so
it's part of a broader announcement of
iOS 11 0.3 which is coming in the spring
although this battery fix isn't coming
right away they do sort of tease that
it's coming in a beta later so it's
we're not sure one is actually gonna
show up right but TBD also one of the
big updates to iOS 11:23 are some new AR
tricks including the ability to
recognize walls offer crisper graphics
and just overall be more responsive now
you've tried AR kid extensively Scott
what what do you think of these
improvements I mean do you think beyond
it being kind of gimmicky and cool and
how useful is this stuff I think it's
great because going back to like what
Google did with tango as experimenting
with AR there's a lot more sensation of
boundaries and rooms and then they are
needs to do and apples actually was kind
of doing a few tricks where it just
recognized the floor and more advanced
stuff was not there now recognizing
walls it means you could like bounce
things off the walls it also means that
you could recognize walls and put things
on them more interact with them to sort
of have like magic posters that would
activate chart if kids got to see some
of that in action and in high resolution
because actually if you capture the
footage from that it's it's it's not
like right yeah it's pretty like it's
pretty low res how important is it to
have like with virtuality obviously you
need to have sharp images because you've
got images right there but whatever they
are do you really need that crisp
graphics does it make a difference you
will eventually on a phone you get away
with it but eventually let's say we're
talking to her towards glasses okay you
know adventure you know if you want to
build towards augmented reality really
becoming good at sensing things which is
half of the equation that's what a our
kid is solely building up to maybe the
other half is the way to display it into
your eyes gotcha alright to be continued
we don't you know yeah no totally stuff
is all totally mystery it's all early
and there's a lot going on with it now
next up is virtual reality you were a
great piece on how high-end VR systems
are finally gonna cut the cord this year
and those cords are pretty damn annoying
but yeah how big of a deal is this and
is this gonna lead to mainstream
adoption of your well the biggest
problem with VR there are a number of
them wine is that you know as many
people said it closes you off and then
you've got these cables especially with
PC stuff or you have to have extra
sensors or you know the price so I've
had a watt has a wireless setup that's
coming out later this year
I tried it you still have to put in room
sensors but it's not
to be wireless but you still have a
battery pack you still yeah I'm gonna
try the same system and it's how we're
to have this thing hooked here because I
feel like if I flung around too quickly
we just fly off and yeah kind of you
know and a big antenna on your head but
and then the other part are more
self-contained mobile headsets like the
daydream hmm so from a Lenovo oculus go
is coming eventually this will all be
built in I think that's probably the way
it's going to go but again you're gonna
have to buy specialized hardware versus
putting in your phone and I'll cos go
the standalone stuff from Google that
doesn't require high-end PC right no and
that stuff is all self-contained and
that's basically the way it could
companies want it to go just eventually
get rid of the PC altogether just buy
one piece of hardware but then how offer
you gonna upgrade that hardware right
and also being it right now I don't
think we're quite at that capability I
processor speed and all that stuff isn't
quite is it enough that we can actually
jam pack all the stuff into a standalone
VR headset no and that's why you look at
processors like Qualcomm is getting more
efficient at trying to do that oculus
has plans for that Wireless Santa Cruz
concept to basically sell be
self-contained but we haven't really
heard much more about that yet so it's a
dream but as processors get more compact
it's it's it's probably the way things
are gonna go vive is exploring mobile
only overseas yeah I know um and and not
doing that now because I think the goal
is for the mobile to catch up to be more
PC level speeds got it all right well
for these stories and more chicken
sounds seen it I'm Roger Jang I'm Scott
Stein thanks for listening nice job
we're still on skype so you say that the
VR closes us off I say maybe it frees
your mind nothing it's true well
actually it's a matrix reference oh I
wish I was like trying it I was like I'm
so bad that he made escorts oh one more
man I'm gonna go ahead and say it better
than the matrix ooh about 13th floor
commercial
I don't remember 30 I don't remember it
yeah you know it's better than the
matrix what eXistenZ I'm seeing that
either watch eXistenZ I'm the only one
who likes existence
that's a chronic course it is it's a
it's I think it has a lot of weird stuff
in it it also deals a lot with like
gaming live-action gaming culture I
think it's I think it's more
forward-thinking metrics I actually
haven't seen it I will check it out
though check it out you'll probably know
the second Kornberg reference you've
made like in the last hour it's Colonel
Berg day it's also Elton John be I'm
going to check out that's true speaking
of AR right yeah our little mystery
event I'm going at 12:30 that's being
live strain Elton John's website there's
an Elton John event I don't know if
Elton John will actually be there I
really hope he's gonna be there yeah
it's I've been told to be prepared to
see Elton John is you've never seen him
before in some new and exciting way and
it's ad really means it sounds like
we're supposed to be there like now I am
supposed to be the chicken isn't know
it's in 28 minutes we're good blocks
away second time but it is so
simultaneously and tweeted by the
account in Kings Cross station in London
which I did not get a chance to see to
see take a breath there was a player
piano set up there where if you stood in
front of a display you could then see
that 70s augmented reality Elton John
seemed to be playing at the piano Oh
like a little hologram like an AR KITT
thing alright and it was a selfie thing
so people a lot of people took selfies I
talked to one Twitter user who I talked
about in the story who nicely told me
about what it was like and let me use a
couple of the photos for the story so
that was there and they were handing out
Google cardboard little things
advertising the event to watch it I
guess
oh so it is a VR thing so it is VR okay
and we were not sure what it was gonna
be like what degree and apparently
YouTube employees were there so is it
related to Google YouTube is that one
part of it maybe that maybe um my guess
would be talking about some Vegas II
event with Holograms yeah and then if
you're following it remotely something
like you to be with the re 60 video yeah
it's some new way to follow him in VR
all right what what questions do we got
Adobe into the chat first of all shout
out to Wilton Wilson from Jamaica we got
a new international listener
then our old buddy Michael Brown says
I'm sure we'll get a WWDC predictions
episode but what are some announcements
we'd like to see a wd / early for that
is that's a good question that but it's
really not that's good right very fast
Google I come up very fast yeah okay
just got announced the year just goes by
in a flash and I'm preparing for the
next year and I know where ICS all over
and then I came to 20 fire always
thinking about this stuff I am thinking
about it so my thoughts right now for a
quick answer would be I just think about
last year and things I still want to see
we talk about health I mean Apple has an
eleven point three more health medical
record type stuff I think they're gonna
talk a lot about more connected medical
tech and health tech Apple watch needs
work with continuing to push coaching
and that type of stuff maybe they'll get
into more heart heart rate accuracy also
I'd really want to see a damn watch face
store because there's never been one
yeah
well overdue and I think it would make
it would be the best thing for the wall
they ever come out with a round watch
I'm just waiting for a round now I mean
I think you're I think you're onto
something but then they have to redesign
all the apps I know I know just they're
gonna do it in like a few years and and
make it like it was the first one you
know SmartWatch that's route a rats made
by a burst round watch in history
whatever with the rotating bezel yeah
all the Samsung oh really you know it
but also this one has an alarm right
there'll be some new twist i alarm I do
think that that's it for that iPad I was
disappointed by iPad overall last year
even though I think the pro got better I
want to see it step up to become much
more of a computer including connected
accessories including really pushing it
forward like if it's gonna be your
computer I know it can be a computer now
but it's not it's still missing some of
the key things that I need on a daily
basis and I hope they focus much more on
that Mac I do not know I feel like Mac
at this point feels like it's a dying
off vestigial tail yeah just because
they're not advancing you'll buy them I
mean it's still buy them very healthy
business doesn't seem like they're ever
intending to put touch into Mac right
they'd sooner evolve
the iPad into a math either way for iOS
to get patch up yeah yeah or make a
hybrid thing and then iPhone I mean I
think whatever the ten started they need
to continue yeah
the ten is the big step so now it's
about what do you do with those cameras
in the front maybe you had depth sensing
and they're not gonna talk about depth
sensing in the back a our VR because
last year Apple talked about VR with its
max they're in the game with VR so I'm
and they talked about at WWDC so that
could be a thing all right
I don't know and smart home there you
hide while you're on the topic Matthew
dad sure wants to know if there's going
to be an update to the iPad Mini I think
I think that face says it all I think
yeah I love the iPad Mini when it first
came out I don't think so I think it's
it's fading yeah yeah iPad Mini 4 was
the last one although you can imagine
that with you know the like the iPhone
10 design they could shrink down the
normal iPad bezel they could doing the
whole face ID thing I mean they there
are ways to shrink it down so it's close
to the physical size of an iPad Mini but
yeah I agree I don't think the iPad Mini
is actually gonna get a real update I
don't think they care too much about
that line anymore it's true it's a shame
because it's it's good for kids and that
brings up one final thing about WotC
kids not coding and programming but
there were a lot of talk about how Apple
isn't attend enough to user accounts and
kid yes yeah yeah yeah and I think
they're well overdue and getting
Google's done this for a while now they
have um yeah so you got my kid devices
like help people out here like you know
come up with better kid accounts yeah
especially they want kids to be using
these in school and at home and
programming like we use one Apple ID
I guess there's family accounts too but
they're hard to set up brand it's all
kind of a mess right now as far as that
goes so I think that could be addressed
question from imagine soggy does a
touchscreen really matter on a Mac
unless you're transitioning it into a
tablet and really doesn't matter too
much I mean I think that's the thing
like we kind of want the best both
worlds are there a lot of great pcs that
our computers as well as tablets it's
actually they fold down I mean yeah I'd
love to see some some innovation from
Apple on that end
and it's not I don't think it's and/or
it's like it's both differents different
cases for different uses right like I
want a tablet for casual reading but I
want the full computer experience if I'm
typing or doing some publishing or you
know dealing with our CMS but it'd be
nice to have the option right now there
really isn't that option it's just it's
just the Mac with no touch
it doesn't matter until you need it and
then it matters so like and kids
naturally want to touch screens it's
like there's yeah normal I know the
thing that just have the keyboard is
pretty unnatural fur for anyone under
what 18 at this point yeah I mean what's
a keyboard there you go and yeah what's
the back to the future to reference use
your hands where's Alfred when you need
him seriously yeah we're low on
Millennials the at least in this room is
out looking around this office for that
that's true in the in this current room
in my in my body yes alone is you know
you know what the thing that really
indicates they need touch the touch bar
that was like a flag to me yeah
Apple knows that touch on a Mac will be
useful but they're trying to kind of
paste together kind of had your bet on
that I think that's why a lot of reasons
why it didn't work for a lot of people
is that it's not the same thing because
you're very limited yeah but touch is
useful like you know to be able to pull
up options quickly you can do a lot of
things faster on an iPad or iPhone
versus a Mac and there are some things
you do more efficiently on a Mac which
is why I want a hybrid ya want the iPad
laptop or just two different options as
a consumer yes I mean the all-in-one is
an outdated model people have different
purposes for different devices even if
the devices are rather uniform well
that's the thing though I I disagree I
think the they're not all in ones that
there are basically laptops that can
transform into right whatever device you
need at the time whether turns into a
tablet flips into a tablet when you need
it I Swiss Army knife they just need to
they need to Apple drop your Ike
invention take a note from the switch
and other things like modular the iPad
should become a laptop when you need it
not just through a floppy keyboard you
should be able to go get get a bass if
you want to get one and then instantly
goes into Mac mode shouldn't be hard
eventually to get there look a little
bit hard I'm I'm not an engineer and I'm
like it shouldn't be hard but the
processors are at the point where
they're at the speeds yes Mac but there
were they're running off different
architectures right now they are other
verses x86 so that there's rumors about
that drifting into arm drifting
animatics there's been rumors about that
for a while yeah they just I don't know
if it's technically you're right I think
it's feasible but I feel like Apple is
unwilling to make that move it's a big
move it's a it's a giant move but I
think considering the Mac you can move
huge move to make it a subset of iOS
would piss off a lot of people who use
Mac's but I think that's more of what
the use case is in the future sure to go
into Mac mode that's what I want to see
I don't want them to fuse and become
like a David Cronenberg know what fly
there we go you have two different I
don't want brundlefly well I mean trying
to process that image in my head you
need an iPad the wouldn't that just work
with an iPhone when the idea like you
just dock your iPhone and that becomes
the Mac I mean yeah your speeds are all
the same look at CES those phones with
PC things yeah we saw the razor one
right you got your phone into a laptop
and it becomes the brain like Motorola
tried this several years ago like eight
or nine years tricks but the Atrix did
not work out so well because process B's
weren't there yet but and the razor one
was like it's fast combined lot faster
yeah I think again it sounds silly until
I think if I were out somewhere and like
it CES and I need to file a story and if
I could just like have a keyboard and
somehow my iPhone some magic device
maybe maybe it's a laptop with a doc you
put it in but like if I could just file
something with that and maybe it's too
weird and cumbersome but yeah
yes I would find that helpful in theory
in practice and what is that device yeah
brand-new seated employee Scott Stein
with lofty dreams more than yeah it's so
funny you bring up and start going down
that that path there because a dog great
screen name it's asking if you think a
Samsung is going to do something or if
Apple's gonna do something like the Dex
doc like Samsung I would love to see
that I don't think it's gonna happen
they seem to want to keep those two
worlds separate and you know it's like
if you want to do like proper computing
you get a Mac if you want your sort of
more casual experience you've got an
iPhone you got an eye kind of bridges it
but not really and I like the Dex
I like the principle the Dex I don't
know if like I found it particularly
that useful yet but it really is a
matter of like getting the right apps
and just yeah you know having it be more
useful but it's just I like the idea of
it I reviewed the Dex last year and I
was pleasantly surprised because it
again I agree you have to bring a
monitor bring your own monitor um it's
sort of not used to a laptop setup and
now you have to set up on desktop but
it's cool and if you work in Google Docs
and drive and stuff it worked
you're pretty golden yeah so again maybe
I just maybe goes back to that fantasy
of Mak mode like if they had a lite
version of like a computing environment
that wasn't forcing you into an iOS II
thing such thing was what I find
annoying a little more mouse-driven
touch pad you could get into those
things they've been avoiding then you
could then you could maybe have a phone
be part of it or an iPad I think will be
really helpful for like anyone who needs
to use a computer like schools mmm
I just think it expands it would help
them expand the footprint where it's
like maybe that's the new Mac Mini where
it's like you have this light Mac
environment that allows people to use a
computer but not have to jump through
the iOS hoops as long as some
third-party creative out there develops
a skin that makes it resemble sound away
from the Transformers I'm in we have
just a few more minutes left let's slam
through some more questions Louise what
would it take for Apple to surpass the
camera quality on the Google pixel - how
do you think
the red phone will do against both of
these mmm good questions
punt I have no idea I well I'm not a
camera tech expert really
I follow cameras a lot because of phones
but in terms of like you know the
advances between all of them I mean I
think what Google is doing is you know
they're writing the best advance of like
using computer advances in photography
and and they're do they're doing a
better job at at low-light I think it's
gonna be a leapfrog rollies come yeah I
don't think at this point the hardware
even matters as much as really the
megapixel count doesn't matter as much
anymore it's like I feel like if there's
a race behind the scenes with the
software side yeah both optimizing for
right now Google has the edge with all
those different words they like to use
yeah
but they definitely have the edge when
it comes to the chemical it's not a huge
edge I mean most people can't see it
that's a super close race and sometimes
between you see these tests between like
even Samsung and Apple and Google
certain things edge out with one other
terrible photographer like it doesn't
really matter what phone camera you have
it's probably gonna suck so you know
it's it's it's a little bit more than
just quality but I think there is a bit
of an arms race and a lot of it is I
think software driven as to who can
optimize their camera better that sort
of wars come down to yeah like Google's
taking the crown last two years so yeah
it'll be great the red phone were I had
some great new advancing camera
technology like all this I was reading
about it the last day or two didn't seem
to mention the camera much I was like
everything else and so that made me a
little concerned because I felt like the
RET whole thing about red is the camera
oh yeah I'm in lead I know like idea of
the red cam I don't know that much about
it
yeah folded that closely because it's
for me it's like a niche product but
people aren't gonna buy this thing it's
that holographic display yeah like what
is that a 3ds like what is that what are
we what are we talking Amazon fire phone
all over again
it is alright we are running down the
clock here let's squeeze out a few more
syringe Oh in the future can we see a
Nintendo lab oh like DIY setup but with
a VR headset instead of the switch ah I
tweeted a picture of
enjoy you were like on fire with your
questions good last three days have been
like solid I put my switching in Google
cardboard and put out a photo that was
like lab Oh 2.0 um I think you maybe it
could be onto something like I seems
like a no-brainer to me yeah yeah
Nintendo I think what's most things
about lab well we talking to this for a
while and today was the day that my son
actually got sad about throwing out
cardboard this morning and I thought
okay kids like cardboard this is smart
smart marketing move every kids played
in a refrigerator box made a for it
something a frickin love cardboard so
Nintendo I think is also doing a bit of
a clever hedge where the their producers
talk to them before it talked about new
ways to play and instead of buying a
whole new accessory that's plastic this
is kind of like in between words you're
getting whole new accessories but
they're kind of temporary but they're
also for a while it's genius I thought
yes and it made me almost want to go but
I want the cardboard more than this yes
right just for the imaginations like
getting a new my Lego is my wife would
actually appreciate the process of
making one of these things even more
than the actual games like she just
loves you know folding an origami like
yeah I mean I grew up with a rector sets
Lincoln Logs connection that's kind of
becomes like a kind of a stem kit like I
think its own experience in building the
actual accessory yeah tactile toys again
wild thought I know so I think it's
exciting for that I'm worried about the
stuff breaking of course but I think it
also allows them to kind of experiment
without having to fully commit so then
yeah you could have a VR headset without
being like we're making a VR headset but
it's like a project kit yep so totally I
think you know why not an app and Apple
Nintendo has done a are for years the
3ds was one of the very first AR game
systems where you could put down those
cards and play all sorts of games so so
was Elton gage yeah although the switch
doesn't have a switch doesn't have a
camera Touche
heywhy minute left exactly one minute
left rapid-fire Matthew dad sure in the
wake of the fixes for spectre and the
meltdowns slowing down of desktops and
laptops doesn't that put the iPhone
slowdown in perspective uh well I mean
those
it's important oh those arms were also
affected to the percentage of yeah arm
ships were also yeah so it's I feel like
that's capsule dogs there cuz that's
like apples and oranges apples an orange
I didn't want to use the apples and
oranges reference but uh how long have
that trademarked probably about the pain
like five cents now crap there goes our
budget for this yeah but I feel like
it's those are two different things I
mean one was apples specifically
addressing the broader anniversary issue
of battery slowdown and battery
deterioration this other one is a flaw
that was found in other phones and on
PCs that's hard to come I feel like it's
hard to compare those two yeah I think
they're I think they're pretty different
and apples is more of a customer service
type thing
yeah I think it's like you know this is
about how long is a battery gonna last
for your phone
how much heads up replacing that battery
it's all self-contained in one
experience it's not it's yeah that
that's pretty different
alright we are out of time but one last
final thought Michael Brown wants to
know if you were all to give Apple a
grade for 2017 what would you give Apple
teacher professor professor technology I
don't want to give him a grade there are
a lot of ups and downs
I thought the iPhone X was I mean it did
well where water was it was that's it
was the necessary step up and then
there's a home Padre you know I like the
AR advancing just a are in a big way be
able to do it on phones and they really
kicked feel like a that first year it
wasn't like they didn't hit it out of
the park but they had it was a
significant year for Apple in many ways
just they had a couple of stumbles my
first grade that comes to mind is B+ but
yeah I'd give him a solid passing b- but
willing to let them make it up over
summer school there you go
yeah the whole pot is the the big like
TBD as to whether or not it was a really
successful year I think the I think they
leaned plus because like at the end of
the year they missed that assignment due
date yeah I did look at the end of the
year they redesigned the iPhone in a way
that price aside a lot of people have
been waiting for yeah
and were generally pretty satisfied with
so that think about how many years we've
been waiting for a new design and we go
what sounds the same
right so that's that's positive I mean
there's nothing that was like a failure
but I feel that there wasn't a lot of
fantastic not a lot of fanfare either no
not a lot of fantastic advancement and a
lot of things think I've said this over
and over but like and there's not when
they talk about products they don't say
it this way but some things did feel
more iterative well you know it's like
the new version of blank and that's what
happens but that's why a are is one of
the more singular things of the year
because it is a new territory yeah and I
think that actually lingers is one of
the most interesting things well said
well said I think we're gonna see a lot
more from this new guy Scott as we're
