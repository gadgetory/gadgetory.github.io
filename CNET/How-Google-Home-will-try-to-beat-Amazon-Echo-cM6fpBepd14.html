spot on the home voice assistant throne
based on the demo we saw at Google's
developer conference yesterday Google
has a three-part plan of attack to take
on Amazon and Alexa who is that for me
first a more conversational voice
controller system in the video a kid ask
Google home 3 straight question ok
Google how many guys are on our galaxy
well there are about 100 to 400 billion
stars according to space.com which star
is the closest according to NASA the
nearest star system is Alpha Centauri
Google home uses the context of the
previous question to answer the next one
Alexa the voice assistant in the Amazon
echo can't do that yet she can respond
to some basic internet searches Alexa
three stars are in the galaxy our galaxy
has 300 billion stars Alexa which one's
closest I don't know that one but I'm
working on including more local
businesses to be fair Google Homes demo
is just that it's a pre produced demo
but the Google assistant on any current
Android phone has similar contextual
awareness ok Google how many stars are
in the galaxy 100 billion stars ok
Google
which ones closest according to Hubble
Space Telescope the closest spiral
galaxy is Andromeda
since what Google can do now isn't that
far off there's no reason to think
Google home isn't gonna deliver on that
conversational functionality but Amazon
updates Alexa all the time so by the
time Google home hits retail shelves
Alexa might be much more conversational
her self second syncing with multiple
devices we have an echo here in the
living room and an echo over there in
the family room
they won't talk to each other Google
home promises to talk to any chromecast
device that's how it sends the picture
of the star to the TV in the video and
how it sends the song to multiple rooms
to wake up the kids
third customizable design people love
personalizing their electronics and
you'll be able to swap out the bottom of
Google home with different colors and
materials to match your home's decor the
Amazon echo just has one first party
action it's a tall black cylinder so
Google home wants to win the design
battle but some people think it looks
like an air freshener so we'll see so if
Google comes through on all of those
promises it could be better than the
Amazon echo but Google hasn't said a
whole lot about smart home integrations
yet there was that one part of the video
where they use a voice command to turn
on the lights in the bedroom but it
hasn't offered a lot of specifics and
the Amazon echo is a great smart home
controller that's why we use it in the
CNET smartphone so if Google falls
behind on those integrations the echo
could still be our first choice as a
personal assistant either way looking
forward to the battle ahead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
