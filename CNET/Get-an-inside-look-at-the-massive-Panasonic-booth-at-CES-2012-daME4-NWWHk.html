Panasonic booth at the first day of CES
2012 and I'm here to give you a quick
tour of what's going on so as you can
see this looks more like a warehouse in
a booth because panasonic has a 10 going
on this year starting with this
beautiful amphitheater right behind me
ok panasonic has over 60 televisions
here with a theater to show off their
passive 3d technology they're also
partners with the Olympics this year so
they want to show that off but let's
make our way into the booth where
Panasonic is showing off some of their
eco ideas and one of them is the
electric car so no they're not actually
going to make the cars but they're
bringing the technology that goes inside
so they've got wireless charging and
they're bringing that technology for
manufacturers to implement and they also
have an actual charging option but
that's a future technology they're
working on over here to my right you'll
see there they've got their eco-home
ideas so how can we make homes greener
what kind of tech can we bring in there
so they've got an actual home set up
inside with the theater and doing some
briefings about that but let's our make
our way over here to the panasonic lumix
area lumix is there actually their
flagship brand for cameras and they
really want to give you an in-depth
experience of what's going on so to my
right you'll see a beautiful wall of
photos of taken on panasonic cameras and
over here they've stepped it up a notch
with their booth babes this year ok oh
yeah it's pretty crowded this year
whoops all right let's make our way over
so as you can see they've got booth
babes that can actually play soccer and
why are they doing this because they
want you to get a hands-on experience of
what it might look like in real life if
you were using their photos so here we
go hopefully when these ladies kicks the
ball and if they did you'd be able to
boom shoot a photo and see just how fast
that shutter speed is but let's make our
way through this is probably the
most crowded CES to get there about Oh a
bazillion people here and to me it seems
like they're all right here at the
panasonic booth right now so let's go
over here and show off some of the 3d
camera technology so they're bringing 3d
cameras to the home they want to put
this on the shelves of best buy so for
example here is one of their flagship 3d
cameras it actually has two lenses right
here for that 3d and you also have the
option to take 2d phone and if you do
you can use one lens for distant for far
away photos and one lens for close-up so
you're actually taking two photos at the
same time okay over here they're showing
you what those photos might actually
look like once they're taking so um
you've got the active 3d glasses to show
you that here and then over here is
their 3d camcorder technology again
we're seeing 3d actually come into the
homes making it available for just about
anybody who wants to get their hands on
it alright so out of the camera section
let's make our weight down to the
pianist the second level of the piano
sonic booth yes panasonic has two levels
this year it's that massive I have never
seen anything like it so down the stairs
we go and as you can see this entire
section is really dedicated to the home
theater we saw that announcement
yesterday they're introducing some new
features like myspace we'll see how that
catches on but for now they're also
introducing their first oh no problem
I'm their first passive 3d technology so
this is something that vizio and LG have
done for a while it lets you use those
theater 3d sorry guys hey just making
our way through I'm going to use this
theater 3d glasses or instead of the
active ones i actually have mechanics
inside so as we make our way through
you I want to show you something that
I'm really excited about that Panasonic
is doing they want to bring together the
home again this year at CES I'm really
feeling that you know how can we bring
all of our gadgets together how can we
marry these so right over here at this
booth and this guy is demoing here he's
showing you how you can download the
Panasonic iOS apps to not only control
your TV like you would a remote but you
can actually browse the web on your iPad
and anything you see on your screen you
can just flick over to your television
but not only that if you have photos or
videos that you shot on your iPad you
can actually show those on the TV too so
that really brings together you know all
of your devices and all of the content
that you have at home I'm kind of like
airplay but Panasonic's version so I'm
happy to see other people do that too
now as we make our way over here we have
some of Panasonic's plasmas again
they're known for their plasmas but this
year they're really bringing the 3d
technology and most of their TVs
interestingly enough have 2d to 3d
conversion now with that built-in Wi-Fi
VAT all their TVs have you can actually
stream 2d content and convert it to 3d
on the fly which i think is awesome
because it kind of brings that 3d home a
little bit more so over here you'll see
the et/5 is their first LED LCD 3d TV
that's over 42 inches and it's passive
so again this is the first time
Panasonic is getting to the passive 3d
technology it's not as good you can't
get as high resolution as you can with
active 3d technology but but it's
cheaper easier to produce and we're glad
to see Panasonic do it so for Steve come
here from the Panasonic booth I'm Sharon
Vaknin and stay tuned for more live
