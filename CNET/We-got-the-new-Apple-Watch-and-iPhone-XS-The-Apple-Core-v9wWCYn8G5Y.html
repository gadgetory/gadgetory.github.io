and the 10 X map the 10s max an early
look at the Apple watch series for and
where did the air power mat go let's get
right into this week's Apple news and
rumors all right so now that we've seen
apples a new lineup let's go back for a
second and talk about what we didn't see
at the event so iPads Mac books Mac Mini
air pods and air power now that doesn't
mean we won't see these products before
the end of the year after all Apple has
been known to host an October launch
event in years past but I'm starting to
think that the air Powermat will not
live to see the light of day first off
we've got no mention of it at the event
not even like a hey it's coming soon
don't worry and secondly Apple has
erased all traces of it in its website
this is kind of like the tech equivalent
of deleting all traces of your X on
social media after you've just broken up
either way it's not looking good a
report from John Gruber mentions
overheating issues caused by those
multiple charging coils as a potential
culprit while a longtime Apple analyst
Sonny Dixon goes on to say that the mat
is having communication issues so it's
having trouble figuring out the charging
levels of these different devices
neither say that it's flat-out canceled
at this point but Apple is running out
of time if it wants to deliver within
the 2018 timeframe the company had
promised last year or in the words of
Gruber the air power could be truly and
on a more positive note the iPhone 10s
and the 10s max make their official
debut on Friday September 21st and in
the meantime the reviews have already
started flooding the internet it seems
like the consensus is that they aren't
all that much different from last year's
10 aside from that larger screen and
that better processor our o senior
editor Scott Stein spent some time with
these phones and to him the biggest
surprise was that the phones aren't all
that different in terms of size or at
least they don't feel that way he also
said that the smart HDR feature on the
camera
makes a big difference when it comes to
photography so stay tuned for more
comparisons to come from cnet.com but if
you're thinking of upgrading your phone
he says you're probably better off
waiting for the 10r
or just upgrading to iOS 12 now let's
get to why Apple finally released its
iOS 12 update this week for its mobile
devices alongside watch OS 5 for the
Apple watch Mac OS Mojave for the Macs
and TV OS now I can't tell you to go
ahead and download it right away you may
want to see if there are any issues down
the road but what I can say is that I
definitely noticed a performance
improvement with this new version of the
software now I'm not just talking about
newer devices even if you have an iPhone
5s or above you will notice considerable
performance improvements where it
matters I'm not talking about the flashy
new features like in years past but
these are - the day-to-day tasks that
you do on a regular basis that really
matter when it comes to your phone
watch OS 5 also brings new features to
the Apple watch including a walkie
talkie app more watch faces but I'm
actually most excited about those new
fitness features which include automatic
workout detection except sorry no
cycling and those tools for runners
including those gentle pace alerts that
let you know when you're going too slow
and speaking of Apple watch I got it
I just finished setting up the Apple
watch series for and I'm gonna be
testing it out over the next few weeks
testing out all the new features
unfortunately one of the coolest ones in
my opinion that EKG feature will not be
available at lunch but that doesn't mean
there's not plenty more we can do with
it I'm actually wearing it alongside the
series 3 just start getting a feel of
what's new what's different is it worth
the upgrade for starters I actually want
to show you the screen size I have them
both with the same watch face already
and here's where you can really see that
difference in screen size the series 3
is the 38 millimeter and this theory
series 4 is the 40 millimeter both are
the smallest versions of each model and
look at how much more screen real estate
you're getting
what features do you want to see me try
out first let me know on the comments
section below or hit me up on Twitter
I'll be answering all your questions
about the series for in the meantime I'm
gonna take both these watches out for a
run
oh yeah and we still have that iPhone 10
are in the pipeline for October so this
Apple madness is just getting started
also thank you so much for your comments
last week I'm pretty sure collectively
we have figured out what the are in
iPhone 10 R stands for we have iPhone 10
regular iPhone 10 retina 10 rainbow
refurbished reduced ripoff or it's that
the R comes before the S thank you again
for all your comments and I will see you
next week with more apple core</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
