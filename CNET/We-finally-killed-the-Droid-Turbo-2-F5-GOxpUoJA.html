we're going to need to put this on
something we're going to need to do
something about this research thing is
don't touch it don't touch it
motorola says the droid turbo to screen
is shatterproof we've dropped it on
asphalt and concrete without any
problems so far no big cracks here or
there now we're gonna try something a
little more extreme here with me I've
got my colleague Vanessa from CNN
espanol and we're gonna put this to the
test we're gonna use some tools and see
if we can wreck this fit let me at it
x marks the spot one two
oh yeah submit a dust from the floor and
then we have a nice big toolbox here
nice big metal toolbox a bunch of stuff
in it three two one drop
got another ding up in the corner but
this screen looks like it's not correct
alright I'll go with this goes up
perfect okay
thank you Brian oh my gosh go ahead back
right over it it's fine there's no
cracks on the screen yeah I think we're
enough to do stress on the old more
extreme yeah moment of truth shall we do
this yes
I may look scrawny but I'm pretty strong
let's try this let's see this one -
whoa-oh-oh I think we got some damage
still seems to work though I think we
can do better than I think I think we're
gonna have to puncture it and I have
just the tool grand finale Sean yikes
I'll get out anyway Oh
and we're not gonna use hood oh my god
okay we punctured the battery it looks
like we're gonna need to put this in
something oh we're going to need to do
something about this research thing guys
don't touch it don't touch it
we're gonna need to get some kind of
safety bag for that and oh Jesus thank
you you're the best so we may have just
punctured the battery and set the phone
on fire and had to use a fire
extinguisher to make sure the rest of
the building didn't catch on fire as
well but as long as you're not planning
to do things that you really really
shouldn't do at home I think you'll find
the Droid turbo to see a very durable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
