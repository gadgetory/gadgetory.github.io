RCA studios in New York City April is
here so it's time once again to run down
the list of games I think you should be
checking out okay April not the hottest
month for games but a little bit of a
week showing still a few games were
checking out in chronological order here
we go up first on April 10th is
Xenoblade Chronicles 3d for the new
Nintendo 3ds does that sound familiar
well that's because this is the same
game from the original Wii and there's
also a little bit of a caveat you see
Xenoblade Chronicles 3d is only
compatible with the new Nintendo 3ds any
other 3ds system it's not gonna be able
to play the game kind of a bummer right
Nintendo you're so difficult sometimes
okay hopefully it doesn't get delayed
again but as of this recording grand
theft auto 5 is scheduled to finally hit
the pc on april 14th if you've been
patiently waiting for the game to make
it to pc you're in luck because it's
well worth the wait out the very same
day is mortal kombat x it's the ps4 and
Xbox one's first taste of over-the-top
brutal fighting action and of course
fatalities MK x carries the old versus
new generation theme by introducing a
new set of fighters including listen to
this Cassie cage who's the love child if
you will of sonya blade and Johnny Cage
how about that okay so one of my
favorite indie games from last year
shovel knight is going to be hitting the
trio of PlayStation platforms in April
specifically April 21st in shovel Knight
you assume the role of the shovel Knight
and you make your way through a series
of challenging levels and bosses it's an
awesome 8-bit throwback style that is
sure to pull at your nes heartstrings
the point-and-click adventure game
starring Elijah Wood broken age will
conclude with the release of Act two
later this month in April while PC
gamers have had act 1 2 playthrough PC
playstation 4 and vita owners will all
get the entire game simultaneously and
finally while it might be a tiny bit of
wishful thinking the crowdfunded mega
man inspired mighty number 9 is
scheduled to release in April an
outpouring of support from the community
allowed the game to hit nearly every
platform out there mighty number 9 is a
throwback side-scrolling platformer that
hopes the channel Megaman to a new
generation of gamers I've got my fingers
crossed that will see it finally in
April okay so that does it for me if I
didn't mention your most anticipated
game for April you can yell at me on
Twitter that's what everyone else likes
to do we'll see you back here in may for
a brand new list of games worth checking
out thanks everyone for watch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
