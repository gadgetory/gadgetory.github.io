with a compelling design language the
foundation of our design approach is
their hardware and software must work
together in perfect harmony and when you
I blend this to seamlessly the rounded
corner of our hardware are echoed in our
software this is reflected in our our
icons which have been simplified to help
you easily recognize and understand what
each one is we've taken a new approach
to presenting both content and controls
because we want the eyes to be drawn to
what matters rather than which is
distracted by things that don't we have
enough distractions don't we all the
important information you need is within
this floating on screen blocks which is
contrasted against the blank space
behind them first we improved the user
experience by making it easier to focus
on the task at hand
most smartphone UX were designed to
provide all the options and information
at a glance but with the constant
evolution of smartphone technology more
and more futures were added so consumers
were given far more options on screen
and this place became even more
cluttered which which can be hard when
you I remove this clutter making it easy
to focus on one thing at a time with one
UI the options on the setting menu has
been rearranged to grip relative
functions together this helps you to
find what they're looking for
straight away we've also regrouped the
functions so the most often ones come
first another example the phone app has
a cleaner look with one UI now you see
only the essential features related to
the task you're okay now
it's a continuous and fluid experience
where the necessary buttons appear when
you need them and gently disappear when
you don't for instance when you're
dialing a number the UI changes
accordingly the search bar and menu tabs
disappear that's because we know the
user plans to make a call we made a
fundamental change in the user interface
with one UI we have restructure the way
we interact with our devices now the
upper part of the screen is for viewing
while the lower part of the screen is
for touch interaction when UI places
everything you need to see where it's
easy to reach
it just feels much more natural to use
let's take another example the clock app
I set my alarm daily actually many
alarms to wake up and I also use the
time zone alert since I have the
pleasure of working with developers and
designers from all over the world
previously we provide multiple tips to
help you move between different
functions at the very top of the screen
this meant to reach the buttons at the
bottom you had to cover the distance
from one corner to the other now we've
moved the tab to the bottom of the
screen so they are easily accessible for
your thumb last year we introduced night
mode in Samsung internet app as a way to
offer a more comfortable reading
experience when it's dark
consumer told us how much they loved it
and that's why we have now applied it
across one new eye speaking of colors we
are offering something totally unique
within one UI a range of color direct
seemed to match the color of hardware
itself now your device seamlessly
reflects your preferences and style
by listening to our consumers we are
providing a user experience of a whole
helping users focus on the task at hand
interact more naturally with the device
and providing a more comfortable visual
experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
