surface book too it's a big powerful
laptop with Intel's latest 8 gen core
processors it's also a hybrid with a
detachable screen which works with
Microsoft sold separately surface and it
also has a new 15 inch screen size
option in addition to the original 13
inch version and that 15 inch surface
book comes with nvidia geforce 1060
graphics card which is more than
powerful enough for most games finally
it's got the hardware of software needed
for both new augmented reality
experiences and for VR gear like the new
Windows mixed reality headset this giant
grab bag of features leaves the surface
book to feeling like it's trying to be
everything for everyone I happen to
think it's more compelling as a laptop
than a tablet the hinge connection isn't
as simple as on other hybrids the tablet
half takes several seconds to unlock and
detach and you lose access to the GPU in
the process overall battery life however
is amazing 16 hours when you use both
batteries one in the keyboard base one
in the tablet app but just this habit
alone ran for about 4 hours
still playing games on this big
high-risk screen was great even though
the surface book 2 isn't explicitly
pitched as a gaming machine it certainly
works as one it is being pitched however
as an alternative to the 15-inch MacBook
Pro just with a lot more features packed
in I'll say this it matches up perfectly
in one area it starts with a similar sky
high price 2500 bucks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
