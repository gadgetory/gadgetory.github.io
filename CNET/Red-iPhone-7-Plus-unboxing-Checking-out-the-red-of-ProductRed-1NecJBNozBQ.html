new iPhone color its product red it's
actually the first iPhone that's been
made in red and it's going to be
available on Friday there are two models
you can pick from the seven or seven
plus we got the seven plus here and
we're going to open it up and show you
what's inside the box
so as you expect very similar packaging
to the iPhone 7 plus that's already out
there in different colors this one is
red on the back how red we'll find out
in a sec so you'd open up there's the
instructions this also is red and here
is the product red iPhone so it's in
there nothing else is red so you still
have the same ear pods that are white
and you've got white charger maybe in
the future you go for red one of those
who knows this is the case on the red
and we're to take off the plastic if
you're better look it's matte and has a
shimmery type of look Apple says that
it's a little bit darker red than
previous product red cases and iPods the
product red iPhone back looks great but
keep in mind that it's not red on the
front it's white so not bad but if you
put a case on it you're going to lose
the red so we've got a blue leather case
put the product red iPhone into there
now you're going to have a blue iPhone
so for lay it down there next to an
iPhone in matte black how red is that
red well let's compare against a few
other things that we assembled here just
to know Pokemon bulk pokeball well there
you go actually kind of similar to that
Rubik's Cube more dark red than that
coke can darker similar metallic type of
look Old Spice high endurance definitely
darker red you master yeah that's like
orange almost that's definitely
different clown nose see dad darker red
not clown nose matched and seen at red
ball let's take a look oh it's close
seeing that red ball is a brighter red
these hot sauce packets that were not a
bad match
we didn't try the sriracha that's
product red that is the product red
iPhone 7 plus and that's where you get
inside the box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
