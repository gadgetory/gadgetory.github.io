francisco california it's the apple byte
extra crunchy podcast with your host mr.
Bryant ah what's up everybody welcome to
the big show I'm adjusting my chair as
we speak just that my hair can be
appropriately framed in the camera
because when we do this live show extra
crunchy extra munch all that of we
obviously stream it live on youtube on
livestream we got my friends from
periscope watching maybe I don't I don't
know if we should do Facebook live it I
don't know if it would make I don't know
i don't think it would work like we have
to have an input into a phone or we just
another phones ice put another phone
yeah yeah yeahs have my own phone we
spend another phone yeah we might do
that if you guys really want that but we
don't want to you know this is for the
diehards is for the people that are
legit they want to know what's going on
with the world of Apple we start off
here this is episode 34 we're making it
we're making it beach oh yeah I've been
a year actually are you serious know
that we started last July or that makes
me feel old extra crunchy here we also
want to let you know this show is all
about you it's not about all about us 1
800 61 62 63 8 is the phone number to
call that's where you leave your name
number message in your comments we love
what you guys have been doing I think it
typically the calls and it's it's bling
it on there typically we get calls
around the time when big stuff happens
with Apple yeah we get good calls when
big stuff happens yeah just because
that's what everyone wants to talk about
so we're gonna start things off there is
plenty of news and updates and rumors
and everything that you guys know and
love first of all though catch you up to
speed apple reported their earnings a
few days ago uh and it wasn't good it
was really quite honestly shocking it
was their first year over you right
year-over-year revenue decline the first
since 2003 and just to put that in
perspective of where Apple was back then
apple announced that ipod for windows
would get itunes in 2003 that's how long
ago that was okay Wow since then Apple
has been in an uptick on every quarter
summertime out four times a year they
report their quarterly earnings duh
they've been up
free time until now 2016 q1 apples up
profit excuse me apples revenue 50 point
six billion dollars profit of 10.5
billion dollars that is down from a year
ago where the numbers were at 58 billion
and 13.6 who are the culprits that
really hurt them quite honestly it was
everyone iphone sales actual units were
down 10 million Mac sales were down half
a million ipad sales were down if i
recall right around 2.3 million and all
these are not I'm talking about not
talking about dollars we're talking
about units here oh okay so everything
that 10 million you can say that doesn't
seem that that's not big at all but you
did we're talking about units here yeah
multiply those unit numbers by seven
hundred dollars apiece that's that the
hence the drop in there yeah so you know
you look at this and I just want to
address all the haters right now looking
at you that continue to get mad and say
do you like you hate Apple we why do you
like talked about about Apple when we're
just merely stating the facts of the
situation that's going on and this is
the first time that you're actually
finally seeing some of those effects of
the ability of Apple just kind of
extending their products but not coming
out with anything new aka amazon echo
AKA vr AKA smart car AKA what else you
know Apple watch yeah actual apple like
an actual apple watch and we'll talk
about that more so during the earnings
Apple wanted to put kind of their own
take on it just to encourage investors
of where there might be more momentum oh
let's let's talk about you know what
also quick thing ipad pro right if that
ipad pro really made a difference you
would have seen that in the earnings
yeah they were still down half a million
ipad units apple says demand for the
iphone SE our favorite phone the 5-inch
phone with a iphone 5s and 6s parts and
technology inside they said the demand
is very strong as it in its exceeding
available supply that just might be
because they forecasted lower numbers i
think that next quarter depending on
what happens with the iphone I've got to
imagine it's going to be flat if not
negative
but if it is a little higher we can
probably attribute that to the
improvement of the iphone SE sales being
better than expected but i don't think
it's going to be anything monsters
monstrous stuff is going to come out
when the iphone 7 when that releases
then all those upgraders that's when
we're going to see big numbers so and to
apples credit it's not that the market
is even strongly the market smartphone
shipments in general has fallen three
percent annually also apples individual
global market share has fallen initial
at least a year ago it was at 16 i
believe it was at 16.3 and let me look
at these numbers real quick yes 16.3
percent global market share last year
now it's at 15.3 Samsung is still the
leader they pretty much Holt held tight
at twenty four percent but what we have
is competition from China hallway oppo
all these other smaller phones and it's
a market that Apple is really trying to
target that is where Apple is losing
market share and as well as the
smartphone market in general flat not
only flattening out but the client as
well I also think a lot of people are
tired of the you know upgrade every year
plan you know it's like I it's it's
expensive to upgrade so why buy a new
phone every year probably just gonna try
to hang on there the phone's a little
longer than usual you know that couldn't
have a lot to play in this you're also
right because the phones market is so
mature now really I feel like what we're
getting is one year we'll get we'll
always get a faster processor so forget
that but one year it's a better camera
and maybe an extra feature and then the
other year is an all new redesign that's
that's what we're getting at now the
point where it's just not the the
technology and what these things can do
has come has really slowed down and
definitely reached a plateau right it's
like where do we go next you know where
we gonna what are we gonna do next what
are we gonna be able to fold our phone
because I need a foldable I really need
a foldable phone yeah right it's been
like it as in general it has been slower
but now there's not that
don't think there's that extreme like
lust of before when phones were new ones
came out I had to get the newest phone
yes it was like I really I have to get
it now it's like uh well you know my
phone still is pretty kick-ass so I'm
can wait a couple years I mean the
bloodlust was high for a while but i
think it's i think it's cooled off a
little i'm just curious what other
people think if you guys want to call us
1 800 61 62 63 where are you and where
are your thoughts in regards to just are
you as hyped up about phone releases
every year or have you kind of lost some
of that have you lost some of that mojo
Shamar Iverson in YouTube saying back to
flip flo back to flip phones everybody
back to back I got the flip phone in me
going back to back all right um we do
also want to dress this the earnings
were so bad that the next day there was
a dead body found on Apple's campus no
I'm not I can only say that and make
light of it but really be serious about
it because I can explain myself that's
it it's actually a poorly it's a bad
joke it's not good but really what
happened here just two addresses an
employee was found dead in a company
conference room the day after apples
earnings yeah they don't they don't have
much details about it they said he was a
young man too so it's kind of out of
nowhere and again this guy has family
this guy has friends we don't know what
was actually going on with him maybe you
know there could be mental health issues
as well we just don't know but it
happened just right after earnings it
was like oh my gosh could you get any
more bad news going on over there yes
and someone like stop that right now you
could speculate us to uh he was a little
bummed out yeah he may he might have
been there were a lot of rumors flying
around of how or what might have
happened in that conference room but
we're just gonna wait they're doing an
autopsy on it we're not going to focus
on it too much but it is something that
happened and you're not going to just
ignore like if this is a show about
Apple news and someone died on their
campus and potentially committed suicide
well probably gonna mention it do you
want to hear the the Mercury News
dispatch audio from the call to the
police is it interesting enough to
listen to it could be could be
compelling let's hear
okay I'm what has working so far for me
at apple campus symphony for a gen 56
camp kidding we need to head the head
possibly has expired Wow okay that does
not sound like the reports we've been
hearing a lady bleeding from a head
wound and possibly had a gun that was
the initial reports so we have no idea
what's going on Wow we'll see we'll find
out we'll find out we'll find out um as
we transition from that you know the
question really about where's Apple
going and we've talked about this in our
prediction shows what can they really do
to stir things up what can they do that
really turn this train around turn this
in the right direction the iphone 7 plus
design drawings reportedly have been
leaked out by mac fan magazine and these
uh in the past they have actually leaked
out other schematics that turn to be
pretty accurate but this is the iphone 7
design and it still looks pretty much
exactly like an iphone 6s other than the
removing some of the antenna lines the
thickness of the phone and the
dimensions are exactly the same as the
iphone 6s the main difference is that we
said are going to be seen here at least
based on these drawings and they do
support the rumors but the schematics
are printing right on the money there
this is going to be the iphone 7 pro not
to be confused with the iphone 7 or the
iphone 7 plus there's going to be a
larger potentially rumoured dual lens
camera on this pro version of the phone
so think of this like the flagship of
the phones there is space on the
schematics for that the most interesting
thing to me is there is a smart
connector on the bottom and what that is
is up sorry let me rewind a little bit
there is no headphone jack just the
Lightning port like we've talked about
okay so that's there on this on these
schematics the other thing is the smart
connector for those of you who are
familiar with the iPad pro it's these
three little dots that allow you to
connect
their keyboard case the iphone this
iphone on the schematics show that it
also has a smart connector on the bottom
of the phone but what i thought this
could really be interesting for is that
this provides data it also provides
power so you think about those battery
charging cases that typically have to
kind of create this big fat chin on the
bottom of your phone so that it goes
into the Lightning port to do the power
transfer this could all be done now it's
the smart connectors on the rear base of
the phone you can actually make some of
these battery cases a lot more slim a
lot slimmer sorry more swim and that's a
good thing so that that's interesting
some people are saying oh you could dock
a keyboard case to it I you know I guess
you could do some keyboard type
accessory but this phone people are
asking about on periscope OLED display
no that is supposed to be coming
sometime in 2017 or 2018 people asking
about the all-glass body phone that is
still rumored for the next generation
and not for the iphone 7 so if you want
that don't don't I wouldn't cross your
friend I wouldn't hope for that don't
cry cross your fingers real hard if you
expect that's happening cuz i don't i
don't want all glass body thank you I
don't either I don't either I don't all
right next up the Apple watch can this
guy help turn this ship around I meant
to say ship I think I said train earlier
i meant ship ship or boat people
difficult to turn a train around i mean
i've seen it done in movies spider-man
stop a train with his feet that's right
right yeah um did you ever see that
train movie with uh Chris Evans that was
based off the Korean directors what is
it called with Denzel Washington oh no
the train movie with denzel washington
was like the airplane movie with denzel
oh that's right I forgot someone
someone's gonna tell him it's no
snowpiercer is that what it's called
yeah snowpiercer I think it's someone
threw that out there for me on the
scopes but um anyways back to the
stories Apple watch report here says
from the wall street journal that the
faster Apple watch too may feature
built-in cellular connectivity as well
as a faster
sir there you go boom okay uh early
reports said that the Apple watch might
be really more like an apple watch s
cycle and so if that's the case all
these rumors about maybe a FaceTime
camera and Wi-Fi and all the debt if its
cellular connectivity and a faster
processor that might be the Apple watch
two or the Apple watch s that's what
people been wanting you know something
that you don't have to have your phone
on you if you want to pay for you will
have to pay well yeah you'll pop to pay
double the data probably or they'll make
like some like tiered pricing or you
know if you have an apple watches five
dollars extra or something I have a
feeling Danny or you could just get just
Apple watch LTE would be cool just just
Apple watch else you would be nice so
who knows what they're gonna do I
actually don't care about the LTE aspect
my three things that I really wanted
this watch our Wi-Fi so that it can just
connect directly to I find more around
Wi-Fi that we can get access to i would
say arguably sixty percent of the time a
lot of okay so i want the watch to have
that it just has to piggyback back off
the fact that the phone is connected
Wi-Fi and sync up that way okay that's
that would be number one and then be
independent of the phone number two I
want apps that I actually are so
compelling that I'm like I actually need
to use this and three I've said this
before I wanted to have a feature that
no other watch has that makes it cool
that makes it quirky and it doesn't mean
it's necessary I want them to make it a
Dick Tracy watch I want a FaceTime
camera and be able to use my watch like
that oh yeah if it's the first watch
that could actually do that you might
use it once a month but damn you know
that's cool I'd probably use it more
views more on my family facetimes me all
the time yeah and I i faced time my lady
i faced on my nieces and nephews my mom
and dad my mother baby I mean who
wouldn't want to do that just for fun
you know that that that is one of those
things that would just be like and no
watch is doing that yet yeah so just do
it make make make it happen make it
happen so that's what I want to watch um
but in case you're kind of worried about
oh where where are these watches going
right where's the watch market going
strategy analytics just posted a report
that says the Apple watch
slipped down to fifty two percent of
global market share for smartwatches in
the first quarter of 2016 now last
quarter it was at let me look at this
really quickly it was at sixty-three
percent and this quarter it is now at
fifty two percent the disconcerting part
about this is that actual overall global
SmartWatch shipments have grown two
hundred and twenty three percent so that
means that apple's market share while
the general market has increased has
actually decreased of course we have
competition from like Android watches
and ties and watches and people are kind
of getting a little smart you would
think that if the Apple watch was a hit
that as the market share grew globally
the watch apple's market share would
grow as well you would think but that
hasn't been the case that hasn't been
the case just can't get a foothold yet
so uh it's one of those things that if
you ask the question okay if the Apple
watch is gonna do it are they are they
gonna help turn things around for Apple
I don't think so not yet at least unless
they put FaceTime on that watch gimme
Apple watch with facetime that's dope
people that know what that is referenced
people that know now they know they know
they know no um also apple just released
a bevy of updates overall safaris
technology preview three this is our
browser that has kind of hooks in it for
developers and what not to do different
things they've released an update to
that iOS 9.3 point2 public beta 3 is out
OS 10 10 point 11.5 dev beta is out
these are all out for their devices
nothing kind of major just a lot of
tweaks but the biggest thing that we
talked about a little earlier it's just
a bringing back low power mode and night
shift being able to be used
simultaneously yeah I need that sooner
than later Apple get on it get on it
what WWDC is in June so you're you you
actually see the beta have to suffer for
another two months you'll get an update
before WWDC and then they'll show you
the new version of those go off with OS
i OS 10.4 okay
or I don't know iOS 1111 yeah I'd be iOS
11 line goes to 11 it would go to 11 I'm
in other cool news just in general for
Apple they showed off their care kit
platform this is really a little
different than health care and research
kit which makes this different is that
it allows you the user to plug in and
pretty much log some of your symptoms
depending on your health related to
different apps so that it can be logged
and then shared with your health
provider it's kind of a day-by-day thing
that you can do because there's no
you're the one that would actually need
to be committed to it so there's four
care kit apps that are available as of
today glow nurture pregnancy tracker
doesn't affect me but might affect me in
the future well glow baby once the baby
is born it does everything from feed
schedules to grow charts these are both
free apps one drop is a diabetes
management app that provides OneTouch
logging of your glucose your food meds
and activity and then start is a
depression management app provides
testing and progress tracking to help
determine the effect of medications if
you're suffering from depression and
then by pumping this data in from
yourself this will give medical
professionals more information they need
to either see if these treatments are
helping you so I think this is actually
really this using our phone as a
middleman between us and our doctors and
healthcare providers it's not the
sexiest thing but it's actually really
cool it's happening though I mean like
we already do we have this app that we
use here at CBS interactive the tracks
are exercise that's writing habits or
sleeping habits it does all that stuff
and you can get points and win stuff so
it's happening everywhere you know it's
pretty cool so for those who don't know
what Stevens like really referring to is
like this app that is plugged into um
like these benefits yes health benefits
and basically CBS just wants is trying
to encourage you to not only use the app
to earn these points that are then can
help you get a discount on your health
care coverage yeah but it's basically
like um yeah you guys should be
healthier because we don't want you to
die and we don't want a head pay yeah we
don't want to be a health we don't want
to pay for you to die that's basically
what it comes down to you so we wouldn't
know if you're exercising we want to
know what you're eating I don't
being my phone is plugged into the
periscope but I don't remember what even
the Apple is called but I have it oh
yeah it's called I'll tell you we're
gonna find it for you i use it actually
do virgin pulse yeah the Virgin pulse
app virgin virgin polsat yeah and it's
actually virgin like the company you
know like virgin air oh yeah they have a
like a help their Halloween sort of
health thing and it's tied to my my
moves app which counts all my steps okay
so it lets counted absent yeah exercise
and then that syncs with that it's it's
all so complicated it is complicated um
carrick it though I think there are
little late to the game I don't know if
any of you remember but there was this
actual real clever app that you can
check daily called pms buddy i recommend
it for guys to track the cycle of their
ladies just in case it so you know when
to hide and dude I'm I'm serious about
that too I'm not even offending my babe
but like it can come in handy when you
need a psych kind of lay low a little
bit you're like walking home you get a
notification oh yeah it's late you're
when you're within that three or four
day rain we go to the grocery store and
make sure I get chocolates and
everything I don't even need to get
anything for her I just need to stay out
of her way I thought that's what it
comes down to well that's part of it
going in the grocery store hiding and
then groceries under an hour it that it
encourages to clean up around the
apartment so it looks so it's like oh
he's doing stuff okay well I'm gonna get
mad at anyone for guys to cos guys get
pms to man monthly there is there's
there's male pms but i don't know if
there's a way to track that there is
male pms oh yeah both site office
eyelids all right Apple Apple car news
Apple appears to be prototyping car
parts at its product realization lab
this is where they've really done
concepts or actual physical you know
models or form factors for things like
the max iPhones other apple products but
reports are saying that they're doing
this now in their own actual lab for car
parts they've also hired new engineers
from Tesla Andretti Autosport to kind of
push forward with this whole new car
initiative and also the other kind of
thing that
is a companion with this and we talked
about how hard it is to really make a
card and Steven can expand on this in a
sec is that handles blot reported that
Apple has been looking for a partner to
build this car for them okay they've
been looking they've been talking to
Daimler which is Mercedes manufacturers
mercedes-benz they've talked to BMW
which is obviously BMWs but both of
those manufacturers have ruled out and
have shut down talks of talking with
Apple to build apples idea of their I
car or their Apple car and one of the
debates is really a who is going to lead
the development of this car we know
Apple is a control freak so obviously
they'd want to be like yeah we're gonna
do it yes and daimler and BMW don't want
to just be the manufacturing you know
itches to it they don't want to be they
don't they don't want to be there it you
know I'm frantically looking for the
story because Roadshow has a story about
who they have tentatively partnered with
do you have magnet was a magnet
international right that's correct
Canadian Austrian based car manufacturer
they've been talking to them as well and
but debate you know the big boys are
like uh not only do we not know who's
going to take the leanest project
there's also debate between Apple
wanting to who gets to keep the customer
data right Apple wants to plug this into
their iCloud data system right get
information on not only driving
behaviors what they're using what
they're doing well Mercedes sorry
daimler and BMW they want their they
want that same information will it be
shared who stores it where how does one
get it right so that becomes an ugly
mess yeah totally and so they have
decided to yet not do it which again
kind of reinforces our talks earlier of
light it's really hard to make a car
yeah it's very hard and you know I did
recorded auto complete today with Brian
Cooley and there was another story that
Apple is secretly operating a lab in
Germany right now and they hired like
600 German auto makers you know to work
on this thing and Brian Cooley is kind
of speculating like he doesn't think
it's going to happen I mean it's it's
easy for Apple they can afford this they
can fire 600 guys
work in a lab and you know spend some
money it's possible but at the same time
like Wall Street is saying why why is
Apple gonna do this when their profit
margins are so high for like the iPhone
and other things like that like they
just make enormous profits off these
things and then if they get into the car
business the profit margins are going to
be extremely slim it's so risky for them
to do this like why would they do it
like they're just be crazy to do it
right but we keep seeing all this news
they're hiring the Tesla guy they got
the secret lab in Germany hired like 600
people so you know it's still so up in
the air but everything is seems like
it's heading in the direction of an
apple car right now it's
counterintuitive to what they've been
and that's why this is a different
company right yes they're doing things
that they would not have normally done
in the past quite honestly they need
products now but it's a little late
that's going to turn things around for
them financially I told you if they
don't get this TV streaming deal done by
the end of the year it's a huge fail for
them that that's a potential big revenue
stream for them that they're still not
tapping to and we're midway we're close
to halfway into 2016 I phones are pretty
much flattening out now iPads or
negative max are a little negative but I
think they'll get a boost with the new
macbook pros but look what what exciting
product is Apple have that's gonna spark
that's going to turn their financial
reports around it's it's there's really
not much the Apple pencil totally
getting into a car right margins on I
think wait a copper margins are they
like around like ten percent if that
yeah I mean they're really slim a lot of
those companies they lose you know they
lose money and that's one that why they
make a new model every single year seems
or even multiple models but it's just
such a hard thing to get into and like
Apple would just be taking a huge risk
doing that I would just encourage people
to test drive a Tesla and then tell me
how some company is going to be able to
leap frog that in the next five years
yeah but even Tesla's having problems oh
yeah I'm having recalls there's like all
kinds of issues I mean there are new car
maker as well you know and they're not
they're building cars that are
cool looking and they have great ideas
but they're still not the most the
greatest most functional cars you know
yeah yeah and shield there's windshield
problems see problems all kinds of
little little things you won't even
think about until you get thousands of
people on the road driving them then you
start to figure out what's wrong you
know this ain't easy it's not easy the
same elight life ain't easy it ain't
easy all right um as we move over from
Apple car just kind of an update on the
FBI and the Apple happenings we've
talked about the FBI was able to unlock
some of the phones in the past they on
their own terms and it has just been
made official from the FBI that they are
they will be keeping their apple iphone
hack secret and the reason being is that
the FBI actually paid a company right to
get to hack into this actual phone for
them and then they've they're going to
be using it i guess the similar method
with the New York drug case that follows
up after the terrorist case from San
Bernardino they pay more than 1.3
million dollars for this method but they
say that they didn't purchase the actual
rights to the technical details and
therefore they don't have the correct
information to actually get this looked
at and also pretty much deconstructed
because there's this process that you
submit to the you know US government
it's called the vulnerabilities equities
process and from there the FBI assesses
okay is this vulnerability important
enough for us to alert the company this
company being Apple and tell them you
need to fix this right this is a way
that someone can get into your product
your hardware your software but because
the FBI says they don't have it they are
not able to submit this and apple won't
find out about it so that's what it
comes down to unless unless they pay the
firm that unlocked it right well yes
they paid the firm that unlocked apple
if Apple paid the first said show us how
you did this yes that's probably the
only way so it basically be a private
transaction it wouldn't be and out in
the open kind of public transaction it
would be private it's all behind closed
doors
don't tell nobody sag in the phone um
just transition you kind of some fun
cool stuff so anyways that whole thing
is that situation is pretty much dead
squashed we're not gonna see it anytime
soon Apple getting the ability to figure
out how do they actually get in our
phones but it I've got imagine over time
it's gonna happen Yeah right it's going
to be they'll get it'll be revealed
they'll figure it out but for now it's
still a secret all right this is a
little different completely out of left
field but come on if you all saw the
Deadpool movie I don't know how many of
you did some of you kiddies should not
see that movie it's did you see it yet I
have some of you kitty some of you kid I
won't spoil some you kitties like Steven
Beecham should not see it but um its
glory there's there's blood and brains
but in a fun way we've seen how they've
had this like really super clever
marketing campaign and they've done
things like a billboard with emojis that
was a skull and a poop and the letter L
so if you actually read it together it
would be dead poo also Deadpool oh yes
really cool I have a shirt that has that
on it just for the record because I like
t-shirts that are cool um so they're
doing they're fun marketing campaign
with iTunes they're releasing the movie
digitally two weeks before the actual
blu-ray release and so Deadpool is now
like in the actual promo marketing for
things like the x-men for things like
taken he's in the artwork that you would
find on the itunes store in their banner
ads super funny but it's just their way
to promote Deadpool the actual movie
being available on digital this is my
favorite city it's awesome it's super is
super cool so you guys just go check it
out if you haven't seen it yet um
hopefully it does pop up once in a while
and then finally Tim Cook mr. CEO he has
this thing that he's done for the past
four years it's called the charitybuzz
lunch with tim cook again fourth year in
a row it's an auction and basically if
you want to spend time and pick his
brain or talk to him about why Apple's
revenue is lower than it ever has as the
climb i'm not saying lower than it's
ever been but why the revenue was going
down he is available in parallel to
apples
reports Tim Cook's this auction to go
spend an hour with him at lunch is
actually declined over the past three
years so when it originally was out four
years ago it was like the lunch with him
for an hour sold for six hundred
thousand dollars oh then it went to
three hundred and thirty thousand
dollars oh then I went to two hundred
thousand dollars and then right now I
think it's somewhere around like 210 wow
so that's an expensive lunch dude what
is he gonna tell you nothing nothing Tim
tell me I mean you can maybe pitch him
ideas and he's gonna say some rev-share
here no he's gonna take your idea
because you're gonna sign a contract
signed a piece of paper and then he's
gonna be like thanks that's what I
needed he's not gonna tell you anything
in fact he'll probably like spend the
first 20 minutes asking about you and
you'll be like so excited that you
wanted Oh Tim Cook's talking to me about
me yeah he cares about me by the time
you start talking about apple stuff the
lunch is over we should be like sorry we
can't talk about half of the time he's
gonna be chewing so like he's gonna be
taken like totally milking it right like
oh yeah oh yeah you know he's gonna take
he's gonna take a simple our way this is
really good Apple water really melt that
melt that lunch out good Apple burrito
anyways 200k I predict because of how
it's been decreasing each year that in
like 10 more years he'll have to pay us
to get lunch with him huh that's if he's
still CEO Wow I'm just saying minimum
minimum next bid 100 $15,000 everybody
jump on that get on it all right do you
want to take phone calls today yeah
let's do some phone calls we gotta gotta
come today remember guys and gals a
1-800 61 62 63 8 that's how you be a
part of the show welcome to party be
part of apple byte nation we love it
with only in the party first call Brooks
in my native land texas here's mr.
Brooks hey this is Brooks I'm from
Dallas Texas and I would just like to
say what are your thoughts on in fun
durable displays that they sell do you
think they're ever going
to upgrade them do you think they're
going to eventually make them into 5k
screens for so you can hook up your
macbook pro to a thunderbolt display do
you think they're going to update it
thanks love the show by sorry to be
honest with you I actually don't know
and I'm leaning towards them probably
not updating them but if we do see
anything it will be at WWDC that's
typically when they put some of the more
big bar hardware we don't see any key
notes that are specifically for just a
mac pro so it might be thrown in there
at WWDC we know that macbook pros will
be make an appearance in they support
Thunderbolt the fact of the matter is
you can find 5k displays that work with
your Mac today that are third-party Mac
third-party displays already oh yeah so
I mean I would have thought they would
have put out something within the past
year or two they still haven't my hunch
is that they I know the imac has a 5k
screen in it but it clearly doesn't seem
like they really care or they're looking
to pursue that in with their focus on so
many other products yeah I I could be
wrong but I don't see it I don't see it
happening I think all you have to do is
just go third party now it definitely
feels like its last on their list feel
like it's been three or four years since
they released since our last display
quite honestly yeah yeah it's been a
long time okay next call is from mr.
Jordan Richards alden richards jordan
high burn hey Stevens Jordan Richards t
from Adelaide Australia I'm just
wondering since I will release the
macbook last year and again update that
this year i'm wondering if you didn't
get all i can be changing all the bit
ports on all their macs and iphones
ipads etc to us bc um so yeah thanks
once a coupon app abiding us bc us bc so
we know that the latest 12 inch macbook
has only one single port it's probably
the biggest drawback of that because it
only has one single port i would be
really surprised if they took the
proline
and put one single port on it if you're
just asking specifically about us bc
they will have a USBC port in there but
I've got imagine they've got to keep
other ports on there it it doesn't make
sense for them to just completely take
it all away yeah it would be way less
pro if you don't have us bc on there i
believe yeah so i think they would do a
myth I think they've got to do a
combination of ports and it won't just
be us bc on that machine we will find
out in June I mean they decided to be
bold with that macbook 12-inch design
but then that 12 inch design has been
around for about a year I feel like
that's the one that they're trying to be
the most minimalist it doesn't serve
them well for their customer base to now
make a pro computer a minimalist
computer that's all that's it for day
that's all for today folks good that's
good so um just again you know thanks so
much for hanging out with us is a polite
extra crunchy every week more much more
crunch episode 34 is in the can we will
be back here next week talking to you
