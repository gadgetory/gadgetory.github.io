filling in for Bridget Carey and this is
your Cena update in a headline ripped
from the movie Armageddon the European
Space Agency has successfully deployed a
lander from its Rosetta spacecraft onto
the surface of a moving comet it's
already sending signals back home the
whole thing lasted about eight seconds
and was one of the most complicated
landings in history I mean think about
it you've got to land a tiny module on a
landing area no bigger than six tenths
of a square mile oh and did I forget to
mention that comet is moving at eighty
four thousand miles an hour it's
unbelievable gajillion Air Mark Cuban's
recent investment in the social video
app known as ojo is finally launching
the app will compete with vine which is
the six-second video sharing service but
as its name implies Oh Cho will allow
for eight second videos users will be
able to shoot longer video and ocho will
speed it up to fit there's also video
filters audio commentary and other
unique features to the service most
notably it will also offer a sit back
mode that will play continuous loops of
videos from all the users you follow ojo
hopes this will help separate the
service from similar products like vine
controversy has erupted over apples i
messaging software and now it sounds
like the company might be facing a
class-action lawsuit over it the suit
claims that Apple neglectful II allowed
text messages to be lost when a customer
switched over from iphone to another non
apple device now because I message had
been intercepting those texts they never
made it over to the users next platform
suffice it to say Apple has since
offered a way to get those text messages
back by turning I message off but the
suit seeks damages from before the
problem was fixed according to Spotify
CEO Daniel Eck Taylor Swift is exactly
right about the value of music but not
about Spotify underpinning its artists
last week Swift pulled her entire
catalogue off the streaming service and
as a result her latest record called
1989 had the largest sales
of any album since 2002 Swift believes
that Spotify helps perpetuate the
perception that music should be free
even though Spotify has already paid out
two billion dollars to rights holders x
says that's money that would have been
lost to piracy believe it or not black
friday is only about two weeks away and
retailers have already started to tease
the biggest deals that customers will
only be able to get in stores walmart
has unveiled a number of sales that
include the original 16 gigabyte ipad
mini for two hundred dollars and an
android tablet for only thirty dollars
