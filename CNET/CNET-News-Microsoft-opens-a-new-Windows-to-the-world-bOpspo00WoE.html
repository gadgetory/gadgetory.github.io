the world it's going to introduce a
number of productivity tools to help
them get task complete and it's the most
secure version of Windows we've ever
produced with the new Windows 10
Microsoft hopes to put it on a billion
devices by enticing people with new
features it's going to introduce a
number of innovations things like Xbox
Cortana an entirely new browser with
Microsoft edge katana is set to take on
Cirie the personal voice assistant can
find information or set reminders and
she even has a sense of humor who is
your daddy technically speaking that'd
be Bill Gates yeah big deal Windows 10
can support biometric authentication if
your device allows it you can use iris
recognition fingerprint recognition or
even facial recognition so your face is
the password windows 10 also adapts for
different screens and machines and that
lets users have great features like
continuum where their devices can
convert your phone can give you the
power of a full PC because of universal
windows appz windows 10 is available as
a free update to use as running windows
7 and 8 but the upgrade process could be
more cumbersome and costly for the
millions who still use older versions of
Windows like XP including the Navy and
some banks that process will take a
number of years quite honestly one of
the things that we've been working very
closely with Microsoft on is updating
the ATM network actually we've been
spending a lot of effort over the last
year and a half or more to help our
corporate customers who are an XP move
forward as the the structured support
for XP has come to an end if you are
running windows XP on your home computer
Microsoft no longer provides security
updates making you vulnerable to online
threats for more information on Windows
