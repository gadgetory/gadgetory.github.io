quality the megapixel spec seems to
dominate the conversation megapixels are
determined by multiplying the number of
horizontal pixels the cameras capable
capturing by the vertical ones for
example the iPhone 5s takes 32 64 by 24
48 resolution images that's roughly 8
million pixels or 8 megapixels but just
because one camera has more megapixels
in another doesn't guarantee
higher-quality images the size of the
cameras sensor also plays a huge part
the larger the sensor the bigger its
pixels can be bigger pixels means more
light can be captured which eventually
leads to more accurate and colorful
images and with a larger sensor you can
also expect better low-light performance
less noise and more dynamic range before
light can even reach the sensor to
create an image that has to pass through
the lens and a good lens can make all
the difference in the quality of the
picture and its aperture controls how
much light actually reaches the sensor
list it as an F number in lens specs a
larger aperture can lead to better
low-light pictures and potentially less
motion blur but don't be confused with
apertures the lower the F number the
larger the actual opening and then you
have what happens after the image is
captured the actual processing of the
picture how well an image is processed
really comes down to the manufacturer of
the phone bottom line the camera is more
than just as megapixels with plenty of
other factors from the camera's firmware
to how well it handles image processing
to the quality of its LED flash that
ultimately determine the camera's image
quality
