show China sets its sights on the far
side of the Moon where no lunar lander
has gone before
planets can drive robots now thanks to
researchers at MIT and deep mines alpha
0 AI reaches an incredible milestone
let's get into it
China aims to break new ground in lunar
exploration early Saturday morning the
chung e4 rocket launched into the sky
the rover on board is headed to a crater
on the far side of the Moon which is
always facing away from the earth due to
the moon's rotation no Lander has ever
touched down on the far side of the Moon
before humans have only observed it via
aerial surveillance landing their
presents some unique challenges the moon
will block all communications from Earth
that's why the Chinese launched a
satellite into lunar orbit over the far
side of the moon back in May to relay
messages between the rover and Earth the
radio silence will allow the chungee for
a unique opportunity to observe the
sounds of space without interference
from earth noise the rover will also
study rocks solar wind and according to
the Xinhua news agency it will test
whether silkworm eggs will hatch in moon
gravity an official landing date hasn't
been announced yet though some have
suggested early January is a likely
possibility since the Sun will be
shining on the far side of the Moon and
the chun-hee 4 is solar-powered we'll
keep you posted on what the Cheonggye 4
uncovers as the voyage to the far side
of the Moon continues plants can drive
robots now this plant robot hybrid is
named Ella WAN
brought to you by the mad scientists at
the MIT Media Lab lo1 uses the plant's
natural signals to trigger movement in
the robot underneath here's how it works
plant cells and tissue react to external
forces such as light and gravity in this
experiment researchers attached silver
electrodes to the plant to detect its
signals and place lights on either side
to trigger those signals
the result is a robo plant that can
drive itself toward the light
researchers say the eventual goal would
be a new breed of self-powered growing
plant robot hybrids now if all this has
you picturing the dawn of some sort of
vegan Skynet where by robotic plant
overlords seek revenge on salad-eating
humans you're not alone I'm picturing it
too specifically I'm recalling a scene
from the 1979 documentary The Secret
Life of plants in which a plant reacts
to the destruction of its comrade and
then seems to recognize the attacker
when they reenter the room hours later I
can't speak to the accuracy of the
science conducted in that movie but I
haven't looked at my houseplants the
same since maybe it's just me being
paranoid but I feel like we should be
100% certain that plants don't hold
grudges
before we start turning them into
cyborgs computers have been beating
master chess players since the 90s but
deep mines new AI is unique not because
it wins but because of how it wins
previous chess computers have relied on
known chess strategies and use their
processing power to examine thousands of
possible moves and outcomes alpha zeros
method of mastery practice practice
practice
starting as a novice player making
random moves alpha zero played itself a
lot and not just chess it also mastered
the classic games of shogi and go it
beat the Masters of each game with what
some have been calling human-like
intuition and creativity developers say
that the end goal is for AI to become
smart enough to help us solve some of
the greatest problems facing our world
today but the real world isn't like a
board game where the pieces are neatly
laid out at all times that's why the
next challenge will be to make an AI
that can master games with incomplete
information such as a card game where
the opponent's cards are hidden from
view alpha zero feels like the end of
the board game era of AI development and
the dawn of a new chapter
that's all for this week if you enjoyed
the show please like subscribe share or
leave a comment below telling us what
made you say WTF this week thanks so
much for watching what the future I'm
Jessie Earl and this will be my last
show for 2018 so Happy Holidays to all
you wTF is out there I'll see you next
year in the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
