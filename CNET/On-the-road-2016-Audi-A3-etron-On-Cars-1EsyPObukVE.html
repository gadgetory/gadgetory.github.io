was more than a basic 12 volt battery
under the hood could be anything from a
full battery electric to a mild hybrid
in this case it's right in the middle
this is Audi's first electrified car
maybe a little car but it's a big deal
because this is outies first electrified
car they've ever actually sold in the
u.s. that from a company that until now
has really been leaning hard on getting
efficiency through forced induction
turbos and superchargers or clean
efficient Diesel's but now they've
either made an evolution admission or
capitulation depending on your point of
view into the world of electrified cars
not to be sure it's a plug-in hybrid
that means it can run extended number of
miles on electric but also won't strand
you when you can't get to a charge okay
quick tour of our a3 Sportback e-tron
cabin here's our pop-up screens got that
beautiful Google Earth rendering on it
courtesy of a 4G LTE connection a very
out II thing 4G LTE is standard in these
cars navigations not it's weird so if
you don't have nav you at least have a
hotspot to use your phone to get now in
front of the driver you see we're
lacking that cool all video virtual
that we just saw in the new Audi TT of
the same model year here its traditional
gauges the one on the left as you see is
very electrified vehicle oriented shows
charge/discharge usage of the battery
there's one gauge and that's a sister
with a fuel gauge over on the right your
drive controls are a very
familiar-looking shifter and gate for
the DCT dual clutch transmission no
paddles on the wheel though this isn't
oriented that way they want you to
conserve more than thrash the vehicle
now along those lines here's Audi's
Drive select we've seen this before to
give you different Drive personalities
individual dynamic comfort or automatic
next to it is a new button it's an e V
drive mode on top of those drive modes
and that'll take you through the
following four electric where it goes
battery only hybrid where it blends the
two that's the most overall efficient
old battery means take the charge of the
battery don't use it and charge battery
says the battery's down charge it up at
all costs so I have it ready later
unlike some plugins this one's easy to
keep in pure electric mode without
really babying the pedal thanks to that
easy mode switch we just saw this 1.4
liter turbo joined by electric motor and
8.8 kilowatt-hour battery generate 204
horsepower system 258 pound-feet of
torque front wheel drive only on this
one no Quattro and as I mentioned
6-speed dual-clutch is your only
transmission the 3600 pounds of this
little guy gets to 60 in about seven and
a half seconds 35 mpg average 83 MPGe
if you fully exploit the cars plug-in
charge ability and 16 miles of pure evie
range / start out he's done a great job
of taking out electric car sound a lot
electric cars make nasty electric noises
this one has them almost completely gone
the next thing I noticed though
depending on the mode you're in the car
has kind of a CVT feel which isn't a
great thing if you're used to that nice
positive fight of a typical Audi
automatic or other transmission manual
gearbox you don't really find that here
I believe it has to do with some of the
juggling of the different power modes
from combustion to electric to the other
combination of them to the freewheeling
it also does to conserve energy it makes
it a little spooley sometimes that's
it's one of the nicer electric cars
you're gonna drive now it feels it's
wait I gotta say it's not that light
bright possible little out of you might
think it is it's got a certain mass to
it it's got a certain tub eNOS when it
bottoms into a divot into a turn when it
comes around it really stresses the side
walls of the tires as it goes around a
sharp radius corner those battery weight
here there's no way around that
you do feel quite a difference between
the different modes but again I would
kind of find the one I like and
hopefully not have to worry about the
cars battery charged profile beyond that
in some the best headline around this
car and one I think Audi was shooting
for is it's the Audi of electrified cars
which is to say it's got the Audi looks
proportions beautiful cabin great
technology and interface and most but
not all of the Audi driving that people
love about these cars ok an a3 Sportback
e-tron is gonna set you back a little
under 39 with destination that's for the
base trim level now from that you can
knock off about 4200 federal tax credit
here in California about another 1,500
credit as of today's shoot but you've
got to go all the way to the press key
shrimp to get things like navigation
bangin Olufsen audio and the more
advanced driver assist fully options by
the way the a3 e-tron can give you
active Lane keeping at 30 miles per hour
and above and also partial automatic
emergency braking and blind spot warning
tech not a driver assist powerhouse but
not bad in all I love driving a lot of
Audi's I would say I love driving this
one the least and but any electrified
car today for the most part is a basic
calculus of how much do you love it on
the right brain and how much of a good
value does it pencil out to be long term
