technologies into the NX one a prosumer
mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera
designed to compete with DSLRs like the
canon 7d mark ii and video shooter
favorites like the panasonic gh4 i'm
laura grinning and this is the samsung
nx1
while it's not perfect it is the closest
that I've seen mirrorless cameras come
thus far to delivering a DSLR like
experience the design is similar to
samsung's previous models of this ilk
it's not particularly lightweight
particularly when equipped with one of
the company's fast lenses but the
substantial grip balances them well all
the controls are comfortable and well
laid out at least once you tweak the
mappings for example I hate the video
record button which is hard to locate by
feel and difficult to press but you can
swap it with the Wi-Fi button which you
rarely need to press without looking the
camera is really sturdy too it survived
an accidental drop when I face-planted
on a hard floor I really liked the
viewfinder which refreshes quickly and
provides tons of information as well as
the bright tilting OLED display I wish
the camera Auto switched between the two
a little faster though speaking of speed
the NX punch is really fast
well it's not faster at focusing or
single shooting than comparable cameras
DSLRs included it's pretty close and for
continuous shooting it thus far beats
the pack running at fourteen point four
frames per second for unlimited best
quality JPEGs and you can push that to
about 15 frames per second with a really
fast SD card and shutter speeds above
one 500th of a second the autofocus
keeps up - they're not under all
circumstances unfortunately the camera
lacks tracking autofocus when shooting
through the viewfinder image quality is
generally excellent but the backside
illuminated center does show the typical
characteristics of that type of
technology such as clipped highlights
and crushed blacks especially at high
ISO sensitivities video quality both HD
and 4k pretty great - unfortunately at
the moment you've still got limited
display options since it uses the new
HEV C codec that's not widely supported
yet
except for the aforementioned lack of
tracking AF the camera has tons of
useful features including wireless
connectivity manual controls and video
and headphone and mic jacks among other
things USB 3 Oh support interval and
time-lapse shooting and so on really the
only thing that bewilders and annoys me
is that it doesn't ship with a battery
charger you're supposed to charge it
through the USB port which is slower
samsung has done a really great job with
the NX one finally bringing the
performance to the place that it's
high-end and EX models deserve I'm
Laurie Brennan and this is the Samsung
nx-1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
