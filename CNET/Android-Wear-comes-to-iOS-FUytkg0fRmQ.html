show currently known as google Isha's
we're back in I don't know about you all
but this week feels like the week of the
SmartWatch with announcements and leaks
galore
now the Ghul announced Android wear is
now cross-platform with iPhone through
the Android wear app on iOS that's right
Android smartwatches will work with your
Apple iPhone it officially only supports
the LG watch urbane and watches moving
forward right now but come on this is a
big move and it's Android they aren't
gonna lock everyone out like Apple does
now that's where users on the interwebs
come in and they tried out their watches
like the LG G watch R and the Moto 360
and with a quick factory reset these
watches and others currently work with
the new iOS Android wear app but
unofficially so you can try this out but
just a heads up it's not technically
supported now Apple watches still aren't
flying off the shelves and this is
another strong move by Google and
Friends we also talked about the new
moto 360 last episode if there's an
award for one of Tech's worst kept
secrets this might be it right now we
know how Motorola made a boo-boo tweet a
couple of weeks ago and brazil's FCC
revealed there might be two models now
it's hello moto HK that has leaked the
first images of the two different sizes
for the 360 l and the 360 s watch faces
side by side that feature the same
leaked design we've seen Alex is also
back at it releasing an image of the two
different color designs we can expect to
see and new renders from website up
leaks have now revealed a sport variant
of the new Moto 360 between black white
and orange as its primary colors the
standard watch design is expected to be
available in September and the sport
version is expected to arrive in
November but we'll hear plenty more
about this at Aoife 2015 in Berlin but
what might be the Android watch to look
out for this year forget about Android
how about the best-looking SmartWatch to
date period it's the Huawei watch we saw
at Mobile World Congress now the Amazon
pages have been pulled down now but it's
been revealed the watch will come in two
four variants based on color and
material
ranging from stainless steel with a
leather man starting at $349 and as high
as $6.99 for an all gold plated
stainless steel version a deleted Huawei
tweet also pointed to a September 2nd
announcement with a curious iOS
compatibility that might have been
foreshadowing the recent Android wear
app announcement so again stay tuned to
Aoife and I know there are still
remnants of blackberry loyalists that
are hoping somehow some way the company
can dig itself out of the ground and
give you all something to look forward
to
well this could be it after detailed
leaked images of the often rumored
Venice phone have made it to the web
detailing its slide-out physical
keyboard that looks nicely executed from
the pictures you also see this includes
both a SIM card slot and an SD card slot
for expansion images of the camera point
to an 18 megapixel camera with optical
image stabilization the phone looks to
be running the Android and might come
with some sort of a blackberry skin but
we'll wait and see and really this might
be the phone that came out three years
too late but its unique enough in I'm
curious but if you're really curious and
you wanted to see what happens when you
put your brand new Galaxy Note 5 stylus
in backwards don't do it we didn't get
to talk about this because we were gone
last week but videos everywhere showed
off how accidentally putting in the
s-pen offers no resistance at all but
could also end up jamming in the phone
and also cause it to break pen detection
once that happened now you can see this
happening if a kid got ahold of your
phone or if you're in a rush you might
even do this yourself it's clearly a
design flaw but what Samsung's response
we highly recommend our Galaxy Note 5
users to follow the instructions in the
user guide to ensure there are no issues
basically they're saying you're sticking
it in wrong and you know what this
deserves
come on son seriously this is a flaw and
they aren't going to figure it out in
any kind of fix or create a way to
prevent this their answer is just read
the manual yikes
alright that's gonna do it for this
week's show keep emailing us at Google
issues at cnet.com or tweet me at brian
tong thanks for watching and we'll see
you next time for some more of that
Google issue
