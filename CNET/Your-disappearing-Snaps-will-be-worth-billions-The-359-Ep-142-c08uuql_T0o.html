hell you are in the world and welcome to
episode 142 of the 359 podcast and Roger
Tang and Ben Fox true but I'm sorry
let's flip that with Ben Fox Ruben and
Roger oh yeah with a big promotion for
me too that I know and I've decided to
just take a step back yeah
Roger was hungover this morning so I
wish post I so wish yes so watch me
bumble my way through the podcast and
I'm gonna be judging you the entire time
all right now artists
extra pressure before I was fine but now
I'm totally freaking out either way
we're gonna be talking about snapchat
again today they filed apparently
reportedly confidential IPO filing also
new restrictions on the Airbnb and a
really cool new app from Google to help
you scan your photos as always send in
your questions and comments and Brian
will look through them and we'll check
them out at the end of the show so
that's about it let's get this thing
started
all right and here we go in three two
welcome to the 359 where we talk about
the top tech news of the day plus
whatever crap we want to throw in I'm
Ben Fox Ruben I'm Roger Jane starting
off we're talking about snapchat yet
again this week after reports came out
that the social company confidentially
confidentially filed an IPO valuing the
company at as much as twenty five
billion dollars for a little context
Twitter is currently valued at about
thirteen billion dollars Wow so Roger
why would snapchat be that valuable look
what it's all about the kids man the
kids the Millennials
Millennials are you use asshat the Utes
cute is that look they're they're using
snapchat like crazy they're living on
snapchat and for advertisers that's yeah
that's a gold mine right there and I
mean you look you make that comparison
to Twitter Twitter's growth has
completely stalled early and it's it's
kind of cryptic people aren't really
jumping on that snapchat and people not
understanding as much SAP chat
ironically is also kind of cryptic it
hard to understand true but it's
the kind of cryptic that like kids can
get into that's why they like that's why
yeah they're Wired's don't get it right
parents don't get it which is what's
kind of awesome I'd like to show how old
I'm like I find it somewhat baffling
this is so and I know we talk about this
a lot when we talk about snapchat but
how much of a threat is snapchat to
Facebook obviously Mark Zuckerberg knew
this because he tried to buy them a
couple years ago no I think they're a
big big threat that's that's why you see
Facebook rolling out feature after
feature whether through Instagram or
Facebook that mimic some of the features
of snapchat as right like Instagram
stories is basically he snaps right so
pretty lame yeah so yeah Facebook
definitely sees the right in the wall I
mean it's still the by far the largest
social network out there but they must
see that younger audiences are looking
at snapchat as their primary tool for
communication
I can't wait for more competition for
different tech companies to waste my
time in new ways so here comes snapchat
next up San Francisco tightened its laws
involving Airbnb saying folks can only
rent their place for 60 days a year that
follows more rules against home run
against the home rental service in New
York City too so it seems like it's
getting harder to do yeah yeah it's
interesting because I've done Airbnb
ease-out like in Europe and in Asia and
like it's practically a business like no
one lives in those homes you know that
they're renting out they're just
continually renting them out through
Airbnb mm-hmm and that's that's how I'm
being be work so to limit it to like 60
days in SF that's that's a big blow
already in New York you you wouldn't be
able to like buy it as a rental home for
specifically for Airbnb right which is
what a lot of people doing what a lot
people do and what city's trying to
crack down on right because it's
basically taking more housing stock out
of the rental market which for SF and
New York obviously they're very mindful
of that oh yeah oh yeah I mean in New
York it's tough right you can't you
can't even rent out the place I think
you can rent out a room
I think legally god I don't know it's
getting more and more complicated which
is making it harder to do Airbnb so last
Google introduced a new Android and iOS
app called photoscan which lets people
scan pictures even if they're in a frame
or
an album making it easier to preserve
old photos yeah Roger do you think you'd
be using this I think I will be using
this constantly over the holiday season
my wife has been bugging me about
scanning her old family photos for like
the last two years i know i collection
and i mean the idea of having to put a
photo in a flatbed scanner scanning it
scan it and then just replace it
constantly do that it just it's just so
tedious and i tried out the the app
yesterday actually and it's you know
it's really simple it's basically kind
of connect the dots therefore dot to
kind of line your phone next to it's not
super precise we're dots on the corner
of the photo well there's sort of like
they're kind of yeah they're all it's
not exactly the corner like i said you
don't have to be super precise about it
and it's google says that you know
within ten minutes you can actually scan
a hundred photos and I kind of believe
it cuz it's it's a pretty that's pretty
sweet yeah it's simple way to do it okay
well if you want to read more about
these stories check us out on SEANET I'm
Ben Fox Ruben I'm Roger Tsien thanks for
listening
all right I survived you did it
congratulations I know finally step back
and just retire you're pretty good
you're pretty good color guy I mean good
color commentary over there so there's a
lot of big snapchat fans in the chat
yeah obviously everywhere we will be
talking I feel a lot more about snapchat
talking about them twice this week and
they're just a very interesting company
I'm I will admit I'm trying to use them
more often yeah I tend to live a little
bit more often on Twitter but that is
getting a little stale probably the
problem with snapchat especially for for
folks like us who are on to kind of you
know promote our stories to have a large
social awareness or presence is snapchat
like gives you no indication of that
right it's it's sort of a one-to-one
communication tool and it's you can yes
broadcast your snaps feed you have no
idea if anyone's actually watching
there's no real measure so you just sort
of out there yeah that's what's kind of
freaky and uncertain maybe that's why
the kids love it right and but like I
was in the the entrepreneurs I look at
like dj khaled Michael points out in the
chat he's making millions who snaps you
have a marketing promotion of
opportunities no absolutely once you get
that sort of brand
awareness going and won't kill the
presence but like if you're starting out
on snapchat and you're and you started
part of this like you're thinking about
it from like the rules of of normal
social networks like Twitter and
Facebook where there are numbers and
metrics and things also easily see right
followers but there isn't that it's just
there's no guidance at all yeah that's
why I've seen certain stories where it's
sometimes described as a messaging
service right as opposed to a social
network which which it can be in some
ways but that's a really good point that
it is still very much applied I think
most kids use it as a communications
tool first like at not a social network
it's it's something that they use to
message back and forth right it's how
they tell their stories yeah that being
said I mean like I don't what what am I
like Facebook posts from years and years
ago I Cali pretty terrible yeah they're
probably pretty terrible so my first
weed was just I don't know what it was
I'm hungry I wouldn't be that upset if
if those things disappeared like I don't
really have much of a use for them so
that is a refreshing part of snapchat
it's just kind of funny to me how short
and abbreviated all of our
communications have become yeah you know
I don't know anyone who continues to
write like books on Facebook you know
until election season well okay you know
it's it what's what's the length on
snapchat ten seconds I have not used it
I'm sorry world yeah okay what is a
short admit that if we keep going in
this trend like in like six or seven
years it's gonna be a new social network
yes one more one scream one photo yes
and we saw vine was actually pretty
exciting in that how much you could do
in six second I liked vine actually cuz
you creative with success everybody
loves vine now that it's yeah I know I
guess I stopped using it a long time ago
like what it's like now that it's like
you know Crested everybody's back on it
so moving on over to Airbnb again what
was it before the 60-day limit if you
lived in the home you I I think you
could rent it out as much as you wanted
no limits always no limit at all so if
like there's there's a house that you
wanted to rent but I think there were
much more significant restrictions in
San Francisco if you didn't live there
and I mean yeah we're now it's so now
it's like 60 days I believe across the
board regardless if you're living there
or not which is a pretty substantial
restriction for people that used to have
that is as good income for an extra room
or an extra apartment in their home
where their incidents that led to this I
mean what is the rationale behind the
limit for the most part what I've seen
is that a lot of hotel providers hotel
operators are extremely annoyed and
Airbnb guys absolutely you're taking
stuff that's in neighborhoods like
regular neighborhood and adding that to
the hotel you don't you don't have to
follow the same kind of regulations that
a hotel right you don't have liability
you don't have insurance like there
there are a lot of restrictions on
hotels it's the same exact thing as uber
in many ways yeah we're right they don't
have a taxi fight all over again right
but they don't have the same regulations
piled on top of them as the taxi it's
like the uber fight except when you when
you added housing like we as we said on
the call like in cities like New York
and SF where housing and real estate is
such a precious commodity that is like
this added stress level right like yeah
every year the abuse has been like in
the sticks like up north in New York or
in Connecticut but yeah the idea that if
you're if you're some guy if you own a
bunch of partment and you're just
renting them out on the Airbnb for like
some super inflated price like that's
taking away an opportunity for someone
who actually lives in New York to have
an apartment right that's you know oh I
did use Airbnb once when I was in Greece
when we were reporting there over the
summer never stopped talking about that
- yeah and and it was like super easy
the guy you know gave us gave us the
apartment it was a lot more enjoyable
felt more like home than finding a hotel
last I was stuffing my preferred way
like when we used to go to Barcelona
reaffirm a little Congress before I got
organized and we had hotel rooms it was
air B&amp;amp;B here for a year and I loved it
it was great like the people were super
nice and a lot of them were a couple of
them were actually they were actually
just sort of renting them out as
a test they weren't it wasn't a business
yet for a lot of them and so it's kind
of nice to get that experience yeah I'm
not a big fan of hotel rooms outside of
like boutique hotel rooms they just feel
a little too just I don't know
impersonal so I I tend to prefer Airbnb
but at the same time I understand I may
be there for a long stay at the same
time if you're visiting visiting a place
on the fly and he's like you're gonna
spend all of like your five to six hours
of sleep in the hotel room yeah that's
true what differences but I sort of your
family and if you've got a kid like
having your actual home amenities it's
just it's just so much nicer actual
refrigerator microwave things like that
in a washing machine here's a good
question expanding on it but it might be
a little bit out of our wheelhouse do
you guys know of any laws that help
ensure the Airbnb places are up to a
certain standard of quality anything
like that in New York specifically and I
gotta say I have no command every B&amp;amp;B
and I don't think so don't have a lot I
doubt it I mean law background outside
of media yeah I mean I think the only
thing that would govern the quality of
an air B&amp;amp;B unit are user comments you
can complain Airbnb like say the
apartment doesn't match the photos that
you'd see when you're searching for
words yeah yeah that would be the only I
don't think there's like oh they're in
kind of law that would like set a
standard for minimum quality for an
apartment or for a unit yeah I I don't I
don't know I know that there are more
restrictions coming up to try to at
least get them at the same level in some
ways to hotels so that there is a
certain level of liability like if I
broke my leg in an Airbnb what was
liable yeah so the I think that a lot of
the stuff is still being worked out that
is a fantastic question though thank you
for submitting that if anybody does have
any input on this please add it to the
comments section in the video anytime I
think we're all kind of curious about
that that is a very interesting thought
yep let's talk about photo scan and how
friggin cool this is yeah yeah I'm
knee-deep in trying to digitize family
vacation photo albums from decades it
actually kind of reminded me that I
hadn't backed up my photos to Google
photo in a while and I like I turned it
on today and I apparently 27,000 photos
that don't need to be uploaded like
alright the song and I'm walking off
yeah no I I mean the thing is awesome
and it's looks super easy I'm not sure
how effective it is on an actual like
when it's in a frame where there's a
glass there's a glare I haven't tested
that out yet
but just like taking a photo looks like
Bridget's had pretty good results here
yeah yeah yeah so the idea is it again
it takes multiple shots and images and
merges the best of them and it like Auto
straightens everything and crops out
like the frame or on the album so you
have pretty good digital approximation
approximation of your your your print
your photo mm-hmm so is there like a it
this sounds really nice but I'm curious
is there like a sneaky or a cynical
reason for Google to provide this you
know like do they want to get you you
know suckered or stuck into their world
of Google photos because like maybe they
get a more the monthly fee I mean I
think the the key thing is like if
you're using Google photos you're using
the Google ecosystem you're using Gmail
and calendar and all the stuff and
likely to use Android which they can
serve you ads for and so it's it's to
get you further stuck into this
ecosystem right you know I don't know if
it's nefarious I think everyone know I
just I wanted to there's Apple sound so
nice I just kind of wanted to like for
the podcast like from a reporting
perspective I was curious they look at
the business implication the skeptical
side of me is you know eventually they
start scanning the photos and taking the
data there and using that to advertise
you know yeah well the thought I've
heard of me like they could scan and
they could see like you have a tendency
to go to like for me Barcelona in
February or March they don't they start
advertising like in January hey last
minute plane tickets to Barcelona mm-hmm
like that's I don't think they haven't
done so bad but they haven't done some
people would be I think they've been
pretty good about the privacy aspect of
photos yet but you never know down the
line like yeah taking that data that's
that's what they ultimately care about
right and there's a lot of data to be
had from their photos I was looking at
it more as if you preserve enough photos
with Google photos
you're gonna you might end up paying
like the monthly fee to actually get
more get it get a higher of like data
limit or well you know the so the the
deal who photos is its unlimited storage
mmm unless you want to keep your like if
your DSLR photos at like maximum quality
right so I mean for me it's good enough
that I take some my photos for my my
phone that I don't really need that that
extra limit so I'm perfectly happy with
the unlimited like compressed version of
it I've been on Google photos for a long
time I'm definitely a fan and I like
yeah I'm just certain that there's some
kind of like business operandi going on
behind this oh yeah but at the same time
this is just a good innovation I totally
agree with that yeah I just wanted to
touch upon that as well and I I
definitely think that this is an
interest thing I feel like your feature
I feel like photoscan is one of those
projects that the it was like the 30
percent time or like whatever the I
don't know if they still didn't do that
you know like they spend whatever 30
percent thinking about non-core
responsibility stuff and I feel like
this is like a random side project that
just came out of some guys thought right
it's perfect timing for Thanksgiving by
the way oh yes everybody's looking at
photo albums yeah I'm going back to Los
Angeles on Friday and oops
no but I'm gonna be going back there's
there are a lot of old photos I'm you
know I'm gonna scan in like all my
embarrassing childhood photos I'm gonna
put up I'll be able to post on Twitter
whenever throwback Thursday comes up
nice yeah yeah everybody else out there
is the app available now yeah
yes it's available so we totally gonna
try that tonight yeah all right that's a
good place to cut it sounds good to me
thanks everybody all right the 3:59
