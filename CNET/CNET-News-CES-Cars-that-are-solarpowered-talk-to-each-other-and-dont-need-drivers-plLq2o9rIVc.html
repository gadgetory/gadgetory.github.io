Electronics Show in Las Vegas technology
is in the driver seat and even on car
roofs that's the solar panel we're able
to fully recharge that battery we're
just using the Sun this is Ford's c-max
a solar energy concept car it pairs with
a canopy that serves as a magnifying
glass
as the Sun traverses the sky we actually
have to keep that focus on the solar
panels and the way we do that is we
actually use the vehicle autonomously to
move it actually keeps it concentrator
at all times as for drivers in the
future well they're optional because
driverless vehicles are here the NA vo
from induct is a self-driving
all-electric shuttle designed with
campuses in mind how does the Navajo
work it's similar to an elevator but
instead of punching the floor you hit
the station that you want to go to or
the location hit go and start then sit
back and enjoy the ride howdy impressed
with a preview of its autonomous
technology that it hopes to deliver
within five years and this car on a
public highway is able to use its own
radar sonar forward camera and a new
laser that's invisible laser light to
map out the world around it and drive it
up to 40 miles an hour doing its own
steering braking and accelerating
another key to making self-driving cars
a reality is allowing cars to detect
each other and avoid crashes for its
vehicle to vehicle communication
technology does that using Wi-Fi and GPS
signals so driving normal through the
intersection
well as long as the vehicle knows where
the other vehicles are if there's any
sort of collision scenario that might be
occurring then we can provide a warning
mercedes-benz showed how cars can
communicate with wearable gadgets such
as smartwatches and Google glass without
doubt cars are now smarter than ever for
