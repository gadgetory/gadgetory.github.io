besides it's slick Nexus phones and some
fancy futuristic glasses but the sleek
Chromebook pixel changes all that hi i'm
seth rosenblatt foreseen it and in this
first look we're taking a quick tour of
Google's first laptop made without a
manufacturing partner the result is not
unlike Microsoft Surface a sharp sexy
device with some unique features and a
ridiculously high price point and boy do
I mean hi let's just get the facts out
of the way the pixel runs on a dual core
1.8 gigahertz intel core i5 processor
with integrated intel HD 4000 graphics
and 4 gigs of memory it's a huge step up
for Chromebook power although not super
high-end either speaking of graphics the
screen on this thing is slightly bonkers
it sports a three to two ratio for
easier vertical scrolling the
touchscreen clocks in at 239 pixels per
inch edging past the 13 inch MacBook
Pros to 27 ppi retina display google
crammed two microphones an HD camera and
a light detector above the screen the
two mics are for better noise
cancellation but google also tucked a
third Mike below the keyboard to help
cut out typing noises on the outside the
pixel has two USB ports a mini
DisplayPort for external monitors an SD
card slot and a combination headphone
mic Jack Google promises around five
hours of battery life which isn't shabby
but that mini displayport Bluetooth 3.0
and USB 2.0 mean that the pixel is
actually a version behind the latest
standards that's a problem why build a
high-end laptop that only meets average
ports however it's been beautifully
engineered and feels solid even if it is
a sketch heavy at 3.3 pounds there are
no visible screws holding the chassis
together the trackpad feels grippy yet
smooth not too greasy and the hinge has
been designed so you can open it with
one hand for better and for worse the
pixel runs Chrome OS Google's browser
based operating system
regular updates every six weeks which
means that your pixel will stay current
for quite a while if you live in the
cloud you simply must consider this if
you're looking for a high-end laptop
however it also means that you can't run
high-powered programs like itunes
photoshop or MS office currently chrome
doesn't do well with a ton of tabs which
is essentially what web apps are so
multitasking can be a bit sluggish at
times even with that four gigs of ram on
the other hand google is giving
everybody who buys a pixel one terabyte
of cloud storage for three years and if
you splurge on the verizon LTE version
that's expected in early april you'll
get practically always on connectivity
and i do mean splurge the LTE version
will run you a whopping it ready for
this whopping 1499 dollars while the
Wi-Fi only version still extracts a
hefty 1299 dollar premium this is a
gorgeous device something that clearly
has had a lot of thought put into it but
at those prices you can get a far more
robust Windows 8 touchscreen laptop or a
macbook still it's interesting to see
Google take a chance on a product like
this and shake things up just a little I
don't think they've nailed it quite yet
but they're getting close for cnet i'm
