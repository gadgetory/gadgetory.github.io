buy the Google pixel three wait wait
wait before you go all nuts we also have
reasons to buy the pixel three in this
same video so use this video to serve
whatever need you want if you're trying
to convince yourself to spend money or
trying to convince yourself not to
you'll get some ideas here let's go
number five the look yes this is
superficial the Google pixel 3 and Excel
looked like great looking budget phones
there I said it
one design is dated the three looks like
the pixel to excel the pixel three Excel
looks like someone saw an apple design
and thought how can we copy that then as
I was like we can do it but it's going
to look hilariously bad
Google's it yeah let's do it then the
design team did not know Google was
kidding
for shame these are Google's top phones
they deserve top-of-the-line designs at
number four no expansion one of the big
hooks about Android phones is you get to
choose what kind of experience you have
Samsung's big Galaxy phones let you plug
in a microSD card
LG's V and G lines let you do the same
how about any of the pixels nope forget
it either by a 64 gigabyte model or a
128 model those are your options that's
it and number three is there's no 5g
look this is the future of wireless and
it's not on the pixel 3 to be fair no
current phones have 5g on board but if
you're looking for a phone you want to
hang on to for a few years
2018 has been a blatte for phones in
general look at the s9 the note 9 the LG
G 7 think you the actual intent asks
just placeholders until 2019 rolls
around if you have a phone from last
year it's a hard sell to jump to any
phone let alone the pixel if you want
some solace the pixel does support
gigabit LTE number 2 these past screen
problems this might be more of a reason
to just hold off on purchasing a new
pixel than anything else
last year the pixel 2 XL had issues with
its OLED screen there were some visible
grittiness and some hue issues if you
tilted the phone once you saw these
problems good luck on seeing them
this year Google put in flexible OLED
screens in both versions of the three I
asked a rep if Google used the same
screen vendor as before but he said
Google is not disclosing that
information will the new screens hold up
better than last year's
we'll see before we get to number one
let's talk about reasons to buy the
pixel while it only has one camera on
the back Google software seems to make
photos look great with features like top
shots and night sights but that was in
the demos we'll see how it really goes
in further testing then there's finally
wireless charging on the pixel so if you
really really wanted that you have it
the two cameras on the front take care
of those group selfies for all of those
photos you get free unlimited google
photo storage and the best reason to get
a pixel or any pixel for that matter is
getting the latest version of Android
when Google releases it other phones
might have a better design more cameras
or whatever but pixel phones can get
updates flipping quickly back to the bad
side and the number one reason not to
buy the new pixel is the specs ok the
pixel 3 inside is relatively
unremarkable it's got a snapdragon 845
processor like other phones it packs 4
gigabytes of RAM which seems a little
light the pixel phone's max out at 128
gigabytes of storage what's that about
Google's working around for that is
allowing full backups of your photos and
videos so maybe you won't need all that
space onboard Google also puts the
screen size on the XL as 6.3 inches
measured from one out of the screen to
the other on the diagonal but you do
lose space to the knotch maybe Google
will find some kind of amazing use case
for that little extra screen mini apps
maybe I don't know I got to play around
with the pixel 3 and XL for a little bit
I kind of like the three better both
were very comfortable in the hand were
surprisingly light and we're very zippy
maybe I'll wait until next year with 5g
that does it for us am i a zap tire and
I'll see you online
