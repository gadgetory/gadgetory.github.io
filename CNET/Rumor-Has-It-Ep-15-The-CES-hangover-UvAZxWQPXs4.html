January thirteenth welcome to rumor has
it live on location from CES in Las
Vegas I'm Emily Dreyfuss and I'm Kareem
levy and this is rumor has it the
Internet's most uproarious hilarious
tech gambling show were rear out of the
rumors from the week and then bet on
them and what better place for our tech
gambling show to be than Vegas it's like
our show has finally come home this I
mean this is where it was meant to be I
know among the poker chips and the cards
and yeah all of our grasp you can always
been Vegas related we finally get here
and we were like we feel so much more
comfortable right everybody gets it we
finally get it yeah except for that I'm
not good at gambling except for on this
show as you guys know longtime fans and
viewers of rumor has it will know that I
have won every single month of our
bedding by a miracle it seems sort of
maroc by a miracle and by a lot of
points also by using my little fashion
noggin I mean not using my noggin my
Kareem just allowing me to always bet
first and take the easy bet and you know
sucker bets and losing big time and so
today's humiliation day yeah so let us
explain up front what humiliation day is
on rumor has it every month we take
points we bet on all of the rumors and
then we take points about which ones
came true and who got it wrong and who
got a right and then at the end of the
month whoever has the least amount of
points has to embarrass themselves on
the podcast which every other time has
been done in a studio in San Francisco
with just the two of us going out to the
Internet and our chat room and now it's
going to be live for everybody here at
CES so because the extra mortifying we
decided that since we're in Vegas you
have to do it up you have to do it
really big so vegas it's going to be the
most humiliating of humiliation days
I've ever experienced and I am just so
great I can't thank you so much for
losing again i just i i really don't
permit fun to do is because of me that's
happening so anyway so that's going to
come up later in the show yeah but we
have titled this episode of rumor has it
the CES hangover not because we're
hungover not at all not that because we
have this because here
okay it's behind the 80s and we've made
it everybody still yeah checking it out
Samsung is pulling their booth down
panasonic is done yeah we already gave
all the award driving away everybody's
exhausted and we're here to wrap it up
and debrief you guys so we're gonna keep
keep ya keep the energy up we're gonna
keep it going it's like the best way to
get rid of a hangover is just a drink
again that's what the show us so the
pacifica care of the dog right now if
you're SI es peor de 17 you talking
about it yes so um maybe we should start
with our room start with our rumors
let's okay well the first rumor that we
want to talk about today on rumor has it
is a biggie and it doesn't come out of
CES but the things that have happened at
CES this year have huge implications for
the rumor and that is the drum roll that
was that was a drum roll because you
didn't know that's how i did dremel um
apple TV apple itv apple television is
going to be coming out everybody knows
that everybody's been hearing about it
we're so excited and a little bit of the
thunder of that rumor has been lost
based upon some of the announcements
that came out of CES 2012 right and it's
crazy that we're even talking about
Apple because Apple isn't even here yeah
well maybe here hello that in our next
show yeah as you probably read there are
potentially 250 Apple employees running
around the halls of CES right to start
any rumors so we'll just talk about
we'll talk about ok but so Apple TV the
rumors about Apple TV have been that it
is going to have integrated series
support which would allow you to talk to
your television and say change the
channel I really want to watch this up
turn that off change the volume right
and point at it and yell at it and do
all kind of crazy person but that have
amped up in the past months because
Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve
Jobs came out and in it he revealed that
Steve Jobs hated the remote control so
much that he wanted to revolutionize
television so that you didn't have to
push up I mean of course because doing
this is so hard I mean personally that
we have to do that instead this was
gonna like the remote control already
was like an innovative device so that
you didn't have to do anything you
already just sit there and push a button
right so that I'll let me start yelling
that I think yeah that would get easier
for the thunder of that rumor
has been a little bit taken away by the
announcements from the likes of lenovo
and samsung who at CES 2012 have already
now introduced TVs that are going that
have the little camera built-in right
and they have smart motion control and
they will at see your body and hear your
voice and they will react to you exactly
um and then another thing that was sort
of one of the rumors of apple TV people
have been saying that it would have OLED
that it would be an oled screen and they
would because you know that they're only
going to make it if it's better than
everything else exactly how thinner and
more beautiful yeah and we're not worth
it for it's not an apple product yeah
and so the organic light-emitting diodes
yeah I juggle that 25 times oh is it Oh
LED or OLED and I really like to say
oulad so and I think so we just made it
and we decided that that was how I mean
we didn't we also asked a couple of
people and I agreed um and climbing with
a pet it would be there would be an oled
TV which is also one of the reasons why
some of the first Apple TV rumors were
saying it was going to be tiny not only
huge and expensive zactly because up
until this CES that all the ola TVs that
are come out have been tiny yeah so I
mean now I'm sure anyone who's here on
the floor went and visited the LG and
the Samsung booths and saw the
ridiculous and if you guys haven't seen
it go into the LG into the Samsung
booths and it's like looking at a piece
of glass like you can't see anything it
was going to be amazing because i don't
even have very good eyesight and so when
I look at HD sometimes even when I'm
wearing my contacts for my glasses I
think I don't think I can tell the
difference at home i have over the air
free television because i don't have
cable and the HD comes in pretty clear
but when I can't get the HD channels I
just watch the other ones and what does
it matter so but then when I went to
visit the LG booth and saw that 55-inch
oled screen oh my god you know I was so
impressed by how thin it was that I
don't even remember looking at what was
on it so I can take pictures of it and
then it just came out it was just like
looking at a piece of paper from the
side yeah I know and I wanted to promote
it on cnet com with a big picture
showing how thin it was and it's kind of
impossible to even get a photo like that
right so you just have to imagine it
your mind grapes guys raise your
imagination squeeze your mind grapes
ease your mind grapes that and figure
out reference one of our favorite
I'm rumor has it so now basically what
this means is that Apple has to have
those things because in order for the
Apple TV that's going to come out if it
comes out at all is that it'll have to
be better and compete with these new TVs
which is actually what Apple is really
good at doing and that they exactly
that's apples mo is to take a product
that came out that was awesome that
everybody was excited about and then
make it better and then you know make it
a little bit sleeker a little bit
different and hide it and use their
amazing powers of PR and to it convince
everyone that they need it and and make
it not a like luxury device that you
don't actually need but that's something
that everyone wants because it has this
cachet and it's cool examined an apple
and vulva Blanc and just like picture
the Apple executives like sitting on
their throne of broken dreams and clean
lines and like unfinished wood and
they're like oh yes let LG and Samsung
have all the Thunder now began in a year
I just made that up and some time we're
going to come out with something awesome
and people are going to forget about
those other guys who started it I mean
it's not a bad tactic I mean this is
what they did with the iPad there were
texts not like there weren't tablets out
there were tablets but then they
introduced the ipad in there and they
made it so that everyone wanted it and I
think it's pretty good they're going to
let LG and Samsung work the kinks out
with this technology right and then
bring they're going to bring it to
market once it's all figured out and
it'll be better and that's what Apple
does and then LG and Samsung will be
like guys hello like remember we did
this yeah once so but one other thing of
note about the apple TV rumor and then
we'll move on because it's really not
that CES related is that sterne agee a
stern agee analyst sha whoo said last
week that one of the ways that Apple is
going to have to compete with all the
other television manufacturers that are
coming out with all of this amazing new
technology the way that they could
differentiate themselves and really make
to apple itv as it's being dubbed more
interesting is to have all the cart
channels which will blow a totally
change everything he's mine good morning
ala carte channels since before we even
knew that that was a possibility because
I'm a cable cutter and I don't believe
in pain
mission to comcast hundreds of dollars a
month it breaks the bank it's ridiculous
so I have a roku and I have amazon prime
and I have it's like rumor has it we
were joking with their rumor has it
brought to you by amazon prime and roku
because emily every time you go which if
you know someone HBO and their kind
enough to let you log in my refuel once
in a while don't tell everybody that but
you can watch HBO go and it's pretty
wonderful but the one failure of a
person like me who watches streams on
roku and everything is that I cannot
watch Showtime shows and I gotta say
shameless is coming back I know I don't
know what to do with my life without
being a little ashamed up to go to
somebody's house no I'm anti-social I
want to watch it in oh and I home as a
Herman you'll be the first in line to
buy that I'll might be I library and
then it'll let me I just want to buy
Showtime that's basically it everything
else I hope can be free I'm sorry and
maybe Comedy Central all right I'm so
thatís a turrible yeah you know yeah
why not we're basically Stephen Colbert
we're writing Colbert of Cena just watch
us um okay so we move on to the next
rumor please it is yours I believe no
potato is it mine yeah it's from our
friends at digits oh my goodness digit
times we're always sort of citing digit
times that's mainly because they write
about every single rumor on the internet
they don't really care if it's credible
or not um this one is a little bit more
credible and it's given even more
credibility by the fact that our chums
across the pond yes our new best friend
hey you're sitting right back in here
right behind that very wall seen that UK
our new BFFs have written about how
according to digit times the first
quad-core smartphone to hit the market
maybe the HTC edge which has been leaked
weeks ago with it specs that it might be
coming in February to mobile world
congress in barcelona one of the reasons
why they think this is happening is
because an analyst for JPMorgan Chase
allegedly mentioned these phones powered
by nvidia tegra Nvidia's new Tegra 3
chip which they introduced here at CES
2012 while speaking in at in a
commercial times report in china what he
was cited as saying was that HTC will
roommate maintain its lead against
rivals by two months if and only if it
unveils Tegra 3 and MSM
8960 base that's the Qualcomm processor
smartphones in February and ships the
models in time in April I mean there's
so many caveats to this thing I know it
happened this time Aurora but what that
basically means if though if you if you
adhere to those timelines what that
basically means is that the phone would
have to come out in Mobile World
Congress because that's in February
exactly and since we didn't see it at
CES 2012 it sort of makes sense that's
the next big event for them to introduce
this and it's the next big evolution of
the smartphone right because I mean they
can only get faster they can only get
better they can only get smaller or
bigger as we've mentioned before there
are people who are not interested in
having they say there's no reason to
have quad-core phones because really why
do we need all that power I'm just gonna
be draining it is that what they said
about quad you know dual core phone now
it's like what is also what's he said
about 4G and I have to say I was one of
those people who was saying that about
4G saying you know 3g seems pretty fast
wrong sort of a real really really fast
and then last night I was playing with
the Galaxy Nexus it's awful mg ah just a
neck house of Android Atlas described it
to me as basically the difference
between using 3g and 4g is that it's
like you're driving from San Francisco
to LA at 60 miles an hour and it takes
you 10 hours or six hours and you're
driving from San Francisco to LA at a
hundred and forty miles and right I
really just get there and then there you
are no wait I think he said faster than
that like you get there in half an hour
which is pretty much maybe like that
here that's what 4g is is basically
light speed but so this is what the
rumor would be and so if we see HTC edge
I'm a rule Congress what it will have my
BFF in East cnet you pay luke westaway
has said that it would have a 1.5
gigahertz cores 720p obviously it's
going to be HD Ray's gonna have an 8
megapixel camera it's going to be 4.7
inches diagonal so that's pretty huge
but it's smaller than the breadbox that
they announced here so the galaxy note
the Galaxy Notes like this big basically
like having another like person in your
pocket right to have the galaxy note
what did I describe it as it's basically
as big as a Sunday ham I don't know why
I think the galaxy note is as big as a
Sunday hand yeah more like I get it
what did we feed your family with the
galaxy knows I'm not Renee that I am
wrong oh yeah cos a little stylist oh
that's so adorable is it's really um and
so that would be so exciting so we'll
see we'll have to bet on whether or not
I mean this is actually a pretty great
bet because if the HTC edge doesn't come
out of movie will Congress one of us is
gonna get a point oh shoot and it's
probably gonna be probably gonna be big
yeah because that's how it's a lot of
you always get the point I know okay
well speaking of the fact that I always
win the bedding a portion of rumor has
it so far let's take a break a
commercial break and hear from our
sponsors and then coming back we are
going to see careens humiliation video
which I want you to know I she hasn't
even seen it is not allowed me to see it
because it's too mortifying and they
want to see the shock and all on my face
as we perform a friggin enjoys shocking
and awful how do you feel is that what
you say yeah shock and awe shocking and
awful I think it's usually awesome miss
yeah but it's gonna be that no it's just
all yeah right got it okay come back in
a second
we're back from our short commercial
break and now is the moment that
everybody but me has been waiting for
which is the humiliation day portion of
the show oh man exactly again as we
mentioned before we take bets on the
tech rumors that we think are going to
come true and at the end of the month we
round up the points and whoever loses
has to humiliate themselves so so far
I've lost twice so I had to dress up as
a banana suit and walk around the
streets of San Francisco and I like I
went to subway hey a nice nap tended
like everything armel and nobody cared
or notice San Francisco I mean I got a
pair of banana sativa wearing coffee
it's not out of the ordinary and then we
did a scene we read a scene from
Twilight we and i bothering country

you going to do that thank you so much
absolutely next month all lose it's all
fair it's all fair all right so let's
move on to our next rumor now this one
is kind of silly it comes out of the
everybody at CES this week has been
talking about Angry Birds like in every
single press conference it's like Angry
Birds Angry Birds Angry Birds so at the
Samsung press conference they mention
angry birds because part of the motion
control with their new TVs is that
you'll be able to play Angry Birds on
the screen which is you mean like this
like push yeah or pull the thing i don't
know i'm not really sure how it works
with your hands because i can't i'm so
over with the on the tablet so anyway
rumor has it I love when I say rumor has
it on my good show here i'm laying the
name ID show again listen so that's why
this is called never has it anyway so
rumor has it that samsung ordered two
thousand plush angry bird stuffed
animals and to help them promote angry
birds on their tvs and we're going to
hand them out after people left the
audience so the rumor is that the boxes
of angry bird plush dolls came too late
and they were stuck with 10,000 plush
angry birds so then and they didn't know
what to do with it so they were kind of
like giving it to their friends giving
it to the guy at the bar layout throwing
it down instead of money at the poker
tables and they didn't know what to do
so the subtle but that we heard
on the show floor is that is that they
had these left over Angry Birds that
they could not give out at the press
conference so I took my crack
investigative team we pulled together
some people who wanted some free swag
and we ran around the show floor we got
to the Samsung booth and we're like hey
we heard you had 1.5 bazillion angry
bird plush dolls where are they and they
said they didn't know anything about it
they claimed they had no no that is very
angry bird plush doll fiasco did not
happen so I don't know somebody's
walking around right now with at least
60,000 angry birds like in their
suitcase like my god i didn't give those
things away i guess located at $95
overweight charge on my back because i
saw her and they had like foam wearing
one I mean they had all the angry
Pakistani accent number one you guys
that's what happens here so anyway so I
was so annoying like we so see it I
don't know if you guys were watching our
site on Monday but we were covering
every single live event live blogging it
live streaming it live tweeting it live
facebooking it Google+ again sometimes
when we remember the Google+ existed and
sorry snap but the time was it was like
we were totally crazy busy and we're
working like maniacs in our trailer and
aunt the computer and we're listening to
every single event and every single
keynote speaker mentioned angry birds
like I thought it was so cool in it and
it was like a drinking game of angry
yards over it's been an actual driver
you would have been with by 11am and you
know and then as i floated over my body
existentially as I was running around
this humongous central hall looking for
the angry bird plushies I realized that
this is the most ridiculous thing I've
ever done you're like Who am I I know
Angry Birds has completely jumped the
shark and nobody I don't I hate it I
don't even want to talk about it yeah
because i just mentioned angry but I'm
one of them I know well I mean I think
it's kind of like once the higher execs
start mentioning it because they think
it's the cool little hip thing that like
gets them in with the people you realize
that that's one that people are gonna
stop using it yeah but now we're done
hope you guys had fun with Angry Birds
cuz he never see it again you every year
on
where has everybody Oh said angry birds
and now it's done nobody wants to play
it anymore so anyway so that was my my
little but the thing is I do want to say
I'm really sorry you didn't get a
stuffed animal like I is what of it all
I did I mean I'm Jewish but Santa
brought me some among the guests that I
got was an angry bird that when you
squeeze it it yells so i'm pretty set in
my already heard quota for the mother
I've got a couple say let me say well
it's our necks on to our next rumor
which is about the PlayStation 4 well my
favorite thing to talk about is gaming
because I'm a gamer I love games and I
mean I say I'm a gamer is such a gamer
but she just got the PlayStation know
the xbox I just finally buddy i'm a
gamer and i play lego batman oh yeah
checking over who's been using the ps2
for the past 10 years I mean you guys
know it's not a gentle area it's really
sad so speaking to reporters at the
Consumer Electronics Show this week Sony
Computer Entertainment Chairman Kazuo
Hirai said that his company won't be
unveiling a new console at the e3 gaming
expo this summer which is when everybody
thought that the next PlayStation was
going to be announced because I don't
think everybody thought that because the
room I for that yeah you thought that
I'm everybody but the rumors that have
been saying that it was gonna be 2014
which sort of makes it they were going
to announce it or start to oh yeah maybe
at this III or the next you know that it
was good there were rumors the rumor
mill about the plate the next yeah a
generation of the PlayStation and the
Xbox have started to any reported before
that there's that people are saying
that's Sony and Microsoft are already
working on it maybe even like given
gaming companies access to some of it so
that they can tell them how what they
want the new devices right they're going
back to us like they're going to start
developing the games and then make the
yeah consoles based on the awesome game
they want they say okay this is what the
console needs which is a great way great
idea I think yeah I mean that it should
be designed um so historically console
makers have kind of stuck to a five-year
life cycle for for console and after
five years of being on the Shelf then
they're like okay like now it's time to
release a new one and it doesn't mean
that the pie mean maybe just recently
the ps2 started like I mean there's a
couple guy make money on the shelf at
gamespot for the ps2 and I know because
just until
like two months ago I was still playing
them oh my god Blaire like on sale for
99 minutes I would buy the new ones
you're like 22 dollars I spent money on
a new bestie wave left in the last year
so I don't know i mean the five-year
life cycle is pretty well and now we're
coming up on that how we're coming up on
that the ps2 is released in two thousand
the ps3 was released in 2006 yeah and so
now you know six years later like maybe
it's time but Sony is so stubborn and
sonia's like we do not have to stick to
this five-year life size yeah but so
every question last 10 years it's
stubbornness or is it that their company
is so many layers of bureaucracy on top
of itself that they're like someone
wants us to introduce the ps4 but this
person does known exactly so then they
announced it happen and then they're
like oh wait maybe that oh honey you
never made the power and enters five
cycles I don't know if L scared and I
like to start talking like robots what
so he is who cares because the ps3 is
still so great if you don't easy today
but even if they came out with the ps4
it doesn't mean that the ps3 is gonna go
out anything no I mean it's been making
money every single year in San now just
in 2010 it they sold 14 million consoles
oh my god that in their fiscal year in
their 2010 fiscal year Sony got well I
money they NFS slim won that year which
made it like pretty alright takes up
less space on your home entertainment
and then I wondering if the playstation
move which is like the other connect but
the kinect if that is going to extend
the life cycle a little bit because it's
adding a little bit more capabilities
and that's what Microsoft has been doing
like they're not introducing an entire
new xbox but they announced to connect
and then they're gonna announce
improvements to connect and now they
announce new ways you can use the Kinect
interactive their television that's
right about gay so nobody's going to
know you're not going to be getting rid
of your Xbox in anytime soon but well I
know and then there's the PS Vita which
is that handheld thing that yeah you can
touch it and like that looks cool I
can't wait to go to target and play
without I know Jeff got more before boy
on to play with it so many times in
loves he does love it although he says
there's a caveat and I can't remember
what it is I can't either there's a
problem ask Jeff help i think its
proprietary proprietary audibles
potentially in time ends I don't know I
look it up I'll tweet it out later but
yeah so the thing is I really feel in my
heart of hearts that the ps4 is not
coming out until 2014 because it takes a
long time to develop something like this
and a lot of coordination with the
gaming makers and these people and it's
like it's actually a huge deal and to
develop like a whole new generation of
graphic graphical technology and to take
it to the next level to even justify it
being a new gaming rig takes forever but
I personally am sort of hoping selfishly
that it will come out this year only
because I once was on vacation and
Sharon Vaknin took my place at rumor has
it as the co-host and she bet that on my
behalf that it was going to come out
this year and even though I completely
disagree with her and I don't so much
with your bind gonna get that point if
it comes out I mean you don't even
believe that it's gonna happen just
because she's been shown to you how to
do changing your tune you fickle fickle
I know there was one time when I said I
would be a gentleman and even if it came
out and I got that point I would not
take it because I hadn't actually said
that that I know but no way my life in
front of all these nice people you're
like I'm taking that point I shouldn't
and I'm gonna actually as you point I
drink your water I can have your
computer again everything look I want
every day so anyway so we'll see we'll
see if ok yes or 47 yes four yes four I
don't know not now i'm an xbox girl i
guess so now you've totally jumped ship
for i know but i don't know and i really
both of them you'll probably buy the ps4
you buy everything I mean I have a wii a
ps2 and then an xbox 360 sitting right
next to each other like I have no more
room on my on my dresser alright guys
are so what we need to do now since
we're at the end of our bet of our
rumors those are the four rumors wanted
to talk about we should now move on to
the much more exciting most exciting
part of our show which is where we
actually bet on the enjoyment right
right yes so the beti bet yeah all bets
are wrong yeah bad i do it all right
which ones are there oh yeah okay so
many of music but we don't need it no we
don't need music apple itv is going to
have all this stuff that we talked about
it'll have all the car channels OLED
technology you can yell at it and do
this to make it changes channels oh
absolutely that'd definitely it'll be so
beautiful and hang on your
and you won't even be able to see it and
it'll be wonderful and how big will it
be it won't be tiny it's going to be
like 55 inch you think it's gonna
they're going to manage to make it if
you have interested in that rumor did
come out yeah alright so that's the bet
will it be all of those things in a bag
of chips yes what do you say I say yes
do you had to their other sorry agree
that's a you know you can't do it but we
never said when it'll come out which I
think we can't take that bet because
that's when it gets all know I mean I I
do believe that it'll try to come out
this year but there have been a lot of
discussion I mean I feel like the Apple
board every time someone's going to come
out this year apples like yeah don't
don't talk about it and then they're
like oh one more thing here's our
humongous television yeah the eye is
having an event in New York soon oh yeah
but that's not event I've been there
news fest of a lifetime I mean is not
worried about that night that's not
gonna be Apple TV um our next that was
about the quad core HTC edge coming out
at Mobile World Congress hmm hmm I say
yes I'm gonna go ahead and say no ooh
we've got a game late in my BF fcuk
we're gonna be there luke westaway I no
no tell us God also nice and helpful
this week I used his expertise you know
cnet we have actual offices all over the
place we have a beijing office we have
people in Kentucky ya seen at UK we've
seen at asia yeah australia and kareena
nine this is our first time coming to
CES 2012 in case you can't tell we're so
excited so we had alaikum we were
starstruck by all of us yes and it was
the peanut personalities all of these
others seen at people who we talk to an
email with but we'd never met them in
person it was kind of like it was like
summer camp I was like summer camp we
all we did was hang out in sync Young's
any enemy toe and made uh what are they
called s'mores okay so the next rumor I
don't know how we're gonna bet on this
about the plushies it's 2.5 million
angry bird plushie dolls so I roaming
the central hall so the rumor is that
they had them they were going to give
them out and they were not delivered in
time yes how do we even prove that well
we'll find someone we will find a sort I
say she'll ask the janitor you please
you probably know you take the regime of
Russia yeah right
um everybody's like what this wasn't
popular anymore giving it um I say no
you say my own that happen okay I say
yes it did have that you're sure I'm
like I know it won't know I regret and
our final bet is that the PlayStation 4
will come out this year right or 2014 I
mean that's a long way yes this rumor
actually is that it's not coming out
anytime soon not coming out anytime soon
I agree see I agree but then Sharon is
already previously saying you got it you
know I'm in between that's called
doubling down I know well i'm gonna go
ahead and say no and then i'll get a
point either way ooh smarty pretty
