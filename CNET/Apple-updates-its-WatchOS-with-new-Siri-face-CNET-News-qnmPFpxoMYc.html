OS for today and we've created a new
watch face which is powered by Siri
intelligence this is the new Siri watch
face now it automatically displays the
information that's most relevant to you
so in the morning I might see for
example commute time and my first
meeting and if I rotate the crown I can
see more information from Siri for
example reminders or even photo memories
from the same time last year or maybe
from this location and throughout the
day whenever you raise your wrist the
face will dynamically update with
information for you now sometimes you
might like kind of less information and
more graphics and that's the soul of a
new kaleidoscope face it displays a
beautiful symmetrical pattern it slowly
changes throughout the day and you can
rotate the crown and give this kind of
trippy effect whenever you want and I'm
really excited to welcome woody and
Jessie and Buzz watch os4 activity
notifications are more personalized to
you to help you closure rings more often
so you might start off each day with
some inspiration by receiving an update
like this this lets you know if you're
close to accomplishing an achievement or
what you can do in a match yesterday's
goals and we're now enhancing the pool
swim workout with Auto sets so just by
taking a rest at the edge of the pool
we'll automatically mark each set of
swimming that you're doing and at the
end you'll even get your distance for
each stroke type and your pace for each
set that you're doing and we also are
creating it's great the pool swim thing
is very popular but also created some
custom motion and heartrate algorithms
for a new workout type called
high-intensity interval training now
this is one of the most popular workouts
in the world so we know it's going to be
a favorite for a lot of you when you
start using it it's now super easy to
just swipe over during a current workout
and then add another one by pressing the
plus button you just press plus and I
can continue with another workout for
example I might do some outdoor cycling
here I just tap and I continue super
easy now to do multiple workouts in a
single session let's talk about music
Apple watch paired with air pods has
really become a magical combination and
we're redesigning the music app on watch
to make this a really great experience
with the new music app we're going to
automatically sync music for you based
on what you love to listen to and the
app simply presents some beautiful album
art and playlist images and you can just
navigate by rotating the digital crown
so you can easily play your
like now and we support multiple
playlists and music on the watch now so
your music that you love is going to be
ready when you are
in making apple watch and earpods a
truly magical listening experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
