am behind the wheel of the 2013 Lexus IS
350 F Sport now the F Sport version of
the new is 350 is interesting because it
is the only model in the lineup that
comes with this a full LCD animated
instrument cluster now when the
instrument cluster isn't shut off you
see that you've just basically got a
black LCD screen and this sort of a
metallic bezel but when you depress the
brake pedal and start the ended up the
entire thing comes to life this is very
LFA inspired the Lexus supercar that
they actually debuted a couple years ago
that we had an opportunity to drive
sometime last year and it's a large
single gauge that has a digital
speedometer a digital analog
representation of a tachometer on your
right you've got your your fuel economy
information and on the left you've got
your temperature information but it also
actually moves around a little bit so if
you hit a button on the steering wheel
you'll see that the gauge the the actual
physical part of the gauge slides over
with some motorized movement and on the
right side you've got more information
so you've got vehicle information
navigation information so if you're
going driving somewhere you get your
turn-by-turn directions they're
currently playing audio source any sort
of messages or warnings that you may
have and then under each of those you've
got more information like this eco meter
right here to let you know how greenly
you're driving if you don't want to see
all of that we hit a button on the
steering wheel and the gauge slides back
over and the screen behind it animates
to kind of make everything a little more
cohesive well of an inch one good one
this is the all-new Lexus if' 350 F
Sport and I've been giving you a look at
its digital instrument cluster</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
