at the Aki portable bluetooth receiver
for cars that's this little device here
which can retrofit your car with
Bluetooth audio streaming and Bluetooth
hands-free phone calls from your phone
to here to your car stereo the main
component of this device is this little
spherical kind of half sphere achill
thing and this you actually attached to
your dashboard somewhere in your car
Aki has this little magnetic pad you
attach this adhesive pad to somewhere in
your dashboard and then this actually
cleverly hooks to this so you can take
this whole unit off hide this in a
console if you don't want it to be seen
while you're parked or something like
that or just leave it on here and we
have a wire coming off this main unit
here at splits down the middle and one
end goes to this USB plug that's for
powering up the main device Aki
conveniently includes this little USB 2
12 volt adapter so you plug this into
your car's cigarette lighter or power
point whatever you want to call it now
I'm using a 12 volt power supply just to
demonstrate this in the studio so I'll
plug that in that powers up the device I
also have an auxiliary plug auxilary
audio plug coming off of the Aki unit
this will plug into the auxiliary input
on my car stereo that's where all the
audio from this will come through
actually from the phone to this will
come through here to the car stereo they
have some really cleverly integrated
controls on here so if I twist this left
or right twist it once it'll skip a
track forward puts it back it'll skip
back a track of this in any music plane
or if I twist and hold it'll actually
change the volume of the audio coming
through so you can quickly change your
audio up or down coming from your phone
and also there's a button on the top
here so if I just click this button once
like that it'll pause any music playing
off my phone if I click it again it'll
play the music so that's very convenient
as well I could also use this to accept
an incoming phone call but even better
if I push and hold this button down it
activates voice command on a smart phone
navigate to CBS Los Angeles and it's
found some locations for CBS Los Angeles
so if I have this in my car I gotta have
my phone back in a bag or
my coke pocket I've just pushed this
cause navigation startup in any voice
prompts for navigation will come through
this to the car stereo so I can use this
to navigate I can also get text messages
so I can have Siri read out text
messages I really like this device I
like the way it works I like the way it
enables Bluetooth in your car a lot of
great functions but one thing to keep in
mind is that it requires an aux jack in
your stereo if you don't have that in
your car stereo this will do you no good
I'm when cutting am here taking a look
