these days even those with similar zoom
ranges can be found in both pocket and
full-size models case in point the nikon
coolpix l830 it has a thirty four X
twenty two point five to seven sixty
five millimeter zoom lens while nikons s
9700 has a 30 X 25 to 750 millimeter
zoom lens I'm Josh grobin with CNET and
while these lenses are very close in
range they are very different in size
and price for that matter with the l830
available for around two hundred and
fifty dollars which is about a hundred
dollars less than the s 9700 the l830 s
lens at its widest is a bit better for
low-light shooting too and the bigger
body allows for steadier control and
it's powered by double-a batteries
that's a rarity these days and makes it
a good occasional camera the l830 is
pretty much for auto shooting only tho
so if you're looking for manual controls
this isn't your camera what it also
doesn't have is an electronic viewfinder
so you have to rely on the LCD for frame
your shots which while nice isn't easy
to see in bright conditions shooting
performance is overall good for this
class of camera but the autofocus
definitely needs more time when the lens
is extended or in low light or indoors
so it's not the best choice for
fast-moving kids and pets when zoomed in
low-light photo quality while not great
is better than other budget mega zooms
you can check out the full review on
CNET but overall this camera shots
outdoors in good lighting so use it
there and you'll get some very nice
pictures and movies I'm Josh Coleman and
that's a quick look at the nikon coolpix
l830</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
