switch you know other problems like you
pack up your switch controller you're
like I want to play overcooked I want to
play multiplayer on Mario car or
whatever and you pack up your switch
controller and it's like over by re and
you get really angry well and you throw
things at the TV that's what I do anyway
that's things kind of a solution to that
it's like it's charges through the ear
which isn't seen because normally when
you are charging intend or switch
controller if you have to plug it into
the switch then you have to tick this
switch and puts it into the door and you
can't actually play the game because
it's charging and the dock is way old
man
so this thing allows you to play well
it's charging which is kind of a first
the wheat walks is wizardry I guess it
charges through this thing which sends
like an RF signal to this thing which is
actually unsaved this thing and it
charges a bar in here which then charges
the joy coins themselves so that means
not only is it charging as you played
but you can play as it charges which to
be honest I'm losing my mind over this
because the Nintendo switch control
thing has been telling me since Agora
even all of the console the range is
pretty decent
okay I'll show you this green light
means it's on so if we walk backwards
it's charging from less than yea ba-bop
ba-bop ba-bop ba-bop oh that's pretty
good so now is starter come on man wow I
guess it's still gone
is that still gone ah there we go
so I don't know about you I thought I
heard of course your sweat shows to your
TV but that's pretty decent man so yeah
I'm super excited for this I'm losing my
mind actually so I guess the thing that
makes this possible is the parasport the
corner wireless charging grips which is
came to disappoint and I feel like it
needs a sexier name come on guys
yeah and it's certainly third quarter
this year and yes in Canada both for
coming to show you where I live because
I need one right now please thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
