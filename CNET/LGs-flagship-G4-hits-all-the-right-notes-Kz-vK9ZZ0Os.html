and LG latest marquee handset is
officially here so it's time to take a
closer look at the LG g4 flagships
similar to its g3 predecessor the g4
sports an ultra crisp 5.5 inch 1440p
display but LG has made some notable
changes to the screen name Leah using
what it calls an IPS quantum display
that improves brightness by twenty-five
percent and contrast by 50% that means
we also see richer and deeper red tones
and more true-to-life blue tones the g4
is also slightly curved like LG's other
high-end handsets the G flex 2 but the
ark isn't as steep and in fact you could
only really see it if you lie it face
down on a flat surface other than the
curve the g4 doesn't look much different
from before its dimensions have
increased a bit all around its corners
are slightly sharper and there are some
new design choices like a leather and
ceramic like backplate before the most
part there hasn't been a huge design
overhaul the handset is powered by a six
or hexa core 1.8 giga hertz snapdragon
808 processor from Qualcomm though this
sounds like a step down from the g flex
choose octa-core 810 processor LG
reports that the 808 chip is more
optimized for the g4 and you're unlikely
to notice any significant speed
differences anyway in addition you'll
get a 3 ampere our removable battery 3
gigs of ram 32 gigs of internal memory
and a microSD card slot for expandable
storage LG has also made improvements to
the phone's camera the front shooter now
has eight megapixels and the rear camera
has been bumped up to 16 megapixels with
an aperture of 1.8 to help shoot in
low-light environments you'll still get
optical image stabilization and the
laser-guided autofocus which we've seen
before but there are also new shooting
modes to play around with these are
labeled simple auto and manual with the
last one giving users the most control
and tools over their photos as for
software the g4 is just with android 5.1
lollipop and as LG's refresh user
interface UX four-point-oh overlaid on
top
aside from the new look there's LG
bulletin which lets you organize widgets
on a full homepage more ways to organize
your photos in the gallery including a
memories option and event pocket which
syncs with your Facebook events and lets
you drag and drop items and photos into
your calendar the device has already
launched in Korea and will roll out to
other countries in late May and early
June all four major US carriers will
carry the handset as well as US cellular
and the phone will be available in the
UK and Australia though exact pricing
hasn't been released yet you can expect
it to be consistent with the g3 when it
first launched so about two hundred
dollars with a carrier contract or
upwards from six hundred dollars without
again I'm Lynn and you've been checking
out the LG g4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
