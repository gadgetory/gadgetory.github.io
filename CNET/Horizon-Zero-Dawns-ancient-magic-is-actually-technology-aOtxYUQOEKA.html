discovers an ancient magic or has some
kind of special power bestowed upon them
in horizon zero dawn however there's a
twist the ancient magic is while
technology there's magic with old
fantasy in this game everything you
experience in this game should be
grounded in science fiction the
designers should be able to explain the
reason why that is a certain way we
spent a few hours playing an extended
preview of the game and one thing was
quickly apparent there's a richness to
the world here that goes a lot deeper
than just hey that looks cool we do
anthropological research and we find
that the way a culture is created comes
into existence is determined by the
resources that are available if you
aren't familiar with horizon zero dawn
you play a loi a wild fierce young woman
seeking answers about her family in a
world full of strange robotic creatures
and primitive tribes wary of technology
so the humans that are left in smaller
tribes they are now in this world where
the machines are dominant but they've
never known a world without these
machines so in a way you see this Bronze
Age kind of weaponry you see the bows
you see the spheres but they will also
harvest elements of these machines and
they use them in their integrity to
craft stuff to make stuff to be able to
fight these machines a law uses ancient
technology that lets her scan areas and
gain an advantage over the machines by
overwriting them or using her hunting
skills to take them out classic action
RPG elements come into play including
crafting gathering gear upgrades and
skill enhancements but for us combat was
the high point during the demo with
plenty of strange weapons and makeshift
traps to use on your enemies you'll find
lots of ways to defeat both machine and
man using some of that old technology in
this world is going to be really fun
based on our time with the game we tend
to agree and we're looking forward to
the full experience when horizon zero
dawn hits PlayStation 4 on februari 28</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
