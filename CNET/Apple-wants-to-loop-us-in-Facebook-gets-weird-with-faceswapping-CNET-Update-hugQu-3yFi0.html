iphone and ipad while the rest of the
world is busy making weird face swap
photos I'm Bridget Carey this is your
Cena update well folks it seems another
iphone and ipad will be unveiled in a
few days Apple sent out an invite to
press for an event on March twenty first
with the teaser tagline let us loop you
in as usual there have been some insider
leaks and anonymous source reports over
the past few months that give us clues
to what Apple may show off although
nothing is for certain there's been talk
of a successor to the iPad air 2 and a
smaller 4-inch screen iPhone that would
essentially be a souped-up version of
the iphone 5s smaller and cheaper than
the success yet it could come with Apple
pay powers it's also been a year since
Apple unveiled the first Apple watch so
people are antsy to know what's coming
next but don't hold your breath Apple
could just be talking about new software
tricks or new bands maybe bands that are
loopy let us loop you in you see usually
these teasers have a hidden meaning
Apple's campus address is one infinite
loop but it's got to be more than that
perhaps it represents something deeper
it could symbolize we the media stuck in
a loop chasing the hype of apple's next
move waiting for the gadgets to make our
lives better but we're going nowhere
like hamsters in a wheel or it could
just be a new Apple watch band so
speaking of pointlessness oculus virtual
reality is getting into social media
yeah the oculus rift headset is not even
out yet but the facebook-owned oculus
also creates experiences for Samsung's
not as cool gear VR headset and if you
have a gear VR and your friend has a
gear VR well you can now hang out with
your friends in the virtual world with
games like social trivia where you just
sit in a room and if that room isn't
cool enough you can sit in another
virtual room to watch video from
Facebook along with twitch and Vimeo
there's also a gladiator strategy game
for when you want the illusion of doing
something more than sitting Facebook is
also hard at work at making videos
better so it purchased an app that uses
weird
face filters masquerade is now owned by
Facebook and it has some of the appeal
of snapchats cartoony selfie features
but you can also look like a celebrity
or swap faces with someone we have
technology to make self-driving cars and
send rockets to Mars and now also make
creepy face video things that's it for
this tech news update for Moorhead the
cnet com from our studios in New York
