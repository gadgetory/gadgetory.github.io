iPhone is right around the corner and
not a minute too soon since it's been
years since I've experienced public eye
phone snobbery the rumor mills are
hopping with reports of what new
features we can expect but who really
cares what we're getting the real
question is what do you want Donal Bell
and then this top five we're counting
down five of the features you want most
from the next iPhone these numbers come
straight from polling data we've
collected from CNET readers over the
past few weeks so don't you yell at me
if you don't agree with what you hear go
yell at yourself I guess starting off at
number five with around 9,000 votes we
asked you what long missing feature of
the iPhone you wanted most in the next
one
and you said NFC Near Field
Communication well I wouldn't count on
it but I understand the appeal in theory
if nothing else it could turn the
undeletable passbook app into a
functional wallet that you still won't
use and can't delete also the airdrop
feature of iOS 7 is already bringing
local file sharing without the awkward
ritual of bumping your phones together
I'm glad somebody wants NFC but it's not
me I'm not rubbing my phone on stuff
when they come out with introvert
germaphobe communication then we'll talk
alright when we asked you what feature
you wanted most from iOS 7 we got nearly
10,000 votes for number four control
center I don't blame you this is Apple
finally admitting that Android had the
right idea when they took all the most
frequently used settings and plopped
them into one panel that you can access
from any screen no more digging around
for Bluetooth or clicking three places
just to adjust screen brightness with
any luck you may never have to open the
real Settings menu again for number
three we ask you what kind of material
you wanted the iPhone to be made from
maybe Kevlar like the Moto X or plastic
like the Galaxy s4 but instead you voted
for metal maybe the poll got hacked by a
rogue group of beavis and butthead fans
or maybe you just like the cold feel of
hard metal in your hand you'll probably
get this one though considering that the
iPhone 5 already uses a mostly metal
design rumors we'll also get a low cost
plastic
the iPhone which is exciting news for
the 6% of you who voted for plastic for
number two we asked you what was the
most important hardware upgrade that
would influence your decision to buy the
new iPhone and you said better battery
life a whopping 57% of voters I totally
know where you're coming from how much
of our lives do we spend tending to our
battery life and you just know that a
decade from now all these things will
harvest wireless ambient energy and lot
to bore our kids with tales of the great
lightning cable shake-up of 2012 it was
mayhem I tell you now the bad news is
that the number one feature seen that
readers want most from the next iPhone
runs completely counter to your dream of
better battery life at number one a
bigger screen we gave you a range of
sizes to choose from and the most
popular option with 4.7 inches same size
as the Motorola X but not quite the 5
inch plank of the Samsung Galaxy s4 the
funny thing is once we start getting all
our email on our Google glass and our
tweets on our iWatch and maybe some
Yahoo underwear and a Facebook girdle
the idea of actually looking at your
phone is going to seem like overkill so
there you go 5 of the features that you
guys want most from the next iPhone for
all the latest rumors visit
