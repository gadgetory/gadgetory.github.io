iDevices $80 kitchen thermometer so at
first glance this looks like a
traditional digital kitchen thermometer
traditional thermometers have a chime so
you need to be nearby to hear that your
food is finished this one on the other
hand has an app so it'll send you a push
notification when your food reaches an
optimal temperature it also has two
probes so you can cook two different
meals at the same time or use both for
one meal that promises greater
flexibility if you're cooking multiple
things at once or more accuracy if
you're cooking one thing but the app
connectivity is really what separates
this 80 dollar model from a standard 20
dollar digital thermometer even if
you're using a regular thermometer you
have to constantly check in with it to
make sure your food isn't overcooked but
with this one you can be as far as 150
feet away so you need to still be at
home or near home but you can wander
around your house you can be even
outside and if you have your phone or
other connected device you can still get
that alert I also found it to be
incredibly accurate so not only does it
allow for more flexibility and
convenience but it's also very accurate
for testing a convection roasted to a
whole chicken and a pork tenderloin I
also used to professional level
thermocouples for comparison these
consistently stayed within a few degrees
of the thermocouples so you know that
not only are you getting that
convenience with the app you're actually
getting an accurate reading it's nice
that the iDevices app has a graph so you
can track the progress of your food as
it cooks but in the full-screen view the
apps aren't even labeled which really
affects the usability overall though I
really like this device and knowing how
accurate the probes are it can really
give you the confidence to leave your
food and rely on the app completely to
let you know when your food is done so
while this is definitely an expensive
kitchen thermometer you're really just
paying for that convenience and I think
it's worth it thanks for watching this
review of iDevices kitchen thermometer
