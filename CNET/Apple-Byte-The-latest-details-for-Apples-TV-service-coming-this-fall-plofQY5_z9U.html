show you know you might have heard of
it's called the Apple bite for
everything good and bad inside the world
of Apple let's go and the big story this
week from The Wall Street Journal says
Apple is in talks with programmers
including CBS FOX and ABC to launch
their own subscription-based streaming
TV service this fall now that's another
notion Tongass prediction coming true
this year
see now the report claims Apple's TV
service will include about 25 channels
cost between 30 to 40 dollars per month
and will be available on the iPhone iPad
and Apple TV the service is expected to
debut this June at Apple's Worldwide
Developers Conference ahead of its
targeted September launch now NBC
Universal content could possibly be
absent because of a fallout between
Apple and parent company Comcast reports
claimed the big A and Comcast we're
working together as far back as 2012 on
a set top box partnership but Apple
believed Comcast was dragging out the
process to launch their own revamped x1
set-top box for web streaming in you
don't want to get on Apple's bad side
now getting as many partners onboard is
key like we've seen with sling TV
service that starts at $20 and Sony's
recently announced view TV that starts
at $50 for 50 channels but also offers a
cloud driven DVR service to store
previous shows for up to 28 days and I
dig that now according to the New York
Post Apple is luring content partners
with the promise of sharing data like
who its viewers are what is being
watched and when they are watching the
report claims are offering data that
other streaming services like Netflix
and Amazon have refused to give up now
the reality is that we don't know how
much or really if they're even going to
give away any customer data Apple is
also in talks with Discovery and Viacom
and could see channels such as discovery
MTV Comedy Central and Nickelodeon
available on the service or wait for
guys TLC which offers some of the worst
programs in the history of television
see here I took a picture of its website
to confirm this
now the Apple TV service rumors have
been around for over five years and the
TV industry is finally moving into the
modern era by treating streaming video
as a legitimate way to make money there
will be plenty more developments here
but I can't wait to see how this all
shakes out the interface and if there
will be any cloud DVR feature which is
really key for me
alright 9 to 5 Mack reports that NBC
Universal will still live on the Apple
TV even if it's not part of their
streaming service just yet in the form
of an NBC app that will still require
you to have a cable subscription for it
to work also the living room battle is
just getting started but the smartphone
war is anything but over 9 to 5 Mac
reports that Apple is planning to launch
a new traded program for Android and
Blackberry phones in exchange for gift
cards that can be used towards the
purchase of a new iPhone now the program
is expected to start up in the coming
weeks and how perfect is that for timing
around the same time Samsung is
releasing the galaxy s6 on April the
10th it's competition and yeah it's also
a jerk move now Mario Luigi link and
Samus could be coming to an iPad or
iPhone in the future after stubborn old
Nintendo finally realized that 2015 is
the year that they should get on this
new platform called mobile games that's
really roughly a 25 billion dollar
market something I've been begging them
to do for 2 plus years now they
partnered with Japanese mobile game
maker DNA and will jointly develop games
for smartphones tablets and PCs since no
one is buying a Wii U hold on fine find
you that person who just got mad at me
for saying that yeah you actually bought
one I'll write the Apple watch has
received final FCC approvals ahead of
its launch on April the 24th you'll be
able to try it on in-store and Apple
will have its own magnetic charging
bracelet for the watch specifically for
their stores now retail associates are
saying that you can make an appointment
when they're available while other
workers are saying walk-ins to try them
on will be available as well and I know
I went hard at the Apple watch last
weekend rightfully so I'm still sticking
to my stance that I don't really need or
want
but I'm buying one and trying it out to
see if it's worth my money and I'm going
for one that I would actually wear and
if I don't like it yeah I'm gonna return
it so yes this 115 thousand dollar Apple
watch edition with 11 carats of diamonds
from brick is the direction I'm leaning
in all right getting feedback from you
the viewers it feels like only 20% of
you actually really want to watch so if
you plan on getting one of these from
Apple check out the pod from Nomad this
is the first portable battery pack for
the Apple watch that will allow it to
last beyond Apple's claim of 18 hours
you'll take the actual Apple watch
charging cable wrap it around the pod
the pod has a battery of its own that
can either charge the watch or even
other USB powered devices it will retail
for 59 bucks and Nomad says the pod will
deliver four full charges to the watch
it's still not in production yet a
little bit of a red flag to me but they
say they're just waiting for Apple
ascend them the finalized dimensions and
since we're talking about charging Apple
gadgets let's do another killer giveaway
for you the Apple fighters I know we
haven't done this in a while and my
favorite battery pack cases for the
iPhone from Mophie are here now these
just dropped a few weeks ago so we're
giving away three iPhone 6 and one i
phone 6 plus juice pack to the Apple
byte nation and I just want to let you
know I have intimately touched each one
of these six flash all you have to do is
send me an email or tweet me what you
think about the Apple watch I know I
asked you to do this last week so all of
you that sent me responses will also be
included for the random winners that I
picked all right hit me up on the
Twitter Bryant on or email me at the
Apple bite at cnet.com and I'll announce
