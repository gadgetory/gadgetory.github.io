CNN taking a first look at the HTC evo
design 4g this is a new phone for sprint
if you're already familiar with the
other members of the HTC EVO family this
one looks really really similar but it
is a little bit smaller still it's not
that small because it has a 4-inch wvga
screen with a 960 x 540 pixel resolution
as usual HTC does a really beautiful job
making the hardware feel very high-end
it's got this brushed black metal along
the sides and here on the back it also
has a soft touch rubber finish on the
back as well so it's definitely got this
understated elegance and in the hand
it's got about the right weight too so
it definitely feels like a premium phone
it's running android 2.3 gingerbread
with HTC Sense three-point oh and I'm a
huge fan of this custom UI because it is
smart it's graphically rich it adds a
lot of convenience with the pulldown
menus and with the lock screen it's also
in the app tray and wallpapers and there
are some additional HTC apps that you
can download as well HTC Sense even
makes an appearance in the camera app
with some of the editing tools overall I
think that HTC does a really fantastic
job enhancing Android and it shows on
this phone okay so onto the cameras
there is a 5 megapixel camera on the
back and a 1.3 megapixel camera on the
front this phone takes pretty good
photos as well it also records in 720p
HD video now this is not a dual-core
device but it does run off of the single
core 1.2 gigahertz processor I have no
complaints with the speed here for other
speeds it is a 4g phone so it's running
off of Sprint's wimax network one of the
interesting things that you can't see
just by looking is that there's actually
a dual mode on here there is a CDMA and
GSM chip that makes it a world phone so
you will be able to take it outside of
the country and slip in a GSM SIM card
so overall this phone calls were really
solid quality it's a great value there's
not ice cream sandwich on it of course
but it should eventually be upgradable
if you really need something right now
on sprint this is an absolute steal i'm
testing adult court for Siena and this
has been your first look at the HTC evo
design 4g</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
