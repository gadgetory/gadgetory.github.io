if there's one big time battle that you
the people have been begging for it's
this one it's a prize five punch out
between the motorola xoom and the apple
ipad to our judges for this fight our
senior editor donald bad to the bell
senior editor Eric shake and bake
Franklin and myself Twinkle Toes Tom now
we'll take all three judges scores and
average them out to the nearest tenth
each round the final prize five score be
an average of all rounds using the same
decimal system get ready for a five
round fracas verse one is designed the
motorola xoom impressed us when we first
saw it it's 10.1 inch 16 by 9 display is
primarily meant to be used horizontally
the matte black surface works but what's
the first thing you notice when you pick
up this thing its weight now 1.6 pounds
my satellite to you but for a tablet
it's not Apple has really outdone itself
with the design for the ipad 2 it's
almost half as thick as the zoom at one
point three pounds it feels a lot
lighter and its really a marvel to hold
you might think we're drinking the
kool-aid but this is hands down these
limits and most elegant tablet design
we've ever seen plus it's really thin
enough to cut vegetables the ipad gets a
4.7 and the zoom gets a 3.7 next round
is controls and user interface the
motorola xoom features androids first
dedicated tablet operating system in
honeycomb and it's really a geeks dream
it's a more advanced user interface with
customizable options for multiple home
screens quick access to recent apps and
more bells and whistles but
unfortunately it still doesn't make this
thing easy to use there are touch
buttons and options on all four corners
and a power button on the back side but
this is just not a pick up and play
tablet now Apple's iOS on the iPad two
hasn't seen many changes and sure it can
feel a little dated but if it ain't
broke don't fix it this is an OS at our
kids our parents and our parents parents
can all use and you can't get any more
Universal than that we'd like to see an
update with its archaic
system but when it comes to user
interface Apple takes the cake and takes
this round with the five and the zoom
gets a 3.3 dr. averaging two rounds
apple's ipad 2 takes a huge lead but
there is plenty of prize fight left to
go next round is features and
performance if you're looking for raw
power the zoom is where it's at with its
dual-core processors more ram than the
ipad to a higher resolution screen
higher quality cameras with a dual LED
flash SD card slot and 4g compatibility
plus voice search commands and androids
turn-by-turn directions I just whip
myself now the ipad 2 has dual core
processors and it's a snappy experience
but what it lacks in hardware muscle it
makes up for it with an abundance of
apps that really transforms it into a
Netflix player or a killer mobile gaming
system a DJ turntable or a sketchbook
apps make this more than just a tablet
and it's a one-of-a-kind experience that
honeycomb can only wish for right now
Apple takes its third round in a row
with the 4.7 and the zoom gets a 3.7
next round is web browsing to multimedia
the zoom brings us a full feature
browser with flash 10.2 support that's
faster than safari and it has tabs
you're basically touching chrome and
it's the best web experience on a tablet
now if we're talking multimedia
honeycomb has improved its media player
but there's still no ecosystem to make
it a seamless experience and it trails
behind apple's war chest of content on
the ipad Safari is still a solid browser
double tapping and zooming is smoother
but it's trailing Google when it comes
to a full web experience multimedia on
the other hand is king on the iPad
there's so much content to download and
read through itunes apps to offer an
interactive media experience and you can
now create media on this device and ways
we have never seen before but our judges
give the edge to the zoom for its web
browsing prowess and it takes this round
four to three point seven dr. averaging
four rounds the ipad 2 leads by eight
tenths of a point those final round that
decides it all is valued
at 599 that is cheap as you're going to
get with the Wi-Fi 32 gig Motorola Xoom
that's the same price and technically
superior to the 32 gig Wi-Fi ipad 2 now
the beefed-up soon is 799 but those are
your only options at the moment now the
ipad 2 16 gig entry-level model is
priced at 499 and that's not scaring
anybody awake who wants in on the tablet
game now neither of these are cheap but
Apple takes the final round with the 4.3
and the zoom gets a 3.3 so let's average
out all five rounds and in a battle or
the ipad 2 jumped out on top early it
dominated taking four out of the five
rounds and takes this battle 4.5 to 3.6
and is your prize fight winner both of
these tablets are amazing products but
it's the ipad 2 that prevailed with this
ecosystem and plethora of apps that can
transform what a tablet can do i'm brian
song thanks for watching we'll catch you
guys next time on another prize pot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
