announces new ipods again netflix movies
come to the iphone volvo helps prevent
pedestrian collisions and how to save a
cell phone that's been dropped in the
drink it's all coming up right now
hi everyone I'm Hollywood and welcome to
the Cena tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech and offer some unique tech
wisdom in the form of the bottom line
let's start with the goods this week
Apple held its annual music event here
in San Francisco and this time around it
was less about big surprises and more
about fine-tuning existing product lines
Steve Jobs was there to walk us through
all the upgrades and now here's Jeff
Bakalar to break it all down it's
Wednesday September second 2010 I'm Jeff
Bakalar and it's time to get loaded
Apple updated its line of ipod music
players in a pretty significant way the
ipod shuffle thankfully got its buttons
back the ipod nano by far received the
biggest change dropping the iconic click
wheel for a tiny three centimeter by
three centimeter multi-touch display the
ipod touch now comes with the
high-resolution retina display from the
iphone for a front facing camera for
facetime calls and HD recording on the
rear the ipod classic remains unchanged
from last year's model at 160 gigabytes
the new ipods are available for
pre-order now and ship next week Steve
Jobs also announced new updates to iOS
starting next week iOS 4.1 will fix the
proximity sensor issues but also allows
for HDR photography that means the
iphone 4 will now take three images in
rapid succession at various exposures to
pull in detail from highlights and
shadows iOS 4.1 also brings along game
center which is Apple's gaming social
network along with iTunes ping which is
Apple's new social network for music
sharing and discovery that functionality
is also built into itunes 10 the company
also previewed iOS 4.2 which will be
released in November for the iPad
bringing multitasking folders and
finally wireless printing to the ipad
apple's one last thing moment was a
drastically different Apple TV
previously apple TV allowed users to
store movies and music in the devices
hard drive
but the new hardware does away with all
of that instead now it's a streaming
centric device which can play movies TV
shows and music streamed over your home
network can also stream netflix titles
in addition you can now rent movies for
499 or TV shows for just 99 cents the
new Apple TV will retail for only
ninety-nine dollars those your headlines
for today I'm Jeff Bakalar for cnet.com
and you've just been loaded for more of
our coverage of Steve Jobs announcement
and first looks of all the new ipods
head over to Cena TV com of course the
first thing most people do or should do
when they get a new ipod is throw out
those white earbuds that come with it so
if you've still got some money to burn
these new diddy beats in ear headphones
might make a stylish although pricey
replacement this game is stylish your
phone's monster may not have a corner on
the market but there's no denying that
it's beats by dr. dre brand is among the
more fashionable lines currently
available unsurprisingly the diddy beats
a collaboration with Sean Diddy Combs
are no exception true to form the rapper
producer was closely involved in the
design process of these earphones the
evidence is clear in the details the
earpieces in particular standout wrapped
in leather at and accented in shiny
silver did he also had a hand in
choosing the color options which are
black white and a rather nauseating pale
pink the cable which descends from each
ear button and terminates here in a
reinforced gold-plated L plug as the
flat ribbon style that the beats brand
is becoming known for features are not
sparse either the diddybeats feature
monsters controltalk inline remote and
mic for the ipod and iphones and the
package include the carrying case an
impressive array of ear tips i'm also
pleased to report that these earphones
offer nicely balanced audio playback
with good clarity and a bass response
that is sufficient but not overpowering
at $150 they're not exactly a seal but
they are a solid by for those whose very
blue suitcase I'm just
you're seeing it for the first look at
the headphone I don't know Jasmine I
kind of think I could pull off those
pink ones if you have an extra pair of
them lying around you know where to find
me but maybe you don't want an ipod at
all you are still allowed to use other
players you know no really and actually
if you're interested it's hard to go
wrong with the sansa fuze plus just ask
Donald Bell
hey I'm Donald Bell and today we're
taking a first look at the sansa fuze
plus this is a new portable media player
from sandisk available in five colors
and three capacities for 8 and 16
gigabytes price to fly out the doors at
$79 89 $119 like the original sansa fuze
from 2008 the fuse plus handles music
videos photos radio podcasts voice
recording and micro SD memory card media
the screen is bigger now 2.5 inches up
from to the navigation is handled using
a capacitive touch control now instead
of the click wheel and the connection to
your computer is now handled by a
generic micro USB cable instead of the
proprietary connection on the old
version there's also a headphone jack on
the bottom volume control on the side
and the power button at the top aside
from the cosmetic differences there's
also a lot of welcome changes happening
under the hood the fuse plus is now one
of the first sands of players to support
unprotected AAC audio which is a huge
deal if you've been getting your music
through the iTunes Store you also get
support for mp3 FLAC OGG wav WMA audible
and subscription music files so all the
bases are covered another bit of good
news for those looking for an
inexpensive mp3 player that will work
with an iTunes library is to support for
h.264 or MPEG 4 videos you also get WMV
compatibility and sandesh provides free
software that will optimize videos and
photos for the fuse including any videos
captured using a flip camera I feel the
audio quality is decent here for the
price but you're not going to get an
extensive suite of eq or sound
enhancement settings like a sony or a
samsung player a pair of earbuds come
included as well as a pouch and a USB
cable the bottom line if you're on a
budget or if you're looking for no
frills media player that will work with
most of the unprotected content from an
iTunes library the sansa fuze plus is a
solid value the design won't turn any
heads but for as little as eighty
dollars you really can't go wrong that's
the sandisk sansa fuze plus we're cnet
com I'm
so if you vowed to never give in to the
pressure of the Big Apple machine
there's still hope for you I just hope
you don't mind if I keep using my iPad
cuz Angry Birds as Jeff mentioned
earlier the new Apple TV will be
enhanced to allow netflix streaming
iphone users won't be left out in the
cold though there's finally and Netflix
app for them to totally want to see this
movie hey there and welcome to tap that
app I'm Jessica doll cord and this is
the show where we covered the hottest
apps in the mobile space this week we
wanted to show off the brand new Netflix
app for iphone and ipod touch if you
think you've spotted it before you're
not wrong it used to only be available
on ipad but now you can find it for the
smaller bushel of apples iDevices best
yet it's absolutely free now the netflix
app is a pretty awesome way for you to
stream content from anywhere you are
there's the home screen that throws out
quirky category suggestions for movies
you might like to watch like feel good
comedies or dark dramas based on real
life if that's not exactly your cup of
tea you can also browse for flicks and
shows by more typical genres like action
and foreign the app shows you all the
details like the rating the synopsis and
the list of episodes if it's a TV show
in addition you can add content to your
instant queue or just play the video on
the fly the direct line to your instant
queue is actually pretty awesome because
it means that you can stream those
movies and videos on demand directly to
your iPhone or iPod touch video quality
was excellent on the iphone 4 we've got
right here without any bumps or breakups
but that's only when you're within a
strong network range you can slightly
adjust the screen dimensions while the
video plays and there is a handy button
to take you back 30 seconds if you miss
apart so what happens if you have to
stop the show Midway that's no problem
at all Netflix actually keeps track of
your place and lets you pick up where
you left off from the top of the home
screen in addition it will prompt you to
resume the video after you've closed the
app and then reopen it all of this makes
netflix for iphone ipod touch and ipad
and exciting
competitor to Hulu Plus especially if
you're already a netflix subscriber
subscriptions start at about nine
dollars a month or you can sign up from
the web or from the app for free 30-day
trial so there's your look at Netflix's
very tap worthy streaming app if you've
got any suggestions for other apps we
should look at email us it's half that
app at cnet com that's it for this show
I'm jessica's all court and keep on tap
trust me there really is no better way
to enjoy dude where's my car then on a
three inch screen alright it's time to
take a break but we'll be back with more
cnet tech review right after this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet
continuing on with the good when he's
not filling in for Natalie unloaded Jeff
Bakalar is also host of our pregame
podcast all about video games so who
better to try out Sony's entry into the
motion controlled gaming race here's his
first look at the PlayStation Move hey
what's up everyone I'm Jeff Bakalar for
cnet.com today we're taking a first look
at the playstation move bundle starter
kit for playstation 3 after first
debuting the technology at e3 2009 sony
is finally ready to release the bundle
it's a hundred dollar bundle and it
comes with PlayStation I which is the
camera you're going to need to use
PlayStation Move the PlayStation
standard controller for move and it also
comes with a game Sports Champions which
is a collection of six minigames and
include disc golf gladiator archery
beach volleyball bocce ball and table
tennis now the standard move controller
comes with a rubber ball on top and this
LED light inside can change color so
that the camera can follow your movement
so if you have a blue ball it'll won't
clash with whatever your background is
and this will change if it needs to now
we really like the way the move
controller feels it feels really nice in
your hand and it has all or most of the
same buttons as a standard dualshock 3
controller you've got the square
triangle circle and X button on the back
you have a trigger button and on the
sides are select and start now obviously
the bundle comes with sports champions
which is basically Sony's responds to
Wii Sports now there's only six sports
here but the games feel like they're
more in depth there's more production
value you can unlock things there's a
lot more to explore in these games a
little more than what's provided on the
wii sports games now this is what you're
going to get in a hundred dollar bundle
there are other games coming out just
for PlayStation Move we got to play a
few like kung fu rider which is a sort
of wacky japanese-inspired game where
you
down a hill in an office chair it's a
little strange but it's a lot of fun to
play there's also a game called tumble
which is basically boom blox if you've
played it on the wii it's sort of like a
jenga game where you use the remote to
control boxes on screen now obviously
we're going to have to compare
playstation move to wii motionplus
because they basically give you the same
sort of control environment obviously
PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Move are
going to provide the better graphics
there's really no comparison in that
point but in terms of actual motion
control we do think PlayStation Move
provides a slight bit of an edge when it
comes to actual precise motion control
accuracy just because the PlayStation
Move uses a camera whereas wii and wii
motionplus does not now obviously we're
really big fans of being able to use
motion control in HD gaming we've never
been able to do that before but we're
just not sure this first initial launch
of PlayStation Move games is compelling
enough to make that first purchase as
the games come out and they're more
developed we think there will be a
better incentive to buy playstation move
in the future we also really enjoy the
fact that you can use your motion
controller to navigate through the cross
media bar in the playstation 3 menu
system for thirty dollars you can get
this navigation controller that has a
d-pad and an analog stick plus l1 and l2
buttons on the back which is going to be
used for games where you're using a gun
or some sort of environment where you
have to have your character moving
around on screen as well as being able
to aim properly and that will be
available when PlayStation Move launches
which is September 19th so that's going
to do it for our first look at
playstation move I'm Jeff Bakalar for
cnet com thanks for watching
okay I admit it we kinect for xbox
playstation move they all look fun but
what happened to the good old days when
it was okay to play video games lumped
on the sofa covered in cheeto dust I
mean what's the longest standing up and
moving around and with that actually get
ready for the bad folks sometimes bad
things happen to good gadgets like when
your phone ends up at the bottom of a
kiddie pool or it's mistaken for a
teething ring well fear not Sharon
Vaknin is here with some suggestions for
drying out a wet cell phone whether it's
Anna rain storm lounging at the pool or
even in the restroom there are times
when your phone is in danger of getting
soaked I'm Sharon Vaknin from cnet com
here with some tips on how to save a
cell phone once you realize your phone
got wet it may be your instinct to hit
the power button do not try to turn it
on yet remember what happens if you drop
a blow dryer in water water and
electricity don't mix your device will
quickly short-circuit and you've earned
yourself a paperweight another thing to
avoid is well blow drying your device so
it's true your device will dry out
you'll likely burn it in the process
instead the first thing you'll want to
do is take out all removable parts like
a battery SIM card or memory card and
Pat everything dry then you want to try
to extract all of the remaining water
extracting the water can be done in
three ways the most common method is the
rice bag method when cooking rice the
water is absorbed into the rice greens
so let's apply that science to water in
your phone simply take your phone
including all the parts you've removed
and put them in a bag of uncooked rice
let it sit for 24 to 72 hours depending
on your anxiety levels a lesser known
way to dry your device is by using
silica packets there are those pouches
of beads that come in most devices
purses and of course man purses or
nurses with
this method just take a ziploc bag fill
it with silica packets and drop in your
gadget like rice silica absorbs moisture
and your device should be liquid free in
one to three days realistically most of
us don't have a stash of silica packets
but have no fear they're readily
available online order them quickly and
keep a supply around for future water
accidents now these methods can work
wonders but if you want a more dedicated
solution try the beastie bag at first we
thought it looked like a gimmick so we
tested it with an mp3 player we dropped
in water lo and behold it works the
airtight pouch is filled with moisture
absorbing beads so it acts a lot like
rice or silica just pop your phone and
its parts into the bag wait 24 to 72
hours and all the water will be
extracted at twenty dollars it's not the
cheapest solution but it definitely
beats buying a replacement phone
regardless of the method you choose once
you've waited the requisite 24 to 72
hours just remove all the parts from the
bag put your gadget back together and
hit the power button with any luck
you'll see the device power on as usual
if so you've successfully rescued your
device and these methods should work for
many of your devices from phones to mp3
players and even digital cameras just
remember if you are forced to try one of
these methods manufacturers still have
sneaky ways of telling if a device has
been drenched chances are you voided
your warranty but at least your phone
works again and just a side note if you
find yourself soaking your phone or mp3
player over and over again you might
consider buying waterproof gadgets for
sina com I'm Sharon Vaknin and I'll see
you on the next how 2
one extra tip for you there don't try
cooking that rice after you're done it's
not safe CBS cares and now it's time for
this week's bottom line for years
Volvo's have been known for their safety
which is probably why you used to see so
many high school kids driving their
parents hand-me-down Volvo wagons these
days volvo continues to be at the
forefront of vehicle safety as Brian
Cooley found out at this recent demo
lots of cars emphasize safety these days
it sells but no one does it like Bobo
they're a little nutty about it let's
check out the latest example of their
obsession a car that keeps an eye on
pedestrians and check the tech
we've shown you bulldoze city safe
before it stops you before you run into
something now they'll keep you from
running into someone with a new tech
called pedestrian detection with full
auto breaking okay the parts are there
but I've encountered plenty of self
parking systems that don't and lane
drift detectors that camp let's see if
Volvo got this fully baked now how is
this different from the object detection
them because I would think if it sees an
object of any kind it's going to stop
that would be City safety right this is
going further the object detection is a
very simple technology we use lasers
it's just looking for something metallic
about the shape and size of a car this
is more complex because it uses a radar
system once it detects that it's closing
in on something a camera takes a picture
processes it again windshield yeah we
see if my kids there so the camera takes
the picture process is it against 10,000
stored images of humans and it tries to
see is this a human it's only if it's
human that it will stop for the
production so how does it tell if it's
human I mean just the shape it's the
signature so head neck shoulders legs
torso even the movement so it's all of
that humans are more than eighty percent
water so it's actually harder for us to
get it to stop for a dummy than it is to
get it to stop for you or I or a real
person because the water and our bodies
are the radar is able to check up on
some of the composition of even being
yes okay so just going on also and we're
still obviously always advancing the
technology for right now because of the
angle of the radar and the camera it can
only detect something down to 32 inches
okay so it's looking specifically again
hopefully someone that small would be
with a parent that it would tell that it
would pick up right okay notice that
pedestrian detection is built on
software using a couple of existing car
tech trends radar and visual cameras in
addition to this car's windshield cams
there's also a walleye cam on the front
for a wide angle creeping one under each
side view mirror looking back for things
in your blind spot and the fairly common
one on the rear that is almost
pedestrian these days but the s60 s
offers a close-up view for real fine
work when backing up we haven't seen
that before alright so I'm supposed to
roll on here and the idea is we're in
city traffic doing a few miles an hour
I'm sitting you're chatting to you i'm
texting god knows i never do that i'm
looking out the window there here's this
guy stepped off the curb and look at
that I never touched the brakes and bob
is still standing I got the brakes I
felt that on really hard the pedal was
really moving hundreds round grinding
zone what happened on here on the dash
yes that is a strip of LED lights and an
audible warning that come on about a
second and a half before it's gonna
break for you so it's giving you again
always a chance to engage wake up wake
up you're driving stop texting I like
how it got really close to him when it
stopped as if I'm not just going to stop
but I'm gonna also teach you good lesson
is this something at the switch on is it
always on pedestrian detection is always
on and if you think that we're saving
human lives and intervening and
preventing fatalities you can see why
you know yeah why don't I return it all
right and what insurance company would
really want you to be able to oh to be
honest do you guys anything about the
insurance discounts that companies
innovations no I haven't heard anything
about that quite yet and I think part of
the reason is because the vehicles
actually land and we'll start being
available to pick up your local
dealership in September so we'll
probably hear more about that then this
works up to what speed 22 miles per hour
right so goes works every time well and
we have found that 75% of accidents
happen at low speeds under 20 miles per
hour so you know we are really looking
to avoid the majority of accidents and
then going forward hopefully prevent all
accidents i'll give it to volvo the
technology does seem to just plain work
over and over and over of the roughly
thirty seven thousand traffic deaths in
the u.s. each year about 12% are 4400
are pedestrians technology like this
could make a big dent in that number but
not until it's available more widely
than on a single forty thousand dollars
semi elite swedish sedam okay this guy
is very happy about pedestrian detection
but will consumers be I mean bulldoze
kind of mixing a funny message here
naughty and super safe those are kind of
odd bedfellows this car has to succeed
is a great road car which they tell us
it is with a pretty hot motor under the
hood and some great suspension tech and
all that we shall see when one comes
into the cnet garage but in the meantime
pricing on this will be around 37,000
base
September 2010 in showrooms but this
pedestrian technology were showing you
is part of a tech package on top of that
but this is a case with Volvo trying to
hang on to their roots they do safety
tech very well but also move into
something a little more salacious the
bottom line this week safety first
everyone the upside of this technology
is that lives will be saved the downside
everyone will have to drive Volvos for
it to make a difference and they are
expensive the s6 you is pretty hot
though all right folks that's our show
join us next week when we'll have our
first look reviews of the new ipod touch
and a whole lot more until then there
are tons of great videos available every
day at cnet TV calm and hey enjoy your
labor day weekend see you next time and
thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
