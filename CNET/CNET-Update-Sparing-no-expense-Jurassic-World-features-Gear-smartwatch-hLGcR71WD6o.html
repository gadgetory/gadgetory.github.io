before hunting dinos I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your cnet update before we
talk about dinosaurs first some Amazon
news if you're in need of a handyman or
computer technician you can now shop for
one on amazon the retail giant launched
a new service to connect you to local
service providers like plumbers
electricians and car mechanics the idea
is that if you shop for something like a
home network router you may also see a
listing to hire someone to hook it up
for you amazon shows a list of
businesses nearby and their estimated
prices you pay when the service is
complete now i'm sure this sort of thing
makes Yelp and Angie's List a bit
nervous but not everything from Amazon
succeeds for example the fire phone
which she flopped but Amazon just
slashed the price by fifty five percent
down to two hundred dollars and it's
unlocked meaning no contract required
the retailer is doing what it can to
clear inventory and that offer ends
after Cyber Monday and speaking of deals
twitter is now testing a new feature
called twitter offers where advertisers
tweet out rebate coupons but it's a bit
tricky first when you see an offer you
need to sign up and hand over your
credit card info then when you use that
credit card to pay for the deal in the
store you get the money back on your
credit card statement brands are
experimenting with new ways to connect
on Twitter and mobile take for example a
promotion that just launched for Game of
Thrones to promote the season 5 HBO
created the site three-eyed Raven calm
which sends teasers to you by text
messages or Twitter direct messages and
finally I like to turn your attention to
the new trailer for Jurassic world the
highly anticipated fourth installment in
the Jurassic Park film series it's
coming out next year and like any geeky
fan I wanted to go frame by frame to
find clues to this movie and there's
actually quite a bit of technology
featured the theme park has opened and
in this universe we've accomplished
great feats in genetics but people still
take photos with their tablets we also
see an advanced control center with some
big screen samsung tvs and giant tablet
tables and then suddenly we see a
SmartWatch and oh my perhaps more
frightening than the dripping blood is
that this person is wearing the original
Samsung Galaxy gear watch with a little
camera on the strap equipping your staff
with these mediocre models is the first
sign you should not be in charge of an
island of dinosaurs Spielberg you could
do a product placement did you ever stop
to think if you should I realize these
films cost a lot to make and you spare
no expense but if you're hunting dinos
your team needs gear with more features
and it must go faster that's your tech
news update from our studios in New York
