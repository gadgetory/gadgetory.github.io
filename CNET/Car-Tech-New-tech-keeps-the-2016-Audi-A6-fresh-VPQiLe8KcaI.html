roller so it's comfortable at 35
miles-per-hour as at 70
howdy has been killing it for years
combining powerful and efficient
performance and handling tech with truly
innovative connected cabin electronics
although this 2016 audi a6 is not a
generational update it does show some
market improvement in fact there's one
minor but key change that makes me a
little bit giddy we'll get to that in a
minute I never get tired of this
navigation system it pulls in Google
Maps satellite imagery of your immediate
surroundings
howdy updated the electronics here
giving the 2016 a 6 a 4G data connection
and a faster and video chip when I pull
up my destination options I not only get
online Google search over that 4G
connection I also have this freeform
search that matches keywords I enter
with the cars own database of locations
and streets it's a fast easy way to find
places and works even outside of data
coverage and now a very special moment
in now D history for years Audi cars
have had this proprietary Audi music
interface requiring all sorts of adapter
cables for different iPhones and other
devices not anymore
the new a6 comes with USB ports 2 of
them I can plug in my phone and select
music for the cars controller sure every
other car in the world has USB ports but
now Audi does too
folks it's a new world order at 8 inches
the main LCD on the dashboard looks
small compared to what some competitor
vehicles that's one way the a6 shows its
age the next generation of this car
should get Audi's virtual cockpit which
eaves is a massive LCD for the
instrument panel showing navigation and
other information overlaid with virtual
gauges you can get an a6 with a 2-liter
turbocharged engine or a 3 liter diesel
both of which get better fuel economy
than this car but I've been very
impressed with the supercharged 3 liter
v6 in this a6 at 333 horsepower and
Freedom 225 pound feet of torque
outtie says the a6 gets to 60 miles per
hour in 5.1 seconds that's quick but you
don't necessarily feel it from the
driver's seat this car is so
well-mannered and it's 8-speed automatic
transmission so smooth it gets up to
speed with no drama and the a6 is pretty
remarkable in the turns that's probably
because it has outies Quattro all-wheel
drive system but also due to some very
good suspension tuning Howdy doesn't
offer an adaptive suspension for the
2016 a 6 but this fixed suspension
strikes a very good balance between
handling and comfort to be honest this
isn't the most comfortable car I've
driven but it's very competent when
faced with rough roads for the long
freeway bits I missed having adaptive
cruise control which automatically slows
down for slower traffic ahead that
feature and a few other goodies come in
the driver assistance package for $2,550
but I don't have it here for driver
assists I have a blind spot monitor
head-up display and a backup camera the
base 2016 a6 model with a 2-liter
turbocharged engine goes for 47,000 $125
we get Quattro all-wheel drive and the 3
litre supercharged v6 we bump the price
to 58,000 $325.00 prestige trim adds
$4,200 and that gets us LED headlights a
head-up display and some other features
and it really goes CNET style I would
add that driver assistance package for
$2,550 getting this up to 65,000 75
delivered to be honest the 2016 audi a6
has the boring conservative looks of a
traditional sedan the ADI a 7
looks better and comes with the same
equipment so I went up for that model
but the a6 blew me away with its power
handling and cabin tech and oh yes those
USB ports finally
