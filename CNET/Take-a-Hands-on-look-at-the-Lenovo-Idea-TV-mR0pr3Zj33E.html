we're here at the digital experience
showcase and this is really one of the
most innovative TVs we've seen here at
CS TVs are big push but this is the
Lenovo idea TV now we talked about some
of the specs of this television set this
is running Android Ice Cream Sandwich
now their interfaces what they like to
call the sandwich interface and what
makes it unique is its three different
panels you'll have your remote where you
can actually slide your thumb from side
to side to navigate through the panels
which includes obviously your TV viewing
then you have access to the Lenovo up
store and then any of your on demand
media content that you'd like to view
now some of the specs of the television
set this is an IPS display it'll come in
42 inches or 55 inches so you'll have
really a great viewing angle to watch
all the content now this is going to be
a passive 3d display we've seen a lot of
push to get rid of those expensive
glasses this is one of them another
really unique feature this has is
there's a little video camera right here
down on the base now what that does sure
you can do video conferencing but it
also has a child lock feature so what
that means is if you are an adult and
you don't want your kids to get access
to Lenovo's app store it only will
unlock with your face so that's another
really unique feature that this TV has
now if we talk about apps this
television set also supports gaming
it'll come with its own game controller
so you'll have things like asphalt 6 to
play with it also allows you to convert
your 2d content to 3d content so there's
just a wide variety of games will be
available for this television set now
the idea TV there's no estimated date
for it to arrive in the US yet it will
be available in China sometime around
april 20012 but this is really one of
the most innovative tvs we've seen here
at CES so there's your first look at the
Lenovo idea TV</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
