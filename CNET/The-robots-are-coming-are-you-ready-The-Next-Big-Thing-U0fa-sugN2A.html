my mind
I'm Brian Cooley from seeing that in
search of the next big thing humanoid
style robots have been on the scene for
quite a while at least a decade now give
or take and so far they've had a market
share and an importance that it's kind
of down there with the Segway in the
home 3d printer appealing mostly to
geeks who are fascinated by the possible
and not so concerned about the practical
as a result we ended up with these
things that are extremely humanoid
trying almost too hard to be like
mechanical people Honda's ASIMO dancing
like your father or Toyotas robot
playing a violin both amazed us but
maybe didn't speak to a role in your
home but now something's changing as
we're seeing robot developers get more
focused on relatability and usability
not just technical ability LG just
introduced a full line of robots that
kind of have a face and an ability to
communicate but notice no arms or
excessively humanoid features and their
smarts are powered by Amazon Alexa on
the backend a bigger model is meant to
be an airport employee who not only
listens to you and helps you but also
guides you where you may need to go it's
also got a partner that is a janitor
model the impact of that trend on
employment is fascinating but beyond the
scope of our show startup smart beings
is developing a robot they have
unfortunately named woohoo that you
might think is just an Amazon echo with
a screen but it has a rotating head so
it's camera can look where its ears and
microphones tell it the action is to
better understand the scene and again be
somewhat relatable it's envisioned as
handling information communication to
you updates whether things like that as
well as integrating with your smart home
for example as part of its function and
note that it has facial and voice
recognition plan an important part of
allowing it to identify you as a
individual not just as a human and may
feel robotics sort of stole the show at
CES with a robot called Curie that
doesn't do much but be very relatable
without arms legs a screen or even a
voice it communicates with head and eye
gestures as well as a series of blips
and beeps
sounds crazy I know but a lot of
skeptics including me were kind of
impressed by how much they've done to
make those simple cues and gestures very
understandable it too promises advanced
facial recognition so it can better
anticipate the needs of who it's looking
at by knowing who it's looking at I
think you can see now that the future of
robots is shaping up to not necessarily
be about their abilities that is likely
going to be commodity but instead about
their nuance and relatability as
something that you have in your life but
don't necessarily have to cater your
life to and this will be based on three
particular attributes that I'm seeing
one of course is integration robots that
are fully engaged in my preferences
history calendar contacts all of the
things that make everything smart in my
life another is recognition as we've
talked about the ability for a robot to
understand Who I am based on my face and
my voice it allows it to really dial in
and serve me which leads to the big one
anticipation we already have a lot of
the functions that we're seeing in these
robots in our phones and tablets but
those are more tools than assistants
because they have not taken the bar of
anticipation and raised it that is the
sweet spot for the coming robot know
