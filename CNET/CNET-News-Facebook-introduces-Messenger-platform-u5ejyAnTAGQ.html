platform it's a new platform that
developers it's a messenger platform is
a new platform that developers can use
to build apps that help people connect
with the more than 600 million people
who are using messenger as the
communicate every day so we're going to
talk about two things and the first is
giving people more tools for expression
i'm going to show you quickly how this
works so we're extending the composer
and messenger so now you're going to be
able to easily in line find different
services that help you say anything you
want better and you're gonna be able to
discover these services right in line
and they're going to deep link right to
the app store so you can download them
very easily and you can create content
you can share directly into messenger
and what you're going to see is that
your friends are going to be easily able
to reply and install the apps that
you're sharing with them all right now
the second thing that we want to talk
about is making messenger a place where
you can easily communicate with the
businesses you care about in addition to
the people you care about so currently
if you want to get in touch with a
business you know most of us probably
still call them but you know I don't
have to know anyone who likes calling
businesses right I mean it's just not
fast or convenient and it definitely
doesn't feel like the future so you know
think about how useful it would be if
you could just message a business and
instantly get information about whatever
you need make a reservation by something
in line change chip shipping information
in times so today we're introducing a
way for you to communicate with
businesses right through messages</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
