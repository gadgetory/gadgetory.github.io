and will.i.am teaches us new techno cab
you Larry I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your CNET update when Apple showed off
new iPads on Thursday we heard about the
performance upgrades but there's one
interesting feature that Apple didn't
say much about you see these new tablets
have new happy SIM cards that let you
bounce easily between carriers normally
if you want to switch mobile carriers
such as going from AT&amp;amp;T to sprint you
would need to get a new SIM card that's
compatible with that new carrier but
with Apple SIM you just go into settings
and pick a short-term plan from the
carriers in the US or the UK now this
could be a feature we may see in future
iPhones making it less of a hassle to
switch but before Apple's new products
were announced another gadget made its
debut the frontman to the music group
Black Eyed Peas
will.i.am showed off the SmartWatch
fashion cuff that he's been working on
but he doesn't want you to call it a
SmartWatch he wants you to call it the
pulse now don't be fooled by the
spelling it's not polls but its pulse as
in your heartbeat and he just dropped
the heat because he's an artist
will.i.am has a few other new terms to
teach us the voice control system sort
of like Siri is called Anita say it with
me I'm Neda as in I needed directions to
the club and if you tweet you use the
app twit wrist twist
he has no words for how much of a cost
or when you can buy it or how long the
battery lasts it makes phone calls and
requires its own data plan and has a GPS
tracks movement and has speakers so you
can share the boom boom pow when you're
rocking every beats if you're a fan of
pulse you may also be interested in
Williams power wear jacket that can
charge it through the sleeve and
will.i.am shoes that tell you how much
you weigh I got a feeling that the shoes
may be a tough sell in other news the
world of cable is going through a change
where we may soon be able to buy all our
favorite channels ala carte just after
HBO announced that it would offer a web
only subscription service
cBS the parent company of CNET announced
that it's doing the same thing
CBS launched a subscription service
called all-access for $6 a month you can
stream a live feed of some local CBS
stations and have access to a library of
older CBS shows this is for people who
don't want to pay for TV through a cable
or satellite provider the downside is
that you can't watch a live feed of
football games CBS doesn't have the
streaming rights to all sports CBS chief
executive Leslie Moonves has said the
company is also looking into offering
something similar for Showtime that your
tech news update and you can get more
