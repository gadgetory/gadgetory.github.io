design for the iPhone well expect to be
disappointed a new report from Japanese
newspaper Nikkei says Apple will likely
make big changes to the iphone design
every three years that's instead of
every other year which we're currently
used to that means the upcoming iPhone 7
will likely look just like the iphone 6
and 6s the report puts the blame on a
slowing market and the notion that
there's just not enough to enhance upon
these days there will likely be small
changes like a better camera and perhaps
the removal of a headphone jack so you
have to connect your headphones with the
Lightning port or wirelessly I don't
want to do that if the next big change
comes in 2017 that would actually be a
good time for Apple to make big fuss
because after all 2017 marks the 10th
anniversary of the iphone we're all very
old even if the dimensions don't change
much there could be one upgrade that
might get buyers excited one analytics
research group is reporting that the
iphone 7 will come with 32 gigs of
storage at the entry model that's
instead of 16 gigs which it absolutely
already should do Apple has long been
criticized for offering iphones with a
measly 16 gigs when all of these better
photos and videos and apps are eating up
the storage way too quickly most top
smartphones don't even bother to ship
with 16 gigs anymore so why is the
iphone even have that as an option the
voice assistant Siri may also be getting
a huge boost soon last year Apple
purchased a company called vocal IQ and
tech Insider reports that the technology
has more potential to answer questions
with normal language compared to what
exists with Google now Microsoft's
Cortana and Amazon's Alexa but speaking
of voice assistance if you ever wanted
to know what it was like to talk to
Amazon's Alexa now you can through a web
browser amazon released the echo
simulator at the website echo ism do but
it doesn't work yet with Safari so I'm
going to try this out right here hey
Alexa who is Jeff Bakalar
I wasn't able to understand the question
I heard neither am i that's it for this
tech news update I'm Jeff Bakalar and
you can stay on top of the biggest
