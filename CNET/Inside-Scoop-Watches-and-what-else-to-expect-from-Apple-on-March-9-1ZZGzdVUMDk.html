I'm cnet's car s toboi joined by senior
rider Shara Tipton and here we are in
San Francisco outside of the yerba buena
center for the arts this is where the
big apple event will be held monday
March ninth what do we know about this
event yeah the invite said spring
forward which indicates we're going to
hear about to watch yes yeah and what
about the wash specifically pricing
hopefully yeah pricing so in September
they showed it off we got to see what it
looks like they talked a little bit
about one of some of the things that
we'll be able to do but we still need a
lot more details so we know it starts at
349 but it could go up a lot from there
into five digits I mean ten thousand oh
yeah yeah yeah some people are talking
about that you know the gold version is
going to be expensive we just don't know
quite how expensive and what about some
of the functionality and apps yeah so we
learned a little bit about some of the
things that can do like you can use
Apple pay you can do health and fitness
tracking get unlock your hotel room door
with the watch we're gonna learn a lot
more about some of the other
functionalities we're hoping to see a
lot more third-party apps as well so
some of these other companies making
making apps for the watch now besides
the watch are we expecting Apple to
release any other product information on
news Apple tents uses events to talk
about at least a couple products so
along with the watch we're probably
going to see Mac news last of all we had
updates to the mac mini and the imac but
the macbook air and the macbook pro are
probably going to see an update what
kind of updates are you tonight
the new Intel processors just came out
so we're going to see at least bad
update we also could see things like
touch ID being integrated in the tunnel
laptops we're also really hoping for a
retina display on the macbook air we
also could see new Apple TVs the
hardware on the current one is three
years old since that came out we've had
the chromecast at amazon fire TV we've
seen new roku sticks so we really need
an update from Apple on that but from a
product standpoint it's all about this
watch yeah and where do you think this
watch will stand as far as the
competition goes as far as attracting
means from appeal I mean a little early
to tell but yeah it's a little early to
tell but Apple has such a strong brand
and you know they're gonna be marketing
this people are not going to be able to
get away from knowing that they exist so
people really think that Apple is going
to have a better chance than the smart
watches we've already seen there was a
report that came out that they'll be the
number one smart watch maker this year
and thumping Samsung to number two and
the release date for this watch is still
a little unknown but thinking April yeah
they said it's gonna start shipping in
April we could get a surprise and they
could say oh it's actually gonna come in
late March you know that's something
we're just gonna have to wait and see
wait and see all right thank you so much
char be sure to stay tuned to cnet com
for live blogs and all sorts of related
news that comes out of apple's event on
monday you've been watching the inside
