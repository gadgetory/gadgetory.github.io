streaming box the Roku three is getting
an update but don't worry because Roku
didn't ruin a great thing still offers
more apps than anyone the same fully
customizable interface that doesn't
prioritize one service over another and
the same speedy response times the new
2015 Roku three still cost the same 99
bucks as the old 2013 Roku 3 and it adds
just one major new feature voice search
from the remote much like on the Amazon
fire TV when you touch this button and
speak into the Roku threes clicker you
get search results it's not that much
easier than typing into the traditional
search window but it does work well and
like Amazon recognized most of my test
searches with no problems
Roku's big advantages that its search
comes through 17 different services
including Netflix HBO GO FX now and Vudu
Amazon search and that of Google's
Android TV doesn't hit any of those
services Roku search results also
clearly reveal what services cost money
and which ones you can get for free is
party a subscription for example when I
looked for the lego movie only Roku told
me it was available on HBO go for free
while the other services charged me to
watch it the fire TV has HBO GO but its
search results only showed me the pay
version on Amazon that's a big advantage
only Roku offers and it's available on
every Roku device another new feature
coming to all Roku devices is called my
feeds it allows you to follow upcoming
movies that be notified when they're
going to appear on roku for streaming
the Roku 3 also has a jack on the remote
control so you can attach a pair of
headphones such as the purple ones
included in its box for private
listening the on voice search on the
remote and private listening Roku 3 is
basically the same as the new Roku 2
which cost $30 less both were equally
speedy and every bit as responsive as
other streaming devices and much faster
than older Roku's so as good as the new
Roku 3 is I now consider the new Roku 2
a better deal than the new Roku 3 I'm
