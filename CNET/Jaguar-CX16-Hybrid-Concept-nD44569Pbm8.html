goes much more to the attainable Jaguar
than some recent concepts they've done
what we have here is a hybrid it's a
supercharged v6 that's going to give you
a 380 horsepower 332 foot-pounds of
torque and then on top of that comes the
electric motor but it's not always in
there you call it up on demand there's a
push to pass button see that red button
there on the steering wheel on the
right-hand side that's the one you hit
to tap into the electric boost when you
want it you've got about 10 seconds
worth out of that guy which is powered
by a lithium battery back here behind
the seats and that'll give you about
another 94 horsepower another 173
foot-pounds of torque so whoosh this guy
goes zero to sixty and a little over
four seconds like for two for three
while delivering 41 mpg on a British
gallon but still very efficient for an
extremely fast car now in terms of cabin
tech there's apparently a whole new
interface on this guy on there central
head unit which is good news because
we've not been big fans of Jaguars
actual interface the way that they've
done the buttons on-screen it's been
kind of a hodgepodge so I look forward
to any concept that can clean that up
and they also have what they call
connect and view technology in here
that'll let you hook up they say a
variety of smartphones it will then echo
their display onto the central screen
although they say they develop that in
partnership with RIM so I don't know if
it works better with a blackberry or not
that of course means blackberry is still
in business and win and if this car
comes to market anyway this is a strict
concept but it does give you some idea
where they want to go with what would
basically be in the XK category right
now the CX 16</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
