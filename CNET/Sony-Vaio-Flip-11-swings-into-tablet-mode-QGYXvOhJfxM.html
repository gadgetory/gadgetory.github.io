slip hybrid series this is the flip 11
let's take a look so the flip 11 as you
might guess has an 11 inch screen it has
a 1080p resolution and it looks pretty
good to me although there are a lot of
reflections so I'd worry about how easy
it is to use in bright sunlight this
device is main feature though is that it
has this flipping hinge on the back so
you pull the screen up like this and it
locks into place with a few magnets and
just like that you can transform it into
tablet mode if you're the kind of person
who likes taking photos using a tablet
there is an 8 megapixel camera on the
underside which is quite a nice addition
sony says there are three modes for this
thing normal laptop mode tablet mode and
what it calls display mode which is when
you fold the hinge backwards like this
that's supposedly good if you're maybe
on an airplane and you want to watch
some movies you get a quad core pentium
chip it has windows 8.1 and there's a
backlit keyboard as well there are a
couple of other treats in store too it
comes with a stylus and the full edition
of photoshop elements which is good if
you're the doodling type it's coming out
in the spring and it's going to cost
eight hundred dollars let me know what
you think and check out Cesc netcom for
