technology with your parenting then you
might be interested in this it's the 361
smart shoe it's a smart shoe that tracks
kids location let's take a look so these
things look just like ordinary
children's shoes however inside the hill
there's a mediatek processor in there
and what that means is that you're going
to be able to track your child's
location you're going to be able to see
their position on a map another feature
you can get is geofencing so you'll get
a notification if the child leaves a
certain zone so it might seem weird to
put a tracking device in a kid's shoe
but we are seeing more and more of these
gadgets they do seem to becoming more
and more popular and maybe it actually
makes sense to put that kind of
technology in a shoe because I imagine
it might be a little bit harder for a
child to lose while they're out and
about then for example a bracelet or a
watch something that's quite cool is
that you don't have to plug these things
in they come with a wireless charging
pad there's a battery that lasts roughly
two days so at the end of that you just
pop them on the charging plate so these
things are launching next month in China
but who knows if they prove really
popular maybe we'll see them come to
other parts of the world as well let me
know what you think I'm the Westway and
check out see Netcom /mw see for much
