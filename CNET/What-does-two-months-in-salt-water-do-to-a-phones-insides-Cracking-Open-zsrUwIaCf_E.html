cracking open where we take apart the
latest tech show you what's inside I'm
Bill Detweiler and today I'm joined by
CNET's very own Aaron Carson here and
Aaron has something special for us
what do you have Aaron I do so I have a
samsung galaxy s6 but it's not just a
regular one okay this guy has spent two
months waterlogged
in the mud and water in the bay off
Sausalito California Wow okay well this
is actually a co-worker's phone right
and so area is gonna tell us the whole
story while I'm taking it apart but we
thought this would be a really cool
opportunity to show everybody what
actually happens to one of these devices
when they sit underwater and this one
sat under saltwater right for two months
and it was just by chance that we found
the thing or our co-worker found the
thing afterwards so show everybody on
the outside maybe what it kind of looks
like here can we see yes so it's it's
looking pretty grody it looks like we
have some corrosion around the sides
here at the bottom kind of at the top
top and on the on the side it really
starts to look like something you might
say from a ship let's go ahead and get
started let's see what we can do with
this thing so we have to go in through
the back of this phone we'll remove the
plate off of the back there's some
adhesive that holds it on you can use a
lot of different methods to heat this up
to heat the adhesive and loosen it up
we're gonna use our handy dandy heat gun
turned on low so while I'm doing this
Aaron once you tell us so what happened
with this phone whose was it and how did
they lose it and how do they get it back
so this phone used to belong to FINA
senior producer Andy Altman and like any
good house story it starts with the
house though he has a friend who has a
houseboat in Sausalito and a bunch of
them we're gonna go ride their bikes and
so this one day he had the phone in the
pocket of his riding jersey and it just
bounced out of his pocket while he was
walking at the dock and as you might
imagine he
just sort of looked at the water and it
was like well I I guess I'm not gonna
see that again but about two months
later during low tide at his friend
actually texted him and was like I found
your phone
Wow so they they fished it out and here
we are and he tried to turn it back on
obviously it didn't work right we're not
really concerned about breaking his
phone we're not gonna try to repair this
phone this phone is toast having spent
two months in salt water here in the bay
so we're gonna he's not counting on
getting this back right so we don't have
to be as gentle with this device as we
normally would so I'm gonna kick the
heat up a little bit here on our he's
gone you can use a hairdryer to do this
when you're working with adhesive if you
have a heat gun with an adjustable heat
setting you can use that we just want to
try and take the back off without
breaking it most people you know lose
these in the bathroom or Lucy's in the
washer or especially with newer phones
you know you there's a chance that those
are actually more for water you know
resistant than perhaps they used to be
in years past right yeah another really
common theme and you you sort of alluded
to this is bathroom horror stories
people have their phone in there and it
does not meet a good end I mean
everybody takes their phone to the
restroom these days right it's just like
the newspaper of old or a book or old or
magazine everybody takes their phones
but you know you definitely have to be
careful all right so we managed to get
the back off of this fairly easily use a
little bit of heat from our heat gun and
we'll pull the back off and now we can
kind of see what's inside it ooh that's
pretty
a lot of corrosion there you can see a
lot of the damage here that we have to
the phone a lot of the corrosion you see
it looks like even maybe some of the
screws here have a little bit of rust on
them let's see if we can't get these out
and see what we can find inside luckily
inside these Samsung phones there's all
Phillips screws right so it makes it a
little easier to take them apart that if
it's a you know they have special
special tamper resistant screws that's
one of my favorite things about Samsung
phones is that they do use stay
in screws once you get inside okay so
we've got to back off we have got the I
think all the screws off that I can see
and what we're gonna do is I'm gonna try
to there's a cover on the back that
covers the batteries it covers the
circuit boards and so we're gonna try
and remove that here as best we can and
then get to some of the circuits
underneath it definitely looks like and
I probably should be let's try this one
so there's some corrosion and crud we'll
call that's our official term crud
inside I mean it looks like the I don't
know the battery doesn't look puncture
but it looks like we definitely have
some corrosion in there so if you're
going to do this yourself I mean I don't
recommend doing this at this point it
probably just needs to be recycled get
what data you can off of it sit if it's
got pictures or anything you really need
on it you really want send it away to a
data recovery company you know see what
they can do make sure I have all the the
screws undone I think we do here so
let's see if I can't pry the body off
the body comes off like this this is
gonna stick together a little bit here
even after being in saltwater for months
there's still plenty of adhesive on this
and this is the all right you see the
battery there if I can't we can hear
some crunchiness this is really unusual
here no sea life so far inside this you
never couldn't tell I guess I guess
there we go
kind of popped it loose so we can see as
we separate the body from the assembly
here there are some wires in here that
are connecting the back panel to the
assembly here I'm going to try and pop
those loose be real gentle here
that hold the camera there we go
now here there we go so we can kind of
see inside the phone now oh that was
that's an issue what was holding the
case on I don't know if we can see this
here this is the SIM card and the door
had kind of stuck shut and so it's metal
that holds the the SIM card in place and
so that was holding the case in I should
have removed there we go
I should have removed that first but we
did now
all right so SIM cards out now we can
see all of our dust and debris here we
see all the corrosion we can see what's
sitting in salt water for two months
actually does to the phone that
definitely looks worse than any be
inside of any phone I've seen it's
pretty bad we're gonna go ahead and I'm
gonna try and disconnect the battery
here just connect everything that's
underneath the battery he would get the
battery we'll go ahead and pop the
battery out the battery it's not oh yeah
there's more more dust more grit more
debris in there and I'm not sure what in
here is actually corrosion because it
was in salt water some of that might be
you know sea salt from the from the west
coast of the u.s. here miscellaneous
dirt dust you never know I don't see any
small sea creatures but you know it
would be pretty hard for that that is
for the best so we're gonna pop off the
outside camera here oh there goes so
there's the there's the front-facing
camera let's see if we can't pop loose
this is the speaker here the front
facing speaker wow this is all dusty man
it's crunchy it's it's it's just there's
dust and debris all over the place oh so
there's our yeah this is everywhere you
can see the corrosion on the contacts
here you can see let's see if we can't I
wanna see the chips that's what we
really want to get to if I can get them
underneath the underneath the metal
shields here ooh yeah more wipes
more white crusty stuff we can see
this stuff I mean let's let's let's pull
this off last connector oh there we go
alright so this would would be the
display assembly here and we can still
see how one of the circuit boards
connected to the bottom of that I'm
gonna leave that there this has the
ports on it the headphone jack and then
the USB port there on the bottom you
have the vibration we can see our little
vibration motor there so and in the
display let's see what seawater has done
for two months - well the camera nothing
nothing yeah that's right nothing good
alright so there's a camera yeah I'm
surprised look at the camera there you
know it actually you know you would
think that the sea water would get
inside these little crevices and the
camera and stop but it actually the
camera seemed to be fairly well
protected inside you know inside its
little housing here on part of the case
so I don't see a ton of you know I don't
know if this camera would actually work
again if you plugged it if you could
connect it up to something but it might
I don't know let's see if we can't get
the I want to take off the EMI EMF
shields here these are these
electromagnetic interference shields
that are put on top of the the main
chips
oh yeah there's water inside there and
there's a couple of them here we can see
one of the things that meat is easier is
the tape the adhesive the salt water and
exposure to moisture has definitely made
that a little bit easier to pop through
you know so here we have the circuit
board the main circuit board inside are
damaged galaxy s6 you can see the
processor here you can see our our RAM
chip our storage chips here and they're
just they're toast now you know could a
data recovery company take this phone D
saw to the chip a storage chip from the
motherboard and possibly get material
off of it that off of it the answer is
yes maybe if there's not too much
physical degradation to the chip they
can disorder these from the board and
pull the data off and then maybe recover
it I think it would
long shot in this case it also be pretty
expensive to do that but not impossible
so there you have it you have a teardown
of a water log phone that has been in
salt water for two months lots of lots
and lots of dust lots of salt lots of
corrosion you know I'll probably have
some disease on my hands from all this
or chemical burns and we'll be okay all
right well that does it for this edition
