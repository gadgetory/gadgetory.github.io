the 2012 Acura RDX super handling
all-wheel drive with the tech package
and check the temp now you'd be forgiven
for thinking that this RDX is just a
dressed-up Honda CRV it's actually not
one of the key reasons is it has a turbo
2.3 liter 4 it also offers Acura super
handling all-wheel drive you won't find
that on a Honda either the differences
continue inside ok now we have the fully
optioned RDX got the tech package that
means we get the navigation head unit
otherwise you'd have a very basic screen
for audio and climate but this color LCD
is not touch you can drive it with the
Acura control knob or you can use the
voice command over here not the
Bluetooth voice button the other one
that hides behind it it's a perfectly
good system it's got traffic weathers
that got restaurant ratings the problem
is it looks like hell this is a crunchy
old interface they've had since the dawn
of time and I'm dying for them to
overhaul it which apparently is due soon
now the navigation as I mentioned is
optional as part of what they call the
tech package well not really it's
actually a technology trim level package
and this is going to also bring you the
ELS sound system that bumps up the
speakers from seven to ten the wattage
from 360 to 410 I think it adds Dolby
pl2 which will turn any digital stereo
source into synthetic surround it works
pretty well and you've got a subwoofer
and lots of additional sound settings
that's $3,100 package also brings your
rear view camera out of the mirror and
brings it to the screen oh one other
thing we have in the tech package you
have a 10-second clipping ability of any
song on XM satellite radio stores a
little music note to remind you you want
to go by that song it's kind of like a
really crunchy version of iTunes tagging
we also have bluetooth streaming USB for
iPod or thumb drive bluetooth also
standard for hands-free calls and also
that Acura hands-free lengthing the
setup service appointments are talk to
an advisor
one choice on the gearbox five-speed
Automatic back and forth no slap gate
you can go to drive or you can go to
sport and when you want to pick gears
you do that on the paddles which are
standard on all RDX
it's a 2.3 liter inline 4 sitting
sidesaddle here normally driving the
front wheels but it's also available
with Acura is very impressive super
handling all-wheel drive 240 horsepower
260 foot-pounds of torque gets this
roughly thirty eight hundred pound via
cup 216 a pound six and a half seconds
delivering 1924 mpg but slap the super
handling all-wheel drive on here and you
drop down to 17 22 now you're starting
to get into guilt territory but turbo on
here as you can see is intercooled it's
also a variable flow unit which means it
can kind of optimize its own dynamics
for low and high rpm to get rid of turbo
lag we'll see about that now the first
thing I notice on this RDX is through my
ears not through my but the noise this
cars got kind of a grindy sounding motor
when it's under load I'm not really a
big fan of that in an Acura I don't
expect that from these guys you don't
forget it's a turbo either you've got a
really kind of a Sergi pulse EP key
power band on this thing no matter what
they do with their dual mode turbo flow
technology you got to get on it and then
it suddenly rushes power to you plenty
of power just not as much responsiveness
as I would like with that power
the real winner here is super handling
all-wheel drive which works as well here
as it does any of the pricier Acuras you
can really feel it grabbing and clawing
in corners and it has the ability to
over rotate the outside right wheel by I
think it's almost 2 percent so in other
words that guy can really push the rump
around on the outside when you need to
vector into a turn nice driver good
compliance on the road and good build
quality but
I'm not totally impressed by the power
train okay 2012 RDX starts at 34 grand
then you're going to add $2,000 for
super handling all-wheel drive that's
your call
thirty-one hundred to go to the tech
package trim level you're going to want
the tech but you're going to hate
yourself for getting this tech in some
ways so I'm kind of in on that what I
would do is make sure you check out a
Kia Sorento with a v6 or maybe wait up a
little bit till that 2013 Ford Escape
comes out with the new line of EcoBoost
engines then decide if you want to pull
the trigger on this guy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
