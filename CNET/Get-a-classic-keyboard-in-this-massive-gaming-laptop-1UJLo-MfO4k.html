crazy experimental gaming Beast you can
buy right now it's the msi gt80 3 VR now
this is a desktop replacement in the
truest sense of the word the massive
body is thick and it angles upward
towards the 18 inch display that extra
space is to accommodate the high-end
parts and cooling needs
that's because does not one but two
NVIDIA GeForce 1080 graphics cards
inside but even the double video card
setup is not the most unusual thing
about this laptop that would be the deep
sense full mechanical keyboard it's the
kind of thing you usually only see in
dedicated standalone gaming keyboards
and if that wasn't enough the touchpad
gets moved from the traditional below
the keyboard spot over to the right side
it also doubles as a number pen with a
tap on the corner it's a cool visual
trick but the whole thing is not very
practical because when you move a
touchpad from where your fingers expect
it to be you just confuse years of
muscle memory there are a few other
quirks the GT 83 VR requires 2 huge
power bricks which sent around into a Y
connector and that's a lot of extra
cables even before you hook up a VR
headset but if there was ever a laptop
that seemed made for virtual reality
gaming well this is it there's more
performance overhead here than in most
gaming desktops
even though it's huge and kind of ugly I
still like the thick binder like body in
the chunky mechanical keyboard gives the
whole thing kind of a retro feel less
like a sleek modern laptop and more like
a nuclear football being hustled to
NORAD corridors in a 1960s Cold War
thriller</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
