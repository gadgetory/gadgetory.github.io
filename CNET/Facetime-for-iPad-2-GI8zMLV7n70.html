videoconference we supported on the
iPhone and we supported on the iPod
Touch and now we're bringing it to the
iPad you can FaceTime between two iPads
between an iPad and an iPhone or an iPod
Touch and between an iPad and a Mac let
me go ahead and just give you a demo so
it's calling him in a second he'll
answer how you doing doing great Scott
how's it going oh it's going great I was
just giving everyone here a demo of
FaceTime you can see already that the
size of the iPad is just ideal for video
conference and the person's face is a
great size you can see all their
expressions it feels very personal you
can also use both the front camera and
the rear camera so Michael why don't you
flip to the rear camera and show us what
you're looking at sure things got
okay Michael's been locked in a really
very sad cafe I'm so sorry
now you could imagine you know if
Michael had children or something just
be fun to look at thank God I told her I
told them to bring a box of puppies but
I guess he didn't anyway you can also
move the the pip around to get it out of
the way so it's sort of pong you can
move it wherever you want but face time
on this really is a great experience and
we can't wait for people to get their
hands on it and of course from day one
you can FaceTime from your iPad too with
all the iPhone 4 customers out there
thanks a lot Michael</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
