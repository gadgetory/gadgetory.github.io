sound but believe it or not you may be
hearing it a lot less these days
that's because auto theft has been on a
20-year rundown and it's been way down
in the US the auto theft rate per
100,000 persons has been coming down
since 1993 there was a plateau in the
mid 2000s then we kept our erosion going
and the total number of fests has
roughly half since 20 years ago in the
UK vehicle theft is down from 600,000 a
year in 91 to just over a hundred
thousand cars stolen in 2011 a dramatic
drop and overall across the g7 countries
auto theft way off so what's going on
here well first and foremost technology
crooks aren't getting any nicer and
times aren't getting any easier but it's
a lot harder to get in a car and drive
it off where you can dismantle it than
it used to be technology makes that
rather challenging now the top cars that
do get stolen tend to have two things in
common one they're popular models now
and they've been popular models for a
while cars that are out there that
represent lots of existing cars on the
road that need repair parts are what
feeds so much theft according to the
National Insurance Crime Bureau of the
top five stolen cars in 2012 where the
Honda Accord the Honda Civic the Ford
pickups the Chevy pickups and the Toyota
Camry combined with that the fact that
we are driving the oldest fleet ever in
the US we're in about eleven point four
years right now is the average age of a
private vehicle on the US roads RL pulk
I don't think has ever seen it that hot
partly because of the recession
that creates a huge base of used cars
out there for which either unscrupulous
repair shops or unknowing parties are
buying up stolen parts
the other thing that stolen cars tend to
have in common is being unlocked with
the keys left in them
yep believe it or not that's about forty
to fifty percent of all stolen car
reports out there so it pays to double
check that you at least have your keys
with you if not your car locked and the
windows up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
