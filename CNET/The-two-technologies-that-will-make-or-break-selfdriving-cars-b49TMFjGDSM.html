Delphi modified out II drove itself
across the country opening minds and
raising eyebrows now here we are about
two years later and I'm in a Delphi Audi
but this isn't a freeway this is pretty
busy congested intersection late in
Silicon Valley where right here in the
heart of the valley and the cars
handling itself as well as it did on the
big roads two years ago a big reason why
is what automakers call sensor fusion
the car has three different ways to see
touch behind its bodywork
there's radar high-definition cameras
and most importantly lidar laser
scanning the environment and then
looking at the the basically the
reflection of that laser beam back to a
receiver to determine the distance and
as you scan the actual you know features
that are out there around the vehicle it
gives the car a contoured view of the
world around it combine that with the
different view that comes from radar and
from a camera and the vehicle has more
confidence that what it thinks it sees
it sees it all adds up to 40 terabytes
an hour of data that the car is
harvesting and a lot of that has to go
to the cloud have decisions made on it
and sent back to the car and like that
which is why car makers are rushing to
adopt the next wireless technology
called 5g the first time that have
adopted a wireless technology for a
mission critical application it brings
almost 10x the level of bandwidth
compared to current technologies lates
and sees in the small number of
milliseconds latency would be how much
time it takes for something to go from
the car to the cloud and then back again
so it's really a game-changer in terms
of what it brings to autonomous driving
because all the wisdom to drive itself
may not have to be installed on the car
itself Ford
outtie Volvo General Motors and more
have all promised self-driving no later
than 2021 they can write all the clever
software they want but they know without
the fusion of these new kinds of sensors
and successfully helping 5g come to
reality we'll all still be driving
ourselves
