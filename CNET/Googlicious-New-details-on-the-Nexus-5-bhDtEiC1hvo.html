google issues for everything google that
we can pack inside of a show each week
let's get to the show and this week
there's going to be a whole lot of actin
in the tech space we know about apple's
event but google is also sending out
invites for an october twenty fourth
event in new york called a night out
with google play alright so that doesn't
sound like the hottest date but
according to android and me sources
there will be no hardware at the event
even if the timing is perfect for some
Nexus 5 or tit cat action and speaking
of that Nexus 5 it's probably the worst
kept secret right now after full
high-res images and a 349 dollar price
point appeared on the google play store
for the 16 gig version of the phone it
came with a caption capture every day
and the epic in fresh new ways
suggesting the camera feature
improvements that we've talked about in
KitKat and the Nexus 5 may not be coming
in just black after images that first
appeared at under kg com leaked online
showing packaging of a possible white
Nexus 5 as well and really this could be
a total fake but the idea of a white
Nexus 5 would be pretty slick and a new
report from tutto Android claims that
the nexus 5 will only sport a 2300
milliamp hour battery opposed to the
rumored 3000 milliamp hour battery based
on the amount of internal storage
available for the battery but there's
still nothing official on that front
alright guys the new android tablet is
shipping now and it's the latest from
amazon with our kindle fire HDX 7 inch
that starts at 229 so let's check it out
with our hands on with what it has to
offer the HDX is smaller thinner and
lighter than the company's previous
seven incher and has a 1920 x 1200
resolution screen both the power button
and volume rocker have been moved to the
back and while the buttons are easier to
find and press compared to the previous
fire having them on the back takes a
little getting used to i do think it's
really comfortable to hold one hand
though it's well-balanced light without
feeling too Airy the new version of the
fire OS is more a refinement
over last year's then something
completely new the carousel returns but
swiping up from the home screen now
brings up an array of your installed
apps and thanks to the higher resolution
all menu items can now fit on the screen
at once the web experience has finally
been fixed now feels fast without the
bugs and sluggishness that play previous
iterations Mayday is Amazon's new
customer service feature for Kindle Fire
owners if you're having trouble with
something tap the Mayday button and
within 15 seconds police as Amazon's
goal a real-time video chat window but
customer service rep will appear thank
you for using Amazon a fifth I see the
rep can't see you but they can take
control of the system they can also draw
on it in order to illustrate how to do
whatever it is you need to do it's a
pretty cool feature but we'll have to
see how well that 15 second response
time holds up when thousands are tapping
the button daily x-ray for music lets
you sing along accurately to your
favorite songs an x-ray trivia is a
pretty effective way to learn more about
your favorite movies or TV shows it
seems Amazon finally got the horsepower
to interface overhead balanced just
about right thanks to the new Snapdragon
800 processor pages and menus are
accessed near immediately gaming
performance hits about Nvidia shield
level may be a bit lower but definitely
Trump's the new Nexus 7 in frame rate
there are plenty of other small tweaks
and changes I haven't even mentioned and
we're still waiting for a few new
features to be ready like Goodreads and
the video fling feature before we can
give them a fair assessment thanks Eric
and I can't say that it's a tablet for
everyone but if you're really locked
into the Amazon ecosystem it's well
worth it all right HTC they might have
had some tough earnings recently but
that's not stopping top HTC executives
who spoke with the Financial Times and
said that wearables is a critical
segment for us and that they are excited
about it and in fact HTC had already
been working with Microsoft on a
SmartWatch device several years ago kind
of showing what they're thinking then
they also talked about a return to the
tablet market that will be something
nice and disruptive at
they're poorly received tablet lines in
2011 so just stick with something you
know along the lines of the ACC one
design in a I think you guys might have
something there all right last week we
asked you to send us your comments in
favor of or against curved screen so
here are some of them ronit roy says i
don't think it's useful at all no curves
michael stand on twitter says
unnecessary manufacturing costs with
little gain and Peter Vasquez says
smartphone screens with curves would
probably feel better in your front
pocket the curb design might hug your
leg nicely so you know what I'm just
gonna start calling this trend of phones
the thigh phones mmm all right that's
gonna do for this week email us at
Google issues at cnet com or tweet me at
brian Tong and we'll answer what we can
thanks so much for watching all the
Google goodness i will see you next week
for another fix of google Isha's good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
