in San Francisco
it's taken on a high-tech twist an ice
cream shop smitten founder Robin sue
Fisher uses a some unconventional
ingredient liquid nitrogen which is an
inert element and it's negative 321
degrees Fahrenheit that triple-digit
chill changes how the ice cream tastes
and feels in your mouth the colder you
freeze it products the smaller the ice
crystals can be and the smaller the ice
crystals are the sweeter the texture is
while most ice cream is made with
preservatives and stabilizers and frozen
until search
is made without those extras on the spot
do you see the actual real organic dairy
being poured into the bowl you see the
you know the berries right in front of
you you see all the different elements
of each flavor and you get to see the
whole process being churned before your
eyes from liquid and to solid into your
finished ice cream this liquid nitrogen
technique isn't unique to smitten but
this machine is dubbed the burr it's the
result of prototyping with engineers for
two years
mixer manages to scrape every surface of
itself such that the ice crystal is
compressed as small as possible and we
have very special DNA GOC which are
beaters designs and then secondly our
machine also incorporates viscosity so
it has internal brains software that can
really understand what's happening to
the product and knows when the product
is it's right consistency in true
startup fashion smitten is trying to
improve upon its hardware version 2.0 of
the burr rolls out this fall we've also
learned that different things you know
have required more maintenance than
others and also we're making so much ice
cream that our machines are limited with
their size so our next machines are a
little bit bigger and a lot stronger and
more robust in terms of eliminating
maintenance and
there's the increase in size should
shorten the wait for a double scoop of
chocolate ice cream you scream for that
