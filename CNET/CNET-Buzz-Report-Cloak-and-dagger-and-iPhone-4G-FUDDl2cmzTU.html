buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
that would be the gadget of the week the
gadget of the week is no longer the iPad
it's now the iphone 4g prototype
accidentally left in a bar sure you all
know this story by now about the phone
that was found in a bar it turned out to
be a possible iphone 4g prototype and
then gizmodo bought it from the guy who
found it and put up a big exclusive that
revealed everything about the new phone
you know that story anyway here's what
they revealed about the phone itself it
looks like this or at least the
prototype does no one knows if it's the
final design it has a camera on the
front and a camera on the back it has a
flash a micro sim card and like a lot
more buttons that is all we know about
the actual phone the story has been a
nuclear bomb in the tech news cycle for
a week now it's even creeping into
mainstream media the story according to
gizmodo is that an apple engineer whose
name is now mud but used to be gray
powell lost the phone while partying on
his 27th birthday then gizmodo bought
the phone off the guy who apparently
half-heartedly tried to return it they
ran this big exclusive they got tons of
press for it and then they demanded a
letter from Apple asking for the phone
back so that they could say the letter
was proof that the phone was real which
they did now the whole story is so weird
and the gizmodo accounts are so self
congratulatory and full of holes that
it's creating all this suspicion in
these conspiracy theories first people
thought the whole story was fake and the
phone was some kind of chinese knockoff
now they're saying maybe Apple leaked it
on purpose to try to like gauge customer
interest and then gizmodo was a non it
the whole time because seriously how
would an apple employee accidentally
leave an iPhone prototype somewhere
especially when Apple is so hardcore
about security it just does not make
sense unless
Oh
you
right he totally got roofied and even if
he didn't that's totally what he should
tell the thugs over at Apple because
otherwise and in other Apple news this
week an apple fan emailed Steve Jobs and
asked him about that company blocking
porn apps satirical comics and other
content and suggested that Apple
shouldn't be the moral police well Steve
Jobs apparently wrote him back and said
among other things that Apple does quote
have a moral responsibility to keep porn
off the iphone and he went on to say
folks who want porn can buy an android
phone so awesome day for Android also
this week Adobe issued a big anti-apple
statement saying hey you know what fine
Apple nevermind we're not even gonna try
to put any flash support on the iphone
ipod touch or the ipad and you know what
we don't even like you anyways in fact
we are now dating android and we are
going to start working on flash on their
phones and future tablets and how do you
like them apples so like I said awesome
day for Android and finally let's have a
look at what's clogging the tubes this
week it's actually the disappearance of
viral videos you know that hitler reacts
mean where people take a film clip and
they make Hitler react to Michael
Jackson's death or that Kanye thing at
the VMAs they're awesome and there have
been tons of them well they're coming
down due to copyright crackdown
Constantine films owns the rights to the
movie downfall which is parodied in all
the meme clips and this week Constantine
started throwing around takedown notices
citing copyright infringement Hitler's
reaction was predictable typographer
fishy chief
nice young fellow gets an idea possess
you suck together if they visit fighters
and wholesome need a time to God I
notified raided my village knish to
Lucinda Cesar Dom deefizzy foggy start
fight yeah yeah alright pataga my villa
for citizens under English chica dollars
get the nuts the subject vs
she's all air she does it come out mig
da weed out gonna be till the professor
dummy seriously what were they thinking
that whole video by the way is amazing
if it's dawn when you try to go look for
it I guess try Vimeo or dailymotion
uh-huh and Constantine film for God's
sake come to your senses the internet
needs its Hitler parodies yeah that's a
hard one to argue for and that's what
bus report for this week everyone i'm
