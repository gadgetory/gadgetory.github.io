you're probably pretty eager to get it
repaired but how do you do the job right
without paying too much step one check
the warranty most large appliances offer
at least a few years worth of coverage
so if your appliances are ten years old
or less or if you purchased an extended
warranty there's a chance that you're
still covered you can look up warranty
info by checking the refrigerators
manual or by calling the retailer where
you bought it from if you don't have the
manual and don't know where your fridge
came from
check out the manufacturer's listing for
your model just find the model number
usually on a sticker on the back or
inside the door
then see what Google has to say if you
aren't under warranty your next step is
to make sure that your fridge hasn't
been recalled
if the problem is widespread enough
there's a chance that it might be and in
that case the company should be able to
get you a replacement again the
manufacturers listing for your model can
tell you more a scam the Consumer
Product Safety Commission's recall
website which we have linked to in this
video's description next use those
details to get some quotes on how much a
repair will cost we recommend getting
three of them one from the retailer
where the fridge was purchased a second
from a competing retailer and a third
from an independent repair technician in
your area services like Angie's List and
home advisor can point you in the right
direction here once you've gotten those
quotes it's time to pull the trigger and
pick one make sure to pay attention to
the details here because different
quotes might cover different parts of
the process for instance some might
charge extra for things like travel or
off our home visits don't just go with
the cheapest one go with the cheapest
one that covers what you actually need
finally a broken fridge could be an apt
opportunity to consider getting a new
one if the repair is going to be costly
make sure to weigh that against the
price of buying a replacement because
you might just be better off with an
upgrade</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
