screenwriting goes all web two point O
on us it can only be the queue
hey there what's going on I'm rich
demuro with Cena TV and you have found
your way into the queue congratulations
feel special if only for three minutes
let's get you started with your must
click moment a vision of students today
the video created by two hundred
students enrolled in a Kansas State
anthropology class the basic idea create
a three minute video highlighting the
most important aspects of students how
they learn what they need to do it their
goals hopes dreams desires challenges a
shared google document let everyone
collaborate on the project from that a
script and an in-class video shoot go
check it out pretty cool bionic woman
might be a hit for NBC but the cool
technology behind a humanoid has had
scientists and sci-fi addicts drooling
for years probably why scott kirsner of
the Boston Globe was so eager to get a
sneak peek at a robotic arm it's being
developed by Dean came in you know the
brain behind the Segway and the
government this video so far the most
complete look at the prototype the nine
pound mix of metal wires and carbon can
wave curl and even shake hands although
creators don't hope for a large market
the arm could help hundreds of injured
soldiers here's a tech fair you hardly
hear about ready in club fest 2007 from
the very early days of bluetooth
hundreds of engineers have gathered
behind closed doors well back then it
was only a dozen to show off their
latest devices but the point here isn't
to gloat that your range is longer than
mine it's to test dozens of platforms
and prototypes for security and
interoperability all that so when you
and I press connect to pair up our
Bluetooth devices it goes off without a
hitch unplug vests are held in three
locations around the world each year if
you find yourself constantly running to
the computer like me to check little
things like scores weather or news
chumby could be just the device you're
looking for the two-hundred-dollar
device basically sits anywhere collects
info from the net via Wi-Fi to set it up
you just plop it somewhere plug it in
and use your computer to choose a
playlist of widgets then chumby goes to
work collecting all that info and
displaying it in an ever rotating
display there's also a touch screen and
a motion sensor the service is free
gratis thanks to sponsors who
chinle send ad-supported widgets Jumby
already shipping to some VIPs one more
thing to put on the old wish list time
for the beta I've written exactly one
screenplay in my lifetime I used final
draft but that was way before the days
of Ajax and web 2.0 now plot bot takes
writer's block to a whole new wired
level the website created by some fellow
USC alums I don't personally know lets
you write screenplays think of it as a
must-have Google Docs app for the
Hollywood set you can use almost any
browser to add dialogue slug lines and
more the neat part is that you can share
a project with a writing partner and
both contribute without exchanging a ton
of outdated files you can also share
your work with anyone or keep it private
which is exactly what I'm doing with my
second draft until it hits that big
screen I'm rich Demuro would see that TV
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
