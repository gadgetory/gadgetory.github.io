new to the Big Apple it's time to beef
up your mac security hi I'm Seth
Rosenblatt and today I've got six common
sense tips on how to safeguard your mac
against the rising tide of malware step
1 get a security suite yes you can stop
rolling your eyes now running a security
program is just common sense good free
and paid options include a vast sophos
clam xav Kaspersky and intense tall a
suite at the very least use a browser
tool that will check links to make sure
they're safe before you load them the
free avg linkscanner is a good place to
start step 2 lockdown admin privileges
the default account that you create on
your Mac is an administrator account
which can be leveraged by the bad guys
to infect your machine simple solution
create a non admin account for daily use
such as email browsing and music and
video watching jump over to admit when
it's necessary step 3 stay on top of
software updates make sure that you let
software update do its job programs are
rarely updated on a whim so make sure
that you've got the latest versions
because they may contain security fixes
this includes the latest security
patches from software makers and Apple
itself step 4 ditch Adobe Reader if you
can adobe has been notoriously slow in
the past about patching security holes
in reader they've gotten somewhat better
but why risk it when preview and snow
leopard and lion can handle the basic
PDF reading requirements if you must
keep Adobe Reader around make sure that
it's always updated to the latest
version step 5 get rid of java and flash
you can disable Java by going to the
Applications folder than utilities and
unchecking the java version boxes under
the general tab be warned killing flash
and still enjoying the modern web
means switching to google chrome for
your main browser because it's the only
browser that comes with flash built in
chrome updates regularly and the browser
has earned its reputation alongside
firefox as a safe browser that patches
security problems when discovered step 6
take control of your passwords unlike
Microsoft Apple helpfully provides a
solid password manager called keychain
as often as possible use strong
passwords this means random multi-word
passwords separated by spaces if you
want to get password syncing for
multiple device and machine support use
one password or LastPass people can and
do run max without paying attention to
security but as we've seen over the past
year attack centered on macs are almost
certainly going to increase these tips
will help you stay ahead of the bad guys
