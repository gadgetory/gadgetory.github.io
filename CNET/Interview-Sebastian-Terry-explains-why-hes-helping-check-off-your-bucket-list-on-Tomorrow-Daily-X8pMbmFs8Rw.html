guest today it a very special guy coming
all the way from the land down under an
inspiration list the host of 100 things
yeah this is very very cool we have
Sebastian Terry here with us what's
happening yeah this is such an awesome
inspiring show that yet you are doing
now to tell us a little bit about it
thanks very much um well it's called 100
things it's essentially based on a
journey that I've been on for seven
years so I several years ago I lost a
close friend of mine and it made me
reconsider life basically and you know
what I was doing and you know how my
friend was living his life i think was
something that i really enjoyed I really
valued and I thought right I'm unhappy
so i need to change it so i got a piece
of paper and a pen and i just jotted
down things I thought would make me
smile and that was the beginning of this
journey really so I dropped everything
in my life and I just went for it so I
started seeking off very bizarre things
I you know married a stranger Las Vegas
I delivered a baby I walked across the
country but a Guinness World Records go
away said you wrote a list of things
that make you smile and they include
marrying a stranger in Vegas yeah
delivering a baby you're smiling well
that's true i mean we're very shaky well
but everyone's which is different but
the progression is now that I spend all
my time helping people achieve their
goals and that's the show yes I get to
help people around the world achieve
very specific unique goals yeah and so
the trailer dropped I think today or
yesterday yesterday yesterday and then
so tell us a little bit about maybe if
you give us an idea of what some of the
people have on their list that's we're
gonna see in a hundred things yeah well
I mean it's a relative concept isn't it
so everyone's list is completely
different so we're helping all sorts of
people in all different ways so my voice
is a bit hoarse today because yesterday
we helped a guy delights his name was
his dream was to place a major league
fastball so we reached out to my
community so I've got this incredible
community follow followme online and
they just want to help people out
basically so I said how can we help this
guy out and someone put me in touch with
somebody else to put me in touch with
Brett Tomko I'm a you know an X and X
major league baseball player so he
organized his mate Adam Kennedy
played for the most of team Anaheim
Angels he was our batting coach and we
went down there and basically made this
happen and I won't tell you exactly how
the episode ends but we met on the
center mound and the diamond and we went
to the you know the the plate that we
call it the batting plate and batting
plan we watch I'll take it yeah you know
what I cricket in Australia Tobias oh
yeah and we had a lot just got to face
you know this guy and his fastball as
well and he swung and the endings just
amazing and I couldn't stop cheering so
you probably guess what happened but it
was unreal shatters the backboard marks
everywhere all the best music swells so
yeah Grand Slam that was the latest one
but you know it is you know everyone has
a list I think and it's often forgotten
about so some of the episodes kind of
remind us of that there was a lady Kim
cleaning out her house and she found a
bit of paper at the back of her
husband's you know draw got it out and
it was his list of 100 things that he
wrote up when he was a high school Wow
and he'd forgotten about it basically
and she contacted us and said can you
help him to play these things and one of
the items was to do a cattle drive ran a
cattle drive he wanted to be a cowboy so
we said yeah we can do that so we
surprised him we knocked on his door
this guy's called a loo really nice guy
and he went you know who are you I was
like I'm from Australia I'm gonna make
you a cowboy I did cattle rancher so I
said let's go so we hopped on a plane
went to Arizona lived on a cattle ranch
for three days and we know we ran a
cattle drive we took one hundred head of
cattle roughly and just took them across
the plains and we had to learn how to
ride horses and laughs ooh and it was
unreal we helped a girl in LA I guess
create a first solo art exhibition which
was awesome it's just what we go to
Europe today actually to film another 14
episodes we're going to go I mean it's a
very mellow very emotional episode but
one of the first ones going to a
concentration camp to reunite to people
family members oh wow which is deep
which is heavy very heavy but if it's on
someone's list of course and that's
that's the thing I mean actually idea is
a journey it's just to give someone a
beautiful moment right just to create
something that brings happiness yeah
yeah take a drain because we will have
them and just make him reality in my one
person it's starting a company for
someone else it's learning the harmonica
now so at first a hundred things like
said you you made your list and you
started doing those things and we bring
a baby over you're marrying stranger
Vegas um and you started a hunter things
calmed I you yeah and this you talk a
lot about one of the things that I think
is really cool is your community of
people the whole bunch of people just
got really inspired by you and now you
have this global community people all
want to help each other out yeah and
it's all just happened accidentally I
mean I I didn't set out I'd never
thought I'd be talking to you guys you
know I just thought it was a personal
thing but there was something to it very
quickly got a bit of traction and I
think it just goes to show that we all
want to be doing things and some of us
you know like I was you take a backseat
to your own life sometimes and you know
we create a lot of excuses like we can't
do things whether it's money or
commitments or you know fear of getting
out of your comfort zone and all things
that definitely applied to me but I
started breaking down those barriers I
think just through you know trying yeah
thanks ray and so people you know enjoy
that so yeah that the progression has
been that I got to apply use this
analogy you don't even or plane and they
say in case of an emergency and oxygen
masks will drop from the ceiling before
helping anyone else put yours on first
rare which is so interesting like it's
almost selfish you know put yours first
yeah but I think in life you have to you
have to help yourself out I think you
need to be pursuing a meaningful life
style purpose driven and I think once
you do that you will find yourself able
to help others more productively and so
that's what's happened I was on I do
live with a TV backhoe in Australia I'm
huge true raising the interview and this
guy wrote in he said I saw your you know
your list you've inspired me to create
my own can you shave my head so I
thought okay why not it sounds quite
quirky so I flew to Melbourne my shaved
marks head and the mark story is that he
was completely able-bodied until 30 got
bitten by a tick and got Lyme disease so
within six months he's like I gosh
change he's a quadriplegic now he needs
a ventilator to sleep at night he can't
talk you know because of a tick and as I
was shaving his head I saw how stoked he
was and I was so happy to be helping and
then I said well I can do more than this
for you what else coming to and he said
via his translator you know I've always
wanted to do a half marathon so I said
okay how can I help you do that because
I'm slow on the uptake and he said well
you could push me
so answer yeah yeah full elegant answer
and I said like what why is no one
offered to push you and he said I only
came up with my lease yesterday there
was something in there so I just signed
us up for the Melbourne half marathon
when I pushed him and it was the first
time that ever helped anybody out and
the interesting thing on that was by the
time the marathon came around I had a
bunch of people who wanted to help me
help mark so you know if my findings if
you want to call it that is I'm just
discovering that we all want to help
people yeah we all lately want to we
have the ability and we have a desire
and it's about I guess matchmaking now
for me so I you know I find people who
need help because I can't help everyone
and I find a lot of people who want to
help and I just match them up and it
feel sir I think that's such a cool
thing and you know we're technology
focused here and I think the thing
that's so amazing about this is that it
really is because of the internet right
because people are connected you can do
this and people talk about the internet
being a negative thing a lot but this is
a positive thing yeah I mean I look I'm
not that tech savvy to be honest but yes
this communities built up and it's just
an idea of connection I think you know i
I've got no problem putting anything on
social media about what I do because it
ultimately it helps people and so I you
know it's not an egotistical thing but
the beauty of it is that it connects it
just connects with people when I haven't
tried for that to happen so yeah people
are you know all around the world
meeting people and helping people online
and I get contacted by everyone people a
little old lady who his partner passed
away she wanted me to move a pot plant
in a yard I saw it helped yeah and the
same thing happened for a lady in Perth
the other side of the country I'm from
Sydney so someone in Perth got in touch
with me said can I do it and I just put
them in touch and that happened and this
is all by of social media a lady who was
suicidal contacted me she found a bit of
hope in what I was doing really sad
story I won't go into it but it was it
was terrible and then yeah I just rang
her up and someone else connected with
whom they rang her up and all online we
found her a counselor the police got
involved and she's good now so I mean
it's gonna be so rewarding it's just
really cool well their lives being saved
I would I can't stop what I do now yeah
um with my awesome I don't know what
direction you going yeah it's like when
people start working out they say like
oh I can't stop now because it feels so
good to exercise like it's the thing and
like this is really kind of like a
spiritual exercise like you're you're
sort of out there helping people and it
feels so good that you just don't want
to stop it's an it's almost
addiction like help people which is
really great yeah and end the show it
just brings it out so it's done so well
and of course i would say that even if
that wasn't the truth but it is a truth
and i saw the trailer yesterday and it's
you know it's only a minute long but
it's like a it's a bit of a tear jerker
and I've seen a few of the episodes you
know behind the scenes and they're
they're just awesome so I before you go
I definitely have to ask you how the
delivering and someone's baby went
what's because jeff has a baby do like I
do and I'm telling you be the relay I
don't know even sure I want to be in the
room my wife says I have to but he
should it was one of the most beautiful
experiences I've ever witness the funny
but this is you know to the point that
social media helps you know connect
people this girl can follow me online in
canada and said I'm pregnant I'm jus I
if you want to help out I know you want
to you can come and help deliver so I've
said okay sure I got my credit card out
cuz I have no money right this just it
just happens and i flew to her hometown
of regina in canada which i think so
that's hilarious that's a coincidence so
you saw her Regina I saw her interest
excuse me i apologize i don't know
whatever you call it I did I have one of
our legs over my shoulder I want to
happen and and so and like so when when
it came out the baby's mother sighs a
robot baby yeah there was no lightsaber
but but it came out and it was I just
couldn't stop crying so I had the baby I
put on a tummy and um how long do you
train for this or did you just show up
and you're like I'll just wing it there
was a midwife there I see what you said
put your hands here yeah I mean it it
was an amazing thing it was a really
well the bad you have a connection with
that child well it's weird because
obviously the emotional connection isn't
you know the same as being a parent sure
but to me it just showed that everyone
is I mean how generous to invite me into
something else so intimate yeah it was I
mean it's a much longer story than that
what a moment for everybody involved I
mean it's just another big deal and I
made lifelong friends oakleys just
turned three and a half I think so um
yeah wow it's all semantics so aside
from a hundred things you also do things
with make-a-wish yeah I raise money for
charities um so you know I I wanted to
raise ten thousand dollars a camp
quality which is an Australian kids
cancer charity and I ended up making a
thousand dollars for him somehow again
accidentally so I thought well why would
I stop here so I then raised hundred
thousand dollars for Alzheimer's
Australia my mom has younger onset of
dementia which is which is really sad
least 60 so I did that and then make a
wish approached me and said can you be
an ambassador and I guess I do a similar
thing in terms of helping people so I
said absolutely and so I'm raising a
hundred thousand also those guys I don't
know how but it will happen I'm sure
yeah so there's you know I I love the
idea that you can go through life and
help other people you know on a
peer-to-peer level or know in a charity
sense as well so very blessed to be
doing what I do that's right how can we
watch the show ya how much you need to
download the go 90 app so it's a verizon
platform online digital thing and it's
been produced by made man so it's also
available on the made man youtube
channel gets released on the 13th of
april new episode every two weeks for a
year so they're 26 episodes a lot faster
and they are I mean they're awesome and
my very last question will be to anyone
out there who is having trouble thinking
of things for their own list what's your
best advice I give yourself permission
to consider your version of happiness
and I think what you've done that just
make a choice to pull the trigger it's
that simple what else what else is more
important than just feeling good about
yourself so what is that and I think by
doing that you know asking yourself the
question what's on your list which I
want to ask you to you know I think the
ramification of that answer yeah could
change your life and I think probably
more importantly change the lives of
people around you and that's just what
I'm fine i love that that point about
you know helping yourself before you can
help others loving yourself a free out
of others because like you said
sometimes we feel too selfish and you
really do have to be whole and happy and
right yeah before you can be of service
I still just the Instagram name or
whatever you call them the other night
and as I said you can't fill up someone
else's cup if yours is empty it's true
man it's so simple so what's on your
list I want to see the Northern Lights
that's good I would like to learn a
fight choreography like in a superhero
movie is amazing is that I want to learn
how to like I don't know I don't maybe
fight a robot or something i don't know
i think it because because she's not as
a life anyway that's great good answer
amazing but thank you so much we are big
fans on this show we sign off every day
by saying be good humans and you are
certainly one of those oh it's nice of
you decided but have a safe flight over
