critical components they include the
initial time the driver and car begin
their journey from a parked position to
active safety systems designed to avoid
a crash to pre-collision features aimed
at preparing for a collision to passive
safety technologies to help survive a
crash to rescue in response systems
after a crash has occurred we call it
our integrated safety management concept
a key component of this approach focuses
on high level driver assist technologies
that may at some point in the future
evolve into a fully autonomous car the
2013 LS with the world's most advanced
pre-collision system uses a combination
of millimeter wave radar a stereo camera
and near infrared projectors our system
is designed to assist the driver and
avoiding or mitigating collisions with
vehicles and pedestrians under a wide
range of speeds day or night now based
on the position speed and trajectory of
an object if the system anticipates a
collision you'll hear a warning sound
and a break alert will be illuminated on
the instrument panel at the same time
several integrated systems automatically
activate to increase steering quickness
suspension control and brake
effectiveness the shocks are stiffened
to help control nosedive and increase
steering responsiveness and the
automatic seatbelt pretensioners are
activated our system even applies the
brakes automatically to reduce impact
speeding the 2013 LS is graphic evidence
of how automated technologies have
advanced in the last decade so what
paths must be explored in the future we
believe there are two that seem most
compelling a few months ago TMC began
full scale operations at its i TS
proving ground at the egg asha fuji
technical center in japan the facility
which simulates an urban environment has
communication system the links road to
vehicle vehicle to vehicle pedestrian to
vehicle traffic signals and control
devices while monitoring the entire
course the research conducted at our
proving grounds will help prevent
accidents involving pedestrians and
other vehicles improve poor visibility
at intersections and much much more
through it all toyota motor corporation
is dedicated to collaborating with
government regulators and cooperating
with IT s governing boards to help
advance future mobility now whereas i TS
is focused on integrating the car with
the driving environment our advanced
safety research vehicle is aimed at
enhancing the car and the driver's
ability to perceive process and respond
with the aid of onboard automated
technologies we believe our approach is
unique and that it involves two parallel
programs half a world apart exploring
different technologies to achieve one
common goal now one of these active
safety research programs is based in
Japan the other in ann arbor michigan at
the toyota research institute north
america known as Trina patrina program
is aimed purely at research the Japan
engineering group adds the element of
exploring future product development for
market integration now this LS hybrid is
just one example of the areas we're
exploring a Trina it's fitted with
advanced GPS forward inside facing
radars and high def color cameras 360
degree laser tracking gyroscope
accelerometer among many of its other
sensor components our goal is a system
that constantly perceives processes and
responds to its surroundings that scans
the movement of objects around it
identifies a green light from a red
light and measures the trajectory roll
pitch and yaw of the vehicle as it
steers accelerates and breaks along the
most efficient route to its programmed
destination an array of equipment
processes data formulates decision in an
ax by wire responses now as you can
imagine we can't discuss
specific performance parameters and we
can't speculate today on how or when
such a car might be available in the
marketplace our guess is not in the
immediate future and that's how it
should be at the moment this is a pure
research project with a strong statement
of the shape of things to come sensor
and by wire technologies have opened the
door for machines to recognize and
respond to the environment around them
beyond even the capabilities of humans
however sensing what's around you versus
understanding it is vastly different so
we must combine the judgement of humans
with the precision of machines and that
takes time right now machines can handle
simple tasks like parking following
traffic and staying in a lane but we
need to introduce a layered approach
that will broaden capabilities step by
step we will build trust with society
and governments so that vehicles will be
allowed to perform more automated tasks
these capabilities must be integrated
with consistency and reliability before
vehicles are trusted to drive along</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
