to the Apple buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple the new
macbook pro reviews are in and we'll get
to that but let's talk about the big
story this week now according to
Bloomberg Apple is looking for their
next hit and it could be digital glasses
or you know dare I say eyeglasses now
the report says they are in the
exploration phase for a pair of glasses
that would wirelessly connect to the
iPhone show images and other information
in the wearer's field of vision and may
use augmented reality according to
Bloomberg sources the company has
already ordered near eye displays for
early testing but if we see this come to
life the eyeglasses would be introduced
in 2018 at the earliest now we saw what
happened with Google glass but that was
a $1,500 beta product and we know Apple
will handle everything in-house and
behind the scenes until they feel it's
ready or they just scrap it
now Tim Cook has commented multiple
times about Apple's belief in augmented
reality that allows people to still
share moments compared to the more
isolated virtual reality these glasses
would align with that thinking we also
know the iPhone is their bread and
butter and they are trying to build
another device in addition to the Apple
watch that is part of this iPhone
ecosystem now my first reaction was
really Apple glasses but Apple recently
received a patent for a VR headset
similar to the gear VR they have a
patent for a video delivery system two
glasses from 2012 and Apple also has a
patent for a glasses type product
referred to as livestream in January of
2015 with the intention to collect notes
recordings and annotation data elements
so they have done some thinking in the
past around this type of product but
does the idea of glasses even get you
excited let me know on Twitter at Brian
Tong or email me at the Apple byte at
Cena comm and I'll see what you guys
have to say also the new MacBook Pro
reviews are in and there is a universal
affection for the design and speed of
the machine which has been reviewed
primarily by journalists but not
multimedia power users at this point now
the touch bar is still a mixed bag you
don't hear everyone saying it's a game
changer or a whole new revolutionary
interface reviews range from nice to
kind of gimmicky to it make some things
easier and is sometimes less efficient
but you don't hear a universal love for
it and it's always going to come down to
the user there's still the frustration
with ports and dongles but that will go
away over time as USBC continues to be
more important bottom line if you're
already looking to upgrade to new
MacBook Pro you won't be sorry and
that's a good thing but the hard part
now is really finding one the online
store has a four to five week wait but
some Apple stores are getting units in
stock if you do a little hunting it's
also been revealed that not only is the
memory soldered on to the machine so is
the solid state hard drive signaling
really a true end to upgrading any
MacBook Pro in the future and that hurts
longtime pro users that would upgrade
them with significantly cheaper prices
for RAM and hard drives like I used to
be one of those guys and it brings a
tear to my eye
now in stories that really matter the
booty peach emoji has returned after
many of you including myself we're
emotionally distressed after Apple had
changed it in the iOS 10.2 beta great
news that peach is bringing sexy back
thanks to the third iOS 10.2 developer
beta and that's as sweet as peaches and
cream good Apple yeah now they've also
completely replaced the videos app with
the TV app and made it more functional
plus there's a sin with love screen
effect that you can now send from your
phone and the latest iPhone rumor from
stage I securities Ming Chi Kuo claims
there will be three iPhone models in
next year's lineup there will still be a
4.7 inch LCD model with a single camera
lens then a 5.5 inch LCD model with the
dual lens camera but an all-new 5.5 inch
OLED display model with the dual lens
camera will be the new kid on the block
in 2017 according to the report so we
will see and a possible air pods rumor
release state investment bank Barclays
reports units will begin production in
December given the slightest chance that
we'll see air pods right before the
holiday season but they could be pushed
out as far as January 2017 so that
Wireless future that they were talking
about yeah it's still on hold
and also Nintendo's Super Mario run has
an official release date of December the
15th there will be a free version of the
game but really to unlock all of its
capabilities that will cost you ten
bucks like for reals
ten bucks yeah like you I'm still gonna
do it but it doesn't mean I have to like
it that's a bad Apple back and the
holiday season is pretty much here so
what are you going to get that special
person in your life well Apple might
have made it easier with the release of
a new photo book called designed by
Apple that showcases 20 years of Apple
products now comes in two sizes small
and large and the large format book at
13 inches by 16 and a quarter inches
will cost three hundred dollars like do
I really have to throw a bad apple at
this yeah I do bad apple but honestly it
looks pretty I will not deny that and
hey you might just need a new coffee
table book that's $300
then you realize you could have made
like the same book on your own by saving
all their product photography from the
online apple store and put it into a
book which is probably exactly what they
did now I can also confirm alongside the
iPhone 7 that this also does not have a
headphone jack now it's available in
stores right now I haven't confirmed the
rumors of an all dongle centerfold
spread but check this out
I was able to get my hands on an early
release of some of the pages so here we
go here's a look at one of the standouts
in Apple design history the apple
battery case I mean look how that bulge
just comes out of nowhere okay and then
we have this one this one of the air
pods I mean they actually look pretty
amazing on their own until you get to
this page alright let's get to our
winners from last week's contest the
correct phrase was let's get ready to
dunk Oh Congrats go out to aleck mini
Chinni on email and Isaac monks and
wayne rodriguez on twitter you're all
getting the lightning audio charge
rockstar from Belkin and there you go
alright that's going to do it for this
week's show you can email us at the
Apple byte at cnn.com or to me at Brian
Tong to answer your deep burning life
questions thanks so much for watching
we'll catch you all next time for
another bite of the Apple
