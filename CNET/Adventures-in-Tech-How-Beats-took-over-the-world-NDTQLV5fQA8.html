single pair of headphones today it's a
music Empire that Apple paid three
billion dollars to be part of here's how
beats took control of the tech world
among Tech fans beats is infamous
audiophiles argue these colorful cans
are overpriced or offer subpar sound
quality and yet the brand has grown to
be a major part of the technology world
beats has achieved this by making
extremely smart moves throughout its
history right back to the company's
formal creation in 2008 Beach began as a
joint venture between rapper and
producer dr. Dre and Interscope Records
co-founder Jimmy Iovine and audio firm
monster cable beats first masterstroke
was brilliant marketing Jimmy and Dre
didn't waste time talking about
frequency response or impedance but
leaned on Interscope roster to get Beats
product onto famous ears and into music
videos also creating artists branded
Beats variants Tom my fans out there
thank you so much and go get the just
beat you might think this was cheating
but what beats did was spot a gap in the
market products for people who would
never have considered spending $300 on
headphones plus it gave me the courage
to launch my own line of endorsed
technology
beach was a hit and it wasn't long
before rival started churning out
similar products by this point however
the company was already one step ahead
beats next move was to expand beyond
headphones something that began in
earnest as early as October 2009 an HP
tie-up zorb Beats Audio arrived on
consumer laptops later in August 2011
HTC sought to benefit from beats booming
popularity paying 300 million dollars
for a majority stake in the company and
the rights to put Beats Audio into
smartphones a year later Dre and Iovine
bought half of HTC stake back ditched
monster and boosted its fame levels by
handing out headphones to athletes at
the London Olympics despite not being an
official sponsor prompting stern words
from organisers of course knowing
they've been forbidden just made beach
scene even cooler some people are just
born to break the rules
over Christmas 2012 nearly 70% of all
premium headphones sold in the US would
be branded while the headphone market
itself grew into a 2.4 billion dollar
industry underpinning beats success with
the fact that it was wildly trendy but
by the nature trends don't last
beats final masterstroke was putting the
tech in place to keep the business
moving forward even once the novelty has
worn off in 2012 beats bought music
streaming service MOG while quietly
working on a project called dayz that
promised improved music discovery
algorithms Morgan Daisy came together in
feats music launched in January 2014 and
this service is thought to be a big part
of what attracted Apple which confirmed
in May it has paid three billion dollars
for Beats following weeks of speculation
with the Apple sale beats as effectively
one in just a few years spinning that
single pair of headphones into a music
Empire that's both vast and hugely
financially rewarding the story is
essentially one of capitalism firing on
all cylinders but if there's something
that beats has brought to the world of
tech maybe it's the realization that
music isn't just about audio
reproduction it's a cultural thing tied
to fashion showboating and sharing beats
capitalized on that idea and to the
victor go the spoils what do you think
of Beats do you love them or hate them
