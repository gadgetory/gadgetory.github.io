powerhouse flagship phone but you
couldn't quite find enough loose change
down the back of your sofa to afford
Samsung's Galaxy s 9 then honors view 10
might be the better choice for you it's
got pretty much everything you would
expect from a top-end flagship phone
including a six inch screen that
stretches right to the edges with a
resolution that will make your photos
really hot you'll also find a
supercharged processor inside which will
blitz through any game you're likely to
throw in it the honors metal back
doesn't look quite as swanky as their
curved glass arm samsung's s9 but I do
like this deep blue here that you'll
find on most of Honor's phones the two
cameras on the back one of which shoots
in color and the other only in black and
white I found their outdoor shots erm
pretty rich and vibrant while indoor
shots and lower lights also looks pretty
decent selfies from the 13 megapixel
front-facing camera aren't great however
particularly in lower light situations
as something that's worth bearing in
mind if you're a gigantic narcissist who
loves posting endless photos of your
face to Instagram like me
what you won't find on the view 10 is
any kind of waterproofing so you'll have
to be extra careful when you're walking
no swimming pool to see or near any of
your friends carrying big trays of
drinks so no honors phone doesn't have
quite the same wow factor as Samsung's
all singing all dancing flagship and
this one definitely won't turn heads on
the bus in quite the same way but at
only 450 pounds you will have plenty of
cash left over for some pretty stylish
head wear something like this for
example bit of cheese hat this is what's
gonna get me the big bucks the cheese
head on the bus at a movie screening
dinner with the queen breakfast with the
prince
yeah oh yeah
