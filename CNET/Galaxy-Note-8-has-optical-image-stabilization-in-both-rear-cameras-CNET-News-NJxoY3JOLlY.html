special occasions we use them to capture
and share the moments we live every day
and many of those moments happen at
night that's why we introduced the dual
pixel sensor so you could capture vivid
photos and videos in low-light but
what's the point of an awesome camera if
you miss the perfect shot like when your
friend finally gets airborne that's why
we introduced quick launch so you can
access your camera at a moment's notice
and remember the days when you're afraid
of taking pictures at the beach by the
pool or in the rain for fear of getting
your phone wet well that's why we made
our devices water-resistant so you don't
have to worry the no date has to
separate back cameras that work together
to capture your experiences like never
before one camera has a wide-angle lens
for capturing big scenes and the other
has a teller lens with two times optical
zoom so you can get closer to your
subjects without sacrificing image
quality but here's the coolest part the
node a is the first smartphone ever to
have optical image stabilization in both
cameras just look at the difference
and that's not all it's not just photos
that benefit from dual OS its videos to
live focus gives you the freedom to
decide how much your subject stands out
by adjusting the blur and focus of the
background in real-time Suzanne how you
doing today good
awesome Kelly we're gonna work on your
profile pic okay gonna be epic make sure
you get my good side alright awesome I'm
gonna launch my camera turn on live
focus mode and now since this picture is
all about Kelly I'm gonna turn up the
effect to maximum alright let's see what
what we've got that looks great you want
to come see this oh yeah
let's check that out now he is sexy that
is your new profile pic tele I like that
everyone give it up for Kelly
in life focus mode you can adjust the
background blur even after you take in
the picture so if I want to dial it down
they can but this is Kelly's profile pic
I'm gonna dial it back up in live focus
mode the cameras simultaneously take two
pictures so not only do you have Kelly's
new portrait but you have all the
beautiful detail behind it which
includes all of you Kelly's new profile
pic all of you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
