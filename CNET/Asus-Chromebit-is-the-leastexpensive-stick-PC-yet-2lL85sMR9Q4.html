away with spending on a desktop computer
I'm Dan Ackerman and we are here taking
a look at the a soos chromebit this is
part of a small but growing category of
systems that we call stick pcs until
compute stick is a great example of that
unlike that one however this guy runs
Google's Chrome OS and if you're not
familiar with Chrome OS it's what you
find in Chromebooks it's basically
Google's Chrome web browser a couple of
file management tools and that's really
about it so what do you do with
something like the chrome bit well you
take the stick you pop the top off and
here you have an HDMI output and you
just kind of jam that into any monitor
or TV that has an HDMI port in it and
you're connected and good to go
almost much like the fire TV stick from
Amazon or Roku stick or even a
chromecast you need power so there's a
tiny power plug right over here so you
have to run a wire to a power adapter
that plugs into a wall but then you're
good to go
you of course need a keyboard and a
mouse as well you can connect bluetooth
ones or you can connect USB dongle ones
there is however only one USB port right
here at the very end you can do a lot of
the stuff that you would do you know on
an everyday PC anyway and that's one of
the things that appeals to people about
Chrome OS a lot of email is done through
web-based email whether it's Gmail or
somebody else productivity you can use
Google Docs you can use Microsoft's
online office tools of course streaming
video is very easy a lot of people do
that through Netflix or through Amazon
or through Google Play Photoshop is one
of the things you're probably going to
miss out on if you do photo editing
there are online tools like Pixlr that
are reasonably close to that and of
course social media that's what all of
us pretty much spend most of our online
time doing anyway now all that stuff
works fine on an online-only device like
the chrome bit or any other Chrome OS
system now how much you're going to pay
for all this well that Intel compute
stick which is kind of like this but
runs Windows albeit slowly started out
at about $150 you can get it for about
120 now a Chromebook is usually 150 to
250 this is Sue's Chromebook
five dollars that's how much it will
cost you to get basic internet
connectivity and web browsing on your TV
or your monitor if all you're interested
in doing is streaming media then maybe
you want to go something even less
expensive like the Google chromecast
which again is the stick that plugs in
and cast media from the computer you
already have but to set up a pretty
simple on-the-go easy to transport
desktop computer experience it's tough
to go wrong if you only need basic
online connectivity I'm Dan Ackerman and
that is the Asuza chromebit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
