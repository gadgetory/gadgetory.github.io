maybe an eighty-five percent male skewed
audience but that just goes with
anything sort of new and innovative I
think it's but you know what at what
we've seen over time hey hey it's the
iphone audience look at the people that
buy iphones look at the people that it's
the ipad users it's actually Silicon
Valley I mean we live in a bubble here
we really do in the sense of people are
people that are using these first
technologies is just happened emails
good audience but what we found over
time that it actually skews more female
and the females are the ones that are
driving the most interactivity if we
look at the top 100 shows and you look
at the audience like modern family
revenge then they've Game of Thrones we
have stuff on Showtime it's actually
becomes a actually a female skewed
audience that is actually driving most
of the social activity but every show is
different I think we're seeing a
transition from male scooty audiences of
female and I think that you know if you
look at any sort of digital platform
that's successful females drive the most
amount of engagement and a time spent on
activity and that's this driving our and
then the advertiser interest of that so
when the pngs and the Unilever's and the
crafts are the ones that are contacting
us because those are the ones that are
driving this to screen behavior</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
