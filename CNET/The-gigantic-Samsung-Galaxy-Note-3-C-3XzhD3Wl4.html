bigger is better why prod daintily at a
tiny little screen when you can stretch
your palm out across something that
blurs the line almost completely between
phones and tablets let's say hello then
to the samsung galaxy note 3 the note 3
is every bit as enormous as its
predecessor it's got a larger 5.7 inch
display but with slimmer bezels the body
size hasn't increased that means more
screen with less bulge in your pocket
still if you're used to the 4-inch
iPhone 5 this will be quite a stretch to
get used to the screen has a full HD
resolution making even tiny texting
webpages look crisp and clear it's one
of samsung's Super AMOLED displays to
which has incredibly vivid color and
high contrast it's certainly a screen to
keep you movie fanatics happy there's a
host of software on board too to help
you make the most of the s-pen samsung
has updated its s note app to let you
create little booklets of notes you can
email people by drawing commands on the
screen draw a little YouTube window into
existence or draw around something on
screen to take a screenshot of it it's
running on the latest Android 4.3 jelly
bean software which samsung has loaded
up with a usual massive extras it's
translator tool health app and usual
multiple app stores are on board as is
the Handy dual screen apps tool the vast
quantity of preload of stuff does make
it rather confusing though particularly
if you're new to android it's powered by
a quad-core processor or an eight-core
one in some areas has clocked at a
mighty two point three gigahertz it gave
some astonishing result in our benchmark
tests so rest assured that whatever you
throw at it it'll be able to handle
without hesitation around the back is a
13 megapixel camera it comes with much
of the same functions found on the s4
including HDR and panorama modes as well
as the Daft dual shot mode it's video
camera is able to capture footage and an
impressive 4k resolution at 30 frames a
second that is some serious resolution
but you will need a 4k display to play
it back properly turn a resolution down
and you can shoot 120 frames a second
for some funky slow-motion acts
physically it's easy to see the family
resemblance to the rest of the galaxy
line with the chrome effect speaker and
shiny edging the back has a new lever
effect coating to but don't worry vegans
it's not real leather it feels quite
nice and I think looks pretty smart too
with its enormous size and price to
match for galaxy note 3 really isn't
going to be to everyone's tastes those
of you who prefer the nostalgia of
handwriting notes will appreciate the
stylist while the immense power will
come in handy to the super users and the
game is among you if you're looking for
a beast of a phone to finally replace
your nakid old laptop this could be the
device for you I'm Andrew Foyle cnet and
this is a samsung galaxy note 3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
