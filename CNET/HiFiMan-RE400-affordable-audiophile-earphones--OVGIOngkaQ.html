cnet.com and I'm here with the high five
man re-400 in-ear headphones now high
five man may not be familiar to a lot of
people but it is to a lot of audio files
the company makes some very good
full-size headphones but in the past
it's in your models haven't been that
good but this is the first in its new
water line series and it's a lot better
than previous models it has machined
aluminum earpieces nothing too fancy
about it very understated but the
earpieces are lightweight they do feel
comfortable in your ears you don't get
much of the way of extras it does come
with four sets of different sized ear
tips as well as a little stick to wrap
up the headphones but there's no
carrying case included and there's no
inline remote with a microphone so you
can make cell phone calls the headphones
themselves seem fairly durable the
bottom half the cord is cloth covered
and the cord terminates in an L shape
which is a little bit more durable than
your straight plug so all in all a
pretty minimalist design but where these
your phones really shine is their audio
quality
they feature excellent audio quality
they're very accurate earphones with
well balanced sound they might not have
quite enough bass for some folks but
these are geared towards audio files who
prefer a more neutral warmer sound and
these really do well with a lot of
different kinds of music they sound
particularly good with acoustic tracks
I'm David carnal and those are the high
five man re-400 in your headphones
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
