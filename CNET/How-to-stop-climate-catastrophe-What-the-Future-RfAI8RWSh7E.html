report suggests that the president is
wrong about climate change so what the
heck can we do about it
welcome to what the future on today's
show ideas to stop the coming climate
catastrophe a plane with no moving parts
makes its first flight at MIT thanks to
an ion thruster engine and last but
certainly not least NASA's first Mars
landing in over six years was a success
and we've got pictures but first we've
got to have a great climate by now
you've probably heard of the massive
climate report released by the Trump
administration on Black Friday it paints
a frightening picture earth could see 12
degrees of warming by the end of the
century the US could lose 1/10 of its
GDP and displaced people could create a
refugee crisis of historic proportions
so what can we do to mitigate the damage
let's talk about the most WTF idea first
dimming the Sun no this isn't a plan
suggested by mr. burns it actually comes
to us from researchers at Harvard and
Yale they call the idea stratospheric
aerosol injection and it involves
spraying massive amounts of sulfate
particles into the air about 12 miles
above the earth researchers say it could
cut the rate of global warming in half
but it could also lead to other
unintended consequences such as
worsening droughts damaging crops or
extreme weather events plus the
technology required doesn't even exist
yet and it would only be a temporary
solution to the real problem driving
climate change greenhouse gas emissions
thankfully canadian-based company carbon
engineering is working on a solution
established in 2009 the company set out
to take co2 out of the atmosphere and
turn it into carbon neutral fuel for
transportation and it has already proven
successful their pilot plant in British
Columbia has been using hydro power to
remove co2 from the air and turn it into
fuel for almost a year now
if fossil fuels need to stay in the
ground to avoid climate catastrophe
maybe these carbon neutral fuels could
someday take their place while these new
technologies are exciting technology
alone will not stop climate catastrophe
it's just one piece of the puzzle the
other major piece of the puzzle is
policy and that's where the green New
Deal comes in the term green New Deal
has been used to describe a potential
stimulus package addressing
environmental and financial crises for
over ten years
it's back in the news again thanks to
efforts from activist groups the sunrise
movement and justice Democrats named
after FDR's New Deal the green New Deal
would aim to get the United States
operating on 100 percent renewable
energy in ten years it would focus on
decarbonizing America's most polluting
industries investing in the capture of
greenhouse gases making green technology
a major export of the United States and
creating tons of green jobs since the
Democrats won control of the house in
the midterms the sunrise movement has
been pushing Democratic leadership to
create a select committee that would
draft the legislation for a green new
deal so that it could be ready for 2020
in the event of more democratic
victories they want the committee to be
made up of politicians that reject
fossil fuel donations to avoid conflicts
of interest if you support something
like this consider reaching out to your
representative in Congress and letting
them know you want them to support a
select committee for a green new deal
twelve representatives have already
signed on in support and now for
something straight out of a sci-fi movie
on an electric plane with no moving
parts it is propelled by something
called electro aerodynamic propulsion or
EAD for short it's an EAD thruster
creates a high voltage across two
electrodes ions flow from the smaller
electrode to the larger one creating an
ionic wind which generates thrust for
the aircraft MIT successful test flight
proves this technology has potential
ionic propulsion is relatively silent
meaning it could be a welcome substitute
for those loud obnoxious drones which
might be delivering your amazon packages
in the not-too-distant future
researchers at MIT say the next step is
to develop these ion thrusters to be
used alongside traditional propulsion to
increase fuel efficiency insight has
landed the Martian probe touched down on
the red planet Monday afternoon and it's
already sending back that red desert
eagle nests here's the first image in
sight beamed back for us from the
Martian surface NASA's latest Mars
mission aims to gather new information
about Mars as composition structure and
how it was formed
insight carries a seismometer which will
be placed on the planet's surface to
measure the seismic waves and map out
the interior structure of Mars a wind
and thermal shield will sit on top of
the seismometer to protect it from the
elements the heat flow and physical
properties probe will drill about 16
feet into the planet's surface to
measure the temperature of Mars and a
radio experiment aboard insight will
measure the wobble of the Martian poles
as the planet rotates which will help
scientists learn more about the
composition of Mars's core insight will
use its robotic claw to set up these
complex experiments it's basically the
most expensive claw game ever made one
that plays itself I'm very much looking
forward to learning more about Mars as
insight continues its data gathering
missions since you all had jokes this
week instead of an audience question
we're gonna run down the top three
roasts of the first images back from
Mars
Douglas Warren cracked its nat season on
Mars I might be giving too much credit
and assuming this one is a joke
but Maurice artist said on Facebook Mars
looks flat I'm now a flat Mars err if
flat Mars aren't a real thing yet I'm
sure they will be in the near future and
finally Brian Lloyd Coco Estrada pega
said they spend millions for those pick
I could have just sent them a photo of
my
but jump down to the comments and let us
know what's got you saying WTF this week
thanks for watching what the future I'm
Jessie Orel we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
