getting heated just a day after Verizon
started offering unlimited data plans to
outshine the competition t-mobile took a
swing back at Verizon and now will match
some of its offerings so to make sense
of it all here's the breakdown of the
current unlimited plans for the major US
carriers on Verizon $80 gets you one
unlimited plan for one line you can get
this on four lines for a hundred and
eighty dollars
t-mobile's unlimited plan starts at 70
bucks and four lines will cost you one
hundred and sixty dollars Sprint's
unlimited starts at just fifty dollars
and five lines not for is just ninety
dollars in total that's the cheapest but
Sprint's pricing will only last year
after March of 2018 it's going to cost
more a little close in price to t-mobile
AT&amp;amp;T they're the oddball right now it
only offers an unlimited mobile plan for
people who also subscribe to DirecTV or
u-verse TV services that starts at
around a hundred dollars for one line
and four lines of unlimited will cost
one hundred and eighty dollars that's
close to Verizon's pricing when you're
comparing the prices remember there will
be additional fees and taxes added to
the bill except for t-mobile they fold
that into their advertised prices of
course you also have to take network
quality into consideration Verizon and
AT&amp;amp;T are the largest but it doesn't
always mean they are the best G Mobile
is ranking very high in many reports
these days and keep in mind unlimited is
not truly unlimited the fact is if
you've got beloved data all of these
networks are going to slow you down for
example on Verizon if you use 22
gigabytes of data in a month your speed
is going to take a hit and other
customers will be given preference over
you if the network is congested
throttling is about the same for every
carrier give or take a few gigs and
there's often another limit to unlimited
HD video sprint limits video streams to
lower quality standard definition
resolution with ATT your video is also
streamed at lower quality unless you
deactivate a service called stream saver
Verizon and t-mobile both offer HD video
and their unlimited plans
they also both offer 10 gigs of
high-speed data that you can tether to
share with another wireless device but
as competition heats up let's hope the
deals get even better networks are
growing to handle more capacity and
consumers are hungry for better
unlimited deals as our apps and
streaming habits demand more data for
