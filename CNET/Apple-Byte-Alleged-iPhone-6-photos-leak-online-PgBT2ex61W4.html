welcome to the Apple by for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
let's get to it and this week it's all
about the iphone 6 and it's not just
rumors with made-up words this time
around we have smartphone camera shots
from factory workers that's slightly
more legit so we start off with this one
from Chinese microblogging site Weibo
that appears to be a front panel from
Apple's larger screen iPhone 6 now this
panel has the same familiar cutouts from
the previous iphone with spaces for the
front-facing camera ambient light sensor
gear speakers and home button and a
noticeably thinner bezel which aligns
with all the rumors we've been hearing
up to this point now another photo on
Weibo this time it's lower quality so it
has more of that super secret you should
not be taking a picture of this feel to
it well this shows a straight on view
side by side with an iPhone 5 or 5s
turned on and based on the size it's
believed to be the rumored 4.7 inch
screen size but operation iphone 6
doesn't stop there after Japanese site
Macotakara posted images from several
booths at the recent Hong Kong
electronics fair featuring iphone 6
machined mock-ups made of metal and
iPhone 6 cases again these are not
official but so far many of the leaks
out of Asia have shared the same similar
designs now if you're looking for some
potential insight on the buttons of the
next iPhone website nowhere else fr
posted images of silicone cases that
they claim 50 iphone 6 with the 4.7 inch
screen perfectly look on the left edge
and if these are believed to be legit
apples abandon the circular buttons for
the elongated buttons with rounded edges
and the power standby button has been
moved to the right side of the phone
which makes more sense because it's a
pain in the butt to have to reach the
top on these larger screen phones at
least if you have small hands which I do
not now there are even more super super
photos nowhere else fr also posted what
they claim are the batteries for the
iphone 6 and a production tray see I
actually believe this photo is the most
real out of them because it's the
hardest to see and
more from website Weibo this time it's
the alleged manufacturing molds used for
apple's next-gen phone and sketches of
the chassis for the phone both of these
are said to be coming from Foxconn and
we've pretty much seen everything now I
want to see the power cord for the
assembly line machine seriously someone
get me that and let me guess some of you
are saying yourself so much for doubling
down on secrecy Tim but we still don't
know if it will come in gold I love gone
I really do now you won't like this
story according to the street insider
jefferies analyst Peter Mesa says Apple
has been negotiating with carriers on a
possible 100 dollar increase for the
iphone 6 carriers are initially
resisting the push to move from the
iphones 199 base price but that could
change with consumer demand drawing for
apple's next big screen phone and this
could most likely be 2014's blockbuster
handset in terms of sales now Peter me
sec is also the guy who continued to
push hard that we get the Apple TV TV in
2012 which yeah looks like it hasn't
happened yet now don't do this Apple and
I know you won't because you don't want
a bad apple no you don't want that all
right let's shift gears and we've talked
about ibeacons and beacon technology in
this show so we decided to check it out
with the Golden State Warriors the first
NBA arena using beacon technology and
Kevin Cote their senior director of
digital gave us the lowdown you know I
wanted to kind of talk to you about
beacons implementing them here at the
part of the fan experience kind of talk
to us about how that works and it really
works with the Golden State Warriors app
right sure yeah so so what it is it's
about enabling our fans to use their
mobile device as a companion to their
experience here at the game and we
believe the beacon technology is going
to be something that continues to take
off so we wanted to kind of be early
adopters and it to really get our fans
used to the technology we already do a
lot here in the arena with phones
whether it's Facebook chicken or this
Instagram wall a variety of things to
enhance their experience and the beacons
are just another way to do that
and then really what school at the app
is not only is it done over a low
frequency bluetooth but also in an
inaudible sound at own right is sent
throughout the arena right correct yeah
it so it can be sent out via these
beacons or even through our PA system in
the in the bowl if we wish now does that
mean you probably won't have like a dog
day here at the arena just in case safe
to say now tell us some of the stuff
that will be delivered to your phone
through the answer so right now when a
fan comes to Oracle Arena they're
greeted instantly as soon as they walk
through the doors with welcome two
warriors ground that's kind of what we
call this place warriors ground and
immediately they're served an
opportunity to win a free doublet the
first 50 fans do so can actually come
right here to the Facebook table in
addition to that Knights facebook
giveaway to get that free item we've
done a couple other things and enter two
wins for VIP experiences so that's
something you're getting right off the
bat when you come in what we're going to
do in the future is merchandise
discounts at our team store we also have
beacons upstairs in the upper level so
through our app you can actually upgrade
your seats moberly through your phone so
we remind you that as soon as you hit
the elevator I like that so if I'm kind
of in the nosebleed yes I've got a
little extra change I can use the app
correct and move on down yep alright we
remind you that through the beacon now
we're here in the heart of the Silicon
Valley you know we have this instagram
wall behind us really the Warriors you
know arena oracle arena is one of those
places that can really leverage this
technology are you guys really trying to
be kind of one of those leaders in that
space yeah we're trying to but we also
have to be because we're in this space
our fans expect to be able to use their
phones they expect to have Wi-Fi they
expect for us to enable them to enhance
their experience through the phone and
for the record I never get caught up
with those Instagram wall thingies I
mean some people are totally into
themselves yeah you were actually in the
video on the wall cool well onto the
quick bites Apple announced their car
play platform about a month ago but at
the time you needed to buy a whole new
car that would be carplay compatible
well not anymore after Nikkei reports at
Alpine will begin selling a standalone
aftermarket console that supports car
plate integration this year with a price
point around 500 to 700 dollars and
pioneer also announced that their killer
line of NEX in dash multimedia receivers
ranging in price from 702 fourteen
hundred dollars are available to buy
right now and will bring carplay
functionality with a firmware update
that will be made available in the early
summer of 2014 and I know a lot of you
outside the US and Australia are asking
about when you'll get itunes radio in
your country well there's still nothing
there for my friends in Canada but the
UK might be closed after reports that
Apple's director of I adds Paul Wright
has been visiting media marketing
agencies to get the advertising units in
place now it was confirmed by this tweet

to free Bieber songs on iTunes all right
