buy right now if you're gonna have a
drone why not have the best we get to
test all kinds of drones here but these
are the ones they're worth your
hard-earned money spoiler get used to
hearing DJI in this video and number
five is a unique breeze 4k this isn't a
toy drone and it really isn't for racing
the breeze 4k is a selfie drone that you
can control with your phone and an app
the breeze 4k has some good automated
flight modes for fun shots while it can
record video in 4k as you figured out by
the name you probably want to stick to
HD video why the HD modes use digital
image stabilization so you get smoother
video in 4k mode that video might not
look too great with movement or when
there's like a gust of wind also flight
time is around 12 minutes so it's
probably best used for quick shots
coming in at number four is the pirate
bebop 2 sharing a name with everyone's
favorite purple mohawk wearing warthog
human hybrid the bebop can do lots of
tricks very easily it's also very safe
check out what happens when the bebop 2
runs into an object the propellers stop
immediately there's also a version with
an fpv pack which comes with a
controller and a headset which gives you
a first-person viewpoint of what your
drone is seeing the controller in the
fpv pack is also smaller than it's been
in the past number three is the DJI
spark it's very compact but it's gesture
support
grabs your attention this spark lets you
take pictures without the need of
anything else
of course you get better control using
the app or you can have increased
precision thanks to an optional
controller flight time is a bit on the
short side under 16 minutes so you might
want to grab some spare batteries the
camera on the spark is really good with
a two axis motorized gimbal for smooth
looking video we are at number two which
brings us to the DJI phantom 4 pro the
phantom 4 pro is easy to fly in beginner
mode outside of that mode you can get
this drone speed up to 45 miles per hour
that's around 72 km/h the DJI phantom 4
pro shoots smooth video and can track
objects what's the downside it's pretty
pricey so if you're just dabbling in
drones
maybe the Phantom 4 pro isn't for you
and the number one drone you can get is
the Maverick air by DJI it folds up has
a stabilised camera and can be used in
the air for around 20 minutes the video
shoots is very smooth even when there
are strong winds the Mavic air also
features gesture controls like the DJI
spark gesture away the Mavic air also
has some advanced object collision
avoidance features you can go over or
around objects to keep moving forward
thanks to Josh Goldman for his help on
this top 5 what features are most
important to you in a drone do you want
to race them you want to take selfies
take selfies while you race a drone when
you're on foot let us know am i as a
colonel see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
