I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update the Apple and Samsung us trial is
almost out of clothes the two tech
giants spent three weeks battling over
patents and accusations of copying
technology the jury is expected to begin
deliberations Tuesday Apple is asking
for 2.5 billion dollars in damages from
Samsung it claimed Samson copied the
look and feel of the iphone and ipad and
samsung was around 519 million dollars
from Apple for infringing on its patents
there will be rough days ahead for
onlive the company that wanted to change
the way we buy and play video games if
you haven't heard of it onlive is a
relatively new cloud-based gaming
service it hosts console games on its
servers and instead of you downloading
the whole game or buying the disk it
streams it over the internet for you to
play on your TV tablet or PC it offers
this ten dollar a month all you can play
subscription but on Friday onlive sold
its assets to a newly formed company
bought by an investor it'll still be
called on live in the restructuring it
laid off employees but said it would
hire money back now subscribers
shouldn't see any problems or
interruptions in the service during this
restructuring a few tech deals are
making headlines for starters college
students who buy a new pc from Dell HP
best buy or at the microsoft store can
get a free Xbox 360 console the computer
has to cost at least seven hundred
dollars and it has to be bought before
September 8th also you have to prove
your student with a valid edu email or
ID gadget trade insight gazelle is
offering a tempting deal for anyone
planning on selling a used iphone and
trading up to the new iphone if you get
a price quote a now for a used iphone
you don't have to mail it in until
october first now everyone's saying the
next iPhone will be out in September so
ideally you'll be able to hold on to
your phone until the new one comes out
the value of used iphones is higher now
than it will be when a new one launches
also iphone users will need that shared
data plan if they want to use the
facetime video chat service over ATT
cellular network otherwise you gotta
stick with Wi-Fi to make a facetime call
and no word
verizon will do something similar and in
what's up with mars news the Curiosity
rover just shot a laser beam at a rock
and vaporize the outer part of the rock
yep the rover has a laser gun on it
shooting pulses at the rock created
electrically-charged plasma and sensors
detected more than 6,000 wavelengths of
light the laser was designed for
chemistry test but no telling how
powerful it is compared to your typical
Martian ray gun that's your tech news
