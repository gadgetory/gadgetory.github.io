coming at you live from CES it's the
last day I'm Kareem levy I am Emily
Dreyfuss and we have been here all week
mainly in the parking lot of CES reading
all about the gadgets that are in these
huge halls behind me great literally in
a parking lot that's where we've spent
our time we're going to tell you today
about our highlights of the show our low
lights of the show what is seared into
our memory forever and we wish that we
could pay tons of money to forget and
then the like for things that we really
truly loved right we tried to keep it to
5 because 5 is you know nice round
number yeah we really like five but I
don't know some things came out to 10
and some we have everything stylings of
new gadgets at this show and thousands
of crazy things that happened but before
we get to see yes I really want to talk
about the one thing that was not here
but that happened while we were here and
that is this huge iphone rumor yeah
which is insane that life happened
outside of here yeah I mean CES is an
enormous bubble it's like tech can't
summer camp right for technology
reporters and gadget gizmo writers and
so we didn't realize that anything else
was happening in the world and then what
actually was happening was was huge huge
so what it was was the wall street
journal came out with this report saying
that it's very likely that a cheaper
iPhone a cheaper smaller iPhone it's
going to come out this year 2013 great
and what a cheaper smaller iPhone $99 is
what they said right and then it would
be for emerging markets or just also
people who don't want to pay a massive
amount of money for an iphone which is
everybody great but then that story got
like flipped on its head three different
times yeah because i'll let you explain
why why the cabin so while we were here
in vegas phil schiller of Apple took a
trip to China that he didn't tell anyone
about until he was in China and then in
China was quoted as commenting on this
rumor as saying absolutely not that is
not going to happen a Chinese news
source said that Phil Schiller said
there is no way that there is an amount
of market share that would be worth us
making basically a crappy product
product
where did the rumors originally come
from that they were going to make a
cheaper crappy product digit times so
anonymous and their anonymous random
people with from the supply chain that's
what they say the supply chain and the
Wall Street Journal who we have to
remember reports that there's going to
be a cheaper iPhone every single yet
they've been reporting the cheaper
iPhone rumor for 46 years six years
iPhone came out and in fact actually
this week was the six year anniversary
of the iphone raised on thurs it was on
I think when Wednesday or every single
day is the same day here every day which
is just another way actually that Apple
has in the past scooped CES because the
original iPhone came out at CES but not
at sea yeah but apple doesn't come
happened like away from CES but it was
still the only thing he had talked about
it so yeah so then this year people are
talking about this cheaper iPhone and
then Phil Schiller was apparently quoted
as saying no absolutely not we would
never do that which that makes sense
they wouldn't do that except for they
also said they wouldn't do that with the
ipad mini and then how we have an ipad
mini and they also said that they
wouldn't do a tons of things with the
iphone though i don't we have that with
the iphone 5 no crazy thing that
happened is that then this morning we
woke up to the fact that Reuters trusted
news source reuters came out and
rescinded their story that they quoted
phil schiller on they had reported that
phil schiller had said this that he that
they would never do this that I that
Apple's not working on a deeper iphone
and then Reuters said there were so many
problems with that story that they're
rescinding it which means maybe he
didn't say that which means maybe there
is a cheaper iPhone in the works so what
my mind exploded well I want to know
what the problems were worth the story
like did their Google Translate not work
I mean we literally tried to ask google
translate that haha like I google
translated by google translate yeah and
nobody knows what answer and there was
like it was like a snake eating its own
head right on tail and a black hole
happen in my computer blew up and CES
exploded and then the world yeah and
then everybody walked out with the team
are I so happy cuz I could finally go
home and take a bath because it's so
let's talk about your ad you take so
many baths and I don't know if that's
the vegas thing or if that's a real life
thing it's a vegas thing in real life
I'm filthy I know I
I am like a cat who's averse to going
into water rumor has it that's not what
happened whatever I didn't know you know
the thing is what happens in vegas is
that all of us technology reporters run
around and it's super dry we're in the
desert and i always think about what I'm
here is I want water I want to be
immersed in water now and that's why one
of the coolest products that I think
came out this year in zs is the Sony
Xperia Z phone right that can be done
attendees dumping water water because
then I consider my bathtub and text with
Kareem about rumor has it about the
cheaper iPhone coming out and if it
falls in water who cares yeah that's
like that thought is really cool ok so
basically just to sum up about the
iphone rumor nobody knows if it's gonna
happen or not we have no idea i would
say it won't because here's the thing
you need to remember about a cheaper
iPhone cheaper iPhones already exist you
can already get a $99 iphone it's called
the iphone for us right and it's also
called when you you know sell your phone
on gazelle or whatever and i buy a
different one yeah and you can also buy
$149 iphone and that is the iphone 5 on
sale at walmart right with it but so
then that's what Apple is doing their
kind of you think that they are going to
just let walmart and all the you know
big companies take the hit in terms of
cost makes absolutely no sense for Apple
to manufacture a cheaper worse small
product when they can actually offload
the burden of a cheap phone on two
carriers and stores who will actually
subsidize the cost for them like Walmart
is already making a cheaper iPhone right
more Apple however remember our tall
drink of water gene munster Oh lovely as
an analyst that we do this time are
Jaffrey Apple analyst gene months so he
is super on board with this 99 doll like
he thinks it's gonna create billions of
dollars and like why why what we've
doubted gene munster before in the past
but he was right about Apple stock going
above six hundred dollars he was right
about right about everything he secretly
works there that's why when you look
deeply into his eyes you're like that is
a trustworthy night so I when you look
deeply into his eyes you just don't
listen to anything else like okay yeah
whatever you say very
um so are so whatever we don't know all
right let me know how about the stuff
that happened that we saw at CES this
year okay so first I think we should
start with the five things we would buy
if we had all of the money in the world
from this show from the show right yeah
I would buy it let me out of my gnarled
I would not that one island that the
Virgin guy owns Necker Island what he
already owns it fine no I'd buy it from
him oh okay but I see yes here's what
happened I want that horizon tablet ok
let me know Bo horizon tablet may show a
picture of this tablet because it is so
cool it's huge and then the coolest
thing about it is that 27 inch tablet
and computer you can just prop it up
like a desktop and use it in its touch
and you can have a keyboard and bawdy
bawdy blah but the moment thanks here is
where it gets really cool it has all
these accessories that connect to it
that you can have like family game night
around your 27 inch table or you and I
could have it and sit it on a table and
we could write our script interactively
because lenovo has an interface where
you can use it i can use it at the same
time and it's optimized for like multi
user computing but let's go back to
what's actually important about this
switches the joystick thing is that you
stick on to it and then you can play
games and you know there's a there's i
don't care about them I know you're
really not excited but there's a
six-sided die and through Wi-Fi when you
roll the dice that's cool it knows what
number you rolled because of Wi-Fi that
is so that's like one of those like
futuristic things that I'm just like I
don't even know how they did it I was
just like half of the big spear I don't
even know are they at it actually this
was my vote for the best of CES show
because I think that what its innovative
because it's not only a thing that you
can just use as a computer as a desktop
that everyone needs right it also has it
points to this future different way of
using gadgets because if you think about
like you and I would go out to dinner
and then we're both on our iPhone and
it's so rude sometimes like we're
ignoring each other and then you can
imagine like the typical American family
now they have their Sunday dinners and
the teenagers are sitting there texting
and the dad is checking his length
great that's a thing and but with this
is what my dad's always checking yeah
but with this lenovo tablet it could
kind of take that desire that we all
have to be connected on screens all at
once and allow us to also be together I
wonder though if the whole point I'm
sitting at the table is because I'm like
texting I'm not going to be texting you
or whoever I think this is bringing us
together so that we don't have to
because I work and also do different
things on different corners of it I just
think it points to a future use case
maybe this one's not perfect divided
million dollars I would buy this rising
tackle and you know what's cool about it
is that it doesn't come in this Tino
table it that they built specifically
for this and it had like a thing that
moves and then it's like an actual
coffee table and then it opened I would
buy that and the coffee table that game
with him you want your gadgets will get
to this but you want your gadgets to
basically be your furniture and I she
loves that Samsung super HD OLED 4k TV
that comes in this cage it's like the
best TV that came out is that yeah do I
have that I have a picture of that let
us show really quick a picture of the
damn some salmon 85 s 9 ultra HD to look
at it it's beautiful Zealand Stanley
actually we took pictures next to it I
know I'm really bad at driving well I'm
going to talk about this because that
stand that is around that TV that looks
like a cage or like a bird cage or an
easel or a scaffold and so that is divvy
it has like the TV knobs on the sites
you can tilt it the actual speakers are
on the cage of the thing so if you can
disassemble it from the family who's
calling it a cage and I call it
beautiful art you can you know
disassemble it from its beautiful art
and then hang it on the wall but then
you need like its own and you'd have to
buy an expensive sound system to go with
it because those are the speakers for
the television so I think it's whew
that's one of the things you would buy
if you had all the money in the world
this is a us in front of that thing
doing art typically thing absolutely not
I hate that yeah zine aesthetic is
offensive that rat alone
ammerman the look of the room that he
even loves a study zone looks like a
bear but is maybe a monkey that I don't
what I wish if you're on Twitter right
now tell us what that animals yeah what
I know about it but I took a class on
monkeys ones and I really don't
understand I really somebody gets
paralyzed like a monkey yeah that is it
anyway we love i love emily is
unimpressed with this thing okay so the
other thing we would i would buy is that
curved TV the Samsung curved TV yes I
have a paper absolutely no a beautiful
look at her Oh what good at this I'm
doing here luck here's the curve TV you
can't really see it what I thought was
really cool about this is that it
doesn't even really need a stand because
of the curve of it building itself up
which is kind of brilliant and it has a
really good side viewing angle which
which is pretty amazing I don't know why
you would have a house in which sitting
directly like this makes a difference
because if you're watching TV you're not
sitting on the side well I was really
snarky about it when we saw it but then
I kept not being able to take my eyes
off of it and it really soothes me
something about the the wrapping round
shape of it was really like womb-like
and I really wanted I don't know if I
want my TV to be womb light you don't
because is it your no you know what i
noticed when i was walking around the
floor when I was seeing all these OLED
TVs all these 4k TVs like part of it was
the actual screen was gorgeous and
wonderful and part of it was the
animations that they would put on these
things like unreal it was like Iron Man
and the engines thanks to the fact
loadings TV technologies for K is not
really that big of a deal unless you
have content that can take control of it
and optimize it and use it and so when
you're these people when samsung
panasonic LG are showing off their TVs
at CES they have made sure to have
images that make it look as crisp as
possible then we go out and spend eleven
thousand dollars on one of these
television right and it was no wat up
chefs top chef yeah and like low res
because you don't want to pay comcast
been sipping america's next top model
which I don't need to see him for Kate
you thought you'd be like on Maura bye
yeah and then so
I don't know I don't know what the point
of my of the 4k erection is just yet
let's talk about how you want to buy the
razor gaming edge razor edge is the
tablet that swept the best of the best
of see out somewhere you pull it up oh
here's that let me um it swept our
awards and people's voice every like you
you guys absolutely said that it was
your favorite thing people in the chat
rooms and in the comments of our hands
on are just going crazy for this because
not only is it a full-fledged Windows 8
tablet and it works great but it also
has these actual physical controllers
yeah so it's a yoke that you can put it
in so that you can use it like a regular
gaming console you can also come comes
with a dock it also comes with a you
know where you can plug in regular
controllers in it comes with another dog
that you can use as a computer like it's
the most versatile thing I've ever seen
I love it for the gaming I think that
yoke is awesome i love to her I mean
love that you love love and I respect
that you love it I hate gaming so I just
don't get it look at how beulah me and I
want to buy this for like my brother so
they got it got the best of CES word it
got the you know people's voice award it
got I think we even saw a prototype of
it last year which I think well I loved
and then gaminguys from cnet dan
ackerman and Scott Stein and rich brown
last year said this thing is half-baked
it's not ready but we love where it's
going and then this year when they saw
it the kinks had been worked out and
it's just it's almost ready and I can't
wait it's great how much do you think
this thing is gonna cost I have no idea
but I know that you're going to buy it
absolutely and because of my obsessive
gambling habit this year oh yeah and if
only you would one in Vegas you could
have afforded it but how much did you
lose let's take a break for a couple
minutes and we will come back to more of
the things that we saw this year on the
show floor or it was 100 mb five dollars
okay thanks hi
you
and we're back with rumor has it live at
CES 2013 on the last day of the show I
am Emily Dreyfus and i'm korean TV and
every time we say 2013 I can't even
believe that it's 20 I mean I can't
believe act like you just said that
wrong also do you realize that we've
spent this entire year so far at CES all
of 2013 as it is existed and actually
the only innovate actually feels like it
and since what happens in Vegas stays in
Vegas it's like this didn't even happen
at all okay don't you know you know I
can't believe we're recording this right
now no this isn't recording this is a
dream land speaking of that yes I would
you what would you like to do first my
Hummer offload get I want to get all of
my chest cream all of the low points
okay past six days of wandering around
the Michigan of this here's like good
news about the Michigan which means
crazy if you don't happen to know if
you're not yet but look the best part
about the low parts or what they weren't
that loan yeah directly still us also
they were still my favorite parts yeah
yeah okay so let's run him down um one
of the most depressing parts for me was
when I finally trekked to the north hall
yes and when I got in there I had all
these really high hopes cuz i wanted to
see the little gadgets that i can
actually afford and then i could
actually buy and put in my pocket and
that i would go crazy make me happy and
instead I was just inundated with a sea
of what seemed like hideous hideous
iphone cases you but then the problem
with that is that your phone is on the
brink of falling out every time i see
you on your phone without its case it
makes me like a kitten loses its wings
or one case i have an iphone 5 that is
not in a case and that is because it's a
beautiful piece of technology that
should not be hidden behind some hideous
but did you see the result there was a
lego iphone case then you could build
like is a seven-year-old boy I thought
that was maybe the coolest thing I see
it though sorry I know that's really
because everybody loves Legos and I love
Legos too but I don't want that on my
iPhone okay trust but you're right my
iphone is going to break it ok so here
was my low point of
show was that I everything that I saw I
was like man and I don't know if that is
because I'm so jaded because I do this
every day I don't know if that's because
the technology like stock I don't know I
see you're not impressed Bei here I saw
so I saw this 4k camera and that is what
I said this is like that's what I looked
about what at this 4k camera and in it
like if you could see kind of to the
behind where it says live video that was
actually it was recording that clock
yeah and I like looked at it didn't get
it so you can see on the screen it says
live video and then there's the clock
and you can see all the masa nations of
this like machine works was not I just
could I think my eyes are bad well our
eyes are bad that is I'm like I think my
eyes are bothersome but I went Stephanie
have for center and rescheduling is it
just the we're myopic and we don't get
it and he's like no no one can see it ya
know so i think that like technology
that was it just it's it's disappointing
so that was a low light for me um let me
let me go to our next you it please take
it away can I talk about your gambling
problem or do you wanted to talk about I
use cable see if you keep calling it a
gambling problem oh I'm like oh yeah
Emily look better on the best of CES
award she's not texting me while we're
rigging I know like I had to call my
bookie my dollar scholar I mean the
truth is she's not going okay fine I
admitted it I have a gambling addiction
my mom is like calling graceless I don't
know what a nice don't worry mom like
room hey all right know the true low
light I want to skip to the actual I
think like not in all serious low light
of the show for me okay which was the
Qualcomm keynote opener so let's so gory
have a pic I wish we had a picture we
don't so there's nothing show here and
it's actually for the better no you
don't want to see it you would be
horrified so I explained it so we both
do theater and so we saw this it really
hit home because
felt like we were at a middle school
production of like or people talking to
middle school students yeah i know ii
like this is o an old age home had
decided to bring in a middle school
theater troupe yes and had said so that
they could show the old people what
youth was alright i just felt bad
because these tweens these people do i'm
sure they were very nice people I feel
like they actually we're in their late
20s perhaps I mean well that's what I
lease which is part of the problem and
then the impersonated youth in America
and I will admit that I am about to be
30 years old people so I am not anymore
in the youth of America this is I am
aging before you that is what you're
seeing right here so perhaps I'm just
bitter but these people were trying to
tell us what youth and what youth was in
their estimation was talking like oh my
god talking like me yeah and then there
we connect the guy in the be me who was
like and I'm a gamer and this is gaming
boomer I mean it was I everyone's eyes
were horrified and he said Twitter they
said tweet except connected and they
can't live without Twitter it was really
it just broke my heart it really broke
my heart and then when it was what was
really upsetting about it was then later
Steve Ballmer came on stage and they
state associated him with that right
we're like you're born mobile you're one
of those people that when he's like to
have him in already was like and then I
think he really bought it no I mean I
actually think it was unfortunate
because the idea is fine it's a fine
idea like these kids are actually born
with a smart like with smartphone
technology yeah I didn't have when we
were children that's true they are born
mobile and they are going to be able to
use these apps different and Sharon
Vaknin who is one of the youngest people
who works at cnet is a good example of a
super connected person it's in her DNA
absolutely yes it's true born Mobile's a
great idea I don't have any issue with
that all I have an issue is is insulting
me with terrible dancing horrible
accents right pretending that it youth
if you're young you're an idiot okay
that's it that's it in a nutshell if
you're young you're an idiot you say
every single buzzword having to do with
the Attic doll and you know what I just
I find it insulting because people are
always telling us or telling young
people that they're idiots and in fact
not to get
on you but we're changing the world
people have the apps that you guys are
using were invented by young people and
we're voting in droves like we're a good
generation I don't read diminish the
bourne mobile done generation don't
diminish it with by using buds buzzwords
like connected and game yeah don't buzz
were defy us or that one that was good
one don't buzz word a fire so should we
talk about the highlights now that we've
talked about all the things let's talk
about the highlights I want to show you
the best picture of the highlights is
when we met one direction speaking of it
so it's not up yes I don't at the moment
we took a comment more and then Emily
was like I don't even know who that was
and I was like you're dead to me well I
don't watch rumor has it you know that I
am really not with it when it comes to
pop culture because I don't have a
television so I don't know who honey boo
boo is and everyone always trying to
send me images of honey boo boo so that
I'll learn and I refuse and if you pull
it up on the screen right now you I will
not I won't I shouldn't let me do honey
boo boo um one time in the trailer we
had to look at this is the cnet trailer
that exists in the parking lot we were
kind of stressed out and then we put on
a kitten cam and we watched kittens
probably and it made us so happy that um
Laura kuliah and Jen gave in who we work
with all the time and so we looked at
kittens which really you know what other
highlight for me was when in the middle
of all of the liveblog stress which I'm
sure you guys were not watching from
home like as closely as we were or
perhaps you were and you were loving it
because it was amazing but at one point
we were so stressed we I don't think I
had gotten up from my computer in 12
hours okay and then suddenly the song
build me up buttercup came on I mean so
it's been telling that all of our
highlights had nothing to do with
anything that we saw except maybe that
no okay well the true highlight of cs i
think okay what came from cnet and maybe
i'm biased yeah what are you um but it
came from molly wood and brian Tong when
they were here on this stage doing live
torture testing of devices
they I actually was I almost I know this
is gonna sound ridiculous and crazy and
I'm just emotional but I almost was
teary-eyed I think that I had survived
it Lena came out of the ashes of itself
because it was like in a zillion dunks
it in water yeah and it filled with
water behind the screen to such an
extent that you could see the water when
they made it hurrying out then they took
that waterlogged iPad and dunked it into
liquid nitrogen rights which I was
screaming when they did that I thought
it's gonna explode it's gonna that ice
is gonna the waters in turn to ice it's
gonna explode the glass is going to
shatter write the book beautiful man
with the very interesting facial hair
who was in charge of it is gonna get
injured but that is not what happened
it's not what happened at all instead it
froze and it was freezing and it looked
crazy it was over and Brian's wrong
brave genius that he is climbed atop a
nine foot ladder right and dropped that
thing on its side its side and it is
weighted so perfectly that even when he
dropped it like this so that it could do
nothing but land on its side it didn't
and we were sitting in front of our
monitors like this and we were horrified
okay wait we have a picture of of it we
do oh god I'm really bad at driving this
okay it doesn't matter we have it we had
a picture that you can see on the site
let's say of the iphone ipad of the ipad
cracked its screen completely smashed
and shattered and then you look up close
and that thing is on the little apple
behind the screen is on and it had
actually survived that which means that
you could really take that screen you
can pay a third party person to get a
new screen for you can actually look up
Sharon Vaknin is how to on how to do it
yourself I know and then that thing
would work after all of that so if you
were wondering if you shouldn't buy an
iPad because it couldn't handle it and
you might be like yep too harshly not
only can it handle it it can handle it
in the frozen tundra it can handle it
throwing it off of a building we can
handle it anywhere that you know it's
pretty awesome Riley was found that the
winner of the yes but that was not
allowed no I mean apples not here um
what else was a highlight I feel like we
had a lot of highlights we found a
gibson guitar tent out in the parking
lot where so you could play guitars just
for you know if you wanted to have just
really cool if you wanted to take a look
oh there there that is the ipad let's go
back because me playing guitar is more
embarrassing than a highlight you could
hear that and ok you could did you see
that little apple was on I mean this is
before it even got dropped you can see
that it is freezing over they pull it
out it's like crystal freezing I don't
even I honestly I'm not even an ipad
fanboy look at that guy's facial hair
that's that was a highlight yes this is
what I said about that man he has
absolutely every type of interesting
hair that you can have on a human being
he has a mohawk that's down he's got a
long goatee he's got mutton chops he's
got a mustache he leaked doesn't quit
with all that I was this an ipad mini no
it's an ipad 3 ipad 3 yes and then he
look Molly's Mulligan thanks trading it
I like she's holding it so gently and in
one second they're gonna throw it off of
a nine-fold like we should be playing
like Schindler's List music for it okay
like John Williams is that the yeah look
it was still is still yes yes like very
sad serious music like we don't know
what's gonna happen then I think we
already spoiler alerted you yeah we did
work it was fine sorry but survived but
it's really amazing but it's unreal I
want to talk about what a couple of the
things that we can determine are gonna
happen in the future based on what we
saw at CES okay great I think I'm not so
good you also want to watch him to drop
this all the way okay here we go guys
ready there it is there it is a three
it's happening yeah one drop it
oh no it's shattered into a million
pieces dead and it I still came on but
it is not dead at all yeah it's like
okay here we go I can't I mean I can't
even makes it it is me I know I guess ok
so we um when we were wandering around
yesterday and we were you know we got
lost I hate to say it um we took a
couple pictures of us being lost yeah
because take a look at this we are
showing you a part of cs i don't think
you normally get to see right which is
where um that's us yeah thnkx over that
but they didn't matter the thing to the
boom and the problem is neither of us
knows how to read a map here we just
gave up and so we found where all the
storage containers are but while we were
doing that we were thinking we're
wondering like what is going to come
next year yeah what's going to happen in
the future I think that so there weren't
necessarily rumors at this CES except
for perhaps project Thor which we
thought it was a new nvidia device yeah
but that's not actually i think the code
name for project shield which you guys
know about but some of the things that
we can say looking forward in the future
are going to happen based on what we saw
at CES this year is number one bendable
screen technology bendable screen
technology is let me find a picture
showed it off and it is just
mind-blowing ly awesome why do we need
it what is the use case for it here is a
picture of the bendable screen yeah I
mean you can actually oh yeah that's a
video and you can watch it work no one
has an answer right now for what you're
gonna do with this thing I mean people
say oh you could put it like a strap
around your wrist that's a screen and
then you can type on it i I don't I
think that's so nice that it's kind of
what I think will be interesting as if
they incorporate that into all the
wearable tech that they have been
showing off you know it like those the
pebble watch or the smart whatever is
that Martian watch and then you can
instead of you know a blotch with a band
you could do one of those like snappy on
things for that I love what I actually
still have and then have an entire
screen wrapped around your wrist I think
that's so awesome and I actually
it'll make it so that those watches are
less hideous because right now the
really smart great watches that do some
really amazing things are also kind of
bulky they look a little bit poorly mate
not not completely I mean the pebble is
actually beautiful and the other one
that Brian Bennett loves which I can't I
think it's the basic the bit that's our
that's the basis band which is a band so
look she's like I mean this is a screen
but i think that with this technology
they'll be able to incorporate it around
the watches better so that it'll be made
more beautifully yo that's going to
happen totally the other really awesome
thing that is going to be a reality guys
the future is just about to be here in
one second is this interface that brian
Tong and and some other people at the
show we're playing with which is that a
new way to interact with your computer
where it syncs with your eyes and then
your eyes navigate through your computer
for you without a mouse so the coolest
thing about this is that brian Tong was
playing fruit ninja which is a game
where you you know on the on the
ipad where you swipe fruit and he was
doing it with his eyes which was and it
work unreal how it like it works better
than me doing it with my fingers so i
think it was really cool i think there's
you know it needs to go a little bit
further like seth rosenblatt was saying
that he would love if you could blink
and it opened a nap or you know what i
mean so there there are a couple new
things that it could you in the future
that i think will yeah i think the
implications of this are unreal i think
there'd be so many awesome things that
can happen with this right now you it
can't react to your blinking right is
that you were saying yes yeah so they
need to figure that out um but it's
really really cool okay uh what are the
other things Oh the only thing I think
we can determine from the show is that
3d technology not a thing I have not
seen what there is the LG booth where
they were i think it was similar to last
year where you walk in you put those
glasses on and it's beautiful yeah
things are flying at you whatever
whatever I just don't see it happening
anymore i think 4k is the new three day
yeah and no it's just that 3d did not
take off even the 3d tvs we saw one LG
TV where we were playing a 3d game on it
and it was true looked at me
it did look like it was coming right at
me it didn't make me feel nauseous it
was really cool everything about it was
awesome but no one cared nobody cared at
all there was like seven people in that
area and they were only trying to get to
the other two the OLED yeah we're k
oulad everything oh and then the other
thing that I think we can glean and what
happened to us at this show is that the
next wedding that you guys go to is
you're going to see you know how we go
to weddings now the real the thing
that's in is a photo booth yes and
everyone goes into the little photo
booth and they take pictures right and
then you can have a photo booth as
yourself at this wedding right ok the
next iteration of that is going to be
this thing called insta print which
you've probably had heard of it wasn't
announced here it just was here and how
much interest there wasn't it was really
shocking to me and that is you can take
your phone and you can hashtag something
on Instagram using a certain hashtag and
it will print out from this wall mounted
printer a little beautiful miniature in
one second yeah when 30 seconds later I
had three pictures of my cats in a
picture of you yeah I printed out
awesome yeah it was me and then it comes
out stickers knows little you do you
know and and what you do is you rent it
out for parties and I hopefully in the
future would be the type of thing that
you can buy on your own and just have a
meeting with lumber which it costs if it
was a trees sure na macol it was like
five thousand dollars for half a day it
literally was $5,000 yeah but when you
rent it you have to also rent the man
who comes with it to run right and who
knows how much he costs I know and he
better be handsome and dress and isolate
your wedding its gene munster
everybody's monsters sold molding gosh
all right guys well one thing I also
just wanted to let you know before we
wrap up is that there's really good news
today there was a concern you remember
this that there was going to be an
asteroid that was going to hit the earth
in two thousand and thirty six and
NASA's been very concerned about it and
they've been playing it down on NPR
because they didn't want to alarm us
that there was Armageddon right but just
FYI don't worry nASA has determined it's
not going to hit us thank God so we're
going to live yeah well there is one day
when every single
well Cena editor was in one space yes in
the trailer and I was like this is the
day it's going to happen it's and now
wont happens in don't worry so we're
good all right thank you guys so wait
before before we ends we put out on
Twitter this morning if anybody had any
Twitter questions we got one response oh
great and it was actually a pretty good
question are we going to see any desktop
oriented oulad monitors in 2013
definitely definitely absolutely
definitely we already saw a 4k a tablet
tablet so I think only the 4k monitor
they came out here at CES yes and a
 monitor I think an oulad and
then all at 4k monitor is up next I'm
just sure I'm will anyone care will
anyone be able to tell the difference no
I want to stop talking about 4k I mean
the thing to like by export k2 you
really can't see it when it's small it's
it's even harder to see when it's small
so that's the one of the reasons why the
TV's come in 80 inches Fran 110 inches
is because that way you can actually
appreciate the reality of it so yeah
it'll happen will be worth it probably
not i wish i believe for 110 inch
television michi let's let's get a
mansion it would be no problem ok but
guys thank you so much for joining us we
had so much fun rumor has it we had so
much fun at CES 2013 before we go away
we've got brian Tong live standing by
somewhere in the central hall we're
going to be right with him after this
break thank you so much
