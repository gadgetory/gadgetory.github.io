I'm Brian Tong and next-gen consoles
I've had over a year to grow up so we're
throwing them back into the prize fight
ring it's a rematch between Sony's
PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox one
our judges for this fight are CNET
senior editor dan the man after man
senior associate editor Jeff Backstreet
Boy Bakalar and you-know-who reeling and
inked Holmes will take all three judges
scores and average them out to the
nearest tenth the final prize fight
score will be an average of all rounds
using the same decimal system round one
is designed
Sony's ps4 is the sleekest console with
an edgy design that you can still pick
up and take to your friend's house and
it still has the best feeling controller
on the market the Xbox one still big
still clunky and that power supply is
still separate now I love the specific
vibration feedback on the controllers
but is just not enough
Sony strikes first with a 4.7 and
Microsoft gets a 3.3 round two is
navigation and interface
Sony's ps4 retains its single bar
interface that's easy to figure out from
the start and we like the quick access
to notifications and updates the Xbox
one still has a lot going on here with
its bold tiles but you have to dive into
layers to do certain tasks there's still
too much going on here and we're curious
if they can make any changes with
Windows 10 rolling out this year now
connects voice control is still here it
can be hit or miss and there's real
multitasking with its snap feature but
how many of you are honestly using it
today not me I disconnected mind plus
the removal of the Kinect as a required
part of the console confirms it's not
that important to Microsoft either the
ps4 takes another round with the four
and the Xbox one gets a three
so after averaging two rounds believe
these big round three is Hardware the
biggest Hardware difference from year
one to year two is the fact that the
Kinect is no longer included or needed
at all for the Xbox one making voice
commands and Skype functionality
optional HDMI pass-through still makes
us more than just a gaming machine to
switch between TV and games both
consoles bring blu-ray players and the
PS Wars real Hardware advantage is
graphical power that runs the same
third-party games at a higher native
resolution at times ps4s remote play is
still a thing with the PS Vita but it's
never been responsive enough for me to
consistently use PlayStation TV these
optimal network conditions to be useful
I returned mine and the only time I use
the PlayStation camera was to scan my
face in NBA 2k15 but people who love
Ustream or twitch streaming won't be
able to go without it
now the Xbox one takes this round with a
3.3 and the ps4 gets a 2.7 next round is
game library
we're just about to hit the flood of
truly next-gen titles that will extend
through 2015 so we're still in a holding
pattern but one big change from last gen
is that it's now the ps4 instead of the
Xbox one that has become the default
choice for many multi-platform games
more people are really gaming with their
friends on the ps4 versus the Xbox one
right now triple-a console exclusives
currently favor the Xbox one with titles
like titanfall Forza 5 and sunset
overdrive that really took me by
surprise the ps4 has infamous second son
The Last of Us remastered and is ramping
up with the order 1886 and uncharted 4
now you can stream games with the
PlayStation now service and play older
titles on the ps4 Xbox Live's games with
gold and the PlayStation Plus a service
brings new games for both monthly but
Sony still has stronger indie developers
one area that the Xbox laxing and Xbox
fans I'm not forgetting about the halo
Master Chief collection but its online
issues killed it for me if you had to
look at it right now we're giving Sony
these slightest of edges if you're
really talking about the overall gaming
picture with a 3.3 and the xbox gets a
three so after four rounds Microsoft had
significantly closed the gap
round 5 is software features in online
services PlayStation Plus and Xbox Live
are pretty much required to get the most
out of your console these days Netflix
Amazon Prime and Vudu live on both to a
streaming is now available on both
consoles but the Xbox offers more media
apps and content while the ps4 has
better social integration with hooks to
Facebook and makes it really easy to
share and stream content Plus Alucard
streaming services are on their way with
Sony's view TV service coming to the ps4
and slings TV service coming to the Xbox
one overall we're calling this one a tie
at four points apiece and the final
round that decides it all is valid
somebody's ps4 system is still the same
399 but the entry-level Xbox one is now
349 you'll still need PlayStation Plus
or Xbox Live Gold for any online gaming
but you can now stream apps and content
without an Xbox membership now right now
the Xbox one is bringing more value and
we've got to give it the edge with the 4
and the PlayStation 4 it gets a three
point seven so let's average out all six
rounds and in this rematch some things
have changed and some things have still
remained the same but it's still the
Sony PlayStation 4 that beats out the
Xbox one three point seven to three
point four and is your prize fight
winner 2015 is going to be a big year
for gaming consoles as they finally grow
up and start showing us what they're
really capable of and really forget the
result the console for you always comes
out what you do and the games you want
to play i'm brian tom thanks for
watching I will catch you guys next time
for another prize fight
