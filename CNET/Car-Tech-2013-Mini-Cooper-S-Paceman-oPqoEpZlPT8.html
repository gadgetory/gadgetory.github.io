rear seats and a turbo but it's not the
standard cooper s this model is called
the paceman whatever that is let's motor
in the 2013 mini cooper s paceman mini
basically makes a one car the Cooper
with a ton of variance this paceman is
the latest in the lineup joining the
standard Cooper the convertible the
clubman the countryman the coop a and
the roadster all of these cars can be
had with the turbocharged s engine this
paceman is the top of the line it's got
the turbocharged engine so it's a cooper
s it's also got minis new all-wheel
drive system now even though it's a
two-door with front and rear seats same
as the standard Cooper it's got a very
different design we got the slanted back
roof here which I guess is kind of
modern looking a little different maybe
they wanted to change it up but it's
also a lot bigger than the standard
Cooper it's a full four inches wider
it's four and a half inches taller it's
also a foot and three inches longer than
the standard Cooper but the seating
arrangement is different so let's take a
look inside and check that out
I'm not crazy about the rear seat
arrangement here mini puts two buckets
instead of a bench that means you can
definitely only fit two passengers back
here between these two buckets get this
railing this is something that many
started putting into the country men and
they put it in this car as well the idea
behind this railing as you can get
accessories like cup holders or cell
phone holders or something that snap
into place it's kind of a goofy idea ah
but you can also fold these rear seats
down maximize your cargo area so that
gives you a little more utility now in
the paceman here we've got the
technology package with navigation so
that puts a screen LCD in the middle of
this big round speedometer that's a mini
signature and we have this nice sort of
an elliptical menu here you control
everything from this little dial down
here there's a button to get to the main
menu we've got navigation here and the
maps I'm not crazy about the look of
these maps they've got these weird sort
of green lines for the streets that make
them look a little I don't know odd and
then we've got our media sources and
here we've got bluetooth streaming audio
and also this ipod connector down here
now this is the bad thing it still uses
this why cable down here so you have an
auxiliary cable plugged into the
auxiliary port ending in a 30-pin
connector so that's an old-style ipod
hookup but we also have this adapter
here i've put in this adapter for my
iphone 5 so i can hook that up it's not
the best setup but that's the only way
to work it but the most unique part of
this technology package is the MINI
Connected feature so i got this mini
connected app on my phone and that means
i can access this part of the menu it's
a little blue globe thing midi connected
and those are all the connected features
and there are a ton of them in this car
for example we've got google search
that's of course the most useful for
navigation i can just punch that up do a
search for you notice about anything and
it'll find all the local businesses that
correspond to that search it's also got
facebook integration and twitter so with
facebook they show your feet on the
screen it's not too distracting because
they don't give you a lot to read they
only have the first little bit of text
from each update and this thing actually
can read
updates out to you I don't know if you
want to sit here listening in to your
car read these various different updates
but what you really use Facebook for is
you can actually post some templated
updates to your own status web radio is
actually a really cool feature here so
this gives you radio stations from
around the world that are broadcasting
on the internet you can even choose
Antarctica see what stations they have
going on there well there's one called a
net station playing folk radio I guess
that's probably one of the Antarctic
base is down there how many connected
has a few other features that are useful
that actually interact with the way
you're driving the car but the one that
I've found recently that is really
interesting is called driving excitement
so the main screen is called the
excitement analyzer and that has a
couple of different gauges here that
show your acceleration your steering and
you actually earn points depending on
how well you do each driving task and if
you look on the phone you can see like
what level you've reached there's also a
series of badges you can earn there's a
badge for acceleration for you're
getting a decent 0 to 60 acceleration we
also have a sports instrument display
which here will show your horsepower and
your torque that's those are gauges you
don't normally get in the instrument
cluster so it's kind of nice to be able
to see that if you want you also have a
force meter which shows how hard you're
taking the car around the corners as a
nice display shows the mini kind of in
the center and drifting to the side as
you're taking the corners and putting
the g-forces on it I mentioned this fact
that this car comes with the automatic
transmission that's a 1250 option comes
standard with 6-speed manual and I would
have referred that it's much more fun
for a mini the 6-speed automatic
transmission isn't too bad we've got
paddle shifters here and uniquely it's
going to more of a BMW mini thing is you
actually instead of having one side be
up once i'd be down you actually pull up
for up shift and push on them for a
downshift this transmission shifts
pretty fast but again the manual be more
fun there's also a sport mode in this
car that's just by flipping this toggle
switch puts it in sport mode put some
transmission in the sport mode and makes
the throttle a lot more responsive
under the hood here we've got this 1.6
liter four-cylinder engine that's pretty
much the same engine that all the
Cooper's have but because it's the
cooper s it's also got direct injection
fuel delivery and a turbo that brings
the power up to 181 horsepower 177
pounds feet of torque those are pretty
decent numbers for this relatively small
car plus on economical engine
interesting enough this is pretty much
the same type of engine I looked at in
the Nissan Juke Nismo last week let's
take this guy on the road you see what I
can do so many confers with me first
came out under a BMW they were really
noted for their go-kart style handling
this car I don't know it's bigger like
it's heavier there's still a good
responsive steering rack here but it
just doesn't have that I would call this
go-kart handling
doesn't have that same feel it's pretty
quick you can have fun with it but i
think the you know the standard mini
hatchback is a little better that way i
also note that this is the cooper s so
we get 181 horsepower that's i think
that's necessary i would never get admit
even out without the s behind the cooper
because he just don't get much power
with the basic engine with a turbo and
direct injection you get much more
efficiency and power it's it's worth it
but one thing that really suffers
someone in this car from the fact that
it comes with a sport-tuned suspension
standard and it's got fairly low profile
tires the ride quality is a little rough
I mean that's supposed to eat the
handling supposed to keep a little more
stable in the corners
really feel a lot of that thing this
roads fairly rough and this does not
feel like that
this morning is supposed to be about
now the base cooper paceman goes for
twenty three thousand nine hundred
delivered this model the cooper s with
the all-wheel drive is twenty-nine
thousand two hundred now to go see that
style you'll want to add the technology
package with navigation that's a
twenty-five hundred dollar option you
can save a little money by shaving off
navigation from that that brings it down
to 1750 all told that's thirty one
thousand seven hundred dollars the
automatic transmission is a 1250 dollar
option I would get the manual
transmission it's a lot more fun and in
fact I would get the standard cooper s
not the paceman because I think that
smaller car is a lot more fun to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
