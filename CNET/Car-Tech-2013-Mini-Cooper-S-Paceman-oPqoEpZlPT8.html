rear seats and a turbo but it's not the
standard Cooper s this model is called
the paceman whatever that is let's motor
in the 2013 Mini Cooper S paceman Mini
basically makes a one car the Cooper
with a ton of variants this paceman is
the latest in the lineup joining the
standard Cooper the convertible the
Clubman the countryman the coupe a and
the Roadster all of these cars can be
had with the turbocharged s engine this
paceman is the top of the line it's got
the turbocharged engine so it's the
Cooper S it's also got minis new
all-wheel-drive system now even though
it's a two-door with front and rear
seats same as the standard Cooper it's
got a very different design we got the
slanted back roof here which I guess is
kind of modern looking a little
different maybe they wanted to change it
up but it's also a lot bigger than the
standard Cooper it's a full four inches
wider it's four and a half inches taller
it's also a foot and three inches longer
than the standard Cooper but the seating
arrangement is different so let's take a
look inside and check that out I'm not
crazy about the rear seat arrangement
here mini puts two buckets instead of a
bench that means you can definitely only
fit two passengers back here between
these two buckets you get this railing
this is something that mini started
putting into the countryman and they put
it in this car as well the idea behind
this railing as you can get accessories
like cupholders or cell phone holders or
something that's snap into place it's
kind of a goofy idea but you can also
fold these rear seats down maximize your
cargo area so that gives you a little
more utility now in the paceman here
we've got the technology package with
navigation so that puts a screen LCD in
the middle of this big round speedometer
that's a mini signature and we have this
nice sort of an elliptical menu here you
control everything from this little dial
down here there's a button to get to the
main menu
we've got navigation here and the maps
I'm not crazy about the look of these
maps they've got these weird sort of
green lines for the streets that make
them look a little
I don't know odd and then we've got our
media sources and here we've got
bluetooth streaming audio and also this
iPod connector down here now this is the
bad thing it still uses this Y cable
down here so you have an auxiliary cable
plugged into the auxiliary port ending
in a 30 pin connector so that's an
old-style
iPod hookup but we also have this
adapter here I've put in this adapter
for my iPhone 5 so I can hook that up
it's not the best setup but that's the
only way to work it but the most unique
part of this technology package is the
mini connected feature so I've got those
mini connected app on my phone and that
means I can access this part of the menu
it's a little out blue globe thing MIDI
connected and those are all the
connected features and there are a ton
of them in this car for example we've
got Google search that's of course the
most useful for navigation I can just
punch that up do a search for you notice
about anything and it'll find all the
local businesses that correspond to that
search it's also got Facebook
integration and Twitter so with Facebook
they show your feed on the screen it's
not too distracting because they don't
give you a lot to read they only have
the first little bit of text from each
update and this thing actually can read
the updates out to you I don't know if
you want to sit here listening to your
car read these various different updates
but what you really use Facebook for is
you can actually post some templated
updates to your own status web radio is
actually a really cool feature here so
this gives you radio stations from
around the world that are broadcasting
on the internet you'd even choose
Antarctica see what stations they have
going on there well there's one called
a net station playing folk radio I guess
that's probably one of the Antarctic
bases down there a mini connected has a
few other features that are useful that
actually interact with the way you're
driving the car but the one that I've
found recently that is really
interesting is called driving excitement
so the main screen is called the
excitement analyzer and that has a
couple different gauges here that show
your acceleration your steering and you
actually earn points depending on how
well you do
each driving task and if you look on the
phone you can see like what level you've
reached there's also a series of badges
you can earn there's a badge for
acceleration for your getting a decent 0
to 60 acceleration we also have a sports
instrument display which here will show
your horsepower and your torque that's
those are gauges you don't normally get
in the instrument cluster so it's kind
of nice to be able to see that if you
want you also have a force meter which
shows how hard you're taking the car
around the corners has a nice display
shows the the mini kind of in the center
and drifting to the side as you're
taking the corners and putting the
g-forces on it alright I mentioned this
fact that this car comes with the
automatic transmission that's a 1250
option comes standard with 6-speed
manual and I would have preferred that
it's much more fun for a mini the
six-speed automatic transmission isn't
too bad we've got paddle shifters here
and uniquely it's gonna s'more of a BMW
mini thing is you actually instead of
having one side be up one side be down
you actually pull up for up shift and
push on them for a downshift this
transmission shifts pretty fast but
again the manual would be more fun
there's also a sport mode in this car
that's just by flipping this toggle
switch puts it in sport mode puts the
transmission in the sport mode and makes
the throttle a lot more responsive
under the hood here we've got this 1.6
liter four-cylinder engine that's pretty
much the same engines of all the
Cooper's have but because this is the
Cooper S it's also got direct injection
fuel delivery and a turbo that brings
the power up to 181 horsepower 177
pound-feet of torque
those are pretty decent numbers for this
relatively small car
it's also an economical engine
innocently enough this is pretty much
the same type of engine I looked at in
the Nissan Juke Nismo last week let's
take this guy on the road and see what
it can do this car it's bigger like it's
heavier there's still a good responsive
steering rack here but it just doesn't
have that I wouldn't call this go-kart
handle doesn't have that same feel it's
pretty quick you can have fun with it
but I think the you know the standard
mini hatchback is a little better that
way
I also note that this is the Cooper S so
we get 181 horsepower that's I think
that's necessary I would never get admit
II without without the s behind the
Cooper because you just don't get much
power with the basic engine with the
turbo and direct injection you get much
more efficiency and power it's it's
worth it but one thing that really
suffers someone in this car from the
fact that it comes with a sport-tuned
suspension standard and it's got fairly
low profile tires the ride quality is a
little rough I mean that's supposed to
aid the handling it supposed to keep it
a little more stable in the corners but
and really a lot of this routes fairly
rapid this does not feel like that
is supposed to be
now the base Cooper paceman goes for
23900 delivered this model the Cooper S
with the all-wheel Drive is twenty nine
thousand two hundred now to go seen that
style you'll want to add the technology
package with navigation that's a twenty
five hundred dollar option you can save
a little money by shaving off navigation
from that that brings it down to
seventeen fifty all told that's
thirty-one thousand seven hundred
dollars the automatic transmission is a
$1,250 option I would get the manual
transmission it's a lot more fun and in
fact I would get the standard Cooper s
not the paceman because I think that
smaller car is a lot more fun too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
