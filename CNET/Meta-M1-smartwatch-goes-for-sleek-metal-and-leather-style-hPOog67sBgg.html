SmartWatch possibly be well what I'm
wearing on my wrist might be at the top
of the heat this is the meta m1 and its
aim is to look good now it works with
Android and iOS and this SmartWatch is
not running Android wear but it does
have a very basic set of notifications
that soured a little bit like a pebble
and the design may kind of look like a
diesel watch it may kind of look like a
fossil watch but metas partners and
founding founding partners actually spun
off from the fossil group so that's no
accident this design is the main front
and center reason to buy one of these
it's stainless steel there are a number
of leather and rubber strap accessories
that you can put on this and you can
pick very various colors the price
ranges from $250 to $450 so this is not
inexpensive but much like the pebble
it's got a battery life that's on the
higher end more like a four day five day
type of battery life its screen is
pretty primitive that's the one weak
point you're talking about an LCD screen
that's high reflective but it doesn't
have any touch and it has six buttons
here that access a bunch of specialized
apps you can get the weather you can get
sports scores in the future you will be
able to potentially do fitness tracking
doing step counting right now it's also
got notifications and also calendar
connectivity so you can see your
calendar info you can see notifications
like on a pebble watch and it works
pretty easily the app also allows you to
filter things with a meta filter to pick
which ones you do not want to be spammed
on to your watch
pretty similar to a pebble so why do you
get one of these kind of sounds like a
pebble and that's the problem the meta M
one is gonna have its own competition
laid out there and products not only
with Android wear but future stuff down
the road from Apple and others to
compete with as well but if this ends up
in stores with a good enough battery
life and designs that are like these
maybe they would catch on I'm Scott
Steinmetz a look at the meta m1 here on
my wrist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
