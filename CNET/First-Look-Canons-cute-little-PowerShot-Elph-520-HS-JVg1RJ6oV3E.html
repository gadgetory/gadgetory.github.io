was seen it and this is a look at the
Canon PowerShot ELPH 520 HS it's an
adorable ultra compact camera packing a
12 X zoom lens in a very tiny body now
to make it so small canon switch to a
hard to handle micro SD card for storage
and a small battery with disappointing
battery life Canada also squished the
controls on back and made them very
small making it somewhat difficult to
take advantage of all the camera
shooting options which are plentiful
photo quality is good - very good but
overall disappointing compared with past
HS model elves even at its lowest ISO
settings subjects can look very soft and
noisy at larger sizes and it also gets
noticeably worse at and above ISO 400 so
not the greatest in low-light now the
quality is still slightly better than a
smartphone's camera as is its shooting
performance so if you're just looking to
do better than your phone and what a
tiny cute camera with the long lens and
don't mind paying extra for it go nuts
and if you've got another 50 dollars and
would like built-in Wi-Fi for photo
sharing and backup look for the elf 530
HS for the money you also get a
touchscreen which times is just as
frustrating to use as the tiny buttons
on the 520 but it does make it a little
easier for passwords and such I'm Josh
Goldman and that's the Canon PowerShot
ELPH 520 HS and it's Wi-Fi enabled line
mate the 530 HS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
