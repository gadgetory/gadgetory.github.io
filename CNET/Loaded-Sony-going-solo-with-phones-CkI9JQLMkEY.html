Bridget Carey on sina com and it's time
to get loaded sony ericsson phones such
as the Xperia line of Android phones
will now simply be Sony phones sony paid
one point 47 billion to ericsson to take
so ownership of the phone line that adds
their tenured joint venture sony's chief
executives said consumers can expect
better integration between Sony's phones
and their other devices like televisions
laptops and tablets a new report on
internet trends says we've gone beyond
the PC era the majority of real-time
entertainment being consumed online is
going to our TVs game consoles set-top
boxes tablets and smartphones and less
than half is being consumed on desktop
and laptop computers Netflix is leading
the trend in North America followed by
basic web sites and YouTube in third and
speaking of YouTube the site will soon
launch its own dedicated channels
offering shows that are exclusive to
YouTube The Wall Street Journal is
reporting YouTube has made numerous
deals with media companies such as News
Corp and famous personalities like Tony
Hawk and they'll be creating about 20
premium channels with several hours of
content each week this would be the
first time YouTube is making its own
content instead of relying on third
parties to drive traffic YouTube is not
officially commented yet though on the
plans a class-action lawsuit has been
filed in Canada against research in
motion the company behind blackberry the
reason being blackberry customers were
not reimbursed for the time they
couldn't connect when service was out
two weeks ago blackberry is currently
offering a hundred dollars worth of free
blackberry apps for customers to
download to make up for those service
issues researcher motion is not having a
great month it also just announced it's
delaying the upgrade to the PlayBook
operating system until februari it's not
this month as first announced and we'll
wrap up things today with some music
news the British band coldplay has
forbid its latest record from being
available on streaming music websites
like Spotify Rdio and rhapsody although
their record label EMI seems to be
scratching their head over why they're
against dreaming after all bands get
paid every time a song
heard on these services and coldplay
isn't the only one Tom Waits is also not
putting his album on streaming sites and
you can't find Adele's best-selling
album 21 on Spotify it's like Metallica
and Napster all over again except it's
not because no one is stealing music but
hey if it makes you happy keep on
fighting the good fight you cool
rebellious musicians those are your
headlines for today I'm Bridget Carey
