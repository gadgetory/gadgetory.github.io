of candy stripers at a San Francisco
hospital amazon is going to start making
their own movies this year will tell you
how and why and an old timey radio turns
into a super cool podcasting machine no
time travel unfortunately tomorrow daily
greetings citizens with the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I'm your
host Ashley Scott i joined me on a
Monday wait a minute you are not kale or
you shave your head and you look totally
different I got much better looking oh
so true this is brian bishop you guys
Brian kill sick want wha get well soon
kale get well soon or don't I'll be here
tomorrow that's it I you know what not I
wouldn't i wouldn't complain I'd be
bummed a little bit cuz I love hanging
out with kale but right you seemed like
an alright guy I'm a pretty awesome
podcasting machine to that is true I you
know old timey radio or brian bishop
ultimate podcasting machine no not
really sure i think it's an even match
just kidding get well soon kale yes get
well soon kill um but until then we have
some really fun stories to talk about
and you just before we hit the headlines
you do the film ball I do so we've got
some really interesting stories
regarding film in podcast yes we're
gonna rely on my film expertise and a
story about Amazon's original
programming yeah films super good so
let's hit the headlines so we here
tomorrow daily love robots as always
it's a monday we love robots every day
of the week but this i thought was very
cool 25 autonomous robots are going to
be rolled out at the UC San Francisco
Medical Center in mission bay on
februari first okay so these are them
here they are right here I we've seen
this before there's actually a hundred
and about 160 hospitals in the US that
kind of employee robots they had they
already have robots kind of like this
but UC San Francisco is the first to
deploy a fleet this large okay 25 is the
most they've ever most any hospitals
seen deployed at once so the cool thing
about these is that they're tasked for
delivery and taking things around the
hospital so they can do food they can
deliver food to patients they can pick
up food trays and take them away once
the patient's done eating they can
interact with six of the hospital's 20
elevators which is pretty awesome they
can interact with an elevator how
advanced yeah like they can tell it like
exactly what floor needs to go to and
all that other good stuff and the neat
thing is it so here it is it's okay well
they're going to put food in there and
then it takes it to the room and then
there's your food it also interacts with
the pharmacy ok so you the pharmacy can
put in some medication say we need you
to take this lab or this other pharmacy
with this patient or this patient and
then at but nurses specific nurses are
only able to open it with a pin code and
biometrics wow there's actually like a
there it is a little fingerprint scanner
there that'll open the the lock so that
they can get those medications out so
that way nobody's running around
stealing drugs from robots in a horse
you don't want that so taking candy from
a baby robot at that oh that's exactly
right drug candy from a baby robot um I
don't see this robot transforming into
anything at what point do they transform
and start battling evil uh you know
actually I think that is in the two
point oh ok ok so we have to wait on
that this is an early version early
version one point oh ok uh but these are
super fastening and I love the idea that
they were saying a lot of people I'm
sure are concerned about the idea that
well these are taking away jobs from
people in the hospital but I really
liked that i read that other the people
who were tasked with delivering those
supplies before have actually just been
moved in a new position i was gonna say
someone's got to refill the medication
summer got to clean the robot someone
has to reprogram the robots when it
comes time to change the software update
whoever so maybe it increases the number
of jobs right it won't also potentially
I really like that frees up time for for
example somebody who could be taking
care of a patient yes instead of running
something back and forth to a lab or
whatever so I I thought that was pretty
cool i like said 160 hospitals about
already have robots but this is a really
big plate there's 25 yeah you really hit
the nail on the head with the personal
interaction is someone who spent a
little bit of time in hospitals recently
over the last few years nothing beats
the personal interaction when
something's really going wrong or you
have a question or you're scared or
nervous or whatever you know I thought
well the robots helpful for delivering
you know if to get your whatever to you
on pain meds to do the sort of you get
this to me on time whatever but when you
want to ask a question or have some
expertise or whatever you don't want to
be waiting for that nurse or that dr. be
seeing five other patients who have some
menial thing like please deliver this or
pray or whatever or take this lab down
or take you know take these samples down
to the lab it's like okay well have the
robot do that as opposed to an automated
that stuff yeah automate the
automate the stuff the menial stuff that
we don't need doctors and nurses doing
so I see a really interesting stuff but
what equally is interesting just on a
different in a different industry amazon
had some very interesting news today so
Amazon was a big winner at the Golden
Globes Bay they won best original comedy
series TV and they won best TV actor in
a comedy series for a trend sentence and
Jerry Chris very well either we don't
want to give transcendent any awards go
to be around cuz you're willing or fancy
it couldn't be more of the opposites out
of the quality scary at second
transparent now transparent and of
course Jeffrey Tambor and amazon
announced they're gonna be releasing
12-3 optical films this year they're
getting into the fiat they're gonna
become a production house they're gonna
start producing vehicle move along
movies lose you confirm the theater
which apparently will be available to be
streamed on amazon prime within forty
eight weeks of being in the theater
which such a good idea quicker than
usual months that it takes for a film to
right well it's like oh it's six months
like you see a movie and then it comes
out on DVD six to eight months later
yeah so the the controversy i think is
going to come from the the exhibitors
the theater is basically we're saying
what's the incentive for people to come
see a movie here if they're gonna see it
in their home and just four weeks right
it's a legitimate complaint i mean i
don't know about you I go to the movies
a lot I actually in one of those
old-time you guys who likes to go to the
theater and I like the experience but
you can't beat the convenience of
watching a movie at home that's true but
I think that I think that you actually
made your own made it another point
there which is well thank you you love
the experience of going to movie and I
think a lot of people will still feel
that way and say I hope so and say I
really want to go to these really big
kind of event movies like I think a lot
of people still are gonna go to these
event movies these experience it was
like like Avengers yes you're not gonna
your orders 8 you know what I'm gonna
take a pass this right that's a
theatrical experience that's an
experience and I think that there's
something to be said for Amazon really
kind of picking up the baton of indie
filmmaking because they did say i love
this quote that they're saying they're
looking for unique stories voices and
characters and they want to get those
things from top and up-and-coming
creators so not only are they going to
be looking at you know really famous you
know directors and writers and things
but they're also going to be looking at
people who maybe
aren't getting looked at by traditional
Hollywood studio I think so but back to
the Avengers in one second put it put a
pin in that okay they got Ted hope
apparently to run the theatrical
division who is the independent producer
executive producer known for movies such
as American Splendor 21 grams
Adventureland he did a great documentary
called the devil and daniel johnston
these are all fantastic alright movie so
he has the pedigree he's a legitimate
guy in the independent world of movies
so if he's got the eye for those kinds
of movies they could start pumping out
some quality materials yeah and I think
that they're really feeling bold right
now because of the Golden Globes wins I
think they'll have less good on some
good of eliciting yeah absolutely and
and one of the things that I thought was
very interesting as kind of a bullet
point to this is both netflix and amazon
have a huge data they have a huge data
cache of information about what their
viewers see what they want to see who
they want to see when they want to see
it i mean it they have that all of this
data that may be Hollywood studios it's
a little harder for them to collect
because we're impossible or impossible
because it's because it's not on the
scale and it's not at the frequency that
people are watching on netflix and
amazon so I find this very fascinating
that you know maybe amazon is gonna
start taking some risks that traditional
Hollywood wouldn't but it's not really
that much of a risk because they have
the data to back it up it's just like
house of cards I think that's very true
i think that amazon getting into this
kind of business is good i think it's
one more sign that the movies now this
show is for and by nerds so people love
the avengers and all that stuff but i
think i just feel like the sequels and
and and the spin-offs and the prequels
and all that stuff it's a routing the
quality of these movies like The
Avengers where there's no there's no
danger it doesn't have to be I'm not
going to get killed in iron man two
trust me no one's dying in iron man 2
because they're asked me in Iron Man 3
and an iron me up so the fact that they
keep pumping out these movies and expect
us to get just as excited about them
every time it feels like we need a look
it just feels having a little bit of new
blood in these movies and I think the
Amazons of the world this is a good
opportunity yes a good opportunity um so
that brings us to our hashtag of the day
which is TV amazon and i just want to
know what you guys out there think of
amazon getting into theatrical
production I mean are you guys are you
guys more inclined now that you know
amazon let's say they make a movie are
you more inclined to see it in the
theaters or do you say you know i'm just
gonna wait because i have an animus on
prime membership I'll wait six weeks I
mean how do you think you'll use the
service I what they should do it is
interesting i'm starting in Rupp what
they should do is they should offer
discounts for feeder tickets to Prime
members that would be amazing then they
can movies yeah I would totally go to
the movies more often get a five dollar
ticket if you get a five dollar ticket
if you use your amazon prime membership
yeah and then and then see it for free
six weeks later on your television or
you know on roku free rental or
something yeah super good I like that I
like that idea that's why thank you
you're welcome amazon you're welcome
just take that that feather in your help
you're welcome and clearly they're
struggling so much i mean i don't know
if they're gonna make it through 2015
lastly are I I thought this was so cool
you are podcaster I have dabbled in
podcasting as well this guy Roderick man
loves the thrilling adventure hour okay
so if you've ever not heard the
thrilling adventure hour this is a
podcast that replicates old-timey radio
serials and they have different stories
like beyond belief and Marshall are I'm
sorry Sparks Nevada Marshall on Mars and
this guy took an old an old golden tone
radio 1936 golden on radio vintage um so
you can see it looks like a just a
normal radio looks like a lot of time
you're ready take an old-time your radio
big box radio you'd like those are like
furniture for people there's a dis yuge
a big display visa so the cool thing is
is that he actually turned this into a
podcast player can iPod docking station
it's a little bit more complicated than
that so he wanted to keep like instead
of you having to open it put an iPod in
all this stuff he wanted to be able to
program his own playlists and change the
actual dial okay different playlists it
trains the frequency so let's say you
have a beyond belief let's say you love
thrilling adventure hour so that you
make your own playlist for all of the
beyond beliefs all of the sparks nevada
all of all the film bolts all film
vaults I'm all of the all the different
podcasts that you listen to and then
what he did was he used this thing
called a BeagleBone black to store and
play those shows in different playlists
and as you turn the dial to each quote
station it actually makes the
the changing sound like the static and
the fuzz and then in that it fades in
the next play okay of Parker that is a
needlessly elaborate needlessly
elaborate but so but very cool yes so so
cool almost everything that is
needlessly elaborate is cool that is
true I will I will go that far and say
that is true um and I just I really like
that he used like everything in the back
of this is modern technology yeah so
he's got um this is the back of it right
here this is what it looks like from the
back which is crazy oh it's just a
facade Oh was the open obvious it's yeah
that's what it opened so he so he was
saying if there's enough interest that
he would make boards that you could just
slide into things like this and your own
design everyone look of your own face do
you can't stream podcasts you can't just
like choose one and stream it like you
would on your phone and you can't
download them directly you have to
actually load them into this vigal bone
black okay to play playoffs but they
have to be loaded in as playlist to work
with the radio dial okay I gotcha but
really cool that's a very cool idea
listen anyway that people can access and
listen to podcasts is fine by me we're
all for that we are because people
brought up like Oh cereals so popular
you are you jealous or air what are your
thoughts on that and my whole thing was
like hey whatever get some more get out
into the podcast pool that's a great
thing and there's only 12 serials I mean
you could have right there's only 12 of
those there's a bunch of everything
bunch of everything I mean you could
listen to film ball non-stop just what
you really should be doing a long time
and then and you would never need to
like start over again yeah cereal it's
like 12 hours you're done it's over
speaking of static you realize that it's
not gonna be long before if kids have no
idea what static is or was yeah super
weird looking at stuff like that i dial
tones dial-up internet they're like what
is that weird sound of this making yours
like you don't remember that sound like
lost crazy we're gonna have to come up
with a new joke or a new way to end
phone calls in movies you know it's like
clinic hello hello paper and I gosh I'm
sorry you're breaking up like uh well
like if you got hung up on with the
movies would be like dial tone like
hello hello I think she hung up on me
it's like what I got something
completely new now you just like talk
for ten minutes and you realize no one
no one's been on the other line let's
make a movie about people realizing when
they've been hung up on and we'll put
you to Amazon and I love in theater and
the Opera Stewart system
are because she has that real straight
like emotionless face you know if she's
happy or sad yeah it's just like you
don't know that you can hung up on it's
the same so um well on that note we're
going to take a quick break we'll be
right back with a really awesome back of
your hackett I don't care how dorky you
guys think it is and your user feedback
so don't click away it's tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show uh every week
we like to do this thing on Mondays
where we talk about crowdfund okay
there's a lot of really good ones yes
they're kind of weird some most a lot
does the majority they're kind of weird
majority sort of bizarre okay um but uh
but I i I'm really curious to see what
you think of this one I saw it and I got
very excited but some people might find
it super dorky so that might be you I so
this is backorder Hackett
all right we're gonna see if this is
brian bishop approve okay this is called
wait for it the foot hammock all right
so far so good so far i love hammocks
any kind of hammock cuz if you sleep in
it on a tree this is actually designed
for your desk so here's the we've all
been there okay I've lived this I lived
this this morning before I even saw this
stupid thing yeah I was resting my feet
on my subwoofer underneath my desk and I
was getting really uncomfortable just
like this guy what prints on the walls
oh just fidgety and you can ever know
and this guy's got a foot hammock look
at that and he's playing World of
Warcraft um so yeah this is the foot
hammock it is set up they have these
adhesive kind of stickies that you put
underneath your desk and then there's
some bungee cables and hooks that allow
you to set up this foot hammock they
give you a couple options there's a mesh
or fleece option okay there's also even
a heated option oh you did fleece and I
think they're stretch goals if they
reach a hundred thousand dollars you get
it you get like a cover so you can like
put your feet in and then it's cold tuck
them in like like the quarterback hand
warmer this you know well yeah exactly
it's just like that so there it is it's
all at you know there's hooks and they
DS got the elastic it rates up to a
hundred pounds so it can it can hold
your legs you're gonna be fine oh god
you'd have to have four pretty strong
adhesive yeah he said sprint like he's
gonna hang on it oh so there you go so
it's a pretty strong adhesive it goes
right underneath your desk you put it in
there you can actually tighten these up
and make it flat so yeah he's gonna do
that so you can hide it pretty easily
which is nice if you don't want it just
you know hanging underneath your desk
going to adjust to your level of comfort
yeah of course and then the one thing I
really like about it is you can always
see people like moving their legs from
like a bent to straight and it just
keeps your foot in there and then you
don't have to worry about you know
readjusting and also okay so aight guys
i totally back this this morning like I
you I paid money I'm like I'm in sign me
up I don't even I'm not even gonna think
about there it is look their job right
there it's a magnetic covery stuff your
feet in there that is a cover I was only
kind of in until I saw the heating
option and then it was like why not I
mean it seems like a really good idea it
does and i don't know i mean the
marketing it towards gamers is one thing
but there's a big platform for this in
like offices in corporate
chapters because what's is uncomfortable
yeah all my wife works at a desk job and
she works in a place that I was like you
know slate floors and it's not very warm
or it gets cold and this would be a
great way to put your friend plus I
imagine you're an exception today but a
lot of women we're not go sockless yeah
they go sockless to work and if you want
to kick off your shoes and relax your
feet a little bit you don't have to
worry about people smelling your feet
you know stuff them in though yeah you
got the cover and a mic and put the
cover on this book your people yeah cook
them you're gonna barbecue here today
who's roasting feet yeah oh that's me
I'm sorry everybody that's me I'm
roasting my feet that smell a roast foot
it's my bad yeah I'm gonna be done soon
you bring a triangle hey I'm go guys
dinner time um so like I said mesh her
fleece heated options ships in june of
this year so not too far out it's not
like oh it's a year away which I was
like and then if you want to get a mesh
one it starts at twenty bucks if you
want a fleece one it's 30 if you want a
heated one I think it's 40 which is the
1i backed yeah I go for the bit I go big
or go home myself but ham again treat
yourself treat your tootsies yeah treat
treat yo feet that's what you gotta do
go so you gotta do that's a good one ok
so what my options are back it back in a
racket and hack it is is somehow bad
Hackett is like oh like hack attack with
uh okay with a hacksaw yeah yeah no I'm
gonna back this one all right good I
know that I would use it but I know many
people who would to back 'it's from me
and brian bishop of the film ball it's
really this good it's really good all
right i'll not know you guys we got to
talk about you it is time for your user
feedback last thursday we asked you guys
used hashtag TD power and tell us what
old device you would use to kind of
jerry rig up something new and exciting
with modern technology and you guys
really came up with some good ones i
love this one from daniel he says I want
Tiger handhelds with storage support I
loved them what if I could have 40 games
on one Tiger handheld it beat you you'll
be living in a utopia that's that does
seem like the definition of heaven that
actually seems like that would be a
really I want one yeah I get your tiger
hanton i would also back that just FYI
if you came up with that really good
Lance wrote in and said I'd easily take
the old virtual boy and prevent the
headache
it willfully provided everyone with
power glove drive laying down most of
those words didn't make sense to me but
I appreciate his passion enthusiasm I
think I think yeah dr laying down out
like that so your virtual boy like you
basically take away the headaches you
just lay down then they just strut with
the power glove you just drive your cars
you're laying down okay see okay so it's
good see you don't know black yeah you
just you checking out like what's going
on out your windshield hey-soos wrote to
us and said get an old brick cell phone
and turn it into a smart phone infinite
battery power and guaranteed
self-defense you be like Zack Morris but
nerdy like the perfect man yeah that
would be really good morning Zack Morris
but also kind of nerdy yeah i love the
infinite battery power and guaranteed
self-defense yes you could really hurt
somebody with a giant with a battery
that side on that size you'd be remiss
not to use a huge long-lasting battery
yeah i would probably have two are like
her brass knuckle like handle on the
back of it so that I could like really
swing it at people if I needed to well
now you're just gilding the lily with
like with the giant phone asking for too
much you are what it was connected to a
base yes hang it over your head that
could be an optional add-on it's an
optional Adlai can see more like the
like the thing exactly ain't gonna feed
exactly you could just unscrew the
antenna and put on like a mace that
would go really good i hope i would
enjoy that um and then fabio road to us
this doesn't have to do with this
doesn't have to do with TD power but
fabio road susan said I did this for
tomorrow daily they didn't like it he

it's time for your very last piece to
use your feedback we do it every day
phone target for the day
the one and only jail Fox wrote in to us
one only seems like a carmen sandiego
like henchman yeah jl fox tail fox is
like not the Bond villain but the
bungalow jail Fox stole the Smithsonian
like I feel like that's the thing that
could happen he wrote doesn't said a few
for phone tog refer tab log refer of the
