bacteria high school senior kriti lal
turned that passion for bacteria into a
potentially award-winning intel science
fair project I made a novel water
treatment system to inexpensively remove
arsenic from water this novel system
uses a bacteria that I genetically
engineer it and it also uses a
bioreactor that I designed and built her
system costs around eight dollars to
build from basic supplies she hopes to
help the 137 million people affected by
arsenic polluted water main component is
the bacteria in the jar which does the
real magic which is converting the
arsenite to the arsenate she's one of 40
finalists from the nearly 2,000
competitors in Intel Science Talent
Search this year finalists projects
range from cybersecurity to detecting
parasites and blood samples a project
created by 18 year old tunay tandon take
the slide put it underneath the
smartphone and the lens attachment you
know take a picture on the camera send
to the server the server analyzes it and
within a couple of seconds you get an
output with sort of a preliminary blood
report tandon says the report could
detect blood disorders like sickle cell
anemia and the presence of parasites
indicating a tropical disease like
malaria or chagas the tricky part was
teaching the computer to make a
diagnosis retrain the machine learning
algorithms in order to identify the
different types of parasites which he
did by showing it images of parasites
and blood cells whether tendon and law
wina top prize or not both students hope
their projects will end up saving lives
