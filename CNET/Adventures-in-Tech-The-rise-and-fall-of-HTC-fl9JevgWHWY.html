Android phones now as it reveals the One
m8 its future is much less certain
adventures in tech examines the rise and
fall of HTC
with the 1m eights now taking center
stage it's easy to forget that HTC began
out of the spotlight making unbranded
Mobile's for the likes of orange HP and
o2 to slap their label on plenty of
these phones were well-received and
after several years
HTC started making Mobile's that
actually bore its logo a landmark moment
came in 2008 when HTC built the t-mobile
g1 the very first Android phone a quirky
mobile with a blocky chin that would
make Judge Dredd blush the following
year we got the hero which introduced
the Sense UI HTC was experienced at
tweaking operating systems and since
filled Android with extra features and
widgets smoothing over androids rough
edges sense also featured HTC's famous
clock widget which tells you what the
weather's like where you are I've never
really understood the appeal of that one
2010 saw a streak of major hits
including the USA's first 4G phone and
the very first Nexus device by the end
of the year HTC had sold twenty 4.6
million phones cementing its position as
the king of Android the Editors Choice
Awards bought in and so did the cash in
2011 HTC went for even bigger chunkier
phones it didn't feel like anything
would stop the HTC train but then
something stopped the HTC train Samsung
had been slow off the mark with its own
Android devices but didn't lie dormant
for long producing the galaxy s2 in 2011
a smartphone that was both shockingly
powerful and extremely thin and light
almost overnight
HTC's mobile started to feel bulky by
comparison as if that wasn't enough
Google was busy super charging Android
2011 saw the leap from Gingerbread to
the futuristic Ice Cream Sandwich
followed up by jelly bean a mere nine
months later HTC Sense started as an
improvement on Android but was quickly
becoming less relevant a turning point
came in spring 2012 when both HTC and
Samsung revealed new flagship phones the
slender One X made a good impression but
was steamrolled by the glossy galaxy s3
which launched not only to orchestral
fanfare but a lavish Olympic ad campaign
in shorts the s3 broke the 1 X like
Carthaginian general Hannibal shattered
the Roman legions at the Battle of the
Trebbia look we can do it if we
green-screen the river and the Numidian
cavalry we have the Romans played by
extras about a thousand lots of catering
then on my signal the animal handlers
released the war elephants across the
river for the big climax and seen a
Samsung's fortunes rose HTC's fell
Samsung doesn't just make Mobile's and
its massive size gave it a huge
advantage in both assembling phones and
marketing them production problems and
new rivals made HTC situation worse and
in 2013 the company Rafi
it was losing money for the first time
in its history even a samsung boasted of
record profits in the clutches of
catastrophe HTC has revealed the One m8
a phone that needs to make a big
impression the m8 looks gorgeous and has
some really cool camera features but
then producing compelling hardware has
never been a problem for HTC instead
it's the presence of powerful much
larger rivals that's making things tough
for this small phone maker an Apple and
Samsung aren't going anywhere can HTC
make a comeback and what do you think of
the One m8 let me know and check back
next time for another adventure in tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
