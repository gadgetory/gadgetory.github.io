year with a new line of electronic
assistance for the home and the business
there's a lawnmower robot of vacuum
robot a massive vacuum robot and an
airport assistant but the head of the
robot family is perhaps the adorable hub
robot and it's mini-me version consider
the sky a cuter version of Alexa in fact
it's powered by the Amazon voice command
system and can accomplish pretty much
the same tasks and then some the hub can
tackle questions voice commands and
control other smart appliances but it's
also equipped with a camera and screen
display with facial recognition this
times it's capable of recognizing each
member of your family to say entertain
your kids with a cute dance or read them
a story the much larger and not quite as
cute Airport guide will actually be
tested at the airport in South Korea
right after CES to scan your boarding
pass and it can tell you everything you
need to know about your flight in four
languages or escort you to your gate and
the other monster robot is also meant
for the airport but this one actually
cleans up as it goes through the gates
it's a massive vacuum that can detect
humans with its camera and sensors to
move around them or tell them to move
out of the way look for the airport
robots next time you're in the Incheon
International Airport while the two hubs
should be insource before the end of the
year according to LG</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
