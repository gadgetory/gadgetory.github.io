checking out the latest flagship super
phone from LG the g3 this phone has had
a significant design overhaul from its
predecessor set the g2 although you can
spot various family resemblances most
obviously are the volume and power
buttons which are found on the back of
the phone rather than on the edge like
any other phone LG argues that it's much
more comfortable as this is where your
finger will naturally stitch when you're
holding it while that's true it takes a
lot of getting used to and I'm really
not sure that button location was a big
issue that needed fixing to begin with
it's a 5.5 inch phone which is bigger
than the g2 but it does have narrow
bezels so its body hasn't had to balloon
out too much to accommodate the largest
screen back panel looks a lot like metal
or thanks to the brush defects in fact
it's plastic with a metallic coating but
it is a convincing effect and arguably a
decent compromise between the lightness
of plastic and the luxury look of metal
that 5.5 inch display has a whopping
2560 x 1440 pixel resolution which far
outstrips in 1920 x 1080 pixel screen on
the galaxy s5 Sony Xperia z2 or the HTC
One m8 sounds impressive well don't get
too excited the fact is that above a
certain point there's no real benefit in
having higher resolutions your eyes just
can't detect it indeed I myself could
find no discernable difference in
clarity between the g3 and s5 nor could
almost anyone I gave it to it still
pin-sharp though and has great natural
colors so I don't have any complaints
inside it's running a powerful quad-core
processor with android 4.4 point2 KitKat
software LG has chucked in various
interface tweaks including its own icons
and color schemes and a reminder to all
who gives info about the weather or tips
on how to save battery it's an
attractive interface and it's quite easy
to use as well on the back is a 13
megapixel camera which took some great
shots in my tests and did particularly
well in low light situations more
excitingly though is the autofocus which
uses a laser to detect subjects and
speed up focusing time
I certainly found it was able to focus
extremely quickly which will be handy
when you have a sudden burst of
photography inspiration in general the
LG g3 packs everything you'd expect from
a top end smartphone and doesn't look
too bad doing it the 2k display might be
more of the marketing boats than a real
benefit but rest assured the screen the
processor the camera and the software
are all top notch I'm Andrew Hoyle for
cnet and this is the LG g3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
