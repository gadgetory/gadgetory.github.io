director please welcome mrs. alicia keys
you were a long time blackberry user and
then we lost you for a while what
happened let's see that that is true let
me see how I best describe this is kind
of like you know I was in a long-term
relationship with blackberry and then I
started to notice some new kind of
hotter attractive sexier phones at the
gym and I kind of broke up with you for
something I had a little more bling but
I always missed the way you organize my
life and the way that you were there for
me at my job and so I started to have
two phones I was kind of playing the
field but then you called and you told
me that you were working out you added a
lot more features a new platform you got
a lot faster all of that was true and
now we're exclusively dating again and
I'm very happy oh so are we tell us what
are you going to do for us I'm extremely
committed i'm a very committed focused
individual so i'm gonna work closely
with the app designers and developers
the content creators of retailers the
carriers to really explore this
blackberry 10 platform and create ideas
for future i'm definitely going to start
with other super women who also love
blackberry a big demographic for
blackberry i'm also going to work with
people in the entertainment &amp;amp; music
business to inspire creative projects
and most importantly i really love i
want to further enhance this concept of
having your work life and your personal
life all together in one device I really
want to bridge the gap between the work
phone and the play phone so it's a big
job and it's a super hands-on role but I
am extremely excited and ready to jump
in and work closely with you and your
incredible too
yep and we will make sure you get the
perfect platform to do this with that
great time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
