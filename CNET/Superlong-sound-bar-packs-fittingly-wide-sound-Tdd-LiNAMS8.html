today we're going to take a look at the
sharp htsb 60 this is a super long sound
bar system designed for TVs 60 inches
and up and is currently selling for
around three hundred and twenty dollars
this is the longest sound bar I've seen
coming in at fifty four point five
inches that makes it a good fit for
jumbo TVs but it also means it's not
going to fit well in most living rooms
unless you have a lot of space
now while the sound bar is very long
it's actually pretty thin and short
coming nowhere near blocking our TV's
remote sensor like some sound bars do
the design itself has a plasticky kind
of cheap feel and the alarm clock style
display only adds to that the included
wireless subwoofer gives off the same
vibe although you can probably stash it
out of sight as long as it's close to a
power outlet the included remote is a
good size but the button layout is a
little confusing the big volume rocker
actually controls volume for your TV
with the directional pad handling sound
bar volume adjustments on the upside you
can adjust the subwoofer level right
from the remote which is a nice plus for
program-by-program tweaks around back
are the inputs including two HDMI inputs
one optical and an analog mini Jack
that's more ports than most sound bars
have although if you plan on connecting
all your devices to your TV first and
then connecting your TV its optical
output to the sound bar you won't
necessarily need all those HDMI inputs
still there are a nice plus especially
if your TV doesn't have many HDMI ports
in the first place
the big missing feature is built-in
bluetooth most sound bars this year are
including Bluetooth which is the easiest
way to wirelessly stream audio from most
smartphones and tablets the sharp
doesn't have it so you'll need to get a
separate device if you're looking for
wireless audio streaming in terms of
sound quality the sharp is one of the
most impressive sound bars I've heard
the extra long design means you get some
real stereo separation between the
speakers and it just sounds bigger than
other sound bars in this price range
even more impressive is that it actually
sounds pretty good with just stereo
music which nearly every
they're soundbar struggles with in
head-to-head comparisons the HD SB 60
overall sounded better than the
competing sony HTC t 260 and i also
compared it to videos 5.1 sound bar and
while the vizio rear channel speakers
did create a more immersive experience
for movies the sharp was better for
music
so overall the sharp htsb 60 is one of
the best performing sound bars at this
price it's extra-long size means it
won't fit well into every living room
and the lack of bluetooth is a real -
but if you're okay with those
shortcomings it's a great sounding value
for just three hundred and twenty
dollars i'm matthew Muscovy AK and this
is the sharp htsb 60</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
