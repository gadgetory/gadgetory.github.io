of Black Friday I'm Bridget Carey this
is your cnet update you can start
planning your black friday shopping
strategy now the shopping holiday is
just about a week away on November 27th
and many retailers have posted what will
be on sale among Amazon's big discounts
you're going to find Kindles and fire
TVs along with different brands of hdtvs
you can't have black friday without some
cheap tvs right you can also get fifty
dollars off an xbox one and playstation
4 uncharted bundle we at cnet compiled
the list of all the best gadget sales at
amazon and other big retailers like
Walmart Target Best Buy coals and Sam's
Club not that black friday really
matters anymore online sales are
continuous throughout the season you
don't need to fight the crowds with a
belly full of turkey to get the best
deal on a TV Black Friday is moving
online the day turned into a weekend
which turned into a month of sales the
national retail federation found that
about half of holiday shoppers did not
buy anything on Thanksgiving weekend
last year it's Black Friday fatigue but
going back to Amazon the site just added
a very important security protection
tool that you need to use amazon
accounts can now have two step
authentication the next time you log in
go to your account settings and turn
this on that way if someone tries to log
in from a new computer it's going to
require a password and a special number
code texted to your phone it's
essentially a double password to make it
much harder for someone to break into
your account amazon is late to the party
on this one the feature is on many sites
already like Facebook and Google but hey
better late than never in other news
google has not given up yet on its
social network if you visit Google Plus
you can check out a redesign that puts
more for focus around communities and
collections it's Google's way of being
more like Reddit and Pinterest a
community is where you could have
conversations around any topic you could
think of with a group of people and you
can follow a collection created by one
person on one topic it can be anything
even zombie cats is a collection for
some reason but there's a more
entertaining way to get your zombie fix
the game plans
vs zombies 2 has sprouted an update in
app stores it brings new dinosaurs and
prehistoric plants the update is called
Jurassic Marsh part 1 the popular game
from 2013 gets updates to keep things
fresh but it won't be until early 2016
when EA is going to release a whole new
plants vs zombies game that's it for
this tech news update and there's more
at cnet com from our studios in New York
