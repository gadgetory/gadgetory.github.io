Alfred hang Apple dropped a tree of new
iPhones and a new Apple watch an event
that well didn't have a lot of surprises
I mean the iPhone 10s 10s Max and 10r
came just as rumored and that Apple
watch series for facelift was pretty
much like the leaks showed you know what
stood out to me was the pricing across
the board increased it's now even more
expensive to buy any of these iPhones it
starts at 750 just two years ago it
started at 650 pretty close to that 2000
price point I mean I think they saw the
success of the iPhone 10 where basically
it was kind of like in your face told
you we can make a lot of money with ya
thousand dollar phone and it's kind of
like let's just lean into that now let's
just make everything more expensive make
more money people are gonna buy our
stuff no matter what keep in mind the
iPhone 10's max that starts at ten fifty
but goes all the way up to fifteen
hundred dollars so that two thousand
dollar iPhone is actually pretty close
the way we're going you know it's kind
of like do you want to pay rent for this
month or do you want like a new phone
like sometimes you know you can just get
a new phone instead like what do you
need a roof over your head for more rent
than I pay all right like think about
all the new features on that on there
ten there your iPhone is max Oh Matt
just keep you warm yeah yeah that's
right you can be homeless for a month
and have a really sweet amazing photos
you can take with that camera in the
back it's my HDR and to me the I mean
that the 10r
was the most interesting phone and you
know it was at least different than the
tennis which pretty much are just last
year's ten right you know it's it's
bigger than the 10s but also cheaper
which is kind of a weird area because
you always think bigger is more
expensive and this is not the case yeah
I mean I'm definitely attracted to you
know the ten are more than I am the
other phones mostly because they didn't
announce an se - yeah I was just like my
dreams of a smaller phone are now dead
so I mean let's get to that there were a
couple of things that they kind of
quietly killed all right the iPhone se
is no longer available they also killed
the plus models of the old phones it's
really just a iphone 7 iphone 8
we thought maybe the plus would stick
around and then no air power for a whole
year they a year ago they announced the
air power wireless charging pad and it's
it's basically gone an entire year
without mention yeah just I think the
idea was like don't even think about it
we I think something really went wrong
there because that that product probably
isn't gonna show up pay no attention to
the yeah yeah no attention to check it
out like we've got three phones instead
and then like they made just like they
talked about the home pod for like maybe
two seconds yeah I know they're like oh
yeah there's this thing we've got some
updates but don't worry about it and
they can sync with each other now forget
about it and then there look lastly
there's the Apple watch right yes what
did you think of the series for the the
new bad so I'm curious to see what the
battery life will be like for the walkie
talkie and the phone mode because I know
that that was a big criticism of the
last iPhone was basically yeah the
phone's cool but like you're really only
getting at like 30 minutes of talk time
so they don't watch watch yeah yeah they
talk about it with the watch where is
basically like oh this has the same
battery life as I'm still getting a full
18 hours and my guess is they haven't
solved that problem if you're running
off that LTE radio that watch is not
lasting long yeah and then they made it
louder which i think is kind of annoying
cuz I hate it when people have speakers
in public yes but I tend to actually
mute mine oh that's good yeah oh you're
a decent person that like doesn't just
play music out loud clap for everyone
here so yes I mean I thought they you
know the EKG support the the fall
detection was kind of an interesting
angle because it's I think for older
folks it's actually kind of useful I'm
curious how many false positive it's
gonna have though right if I if I like
if I'm like you know after a long night
of drinking or some of that I just fall
into bed and I forget to take my watch
off yeah automatically call some I call
one yeah that is not gonna be so maybe
it uses I guess the heart rate Meyer or
the motion sensor like if you're moving
your hand around within those five
minutes but you can move your hand
around after you've fallen too well so I
think the idea is if you fall you're
unconscious right yes I used to move
your hand that's true
well see how it works they didn't
actually have us check it out during the
the demo Oh gladly fall and see how
or yeah well we'll definitely do a lot
of fall test here anyways for more on
all that Apple coverage chickens I've
seen it I'm Roger Chang I'm Alfred Aang
thanks for listening
alright thanks for bearing with us folks
and oh we're running late but there's
still a lot for us to kind of wrap our
heads around after yesterday oh wait no
there's not
oh my fault that we're running late
today hey let's go ahead and take some
questions and comments
what would your takeaway from the
keynote did anything actually blow your
mind I'm kind of with you guys Roger and
Alfred the fault detection thing was
probably the most notable most admirable
well the fact that it's got a EKG reader
electrocardiogram support and that it
got clearance from the FDA to be a
medical device that's that can change
how well who gets access to this thing
right because imagine if an Apple watch
is covered by an insurance company all
of a sudden it's a lot more appealing
right
yeah I've seen like Fitbit it's being
covered by some insurance companies yeah
I've talked to analyst who say you know
in terms beyond senior citizens folks
who work in warehouses that fall
detection thing could actually be useful
as a preventative measure so there's a
lot of applications I thought the Apple
watch was definitely more interesting
than the phone announcement yeah
somebody made a really good point on
Twitter that I saw what was basically
like what if they sold the 10r and the
watch together as like a bundle because
I'm like a thousand dollars that's like
the price of a 10 s so could be
interesting could be interesting for I
don't know I would definitely rather
have the 10s for the thousand dollars or
the 10 R and watch a bundle for sure but
the problem is that what is it 750 for
the 10 are the watch starts at 400 so
11:50 that's a $150 discount I don't
know that's actually not that
unreasonable yeah Apple go for it do it
do it they're listening to us
they never listen all right jumping into
the chat taking some questions and
comments from first and foremost let's
go ahead and address the elephant in the
room for where to go Oh from Joseph what
do you guys think of Apple no longer
including the headphone jack to the
Lightning port outside right out of the
box so dongle yeah I mean yeah I'd be
I'd be kind of
annoyed but I am annoyed by that those
things are easy to lose I'm not
surprised you know they gave us like I
guess what three generations of dongles
was it three I don't know six seven
eight maybe two it's two years I guess
yeah it's disappointing I really wish
they they would have kept that little
dongle in because it is useful and there
are times and you still need that thing
like you know if you're an airplane or
something if you it's just yeah it's
very frustrating that like you have to
buy it separately now and let me believe
it's nine dollars I mean that's not a
bad price if that's the case but I don't
know how all right first of all that's
it is nine dollars and it has one and a
half stars on their website oh yeah well
probably cuz you can lose it super
easily doesn't make any sense though
we're like why would they it's like nine
dollars like how much I'll feed your
off-mike
oh there you go it's like nine dollars
and I don't know how like why they would
get rid of it for you know something
that's so essential and useful for so
many people I mean I suppose they really
are trying to get everybody to you know
not use all about why your headphones
it's all about the profits trying to get
squeeze that profit out of yeah yeah
those dongles let's call the dongles
they were just sucking up valuable
dollar bills that that Apple could've
been posting that's that's what Apple
does Sean wants to know if you guys
think that Apple may have missed a big
opportunity by not creating an SD sighs
iPhone 10 yes yeah
all right you not me people that are out
there with small hands okay this is it
fit affliction okay this is BS that's
the I don't BS that they don't have
smaller I would say that the fact that
they dropped the se and you know they
they consider now the XR to be their
budget phone at 7:50 which is kind of
crazy
I'm pivot he's not a budget price I know
that is my point though I think Apple is
basically saying hey that's so much
success with the iPhone 10 let's just
lean into that and for folks who just
can't afford these phones well sorry go
to Android it
proven at least with over the last year
or blackberry no or Nokia I mean I was I
won't say this though with with these
like higher price increases I think that
more people are gonna be holding on to
their like different little bit longer
yeah yeah yeah in the same sense that
like you know you you wouldn't like just
go out and buy another phone if it was
like a thousand dollars but it's like
another phone if a new phone was like
300 or 400 it's like much easier for you
to make that like justification yeah for
sure like you're much more likely to
just hold on to your stuff now like it's
the same thing with cars you know you
don't like go out and buy a new car
every year yeah ultimately they don't
they don't necessarily mean they do care
that you're buying iPhones continually
but if you stay on iPhone and you using
their services that's still an Apple I
thought the whole recycling thing was
kind of interesting is that knew how it
were like am i that far out of the loop
what situation no the in terms of the
recycling like they've shown off that
robot arm that could sort of disassemble
the parts and reuse them for the
manufacturer future devices what was new
is I believe the the fact that they
they've included or they're using even
more recycled parts in the iPhone so
it's more it's greener the idea is that
you don't have to mind for certain
precious materials that's necessary for
these components some of them are rare
they're expensive oftentimes they're in
conflict areas and so I think they're
trying to get away from their dependence
on that Apple should have a program
where if you have all the recycled
materials from like old iPhones and
stuff if you ship it in to them they can
like make you a new phone at a discount
from that oh they're not gonna do that
no what you're cycling your stuff it's a
that's a really cool idea I imagine an
Android startup would try something like
that and I can't just do a terrible job
at it and fail yeah probably but Apple
it's a great idea but that I mean how
would Apple make its money the sweet
sweet I mean they probably still sell it
to you at a much higher price but like
oh if they still charge you like two
thousand four yeah but like you know
he's gonna discount like I don't know
like now you wouldn't get a discount
with Apple Apple doesn't do discounts
even if you send in your own part yeah
they don't care I gathered all the
materials please and thank you but you
pay extra for feeling good about
yourself
Green that's the app premium right there
we didn't pay for any of these parts but
we're still gonna charge you premium if
you send me your old iPhone I will take
it apart and solder it together into a
statue for you I would love to see that
actually it's like a commemoration it's
like when you when you have your pet
cremated and you put it on in a jar on
the Shelf you can do that with your old
iPhone now oh you guys I'll make it for
you you just be reasonable and sell your
phone it's your money back get some
money back
don't chunk it there that's that's
actually really environmentally the bad
I mean the last couple the first couple
of phones I had were obliterated there
was no coming back for them so I had
them destroyed were they all like rage
obliterated yeah well I have my surprise
I'm not surprised
all right more questions we've got a
couple minutes left James Cook is it
true that the new iPhone will take
advantage of t-mobile's faster speed yes
yes I believe so I don't think they
talked about during the presentation
call my buddy John he I will I will
it's actually more it's Nevel Rae their
CTO he would know John actually doesn't
I don't think he even knows but yeah I
believe the new one is optimized for
t-mobile 600 megahertz spectrum which is
there they called extended LT it's
really just LTE with better range and
coverage so extended yeah you're right
you're right
no but they market it as like it's
special extended LTE like as if it's
special that's not it just don't see you
guys anyway man on top of a telephone
pole is like extend yes he has a shout
actually the entire time it's a terrible
job here's a good question from Sean
Vega will Apple watch for be bought by
nursing homes for patients that's the
thing I mean it could that's like I
don't know about nursing homes but like
if my parents thankfully or not at that
that age or that condition were this is
a real risk but like if they get older
like I wouldn't mind I would consider
buying on these things
and paying for the LTE connection I'm
curious about like what you know the
popularity of like
EKG on your watch will do for like the
public mindset because there's a lot of
like young people that don't need EKGs
that are gonna have Apple watch they're
just gonna start doing it yeah I'm what
you're like are they gonna be much more
conscious of like they're they're like
health because of that like they don't
need it at all right it's on there like
it's there as like a constant like I
don't know I think with this yesterday's
presentation it seemed like Apple was
trying to go after a broader base not
just say that the young folks who have
been wounded - brace wearables but even
older folks there's the the health kick
definitely kind of signaled that this
wasn't just for you'd be young and just
like kids using it as like a makeshift
lie-detector now ooh maybe there'll be
an app for that it's gonna be so it's
gonna be completely inaccurate and it's
fine
oh so well can we refresh Ricardo what
the size of the battery is on the XS the
XS Max and the XR did they give out the
actual battery specs they usually oh by
the way go ahead and at me Chet I'm
calling it the X yeah it's fine I just X
s max just I can't say that fast too
many times even though I want to say X
but anyway it's I know it's it's
basically it's supposed to be more
battery it's supposed to be a little bit
longer life than the last year's model I
believe the 10 s is supposed to last
like I don't know half an hour longer or
a little bit longer and the maxes as
longer battery life I don't think they
gave out battery capacity you know they
usually don't
I don't recall battery capacity either
and I'm scanning through our review
right now put it up on screen for some
other let's see one or not have yeah it
claims 90 minutes or 30 minutes longer
depending on which mode for the unit
that's the 10s right yeah well I mean
I've got all three lined up here okay so
the 10s is thirty minutes longer than
the 10 the max is 90 minutes longer than
the 10 and the R is 90 minutes longer
than the eight okay that's not mean okay
yay but that's a claim without a test so
far so what exactly then yeah and also
you know it really depends on how you
use the phone right if you're constantly
streaming video
it's not gonna last long exactly yeah I
just remember like they kind of glazed
over it at the keynote yeah it is
slightly longer though which gives
people more time to watch their favorite
like live streams on YouTube such as the
stream economy oh yeah okay your
Alphabet City yes those are excellent
shows yeah yeah it breaks it down there
you go that's that's really all the good
shows on yeah I'll see that and think of
our YouTube self all of YouTube yeah
okay sir enjoy for the people who are
paying close attention was Tim Cook's
Twitter troll ever surpassed in the rest
of the event did he set that bar too
high I remember when that came out our
artist yeah they aren't tweet yeah an
office chat was like what's going on you
know it actually kind us the fight had
kind of worked well but that was that I
saw they know if that was around think
he was I don't think that was on purpose
I think because it worked well with the
video I think that was a theater for the
videos absolutely stay no I think that
he sent out that accidentally I was like
we got to cover this up now and then
they made that whole video yeah do it
they have the money that's probably like
I don't care if it cost ten million
dollars you make that video to fix my
arrow tweet or make my air and tweet
relevant it was a good cover-up video it
was great so do we know what the R
stands for Sandro is wondering if it
means rubbish or ripoff hmm I don't know
that it they just called the are like
this same with you iPhone 5c there was
no they ever holler they never
officially they never officially said
that so it's I think yeah it was up to
us and I think it ended up being known
more like for cheap
yes that's what most people see as cheap
yeah which is why there's no 10 see it's
a 10 R I don't know what R is gonna
rubbish would be that's a little bit
overstatement I'm going with rude boy
but that's just because I've been
listening to a lot of sky lately the
iPhone 10 rude boy so it sounds better
than 10x s-max
oh yeah can't say that three times fast
10s xmax
oh well you were being redundant oh
you're right iPhone excess max okay I
still can't say that right either way
Oh phone Daft says reach for reaching
more people that's actually a good
thought right there legitimate we're
just gonna keep making bad jokes
sure before we go James asks when do you
think the new air pods are going to be
announced I'm surprised we didn't see
him yesterday I there there is we're
expecting the October event so they
might show up because we didn't get to
see an iPad Pro we didn't see the the
MacBook Refresh is that the rumor the
new iPods either where the iPod nanos
where the shovels Tim the DiMaggio me
the iPod shuffle in like five years
people want to know I had a shuffle
great shuffle 10s max yeah so I mean we
have the October event to look forward
to I wouldn't even be surprised if they
drop those airpot updates into like like
a present like a quiet press release
announcement I mean these question is
real they glazed over the home pod and
Mojave and just like on that why
couldn't have just thrown pods in there
everything the Mojave stuff would have
like went down anyway though like the
true suppose hardware stuff that's why
they had the watch OS like announcements
like at a completely different event
right because there were like pretty
cool stuff on the new watch OS but like
they don't really show that with this
one oh you know what we completely
forgot about no one really cared about
home court
home court was cool Steve Nash was their
home court
oh never basketball oh good lord
yeah I was you know this cool st. Steve
Nash there it's just weird to see him be
the tallest guy on stage as opposed to
the shortest guy on the court just
please can't wait for my iPhone to teach
me how to dunk I mean great well that's
the 2000 dollar model freaking help me
yeah I'm paying that much alright I'll
give him that much some of the AR stuff
was pretty cool I did get kind of
excited about the Galaga arcade game
what's dumb as hell to me I'm oh shut up
I'll play that alright but I'm just
saying like that looks cool cuz you're
seeing what's on the screen but yeah but
let's see how it actually performs yes
like when they pan out to just the
people they look really stupid like when
if you can't see what's going on it's
just like three people with their phones
like walking around a desk and it looks
really cool if you're doing it though so
is sitting in a chair and pushing
buttons on a little rectangle in your
lap no you look very cool Brian but like
if if you were doing a are buttons like
there was nothing in the room and you're
just like sitting in and after you
pretending to press buttons and stuff it
just looks really dumb
Sir Isaac for yourself enjoys asking one
more time before we're out the door did
you notice any improvement in the front
camera I watch Scott Stein's video and
the photos did look better we're gonna
have him on ASAP he's actually on a
plane on his way back right now or the
podcast for us so I'm sure we'll have
them on and very very soon facing
cameras supposed to be much better not
as like seven megapixels on it which if
you think about it like that's better
than like some of the back facing
cameras on like phones just from three
years ago and it's supposed to have a
faster sensor yes yep and so it's like
faster for like mostly it's like for
face ID but like it also makes it better
for like taking like clearer sound glad
I'm glad they improved face ID because
it's still great it's not super reliable
it's also better for like depth of field
constantly the depth of field stuff we
mostly talk to us for the front the rear
camera like it's like the sensors on the
front also and also fact check there
they claim that this is the first time
it's ever been done that's completely
false Samsung did that last year with
their dual lens camera and Lytro has
been doing that for a long long time so
not the first time so it's been a fact
check their breach Roger preach hey
we're out of time for the day we're out
of time for the week thanks everybody
for joining us thanks for bearing with
us on such a weird scheduled week we'll
be back next week where we'll talk about
the philosophy and theorize whether
Apple will or will not create augmented
reality crossfire the boardgame
router you want to take us on out of
here yeah the podcast is available on
iTunes tune in stitcher feedburner
google play music google podcasts and
Amazon Alexa of course it's on Sina com
we'll see you all next week
take care folks we're doing an AMA on
reddit about the iPhone sub so if you
want Jews out there not our boss honey
our boss Connie is gonna be on she was
