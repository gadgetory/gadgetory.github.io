enthusiasts Volkswagen finally brought
the hottest golf to the US the Golf R
this guy demotes the GTI to vice
president in this country but is it the
right choice when you're going to go
CNET style let's drive this 2012 Golf R
and check the tech now if you want to
spot a Golf R aside from the little
teeny badges that live around the body
look at the but you've got center
mounted dual exhaust outlets dead
giveaway also look for a lower stance on
the car mild body hit under the skin
there's more power out of the engine
6-speed only sports suspension all-wheel
drive ok our Golf R is missing one key
option package the navigation and
sunroof thing you know real logical
combination I don't know
but without that we still have a touch
screen media head unit and you got all
the sources you need and one or two that
you don't AM and FM both have HD
capability as well your satellite radio
functionality good readout here you get
good readouts of the various station
information and such under your media
tab you've got the four main acts here
CD is a six disc integral changer right
up here at the top very nice SD card
yeah that's one of those I mentioned
that you don't need media input refers
to this thing the MDI connector which is
an Audi Volkswagen thing now the one
I've got in this car as you can see
still has the traditional 30-pin iOS
connector for an iPhone or an iPod Touch
I've had to adapt it to this iPhone 5
right here and as you can see it works
fine we're seeing no issues with logic
control or screen readout now because
you're using this MDI connector and not
a USB jack like a lot of other cars do
you're going to have to buy different
pigtails here for let's say a USB female
jack if you want to plug in a thumb
drive or any other device this is a
relatively old-school backwards idea
right now
I talked to Volkswagen
this morning and so far nothing on the
horizon to bring a lightning cable to
this port so you are going to have to
use this adapter this whole mess and the
console is not very friendly here with
this iPhone on a cable I've got nowhere
to put it though it just kind of has to
hang they're not real elegant to be
honest and of course finally you've got
bluetooth streaming audio which looks
good nice use of meta tags the logic and
the response is kind of pokey but that's
at least with my Android 4.0.4 phone you
may have different results if you get
the nav package you're also going to get
a better audio system we have this
interface here for the bass treble
volume and fader and such but the
Dynaudio 300 watt 8 speaker rig comes
with the navigation upgrade as well and
at this moment let me get up on my
soapbox not so much picking on VW as
almost every car maker why do you put
these kinds of settings on a touchscreen
nobs do it better they're cheap and
they're proven yes you got to put some
additional parts in I guess but dealing
with digging through menus and all this
poke poke poke nonsense for bass and
treble or dragging these around that's
not better than knobs that's worse this
is screen interface for screen
interfaces sake
now when our is basically a GTI on
steroids under the hood same basic iron
block aluminum head two-liter
intercooled turbo engine but with more
oof bigger turbo hotter tuning 256 horse
243 foot-pounds of torque it's this
3,300 pound car to 60 in about 5.6
seconds and it also delivers 19 27 mpg
not bad
those numbers are 56 higher on the
horsepower for this car and 36 higher on
the torque substantial increases now all
ours are all-wheel-drive
GT is or not all ours come with a
6-speed manual and that's it GT eyes can
also get a DSG automated dual clutch
what I like about the Golf R is it's
kind of meatiness there's nothing fussy
about this car same can be said for the
GTI it's a German DNA thing and it's
certainly not lost in this variant the
turbo charging in this car bigger turbo
it's doing more of a boost job but it's
not ending up being laggy er put it this
way it's not any of being leggy er than
I'd like I don't have a GTI here to
compare it to but this car has got good
power delivery not frantic but
substantial now since you only have a
6-speed manual to play with it better be
a good one this one is the clutch and
gearbox action are pretty darn good I'm
not real crazy about this sort of
popping in and out of each gear I would
like a smoother engagement but that may
wear in with time another nice thing
about this car is the power is not too
much in other words you can drive it
flat-out when you really want to have
fun with it and you're not going to get
exited off the orbit of the earth it's
substantial power but not goofy power
ride quality in this car is actually
quite nice firm well planted you
definitely feel a nice leveling sports
suspension but without the
taking road inputs that I had recently
and let's say the Nissan Altima which
also had its own variant of a firm
suspension but it was just constantly
needling you through the bottom of the
car the bottom line I don't know if this
car is any more fun than a GTI you got
to be pushing it pretty hard to get that
all-wheel drive system which in this car
is built for performance not for
off-road traction so much to really get
the benefit of that it's really kind of
a track car which I don't know if you're
going to use in that respect so much
okay let's price this bad boy we have a
2012-2013 prices or what I'm telling you
just under 30 for base for the two-door
they've also got a four-door kinda
doesn't make sense to me in an R but to
your money the best deal out there
though it's kind of a weird package it's
1,500 bucks for navigation the power
glass roof keyless access and the
Dynaudio audio upgrade it's a great
price though I'm not a huge fan of the
head unit in general but at that price I
can become one the other options you got
on here are all pretty much non tech
this car is about 36 CNET's top</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
