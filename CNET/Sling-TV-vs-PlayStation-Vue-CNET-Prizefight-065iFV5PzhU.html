and streaming TV services have finally
made it into our home so we're bringing
you a prize five-foot out between sling
TV and playstation view our judges for
this fight are seen at senior editor
david man on fire cats mayer nice
muscles and yours truly can't go wrong
tongue
these services are brand spankin new so
we're not scoring them but we're going
to decide a winner for each round the
final prize fight king of the ring will
be the competitor with the most rounds
one let's get it on round one is
interface and design sling TV primarily
sticks to a single row for all your
stations and you can view the content
plane above it playstation view brings
the layout more like netflix with
multiple rows of content based on your
timeline shows and recent channels it's
a lot more customizable with favorites
you'll also have the traditional grid
guide as an option and the interface is
faster and more responsive than sling TV
most PlayStation View users will be
using a game controller to navigate
which might not be ideal versus a more
traditional remote for sling TV users
unless you're on an Xbox
this rounds tight but we're giving the
edge to Sony round 2 is platform with
any service it's all about who's on more
devices and this one's not even close at
the moment sling TV can be used on a
Roku player Amazon fire TV and the Xbox
one it works on your Mac or your PC and
also plays on iOS and Android devices
Android TVs and Nexus player support are
also coming soon now the PlayStation
View works on your ps3 and your ps4
that's it on top of that it's currently
only available in Chicago New York City
and Philadelphia like I said this one's
not even close
and sling TV dominates round two round
three is features PlayStation View acts
like a cable box with the ability to
pause and rewind every channel skip
commercials and you can use its cloud
DVR to save your favorite shows for up
to 28 days you can also stream from
three consoles at the same time but they
have to be in the same household sling
TV was the first to market but it
doesn't really bring any feature
advantage other than the ability to use
its bandwidth limiter it also has
channel specific limits that hurts a lot
so most channels don't allow you to
pause rewind or fast-forward and you're
allowed one and only one stream on one
device at one time per account this
rounds a no-brainer PlayStation View
round four is channels fling TVs basic
service starts off with the core of 21
channels that covers most of the cable
go twos like ESPN CNN AMC TNT and the
Food Network now it's still bhasin
networks like Comedy Central and Bravo
but brings on extra packages to add more
channels relevant to interests like
sports lifestyle and Chin's programming
Plus HBO has been added as an option to
get your Game of Thrones fix now
playstation views basic access plan
brings 50 plus channels with content
from CBS FOX NBC and Viacom so you'll
find channels like Bravo and Comedy
Central and Nickelodeon but there are no
ABC Disney networks so say goodbye to
channels in that family like ESPN
additional plans let you add on local
sports and an elite plan brings on 88
total channels variety is the spice of
life and Sony takes another round but
the final round comes down to pricing
sling TV starts at $20.00 a month for
the core 20 plus channels and you can
cancel at any time the additional extra
packages cost $5 a pop and the HBO
channel will cost you $15 a month
PlayStation views basic access plan is a
lot more starting at $49.99 a month the
core plan with local sports cost $59.99
and then the elite package with 88
channels is $69.99 is basically like
paying for an actual cable service even
though sling TV has many limitations
with view you're paying the same as
cable or even more with fewer channels
round 5 goes to sling so let's break
down the results and the sling TV made
it smart for its platform support and
pricing while playstation view one out
with its interface features and channel
selection taking this battle three
rounds to two and is your 5 byte winner
now I can't really say there's a clear
winner here and both services still have
a long ways to go but a combination of
an over-the-air antenna and one of these
services might be the best for you but
for me I'm a sports junkie and I don't
like how sporting events lose their
image quality and just aren't as smooth
compared to a cable signal right now i'm
brian tom thanks for watching and we'll
catch you all next time for another
prizefight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
