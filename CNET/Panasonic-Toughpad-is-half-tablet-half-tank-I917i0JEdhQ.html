Mobile World Congress in Barcelona
taking a look at two new Panasonic
5-inch tough pads now despite the pad
name at first glance these devices look
a little bit more like phones however
actually holding them they have more in
common with a tank I think than either a
phone or a tablet they're absolutely
enormous they're incredibly thick very
very heavy but that makes them extremely
rugged as well as toughened glass on the
front these things can survive drops of
up to three meters and they can survive
underwater down to 1.5 meters for up to
30 minutes this one's running android
version 4.2.2 while this one is running
Windows Embedded eight handheld which is
kind of like a version of Windows Phone
for the professional market inside
they've each got 1.7 gigahertz quad-core
processors 2 gigabytes of RAM 32
gigabytes of storage 4G capability and 8
megapixel cameras on the back also on
the top here you'll find a barcode
scanner now I want to talk about the
battery because these things have 6,200
milliamp hour batteries which means
they're going to last for a very long
time how long exactly is still up in the
air I'm told but maybe we can expect two
or three days of use now these batteries
are hot swappable and what that means is
you can take one battery out and the
phone will stay alive for a few minutes
while you put a new one in obviously
these are a long way from the gorgeous
design and incredible portability of the
iPhone 5s or the galaxy s5 but to be
honest for the peace of mind that these
things would give you I'm kind of
tempted they seemed so sturdy I don't
think you'd have to worry much about
them they're coming out in autumn but
there's no price yet what are you more
interested in lovely design or sturdy
construction let me know at checkout see
