with anything I guess there are the show
ponies and the workhorses hi I'm ty
Pendlebury and though these have some
flashy elements that BMW 685 s to
high-five speakers are definitely in the
workhorse category these are solidly
made beautifully performing speakers but
it's hard to get excited about them
BMW have been doing this a long time and
these are basically a tweak on previous
models the biggest change though is the
new tweeter which not only comes with a
protective grille but are now two
drivers sandwiched together the results
are much better trouble response than
the original 685 s they're also a couple
of other cosmetic differences and a new
dust cap but they're unmistakably 600
series speakers but as a result of these
tweaks so six eight five s are probably
now the best speaker under a thousand
bucks whether you're watching a movie
listening to jazz or getting pumped for
a big night out these are dynamic and
involving though they do work better at
low volumes than any other BMW speaker
I've heard these begged to be played
loud and as long as your amplifier can
handle it you can drive these really
hard they are more revealing than the
original six eight fires have better
resolution of vocals and even at $700
they offer a similar bang for buck as
the entry-level pioneer SPFs 50 to floor
standards
despite this greater clarity though bass
response is still pretty deep and they
can slam really well with rock tracks
though I'm finding it hard to get all
gushy about them I think it's just
because I believe this is how speakers
should be these are the new normal the
BMW 685 S 2's are simply great speakers
for the money this has been Ty
Pendlebury for cnet.com
