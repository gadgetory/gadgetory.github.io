and s 9 plus have new qualcomm
snapdragon 845 processors better stereo
speakers slimmer bezels and gigabit LTE
but it's the cameras that are the
biggest reason to upgrade or so Samsung
promises so here are the details
both s9 phones have 12 megapixel rear
cameras with adjustable apertures which
is a unique feature for phones it
physically moves from an F 2.4 to an F
1.5 and can lead in what samsung says is
28% more light it's supposed to take
brighter shots in low light or higher
quality shots in brighter light like an
SLR does or your eyes the s9 plus also
adds a second 12 megapixel rear camera
for 2 X optical zoom
kind of like the note 8 the s9 still
only has one but both phones take
advantage of better processing in a
faster ISP to deliver a promise 30% less
noise and photos taking 12 pictures to
generate the best photo overall
technically deer am on the new sensor
makes the processor work up to four
times faster so samsung says samsung's
so-called SuperSpeed dual pixel tech
promises to be as big an upgrade as the
galaxy s7 camera was to the s6 the 8
megapixel selfie cam is largely the same
but also gets better with an improved
camera sensor and processor one new
processor driven trick is super slow-mo
forget 240 frames per second this does
960 but in 720p and over a very short
period of time point 2 seconds
it's activated by a motion trigger like
an exploding party favor
afterwards it defaults back to 30 frames
per second and there's a are 2 AR
selfies are an answer to apples and
emoji or Google's AR stickers
I'm just gonna test this out see how it
works I the camera captures your face
and converts it to an equivalent emoji
kind of like bitmoji does and then it
suggests animated gifs that you can send
to friends AR emoji can be created with
the front or rear camera and you can
animate them too using your face and
putting on various human or extremely
non-human characters but the level of
face control isn't as good as Apple's
true depth camera cameras are used more
as well with Samsung's Bixby vision a
visual part of Samsung's
a I added modes can live translate
languages add virtual make up scan food
and to quit calorie counts and also do
quick scan shopping at Sam's Club and
Nordstrom's while better cameras make
the S 9 the best we'll know more when we
review it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
