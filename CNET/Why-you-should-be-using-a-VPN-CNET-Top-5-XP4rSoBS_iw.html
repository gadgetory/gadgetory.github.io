virtual private network also known as a
VPN if you didn't know using a VPN can
be pretty handy it creates a private
secure network between your device and
wherever you go to online and a big
thanks goes to my friend Shannon Morse
for her help in this episode let's get
to it and number five is you won't be
tracked as much when you are connected
to a VPN things like your actual
location are masked on top of that
search engines don't get to see what
you're looking for
so that means Google won't be able to
identify you because it won't see your
address it'll see your VPNs IP address
just be aware that cookies can still be
left on your machine so data can still
be collected and number four is access
content out of your region sometimes you
want to get to a service that you would
not normally have access to just because
of your physical location
VPNs can help with things like that
Shannon actually used a VPN to access
Cheaper Japanese ghibli museum tickets
and was able to sign up for a japan-only
Sailor Moon fan club normally she's in
the States and this would not be
possible for the most part you can
forget borders with a VPN coming that
number three is going around your office
or school network you ever try to access
something like a gaming site only to see
your network administrator says nope
well you don't need to abide by your
admin if you use a VPN while you're on
your office or school network you could
pretty much go wherever you want same is
true with sites that are blocked by
governments and number two VPNs make
public Wi-Fi a little safer if you just
jump on to the Wi-Fi at Starbucks or
McDonald's you never know who's snooping
around if you're running a VPN when you
connect to those hotspots it should make
it more difficult for someone to try to
snoop on what you're doing even if
someone's running a man-in-the-middle
attack where they're running a fake
hotspot they will see your data but with
the VPN at least your data should be
encrypted and coming in at number one is
your privacy when you're using the VPN
your own ISP does not know what you're
doing your browsing history is
essentially for sale by service
providers although many claim to make
that data anonymous do you want them to
know exactly everything you're doing
online if you
do use a VPN the ISP can see that you're
using a VPN
however the ISP will not be able to see
what you were doing while you were using
that VPN if you want to protect yourself
a little more you might want to look
into changing your DNS settings
now not all VPN services are created
equal if you're using a VPN remember it
can see what you're doing look for a VPN
service that does not keep logs again
thanks agender Morris you can find her
