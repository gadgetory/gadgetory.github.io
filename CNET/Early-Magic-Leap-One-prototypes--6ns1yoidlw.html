headset to blend real in virtual worlds
the goggle-eyed glasses aren't the first
AR headgear on the market though and
they won't be the last
but magic lips AR vision started out
even weirder dreams of biomechanical
creatures that took people to wild
worlds in the pages of a comic book
CEO Roni a bovitz made back in 2012
which one history lesson as to where
magic leap is bin let's go back in time
all the way to 2013 with the Beast this
prototype CEO Roni Abel Yvette's
actually built himself in his garage and
you would have to put your chin into
this look through these prisms to see
the holographic effect and the first
effect was basically one floating pixel
and it didn't work at first but
eventually they built it up to work with
that and other little holographic
characters now the next iteration was
something that you put on your head but
it looked like this really large but you
could at least float the lenses in front
of your eyes then it moved on to
something
this was the technical wearable ones but
they still had a tremendously large
array a massive cable that need to be
tethered to a big pc so these PC cards
here are the living examples of what
that looked like then before now where
it's connected to a little belt pack
computer and something that looks
relatively a lot more lightweight that
you put on your head the metrically one
isn't the end it's actually what the
company calls its first step forward a
second and third version are apparently
in the works with aims and improving the
field of view and working better with
glasses we're a lot further along than
where things used to be but magic leaves
future comic book dreams aren't all here
