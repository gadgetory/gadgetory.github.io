other I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
cnet update gadget news continues to
roll out of the Mobile World Congress
show going on now in Barcelona this is
where we learn about the new tablets and
phones hitting stores this year now most
attention goes to the new android phones
from Samsung LG and HTC but there are
some unique models for instance would
you be interested in a phone that keeps
your calls secure and untraceable if you
want to avoid being tracked by the NSA
then check out the black phone it's made
by Switzerland's geeks foam now this
phone encrypts voice calls texts and the
websites you visit as well as encrypting
the data that's saved to the phone
you'll have to get your own mobile plan
because it'll only be sold unlocked when
it arrives in June for six hundred and
thirty dollars panasonic showed off a
new Toughpad tablet well panasonic
insists that it's a tablet even though
it should just be called a tough
smartphone because the screen is 5
inches like many smartphones and it can
make calls but panasonic is targeting
this for the business world so it's
pushing the tablet title and it's
specifically something that you'll see
in warehouses because it has a built-in
bar code scanner that's also a
flashlight this can survive a drop from
10 feet and it can go for swim
underwater at five feet for 30 minutes
it comes in two flavors windows phone
and Android jelly bean and it'll be
available in August at a high price
expected to cost more than a thousand
dollars blackberry is hoping to bounce
back making a fan favorite classic phone
design with a keyboard and a trackpad
yes different for blackberry means going
back to old school the q20 will come out
by the end of the year but we didn't get
to see what it would look like
blackberry will focus on selling it to
governments and large businesses that
want workers to carry blackberry phones
it also has a new touchscreen phone it's
called XIII and that's coming in april
first to indonesia blackberry is hoping
to grow in emerging markets with cheaper
phones the company gave up trying to win
over consumers that have moved on to
androids and iPhones and the dual screen
yotaphone from
is back with a new model this
experimental foam has two screens a
normal color screen on the front and an
eating screen on the back the idea is
that you can save some serious battery
life by using the e-ink screens which
are similar to what you find on a Kindle
now you can even turn off the color
screen on the front and just keep the
e-ink on if you want this new model
isn't ready for primetime yet but we
should see a version of this in the US
by the end of the year that's your tech
news update you can find more details at
