iPhone 7 plus and jet black 7 are
completely sold out sold out why are you
the wait in the store no no you keep
moving get out of here
they're not there you should have
pre-ordered at 12-amp what you did it so
Wow Wow
now go go what's happening Brian Tong
here and welcome to the Apple buy for
everything good and bad inside the world
of Apple this is a big week for Apple
releases with the new os's and hardware
and like it happens almost every year
yep iOS 10 had a rocky start during its
first few hours of availability
you know when almost everyone tries to
get the update now some users received
an error during the update process
telling you to plug it into your
computer and iTunes and then it required
that phone to be restored not a good
thing for people who commit the cardinal
sin of not doing a backup before an
update it's almost as bad as going out
wearing the same underwear two days in a
row without turning them inside out
almost now the issues have been resolved
iOS 10 is now good to go and plenty of
you will love the new features like rays
to wake or the all-new notification
screen but I don't know about you with
all those bells and whistles my current
iPhone 6s s battery is getting sucked
dry in almost half the time I know
change is always tough and overall it's
better but there might be one thing that
bugs you the insistence on iOS 10 to
make us press the home button down to
unlock the phone ain't nobody got time
for that so if you want to do it without
it go to settings then general
accessibility find home button and then
select rest finger to open to open your
phone with touch ID without having to
press the home button it's subtle it's
kind of like iOS 9 I like it better and
now I've solved your first world problem
all right I message is gonna be a love
and hate thing for me love because it
can be fun at times hate well have you
seen that sticker app store it's a mess
like everyone is just spamming the car
out of the sticker store and are you
really going to find anything other than
just the Downloads they recommend I'm
going hunting to pull some of the good
ones and it's a little out of control
right now but while you wait
I found a fun one that's perfect for the
Apple buy called bad apples good apples
and you guessed it it's a bunch of
stickers of apples ranging from cute to
total d-bags now I'm giving away five
codes for the sticker pack and all you
have to do is tweet me at Brian Tong
with a good apple and bad apple of your
own for iOS 10 to win see I made it easy
on you
alright early reviews are out for the
iPhone 7 7 plus the Apple earpods
and the Apple watch series too and they
literally echo everything we felt about
them from last week's show
Apple iPhone 7 is a solid upgrade
nothing major
but its waterproofing speed and battery
life make it more useful in the camera
is an upgrade as well now the iPhone 7
plus is all about the dual lens and the
phone to get for people who want the
best camera on a mobile device almost
every reviewer still feels the lack of a
headphone jack is inconvenient but Apple
is forcing us to get used to it and
guess what you probably will but don't
worry something even better is coming
next year the New York Times review
couldn't hold back and tucked in a line
at the end of their iphone 7 review that
said Apple is likely to continue making
iPhones without headphone jacks and next
year's iPhone will have a full screen
face with a virtual button built
directly into the screen according to
two people at the company who spoke on
condition of anonymity see it's another
confirmation of Apple's plans to make a
huge change with the rumored all glass
body OLED screen wireless charging and
yes the elimination of a physical home
button now the Apple watch series too is
really the Apple watch that should have
come out originally it's better for
swimmers and runners but if you already
have one you don't really use GPS with a
new watch OS 3 you really don't need a
new Apple watch and that's if you even
want one at all which brings us to the
air cuts pretty much every reviewer
loved the tech the sound is about the
same but the looks will still hold a lot
of you back Tim Cook recently appeared
on Good Morning America to tell us just
how cool they really are I've been
wearing them for a while and because
they don't have wires on them the wires
tend to help the earbud to fall out
right because it applies weight
does by snipping the wires I have never
personally had one fall out and yes
finally the first admission by Apple
they snip them come on Tim you're not
supposed to say that out loud
and you know what that's a bad apple in
fact you can find pre-release air pods
on eBay before they come out in October
just like the ones Tim talked about but
then you know he went on and had to say
this it's absolutely they're absolutely
magical as well please please stop with
this magical stuff I know what magic
looks like and this is magic this is it
empty perhaps to you open it up yeah I
want you to know it's empty the very
short to the audience but it's black on
black and here's the warm and here's the
trip Jim you may have never seen borrow
top hat magic gesture - taps and out of
the Hat comes a rabbit that's hockey
puck the rabbit under door riffles wow
that really is magic but you know what
would have been really magical if they
somehow made the earpods in black like
these cool mock-ups from the master Marn
hey Jett now I'm still waiting to see an
actual exact wearing the air pods and
until then I'll still always have this
and that will never get old for me now
during the ABC interview chips was also
commented in AR vs. VR and said that
augmented reality is the larger of the
two probably by far for him because it
gives people the ability to sit next to
each other
be present talk to each other but also
have other things that visually both
people can see he ended by saying Apple
is high on AR in the long run okay two
quick note Swift playgrounds is now
available from Apple as a free iPad app
on the App Store and it helps kids and
you know even some adults to learn how
to code using Apple's Swift programming
language for developing Mac and iOS apps
and Twitter is coming to the Apple TV
Amazon fire and Xbox one with their new
video app that will broadcast live
streams of Thursday night NFL football
