delivery service we visited their new
urban distribution center in Manhattan
to see how they get last-minute holiday
orders to you what if some of the
challenges been of creating a
distribution center in the middle of
Manhattan we're standing right in the
center literally of Manhattan we're on
34th Street that's both a blessing and a
challenge obviously this is a pricey
place for real estate right in the
center of everything but it also means
that we can get to all customers that we
have in this really dense area in less
than an hour and so it's actually a
great location to be G once your order
is received an Amazon employee will
retrieve your items and get them ready
for delivery customers might be
surprised at the diversity of products
that we carry and also the way they're
actually stored on the Shelf we actually
store the items on the shelves as soon
as they come in so the items are put
directly onto the shelves and they're
available to sale for customers right
away and then our back-end algorithms
actually tell the folks who are picking
the orders how to do it in the fastest
way possible so it looks a little bit
crazy with all this different stuff on
the shelves but it actually gives us a
lot of efficiency right here's examples
of our Kindle Fire HD this is an Xbox
these are great gifts for the holiday I
see a Dell right there that's one of our
number one sellers right now and of
course we have tons of wrapping paper so
that people who have last-minute needs
can get all of their stuff wrapped in
time when a package is ready a courier
will walk bike or drive it to you with
any luck even procrastinating shoppers
can get that Xbox or flat screen TV in
time for the holidays this is Ben Fox
