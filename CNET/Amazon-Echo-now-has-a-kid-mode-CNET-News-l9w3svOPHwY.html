with your kids the smart assistant now
has a kid-friendly mode there's also new
kid content and Amazon's even selling a
special kid version of the echo dot so
there are a few layers to what Amazon is
doing here but to put it simply if you
already have an echo speaker you can
have it be more kid-friendly for free by
adding a feature called free time there
are parenting controls to lock it off
when it's time to stop playing all done
for now we can play again later
it also has tighter data privacy
protections and Alexa is designed to
talk to kids differently for example if
it hears the word please it will respond
with thanks for asking so nicely or
it'll wake you up with cutesy talk about
how it's time to eat something that's
yummy in your tummy it also is packed
with more cheesy dad jokes Alexa tell me
a dinosaur Jo let's have plain weird but
true let's play you can take it a step
further by adding extra kids content to
the echo it's gonna cost an extra three
dollars a month for Prime members it has
access to children's audio books custom
radio stations and playlists and special
skills for interactive Disney stories
and Nickelodeon games and kids can also
set wake up alarms featuring voices from
their favorite Disney or Nickelodeon
characters but if you want it all in a
nice little package there is a new echo
dot peas edition and that's gonna cost
eighty dollars it's about thirty bucks
more than the normal echo dot because
this comes with a colorful rubber
protective bumper and two year warranty
so if your kid throws it down the stairs
well no questions asked it will be
replaced and this is similar to what
Amazon does for its kid version of the
tablet it also comes with a year of
access to all that extra kid's content
and games that I talked about kids
already talked to their family echoes so
what do you think of Amazon's new
features focused on kids sound off in
the comments I'm Bridget Carey and you
can find more details on the echo dot
