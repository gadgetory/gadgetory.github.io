wireless contract I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update t-mobile is
killing the traditional two-year
wireless contract the carrier jumped the
gun on its scheduled tuesday
announcement and changed its website
over the weekend with new pricing before
when you got a discount on a new phone
you really were paying for that phone
over time through the data plan t-mobile
is ditching that system but here's the
kicker you can either pay for a phone at
full price up front or pay off a phone
over the course of time with monthly
fees a 2gig data plan with unlimited
talk and text will cost you sixty
dollars a month but if you want to get
the samsung galaxy s3 you could pay a
hundred and ten dollars up front and pay
an extra twenty dollars a month for two
years until you pay off the phone and if
you get an older or less popular phone
you might not have to pay anything
upfront and just pay a lower monthly fee
to pay it off expect to get more details
on the new pricing structure in the days
to come Barnes and Noble is working to
bring in app payments to nook tablets
in-app purchases are common in games or
players might buy items to improve their
chances of winning it's also worth
noting that Barnes &amp;amp; Noble is running a
special deal until March 30th if you buy
a nuke HD Plus tablet you get a free
nook simple touch e ink reader which
normally goes for eighty dollars
linkedIn has improved its search engine
the system will tailor a search result
to your interest and network so if you
type in product manager you might get a
different result from somewhere else
it'll get smarter with more searches and
it'll let you get alerts for saved
searches lawmakers in West Virginia are
seeking to ban drivers from using google
glass it would be an amendment to a
current law that prohibits texting while
driving but to also prohibit wearing a
wearable computer with a head-mounted
display while behind the wheel because
that's also distracted driving if you've
been waiting for the HTC One smartphone
and it's all aluminum body it's facing a
launch delay because of camera parts the
HTC One is expected to arrive in the US
by the end of April
there's some good android app news today
snip snap is a coupon app that lets you
scan your printed clipped coupons and
save them into your phone or you can
find coupons that are scanned by other
users it's been available for free and
iTunes but now it's on Android and the
Evernote app for Android is updated with
features that are found in the iOS

your written notes and turns them into
