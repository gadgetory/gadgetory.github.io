aim to go against Samsung's Galaxy S
nine and while it has a lot of things
going for it it doesn't have quite
enough to beat out its competitor or
justify its higher price as part of LG's
thin queue line of quote unquote smart
devices the g7 s camera has some
artificial intelligence features the
camera can identify more than a thousand
objects and images then group these
things into 18 different categories like
a person flower or food it'll then auto
adjust the camera settings accordingly
and suggest filters pictures can look
more vibrant with these AI adjustments
since the contrast is cranked higher it
also helped with overexposure and
lighting but overall I found myself
skipping over the future it can be
distracting and while the novelty is fun
at first
the g7 algorithms need to be more
accurate and worked faster LG retain the
secondary wide-angle camera too bumping
the specs from 13 megapixels to 16 you
can also take portrait photos from both
cameras with the tap of a button
below the volume rocker is a button to
launch google assistant when does the
World Cup start 2018 World Cup begins on
Thursday June 14 2018 double press the
key and it could run an image search
with google lens though this gives you
quick access to Google's handy digital
assistant you can't reprogram the button
at least for now
which is kind of a drag the phone is
also still waterproof has wireless
charging and has a headphone jack LG
added a brand new notch as well which
you could change the color of the bars
next to it or hide it all together at
the same time however the LG G 7 doesn't
have much of an X Factor that sets it
apart from its competitors while it's
great that the phone is water-resistant
the design feels very familiar at this
point and it just doesn't look as sleek
as a s9 in addition it's battery life is
unimpressive during our battery drain
test for continuous video playback the
phone lasted 12 and a half hours the g6
from 2017 lasted a whole hour longer
than that and the Galaxy S nine clocked
in nearly fifteen and a half hours on
top of that the g7 is more expensive
than LG flagships of years past about 80
to 100 dollars more depending on the
carrier sure it has more internal memory
than before but that's still a notable
amount of money to ask users for
something not super compelling despite
being an all-around great phone but
that's the curse of LG even though the
g7 is a solid and reliable phone it's
underwhelming AI experienced an average
battery life can't push it to the top of
the ranks
