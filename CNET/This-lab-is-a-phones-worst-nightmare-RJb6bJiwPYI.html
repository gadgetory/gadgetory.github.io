on purpose some not so much but these
guys have it done with science I think
sometimes people here in meetings drop
their phones on purpose it almost feels
like it sometimes we went to the
OtterBox labs in Fort Collins Colorado
to figure out how they make their cases
tough enough to protect your phone from
just about anything
whoa it starts with getting the phone
specs from the manufacturer if it's a
galaxy phone they'll have them ahead of
lunch but in the case of an iPhone even
OtterBox is kept in the dark about every
conference room is booked and we're
live-streaming the Tim Cook speech as
well following all the information all
the details and stuff within 24 hours
they're ready to 3d print cases in this
monster printer to get the feel for how
it would work on an actual phone and
make the necessary changes before they
go to mass production and that's not
even the half of it the real testing
happens inside the pit an entire lab
devoted to torturing cases each one goes
through a minimum of 24 tests a lot our
industry standards while others were
inspired by cussing the horror stories
and that's how they came up with the
first test this transform Maytag dryer
spins a phone inside of a purse holding
loose change keys and even a nail file
about a hundred tumbles with a meter
drop at each end then there's what looks
like a tanning bed for phone cases which
test you the exposure also a machine
that rubs a piece of fabric on a case
over and over again and one whose sole
purpose in life is to press a button
really we're putting a wrapper if you
will on someone else's product when we
do that we want to make sure that we are
not making the way that that thing
performs that device performs any less
and it would be than when it's the bear
than a device that includes audio
quality some of the more rugged OtterBox
cases and the water-resistant lifeproof
cases a sister brand of OtterBox
undergoes sound test in the studio with
this guy
get spooky I'm not sure definitely not
English the dummy emits a series of
sounds covering every pitch in the vocal
spectrum to test that the case won't
muffle your conversations love you too
okay bye after a day of putting these
cases through the ringer I asked if they
ever pushed them beyond the standard
testing limits which is how I ended up
standing below the guillotine the
ultimate torture machine that can drop a
phone from up to two stories to three
Wow and then we didn't break anything on
our visit we learned the torture testing
is a serious business
