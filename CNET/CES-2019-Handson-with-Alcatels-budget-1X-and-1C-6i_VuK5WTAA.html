phones here at CES 2019 the Alcatel One
X and the one C the one X is the more
advanced of the two relatively speaking
will sell for about $120 globally
including in North America the 1c
however will sell for about 70 euros and
it's not coming to North America it is
aimed at markets like the Middle East
Latin America in parts of Europe let's
start with the Alcatel One X it has a
5.5 inch display with a 720p HD plus
screen and it runs Android 8.1 Oreo that
isn't the most recent version of Android
which is Android 9 high but a phone at
this price point can still give you all
the Google goodness you need with Oreo
note that this is the full version not
the lighter Android go version that some
phones in this category have the One X
is very thin and light with a kind of a
no-slip tactile backing that borders on
rough it's got a little thin glossy
racing stripe on the side
Alcatel calls this two-tone but it's
really not inside you have a 1.5
gigahertz quad-core MediaTek chipset and
2 gigabytes of RAM you get 16 gigabytes
of storage inside which is pretty slim
but again this is a budget phone you can
also spill over an extra 128 gigabytes
onto the microSD card slot or you could
use the slides and go dual SIM there's a
dual rear camera with 13 megapixel and 2
megapixel lenses and a 5 megapixel front
facing camera there's a kind of a cool
camera interface and there is portrait
mode you may not get the highest quality
photos from the One X but you're not
gonna miss out on those depth effects
shots at least color wise the phone will
sell in black and blue
now that August l1c on the other hand is
much smaller and very plastic feeling
even though it has a snazzier design on
the backing it's got a thicker profile
and has these thick bezels around the
screen speaking of the screen you get a
5-inch display with a 960 by 480
resolution that's very low and it does
run the Android 8go Edition that we were
just talking about
there's a five megapixel camera on the
back and a two megapixel camera on the
front but only one gigabyte of RAM and
eight gigabytes of on-board storage
expandable storage support tops out at
32 gigabytes this one will come in black
and blue but latin-americans will also
be able to buy it in blush pink there
are no sale dates for any of these
phones exactly yet but look for them to
start launching in January on low-cost
carriers and in retail stores while
these two Alcatel phones may not exactly
excite you they are positioned to sell
for when a low price is your ultimate
priority make sure you're checking out
