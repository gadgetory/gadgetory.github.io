CNET today we're gonna take a look at
the Microsoft wedge mobile keyboard so
this is a new $80 keyboard from
Microsoft it's pretty expensive but it's
also one of the best tablet keyboards
that we've seen so it's got a nice clean
look here you see this rubber case on
top sitting around to the back you can
see the metal backing so the case
actually serves a couple purposes when
it's on the keyword shuts off
automatically take it off you can see
here's the keyboard pretty
straightforward design here then the
case also doubles as a stand for a
tablet so I've got a sample iPad here
works in landscape portrait mode and
what's nice about it is that the
keyboard is Bluetooth so it'll work with
pretty much anything that supports
Bluetooth and the stand is designed so
that will work with pretty much any
tablet as well as any tablet with a case
on so for the keyboard itself it's
actually a pretty small design compared
to other mobile keyboards but still it's
pretty satisfying to type on it has a
nice sturdy feel to it when it's on a
desk keys are nice and responsive so the
keyboard gets his name in part from this
wedge on the bottom side and that serves
a couple purposes first gives it some
elevation which is useful it also houses
the batteries and there's a nice design
behind that pop this button out here the
battery tray slides out takes two triple
a's and what's a convenient design
feature for travelers is that the sled
doesn't actually come out of the
keyboard entirely it stays right in
there you can pop batteries in like no
problem and it slides back in over here
on the side of the wedge is the
Bluetooth connection button you hold
that down for three seconds or so and
you'll get the connectivity light here
letting you know that it's ready to pair
up so with Windows eight on the way from
Microsoft this is designed with that new
operating system in mind you can see the
new windows 8 logo button here as well
as up top you've got four hot keys to
Windows 8 charm buttons which take you
to certain specific features like
searching sharing and some others so we
say this is one of the best tablet
keywords we've seen because it's stand
is so simple for one thing and the size
of this thing makes it really pretty
easy to travel with so have a couple of
the key words here for comparison we
have the Apple wireless keyboard that
you may be familiar
works with an iPad or an OS 10 device
you can see here the Microsoft Board is
about the same length but it's also
thinner from top to bottom and here we
have the Logitech tablet keyboard for
iPad now this is a nice keyboard but
it's a little bit bigger here also and
this case is not quite as intuitive as
this one and it's just sort of a little
clunkier overall one other feature about
this keyboard that you may appreciate
you can take the rubber case put it back
on here you're gonna have the wedge
again if you take your tablet put the
keyboard on the wedge X is sort of a
convenient carrying ledge for you there
and you can kind of trot around to the
next meeting or wherever and carry the
two devices without too much hassle so
80 bucks again this is pretty expensive
but it's also really versatile and it
just simply works well with any device
we've tried so we're all I can recommend
this without reservation so I'm rich
Brown this is the Microsoft wedge mobile
