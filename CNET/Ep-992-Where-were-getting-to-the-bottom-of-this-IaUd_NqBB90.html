404 show on cnet I'm Jeff Bakalar I'm
Wilson tang mmm that what I'm Justin you
this is the show we're getting to the
bottom of this these shenanigans
shenanigans that wouldn't call Janet
shenanigans are that's a really
meaningful word that's when you know
someone serious when they use the word
shenanigans what are we talking about
here talk about the live stream event or
the weekend there's a lot of stuff to
knock them there's nothing nothing has
nothing happened to Megan god you're
insensitive what do you mean such a
prick about a pretty you yeah you are
what Lexi the definition is you're a
picture you weren't this a pathetic when
Michael Jackson died i'm not a pathetic
it said cracking jokes I'm not crack
jokes racket you guys so it's not funny
at all you know I get tired of uh like I
thought I got about all these things
especially who Twitter and push
notifications like is it it almost it's
scary to look down at your phone now
like you know every time you get one of
these notifications obviously if you
don't know when you use the best way
this weekend and that was just like a
you know it happened when we were
actually about to go out for dinner and
have some fun with some friends and you
know I'm sure it was just so depressing
it it said for sure what I ruin the
evening well we talked every one yeah
the Grammys were pretty said to what I
find what I find a weird is not even you
know uh her specific death what's
crazies like every week now there's
these trends on Twitter uh celebrities
who are not dead right and that's
becoming a problem that's when you know
that Twitter is way too popular uh
because all the idiots are out there and
every stupid person who's ever had any
stupid ideas like and how do these
things are they propagated by the last
week it was Kim jong-un got assassinated
by ninjas ninjas but it's always like
someone we was like Morgan Freeman Jeff
Goldblum yeah George Lopez these all
ball these people are alive and well
right but Twitter for like eight hours a
day kills a celebrity that's not really
dead do you ever
back in 2010 I feel like there was a
rumor that Whitney Houston had actually
overdosed um well that it does have a
weird fortune well let's not lie to
ourselves it's not unbelievable that
that would have she's had issues for a
while but nobody expected her to be to
pass away at relatively young age of 48
definitely young for sure us really said
there is a tech angle on this though so
obviously after she died people went to
places like Amazon and iTunes to buy her
greatest hits album and it became number
one immediately on both of those I would
easily mad right but then soon afterward
it actually jumped the price jump sixty
percent whoa on amazon and itunes yeah
it went from around 787 originally so
there's like 12 62 that's the price when
generally things are sort of like in the
bargain bin run itunes the bargain bin
price is like about eight dollars right
right which is probably why it's because
no one really purchased that all i mean
everyone had the ultimate connection
collection already and then i guess and
they bought it more on twitter and the
headline was like itunes is trying to
trying to capitalize on the unfortunate
death of a miss houston right that turns
out not to be sort of like itunes
apple's fault yeah it was something else
right it was sony's issue sony hike the
price up up well sony owns all the
rights okay Houston's catalog and I
guess when they saw the house and sales
rising they raised the cost of the
wholesale price he's not raised because
of the individual can't you not do that
isn't that Aaliyah whatever the heck
means you want to help your own if
you're on the right thing I thought you
could not do that under certain certain
circumstance elite you could but the
government can stop it come into you can
raise the prices the equivalent of a
hurricane in the entertainment it is
entertainment industry but nobody's you
know nobody's gonna die with I because
they're not gonna listen to what Houston
I understand the difference but still
but that is pretty effed up it is not
more than F it's okay that's beyond
after peti Reddy Oh Jesse were heard of
Winston
see I will always love you this morning
in the pre-show is like white what is
Adi good just make that up the bodyguard
yes I know that's all like and you have
like puzzled look on your face I don't
know that part I know the chorus the one
that's you know what I was like just one
know the one shows one note yeah that's
really good oh stop you called Adele
addley last week that no no sorry you
didn't know what good will was so that
how is that a win they're both in the
kid at a loss for me I was that a den 11
freeze I remember yeah don't forget are
you smart who's talking over here what's
that are you smarter than a 5th grader
sometimes occasional is to be a pop
culture genius ah dude don't don't you
dare I that is not the case here I want
to dance with somebody someone that is
my favorite whitney houston song well
it's not you know it's not very manly of
me but I don't care because it's a great
song I slid across the kitchen floor in
the speaking of high school who and
Twitter that doesn't know anything so
there's this kind of meme going up
somebody did a search for who is Paul
McCartney okay during the Grammys man
and it returned dozens upon dozens of
tweets presumably from somebody who's
probably under 10 and Adele uh who is
like who the f is Paul McCartney see I
don't blame I don't blame a young person
for not knowing i blame their parents
for not telling them who that's that the
pair I mean you're ten I mean I guess
someone who's ten should have heard of
the Beatles yeah you would imagine you
would imagine I oh my goodness this is
just we're just scrolling through a
seemingly endless list of people asking
Twitter who is Paul pry the same people
who say rest in peace you know Wayne
Brady as you know like it's it's
ridiculous how man it's stupid there
should be a total sort of censorship on
Twitter you should be able to pet you
have to pass some sort of a GED
equivalent to be user to it right there
are a lot of people on Twitter last
night when Chris Brown came out uh that
went to Twitter and said oh man this is
kind of messed up but I'd like Chris
Brown beat me like that what a trending
thing I saw there was a whole list of
stuff on buzz
feed about people just saying that you
know various iterations of that phrase I
we put the furniture yeah I think I let
him beat me no I offer i wiII for
American you are weep for our culture
because I absolutely like refuse to have
watch or you know pay anything or
anything Chris Brown relates crazy
people like call me crazy but I would
like Chris Brown beat me up any day see
now I feel like they may be a joke I
don't know me cry don't know I'd like
Chris Brown beat me up anytime that they
all say the same but these are all crazy
women right these are the women that
make it okay its various way I'm serious
they by saying that you are not your
you're throwing yourself under the but
how could you do that to your gin how
dare you represent your gender though
Scott cheeky though it is Twitter you
think it's fair I I mean half the crap I
say what do you know one my talking
about eighty-nine percent of the self I
sands witter the whole website now my to
come in it's not some sort of
self-promotion threat it's something
completely useless I could go in one
year now the other way and then I've
lost everyone it's weird because you
would imagine given like all the
articles and all the warnings of like Oh
Twitter's public and if you ever want a
job don't tweet anything that stupid you
could always go back and deletes them
Twitter yeah we should really only last
for a week you should be able to specify
an expiration date after each tweet
weather service we found that day yeah I
forget what it's called but it should be
ingrained in the Twitter service right
I'm cuz does not you ever want to go
back to and read your old tweet oh I was
sometimes I mean about 300 hours ago you
know like no way the only reason why is
for people to call you out on something
you can yeah that's what I'm saying they
should all be transitive it's only
designed to backfire nothing good can
come of that having a complete you know
an anthology of your tweets yeah
speaking of Adele uh do you want to talk
about your newfound love of man artists
i I've known about her she's not like
news to me I took me a really long time
to learn about Lady Gaga that I will
admit I was way behind the curve oh she
was kind of sort of but I went say
underground but like she was popular
amongst like a certain small crowd yeah
won't even know if you can say that I
have no idea but what was what I thought
was really cool about Adele was that
when she wants you
thanked her doctor would like yeah
because Roger throat sir yeah and like
you know it was it wasn't anything like
you know it was just like hey guess what
this guy fixed me up thanks right she's
awesome what a sweetheart really cool
 looks relatively normal oh god she
is painfully norm yeah that's the weird
thing it's like you it's a shock here
music you expect her to just because
she's so passionate like they have some
sort of uh just very distinctive look
and she just that's almost the reason
why I feel like a lot of people like
physically normal or her she just her
demeanor her attitude of right next door
she just looks like she's awesome she's
slowly Osborne to me whenever I know
better think twice she has a British
accent no no physically I don't know she
just reminds me of her oh she's much
more attractive than Kelly Osbourne yeah
well have nothing against Kelly Osbourne
have you ever cried to any of Adele
songs you know but i understand it out
here it's like that tier note yeah you
know what I mean absolutely if there's
something about that song and they make
fun of it on Saturday Night Live to have
you ever seen that women like you yeah
they all the window washers cry yeah
like pans across are pretty good it's
pretty good yeah well actually I'm
speaking of that there's an article in
The Wall Street Journal this came out
last Friday but I wanted to talk about
it uh a British psychologist is kind of
analyzed a bunch of tracks including
Adele Someone Like You and he realized
that a lot of those passages have a
similar characteristic and they all
contain this musical device called
appoggiatura wasn't I know you're a big
classical music fan this is Marcia not
sure what our tour is appoggiatura is
basically an ornamental note that
clashes with the melody and creates a
dissonant sound to wear those
conflicting tones create an emotional
response in the listener Wow um and so
you find these types of notes in sounds
like someone like you also in uh what's
that Eric Clapton song tears in heaven
oh yeah yeah of something like that or
yeah and everybody hurts all those kind
of songs that invoke that really strong
tier drinking reaction they all contain
appoggiatura don't you think it's it's
that's only part of the equation though
I mean the context you know the context
of the song I mean her beautiful voice
doesn't make me cry
right but there's so much passion in let
me Jenny when Christian no I wanna
elevates you want to correct things I
don't cry from your singing to Adele I
can cry I can't know I've read I have
cried there was one too no I cried and
but I can understand / appreciate that
emotional sort of trigger that happened
it's a really sad song she's talking
about this guy who's broke up with and
she it's really sad yeah and she's young
so you know like what young love is a
bit you know it's your very emotional no
does it to me is that like she most of
the song is really quiet and then in
crescendos and then all of a sudden the
chorus just goes up and when she laughs
she lasts out that course you can I've
never I'm not sure there's a song where
you can understand how emotionally
affected the artist is yes in a chorus
because when she belts that out it's
like Jesus I'm is supposed to be
watching you seeing this this is a very
intimate moment that maybe you should be
having with yourself yeah wow it's it's
it's beautiful well do you guys have
songs that that invokes that reaction
out of you is there one particular song
weather associated with someone
situation or an ex-girlfriend or
something that makes you really just I
don't know man I don't need to come on
I'm thinking of like College it's
getting in the dark ages ya know when
things were real real black yeah okay
well i don't know i don't have a
specific song though it's all like it's
all like nonsense pop punk sort of stuff
90's music does bring me back to the
moment with that song there's okay i got
you know i got a song is it collective
soul or soul asylum they don't run away
train no no I runaway train which one
when he's on the edge of the building um
how does it go the world I have known oh
this console yes oh yeah that's a good
one so I walk the gonna step to the
what about the sand below
said that sir that's a very good hi this
is a little person I would say it's
music but like things like uh I can't
watch medical dramas anymore like I
don't like I with other so nonsensical
the general really like with my zynga
other like I can't I just are
understandable I don't sound like it's
weirder stuff that i watch house all the
time before and then now like I turn it
on it's sort of like is it how science
fiction a lot of it is but a moment
somebody she's like tumor I'm right no
just I definitely understand that Wilson
I thought you were gonna say the UH the
opening music to when you turn on an
apple macintosh computer is like a child
every time I you know I get when it when
you know when you could feel like
yourself getting teary-eyed you like
that do I love it I do love it yeah
Fleetwood Mac landslide that one don't
get it right come on Bonnie Raitt I
can't make you love me really oh these
are like kind of old songs too yeah it
hurts me I think um here's a heaven I
guess that's why they call them dear
heaven especially when if you know
there's about as kid right Elton John I
guess I'm a bit guess that's why they
call the blues that you said song yeah
yawn or going towards the movies that's
stupid don't ever cry is there anything
like a movie I get weird emotion at
weird times like you might see if this
is stupid but I'm just gonna be honest
with people if I see like certain scenes
from like sporting events to that like I
have emotional attachments as a child
too yeah like the first time like the
miracle and yeah like stuff like that
guy's gets me a little teary-eyed
because like I wasn't alive but I can
appreciate the emotion right okay you
know like the first time I saw a green
day I remember I was like twelve oh wow
I cannot believe I'm seeing these guys
cried at the show I was like teary-eyed
for a second yeah a little bit cry if I
was at a show right now and I look to my
side and I saw 12 world kid crying I
would cry I'll cry yeah I'll try looking
at him I feel like oh my god is your
first time seeing yes Ben
that I've known before using been a lot
of rain good job you know what seeing
gets me every time and over actually
being in the theater as a kid and crying
during this movie somewhere out there in
the movie and americantale Bible yeah
yeah some more others when him and his
sister separated on their different
countries and they're looking at the
moon and singing to each other said by
james ingram and Linda Ronstadt ah yeah
that's def it's not very sad then
there's that seen whether on the soap
box right there like on drifting away on
doing oh my gosh it's tough man won't
you make it over like thinking yeah the
ranking yeah I guess but that is said
but you cry at wally and that's
unacceptable what libels bible is much
sadder nothing much sin ya know what was
crying our future though or up up ahead
opposite opposite talking about old
movies we are jumbo we're bumming
literally everyone had not imagine if
you guys watch SNL this weekend I did
actually i'm close the verizon 4g uh
yeah LTE gonna get that was a layer it
was pretty good and it sort of puts in
perspective the world that at least we
go to every single day like we're seeing
that talking about like that you know
droid xyboard just like for some reason
seems normal right but then you step out
into reality like oh that's the reason
why people don't see I didn't think the
commercial was that funny I thought the
slogan at the end was funny words i'm
using old peoples engine whatever that
was funny right that was funny because
that's definitely true these poor people
i'm glad that people are finding
realizing this finally in the
nomenclature how long have we been
saying yeah ridiculous oh so confusing
how dare they attempt to it wine is one
day we're gonna be that guy see haven't
see I know I know we're biased because
we're young now I can't imagine a future
where we don't understand technology but
don't forget people who were in their
70s and 80s and grew up you know without
you know without even television yeah
you know it's like they I don't think it
said I don't understand what it means is
that they don't just they just don't
care if they don't know parents find out
what it is and I don't blame the party I
don't give a crap either who would blame
them yeah blame who could blame a 75
year old for not knowing 4G LTE right
they don't need to be downloading thing
are just song their psyche they're alive
I don't know about that I'm dude a life
expenses gone up it's a big deal there
never fish to fry in their priorities
there's sales going on local grocery
stores they need to conserve they're
worried about their children and their
grandchildren people in a yard there's
kids driving by their house that they
need to yell at you know like you know
when I visited my grandma playing those
streets my grandma has a cell phone yeah
she didn't know if she uses any more
like even to meet the fact that she was
using a cell phone at one point was just
blowing my mind how dare we lay this
responsibility like that she even has a
strength to push down on at all what I'm
saying oh and that's not what I'm saying
all right grandma back and I you know
but they all get golf right they'll
understand go that's a complicated game
it's true give him some little bit of
credit oh boy um you know let's get to
some calls because we got to go short
shows on Mondays you guys know the
situation let's let's handle some of
these time to show the love a jig 6404
cnet
I need a good cry it's been a while yeah
don't cry you do this after the show hey
for four guys this is Chicago from Lucca
was having dinner with my girlfriend
when she told me that she'd never seen
the fifth element much to my horror
immediately after we went to dinner i
wrenched over to best buy and purchase
it made her wash it over at her house
hmm to my horror and she was
underwhelmed no muss begins my new
search for a new girlfriend I mean I
can't disagree with this guy he brings
up a decent question though do you think
that fifth element holds up now to
people that had never watched it in this
big questions good question i'm bias I'm
gonna say yes yeah I am you watch stuff
I mean it revokes that sort of nostalgia
like it's hard to divorce you know like
oh when I saw it back then how awesome
it was right to how I'm feeling right
now so i know i'm pretty sure uh the
okay the scenes where he's driving the
cab some of those probably look a little
suspect but today standard the action
scenes are still really good actions
really good all the like the fly
throughs all the the establishing shots
of you know New York and way in the
future yeah I think that looks good
still milla jovovich still ha still huh
that's never gonna change he'll make it
for a second yeah all right let's uh
let's respect that move on down to the
frame oh I know I know exactly the
timecode know all the coordinates oh man
no just yeah you know look it was a nice
run you didn't have to go your other
separate ways I'm sorry if you get a
breeze she cared about you she would
pretend to like it that's how you I
don't got a problem her not having ever
see on the movie got a problem with her
seeing it and then you know not long
that she enjoyed she saw how passionate
you were sick and good bro for this is
an diego from stephen i was actually
just calling in regards to your friday
show and he had a gut man on and i
actually wanted to comment on a
throwaway comment that Justin seemed to
make about what earbuds he used he
mentioned that he uses I guess the
ultimate years 18 earbuds and I have a
crappy twenty dollar pair of earbuds so
I figured I'd check them out and if
they're the right ones that are listed
on the logic
website it looks like there's thirteen
hundred dollars so I was kind of
wondering how someone who lives in a
shoebox apartment and survive solely on
Domino's Pizza was able to afford
thirteen hundred dollar earbuds well
that's why he is in a jam down no it's
like a chicken in the egg hunt it's true
so uh what we were talking about last
week was in ear monitors these are
custom earphones that you can get from
an audiologist that's a jewel of your
ear there thirteen hundred dollars 1350
when the words monitor or in the name of
the device like that generally means
that it's actually like alright so what
would explain the situation how do you
have these mm well an ultimate ears bus
broke down in front of the scene
analysis and splaying out earphones
everywhere no I mean I've been testing
them out for review on that uh you know
we showed a picture of Steve's pair I
think he had one from a different
company yeah they all cost this much
money these are usually reserved for
musicians or the one percent like anyone
that really really really cares about
their music but generally had three
pairs because for my tears I threw mine
away they got my way when I just rip
them in half and throw away these are
everyday it's a contact yeah yeah poppin
tags these are really crazy sounding i
mean i wish i could have you guys hear
them but they're custom wont to my ears
they have six different drivers in each
ear it's crazy you could hear the
artists heart beating yeah which which
are the ones i have the ten eyes you
have vidya 10v eyes yeah those aren't
cheap either i think those are 350 400
or what they're amazing what's the price
you recommend for like most people out
there were like you can expect to spend
I mean that's and it looks pretty decent
good sound okay eighteen hundred dollars
a lot of money you can spend a buck
fifty under buck fifty and get really
good quality alright anywhere you have
it straight from the horse's mouth yeah
that horse is mounted a beautiful horse
next call hey it's Brooklyn from jimmy
and i'm calling about friday show with
the steve on and you guys talk about
bands with some longevity and so you
guys were saying how hard it was think
it so much i can't believe that you guys
had to get you to and I got imagine it
you know whether you love them or hate
them you gotta admit that they're pretty
general very loud knocking but that's a
innovative stuff over the years
agomovies different types of blood be
invented himself I don't know just throw
that out there love yeah we didn't
forget punctuated with that okay I'll be
the first to admit Joshua trees a good
record notes it is a good record but I
hate you too yeah oh my god do I dislike
them so much so much they're not but
they're no no I did that's not fair to
say is it not though Wilson if it's not
don't you know if he's no longer whoa no
rug like it come on I don't dude it's
not my cup of tea man i don't i'm not a
big I think Nickelback is more what
white stuff than you two yeah and just
because they're making soundtracks to
musicals now doesn't mean that they're
still making good music right like we're
talking about artists that have
continually made albums right build upon
each other grow evolve I think most
people our age or I guess us we could
collectively say like we are constantly
surprised that they continue to be my
platinum I'm very surprised that they
find as much success as they currently
do I think they just it's just like it
they got one or two songs that are good
it's like Tyler Perry he's gonna
continue coming out with stuff somebody
managing it's gonna make with four
billion dollars at the box off right I
don't know if you'll be trying to these
and buying the albums I mean I know
they're important to a lot of people
they are I don't see that I never really
i think that jut like i said joshua tree
good record also 20 years old that
record in probably more yeah so I yeah I
don't know would not employ you two up
with Michael Jackson though in terms of
Quran no no way nowhere near each other
the one dude calls himself the edge not
sure I feel about that either yeah bono
look it was charitable I guess yeah I
think it makes me believe he's
charitable yeah right you know who's
made consistently good music and um you
guys might not agree with this Mariah
Carey yeah my carry-on still makes gonna
take anything away from her yeah
yeah if you did in the 80s in the
90s whatever the next decade was hot
whatever yeah it's called seriously good
