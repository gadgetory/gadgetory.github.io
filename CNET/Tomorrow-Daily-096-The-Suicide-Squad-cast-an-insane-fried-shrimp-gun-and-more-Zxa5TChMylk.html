ultrasound to create objects that you
can actually reach out and touch we have
a new Joker for the superhero movies and
then a bunch of other Suicide Squad
people so but they are not us we were
not cast also we're going to tell you
how Google's made with code project is
going to let you program the lights on a
Christmas tree display in Washington DC
super exciting don't get your hopes up
tomorrow daily
greetings citizen to the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk shows known universe i'm your host
Ashley's gonna join me once again kale
anonymous finished with his pizza SP not
I told you not to tell people I was
doing this all right I was just a suit I
guessed then and then I was right later
and it just got weird I'm gonna delete
this footage off of youtube anyways
weird absence yeah this never happened
but you know what did happen news hour
headlines I got resident look like that
me too me too okay we go alright so we
gotta talk about haptic feedback know
we've covered the XO glove that allows
you to sort of feel feedback in Virtual
Reality remember that crazy-looking exit
very cool and then we also talked about
ultrasound being used to make a haptic
keyboard like a holographic keyboard you
can feel it so it's a little bit
different but it's a kind of in the same
vein so this comes from the University
of Bristol's Department of Computer
Sciences they have invented a new method
of haptic feedback that allows you
actually see the object in questions you
can see this this woman is like reaching
and touching this object this is really
cool so the way that they set this up
and how it works is they're using
complex ultrasound patterns and then
they focus them into shapes and they
cause air disturbances so for example if
you were to feel these sort of
ultrasound this array you'd be able to
kind of feel almost like a haptic
feedback like something that was
actually pushing against your hand okay
okay so they're using that and usually
you wouldn't be able to see this
technology but in the video I believe
that they're using like I almost like a
hologram or you know computer-generated
but this right here what you're seeing
is oil so they're showing you the shapes
that they're making with ultrasound
inside this oil so that's what you're
seeing right now on the screen so there
you go so single sided double sided so
they modulate the ultrasound at certain
frequencies to create these shapes you
can rotate the shapes and everything so
the neat thing about this is and here
this is where it gets kind of cool so
this looks kind of like okay well it's
sort of weird like what exactly we're
going to do with this technology well
they say that obviously you'd want to
pair this type of technology with a
display maybe a holographic display and
in doing so you could do things like
if I were a surgeon maybe I could reach
into a holographic catskil CT scan and
feel the difference between say an organ
and a tumor or maybe if I was going to I
here's another kuchel sex question and
eyes busy setting so you would just
reach out and be able to have raised
gauges like I having to look out okay
and then also one of the things they
mentioned was people in a museum might
be able to reach out and touch an
artifact without actually touching the
physical object oh that's great too so
really cool sort of Hope's first
technicality and science yeah really
really need like a just kind of a cool
use of the technology that may come into
play in a very big way later but just
really awesome scratching the surface
yeah it is virtually scratching yeah
it's just a little little scratch on
service but really neat to see and also
um the thing that got me the most
excited was all the potential uses in
the future yeah we should got a nail
holographic displays that's the next so
we can drive and you know text yeah it
is okay so let's let's not wait we got
to jump into this I was so excited you
weren't here yesterday and they
announced the news right in the middle
of the show and I'm like okay kills
gonna be able to talk about it tomorrow
okay so Suicide Squad was kind of one of
the things that they announced for
everyone was kind of like okay whatever
okay subscribe right yeah sure okay well
there was a lot of buzz around casting
because there was a lot of a-listers in
there like on the rumors turns out most
of them are right yeah Ryan Gosling not
included so here's what we got first of
all we got a new Joker and it's jared
leto it's Jesus okay it's not Jesus let
him um so so that was that was exciting
as letter everybody is totally cool with
this one you don't know it's not true
that's that true I saw so many r AG
people on the internet oh no people
aren't happy saying he's too pretty okay
whoa whoa I disagree Oh scuffle continue
I mean he pleasure was pretty beautiful
man all right let's get okay so the next
one is is what do you got what do you
got oh yeah oh yeah Will Smith's gonna
be dead shot so now I mean this is
obviously the biggest title well it's a
big change from the comic because we'll
spot will smith is black good dead shot
in car quite but kind of cool that DC
has kind of really been
more committed i would say so far to
diversity right and marvel which is very
interesting I mean I guess black panther
Chadwick no Chadwick Boseman but ya know
we gotta get a female and then we have
then we have Tom Hardy he's now playing
in a note another DC hey listen nobody I
got a theory of different I got a theory
about okay he's in this new DC movies in
Suicide Squad because nobody can
understand what bane was saying so it's
as if he was never in a DC movie
previously like we didn't really give
such a transformation now he's gonna be
like Tom Hardy like you're gonna see me
like that's Tom Hardy yeah Susie hidden
behind it you know yeah okay yeah you
can ask you can do it it's just that's
pretty that's pretty intense I mean we
had to memorize young I mean it started
out Ryan Gosling um he uh he was a great
return oh yeah Chris FL yeah IDK mandir
sevens yeah he played he was Johnny
Storm and then he also his now captain
america so I there's plenty of this so
that's fine moving on next how do you
how do you Sarah Cara Delevingne Oh
Margot Robbie and is the best one of all
yeah I should play early kales favorite
day I'm so excited I'm so excited for it
she's gonna knock it out the park she
already has the accent I know I'm a huge
listen I with you both margot robbie and
harley quinn fan and i think this is
like it's it's on point perfect so i
have to believe that the rest of them
are on point too I liked uh-huh and then
we have oh yeah Jai Courtney he's in
play boomerang which is like okay the
hits he's like the secondary out version
of Aquaman like boomerang is like it's
like Eve Aquaman and people like joke
around about aqua having the lamest but
so then you have boomerangs I don't know
what it's also Jai Courtney which I
don't it's kind of weird like a lil
Israel yeah than like who's this guy
like I know that he's in Spartacus like
I get I get it okay but knowing that
very nice guy impress us is what we're
saying very very good guy let's do this
okay and then next we have I think we've
Cara Delevingne yeah Cara Delevingne
Cara Delevingne is my eyebrow
inspiration for life yeah like my
favorite supermodel look at that quirky
quirky personality there you go she can
play enchantress oh I'm gonna do that in
a world not grounded in magic like this
is not really a magical world like this
universe
knows I don't know any way any of these
movies yet ok so then there's a
mastermind Amanda Amanda Waller but she
doesn't catch she's in cassis she's like
the villain in the movie right ok well
who are they ok who are we talking about
oh my god get ready for this ok go so uh
Viola Davis great choice hmm Octavia
Spencer amazing Jones great and Oprah
Winfrey what what Oprah yeah yeah you
know what's gonna happen there's gonna
be a moment in the movie where she's
like hey you all good car and you all
die you're gonna die you're gonna die
everybody's guns right you go to that
joke here fifth Phillies fans got him
maybe 15 like so so there you go uh
Jesse Eisenberg is rumored to come back
and play lex again come back we haven't
seen him yet but it'll be coming back
David Ayer there's a higher I've
interviewed him I should know David
David David Ayer think it's air who did
training day and and watch pitchers
Victor yeah really gritty stuff yeah
it's all like very action-oriented like
really good at that type of movie I
think he'll do very well so yeah I mean
there you go 2016 who knows how
expensive this thing is with all those a
Listerine just paying their salaries not
counting everything else where you
guessing 254 how much it cost yeah yeah
but they're banking like a superhero
recently yeah we're gonna make it but I
gotta spend money to make money but that
brings us to our TD of the day it's true
and that is hatching tds you t do it's s
1 s squad okay TS squad so we want to
know do you think that they got all
these charities right do you think that
you know maybe she's just anything
whatever your thoughts are on Susan are
you like super hardcore about Jai
Courtney and you like really want him to
play boom are you Jai Courtney oh yeah
sorry Jai I really apologize diehard
wasn't that bad um but anyway uh
obviously who's your favorite of the
casting let's say besides Margot Robbie
decides where are we
you know i right I gotta say I I was so
skeptical about Heath Ledger as the
Joker that I feel like this is right
like I because of what I saw he pled to
do with the Joker what we all saw him do
the Joker jared leto as the new Joker is
right I feel like it's going to be great
and it's gonna be different because he
it may not be better or worse it's just
gonna be different because Jared Leto's
his own person and I feel like with
Harley Quinn involved it's going to be
kind of more fun and a little bit more
like I just think it's gonna be a little
bit more it's gonna a little sexier
because i think his role is given is
like not sexy Joker not like Calvin
costumes guys but like I feel like his
depiction might be a little bit more
appealing to a lady audience and maybe a
Harley Quinn he's good that's what I'm
saying is that we're gonna he's gonna
have to build his Joker off the
relationship with Harley Quinn right
which was lately so she's Margot Robbie
and it up to like right away it gets it
gets him way away from anything that
Heath Ledger did in dark night which I
i'm all about that so this is basically
it's like well start from scratch again
so it should be interesting to see if
there's any mios other than Jesse
Eisenberg as well yeah yep although you
know the Warner Brothers doesn't
necessarily do post-credit scenes so
maybe we won't see any of that I'm
actually now i'm actually now excited
for this film like I was excited because
the harley quinn and there maybe she's
like a beautiful now now it's like got a
new Joker I've got a bunch of attacks
factors and of course Jai Courtney so
you're the you're the one you're the
reason you're the reason for it and
everybody's new favorite its crew Groot
we've got Jake we got boomerang has
boomerang have a great song no no not at
all three story there's a more
informative and interesting than than us
nerd raging out I know I apologize to
anybody that skip through that hole
let's go fast looks good okay so I got
to tell you guys about this really cool
thing it's it's called made with code so
this is a project that google launched
four years ago to help girls get into
coding like spark their interest in
coding okay now these really neat little
projects on the website where you can go
and like they have snow yuly build a
snowflake with blocks of kind of code
it's not you know full-on coding like
i'm probably a lot of you guys do but
it's too it's to help kids kind of spark
an interest
in being a coder or an engineer it's
really really neat there's like mentors
and there's community programs and all
this stuff is really awesome but here's
what they're doing for the holidays
which I thought was awesome it's very
cool it's called holiday lights made for
code holiday lights here's how it works
you drag and drop all this all these
bits and so you can see like this is how
kind of code works so you have the
outside you know the kind of the
framework of code and this is how it
works you drop in all your variables you
drop in what colors you want and you can
see a preview of a tree right there as
you are changing the variables which is
really neat and so on you can set up you
know if you want it if you want the
lights to go you know up and to the
right or back into the left easy yep and
uh and so you can do all these different
things and then the neat thing is is at
the end when you submit it you can pick
out up to i believe it's 56 states and
territories and it gets put in a queue
so here's the tree that for a producer
Logan put up message tree producer Logan
made uninspired there's no troll face on
this but hum but the cool thing is is
that it will actually show up on one of
56 trees between december fourth in
january second and how will you be able
to see it there i believe especially on
the fourth they're definitely doing a
live stream on youtube of like the tree
and i want to say maybe you can go at
any time and see like a live webcam view
of all the trees okay it's it's in a
it's kind of a tree holiday tree display
that is a little bit a ways away from
the White House but not too far so it's
in Washington DC okay and so they you're
gonna it tells you exactly what day and
time you can view your tree like your
light design which is awesome yeah I
like the coding part yeah that's really
that's really awesome and so yeah it
sort of just shows like the fundamental
idea of coding there's no actual code
being written I know producer Logan and
I both agreed we'd love to be able to
see like show me how this show me what
this code looks like and then you'd be
able to see it actually there so you can
kind of get a feeling on the side as an
extra or even yeah just like as an extra
or whatever but it's really neat there's
a whole bunch of different projects on
there if you go to made with code I com
who's doing this again Google okay so
Google and then and there's a whole
bunch of the
they have charities and other like they
really they raised a lot of money I
think have raised over 40 million
dollars for charities that help girls
get into stem Wow which is pretty cool
but they're also I mean they're very
inclusive it's like if anybody wants to
come do this you can do it so you should
go over there if you have kids or if you
are a kid at heart and you just want to
make your own little Christmas tree
light design it's really simple super
basic you're not going to be able to to
write I love Margot Robbie on your
Christmas tree and have it you know
light up well I do them one of my house
you do that you could do that your house
yeah but are you mean us it's really
cool it's really really cool so check
out made with code calm help them out if
you are so inclined if you're feeling
very charitable you can always check out
a stem stem program to donate to this
holiday season always helpful get people
in to get kids into engineering science
you know math all that's all that great
stuff get them all into it and they also
get to have this like especially if you
get to feel a part of like oh yeah house
and whatnot they'll get to just go and
see you like their tree like light up
which is really neat so it's great news
story fun I like that super good oh so
that's it for our headlines which means
we have a Japan has the best kind of
weird oh this is about goat picked one
out so we got to take a quick break but
we'll be right back with that and of
course your user feedback from yesterday
and our phone tiger for the day so don't
click away it's tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show everybody it's
time for another round of Japan as of us
kind of weird which we still don't have
a graphics and we still need to do more
often because like we do they're
definitely cuz we try to pick articles
that you can like share with people you
can be like hey you never believe like
this is a video thing that's going on
but but you haven't still like I want to
tell everybody okay let's go we have the
robot the worst robot fight club ever
yesterday and I was sad that you weren't
here for that oh they had a shoebox
robot that was fighting with um personal
massagers as legs all right what do we
got today today we have a shrimp gun and
I I that is not a euphemism in any way
shape or form is an actual shrimp got is
the coolest way ever to make tempura
okay so here's this video it's actually
commercial so yeah I'll be straight room
yeah get some eggs so we're eggs this is
a mom and her daughter it's like it this
commercial is crazy okay so here you go
she's gonna like hit the button boom ok
so i love how scared she is so here's it
goes the shrimp they're leaving eyes are
gonna get coated in flour hi done
successful yes if there's eggs beaten up
you got the eggs a lot of wasters but
there you go temporarily I've got the
flakes on there gotta get all done and
then fire bird and it just cooked about
risk them up and then they hit a giant
air bag and will operate on to the blame
haha it's amazing well cream so are
those the actual shrimp like I mean I
don't know as we know about that it's an
ad okay so this is an ad for ntt docomo
which is a carrier in Japan and this is
to advertise their new blazing fast LTE
network so they've put together special
I have no idea if those shrimp ahead of
knowledge some genius college kid is
gonna make this absolutely good or send
evening somebody needs to make this they
do it on Mythbusters when you send this
to Jamie and Adam and be like guys build
this hey I honestly think this is one of
the segments we should ask for people to
send us stuff please if you have minor
that Japan is the best kind of weird
please send them to us we want to look
at them and freak out and we want to
share them with everybody else at was
honestly i'd be willing to even change
the name of the segment two humans are
the best kind of weird if you just have
some weird stuff from whatever country
you live in
I'm where we're totally open to that
that's fine I need your busy Japan's an
easy target because there's always stuff
like that coming out of Japan which is
great um but yeah i'm i'm a big fan of
this this commercial it's it makes me
laugh oh I love how scared she gets when
explore the shrimp explode out of the
cannon it's just I'm totally sorry if
you're just listening to this you really
this is if you're listening this is the
thing that you should be seeing on the
show all right it's so good okay user
feedback oh yeah I think so used to be
back so yesterday in light of the
terrible robot competition in Japan we
asked everybody to use the hashtag TD
bad BOTS to tell us what the most lame
robot University lamest robot they could
think of okay you guys came up with some
kids great ansel wrote us and said how
about the most useless machine it is a
robot that when you turn it on it turns
itself up I have one he says I have one
yeah you like it has a little button it
pops out the hand pot you click it on
and then a hand pops out and turns
itself off oh yeah the little rubber oh
yeah I have seen that and then Andrew
wrote us and said how about a robot that
blocks your view watching TV or even
your smartphone dun dun dun I love the
idea of like you're like always trying
to look at there's like always just
something like flying robot hey that's
guy not that's things taking over as
they just start blocking stuff that's
gonna be how the robots take take us
down they're gonna drive us crazy I
can't text my friend you're all gonna
lose our minds as you can't see our
screens okay so what do we have next
producer Logan we've got we've got Tony
Tony says a robot that's supposed to
patrol your home and protect you keep
just keep shocking you hahaha kinda
shocked yeah but VIP just enough to
annoy you close enough hours of course
Stefan wrote to us and said a robot that
is programmed to burn itself as a bonus
in the past two thousand dollars I like
this on it just as a canvas face like oh
I'm gonna burn myself they're my
favorite like user feedback so far
they're pretty good at it well we got an
email from tanner and Tanner says the
worst robot I can think of is one with
my mom's face on it that follows me
around school saying really embarrassing
things about me in front of my fur
and also its volume gets louder when I'm
around the girl I have a crush on I'm
gonna get I think that was so specific
and and really now Tanner I feel like I
know you yeah oh my god I'm sorry I
cried a little bit um it's really good
right did you say one yesterday with
like one that you would I think it like
I can't remember I don't remember
remember nothing we're not yeah why do
us minor be a smart car that like one of
those like a car that is robot you know
operated that would drive in front of me
and do the worst driving like it slowed
down cut you off it would cut me off it
what it would be like consistently like
with me and making it really hard for me
to drive around that seems dangerous I
really like even fall behind me and
sometimes turn on a fake police siren
I'm like ah ah stupid robot car like I'm
getting pulled over yeah so there you go
mine wasn't as good but that's a pretty
good one happy you're annoying robot cop
car type thing uh well time for our last
piece you use your feedback which is our
phone target for the day you're Mike's
going completely insane good my first
day troopers say back from Pete's
espionage I understand about it we're
gonna it's it's cool I just people gauge
what might fall out YouTube's gonna make
fun of you for that they're gonna be
like what is going on with kales next
we're Peter were locally on it all right
what else we got alright our phone time

smiley he was like this hopefully the
prettiness of this one any others will
persuade you to put them in the show and
maybe change a few cnet opinions of
tablet phone tog refers you can still
get annoyed you can still get annoyed at
those iPad concert Game filming people
