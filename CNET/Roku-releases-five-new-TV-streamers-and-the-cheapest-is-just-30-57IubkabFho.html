devices you know those things use to
watch Netflix on your TV and today the
company introduced five new boxes you
heard that right there are five new
Roku's now the first the Roku Express is
probably the biggest news that's because
it costs just thirty bucks it still
provides the full Roku experience with
all those thousands of apps in a simple
snappy customizable interface it's also
tiny about the size of remote control
and unlike Google's popular $35
chromecast it actually includes a remote
of its own in the Box one downside of
its tiny size I'm guessing is a tendency
for the connected wires to drag it down
the second new Roku the Express plus is
40 bucks and looks the same as a normal
Express the difference is that it's
designed to connect to older TVs that
have yellow red and white analog inputs
instead of the HDMI jacks found on newer
sense basically no other current
streaming device does analog videos to
the Express plus one of the few options
to bring streaming to older TVs the next
three Roku's are all more expensive
feature 4k resolution output and are
designed to work with the latest 4k TVs
the premiere cost 80 bucks has a
standard no frills remote but is
otherwise very similar to the current
Roku 4 it makes 4k TV shows and movies
easier to find than competing devices
and the cool 4k spotlight app services
different 4k shows from various apps but
not Netflix
unlike the Roku for all three 4k Roku's
of a famous design next up the ladder is
$100 premiere plus it adds Roku's
enhanced remote which allows you to plug
in headphones and listen without
disturbing anyone else it also sports
high dynamic range HDR video currently
offered by both Netflix and Amazon or
potentially even better image quality to
4k of course you'll need to connect to a
4k HDR TV to enjoy the benefits finally
there's the Big Kahuna the Roku ultra
coming in at $130 it has a more powerful
processor a few more jacks on the back
and the best remote of the bunch
in addition to that headphone jack the
ultras clicker has voice search
capability and a finder function so it
emits an alarm from under the couch
cushions if you're looking for the best
Roku yet the ultra is it these new Roku
is join our favorite Roku device ever
the $50 streaming stick they create the
most complete line of media streamers on
the mark
review them all as soon as they become
available for sale I'm David Katz my
