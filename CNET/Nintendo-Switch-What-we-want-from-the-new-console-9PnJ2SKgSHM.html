thank you so much for joining us right
now I'm joined by Scott Stein how are
you sir
good are you I'm pretty good because
we've had quite the week in the world of
tech specifically with Nintendo
they have announced their brand-new
hybrid console the thing we've all been
anticipating all the expecting the
Nintendo switch to switch and it's
coming in March 2017 it's like right
around the corner it's freaking five
months from now and I can believe it and
they've kept it under wraps up until now
we knew a little bit about the details
and some of that stuff kind of checked
out so what was your first impression of
that debut trailer they released well it
was kind of something that we thought
about either with a free you first came
out right like we're talking about it
that that that gamepad only worked with
the console and you think oh well they
have a handheld why isn't all this stuff
also work on the go sure so in that
sense it looks like the switch is that
thing it's a handheld in console but it
looks like it's more a handheld than at
the console we're talking about that -
that maybe it's a handheld plus a little
bit of console thrown in right and then
there's a lot of other questions about
like you know does that replace the 3ds
going down the road how interoperable is
it it looks like got a little lot of
little pieces swapping it out and but I
mean it looks potentially like that
all-in-one that you'll be hope is good
nothing on paper and when I say on paper
this video yeah I think it looks pretty
cool oh look I think Nintendo has earned
the right that massive catastrophic
failure of the Wii U aside I think
they've earned a right for the sort of
you know hesitation but optimistic sort
of like you know hesitation right like I
think they've sort of earned that by
this time I think so and it's like for
how many years now and Nintendo's this
company that we just expect weird things
to happen with hardware like what crazy
thing are they gonna do they become that
company the Wii with it's crazy
controller and glasses-free 3d and even
the DES with the dual screens so I feel
like this is another step in that like
what is this crazy idea hardware wise
and and that's kind of half the appeal
of what their debut
in fact what we don't know for the most
part seems to be a lot of the games and
software right and like how does this
actually work
all right a lot of that cautious
optimism is like yeah okay what do we
what's this little you know controller
about what happens when I dock it does
the dock change the way the game thing
works I think that and obviously the
biggest you know the big elephant in the
room is what's the battery life gonna be
like on that screen for me exactly so so
what do you think like what would you
have to be happy with and what are you
expecting and it's a good question so
we've actually seen a couple of things
that are not entirely unlike this I got
yelled at on Twitter saying it's not the
same thing but it's not
but the nvidia tegra there will be a
Tegra processor that's right this thing
Nvidia had a shield tablet and we've
seen that played games and also dock
with the TV and then you've had a couple
of things that have been almost like
that I feel like five hours would be
what I would expect that's too high and
that seems way too high right maybe
anything lower than three it would be
awful I think if it is three that is a
massive upsetting detail like there's no
way this thing can have three hours I
think they're gonna say it's like four
and a half yeah I feel like for some
reason I feel like five in five if they
come out and say five I'm happy because
one we really care about is that LA to
New York flight right like I just want
to get my game country and and do my
thing do you think they're gonna have a
battery pack Oh what are the odds
they're gonna have an attack this thing
looks like it's seven inches six to
seven inches what do you what do you
think I think it's like six and change
maybe seven I feel like it might be I
was looking at thinking it might be six
I mean look you know look that is wide
man that is a wide it is in there and
they're in that hand yeah compared to a
phone so I can iPhone right you know the
plus is 5.5 inches in all of our entries
so it looks bigger than your big screen
phone which would suggest 6 plus
definitely I and the we have a 22 inch
right it's definitely bigger than 6
hard to tell all the angles the same as
this close up but and the question is
how big do you want it to be because
some of these games they're showing
you're playing in split screen on that
little screen right kind of like an iPad
maybe it's almost an iPad I mean iPad
Mini 7.9 I think that's where we're god
I think I was how big was the shield the
ship is a seven inch I mean I'm trying
to remember when that's in the that's in
the ballpark of what the switch is gonna
wind up being um I go back to those
controllers to call play con controller
oh no what are they joy con joy conjure
week on controller doesn't get
convention yeah come to joy Connie yeah
so I wonder how that's gonna shake out
um you know those things look real small
super small it's kind of like a little
cute I mean you got the mini NES coming
out it almost feels like it continues yo
the novelty thing yeah praise like
little mini controllers you're playing
like a cute little tabletop Nintendo sit
for sure um you know I don't know again
all speculation we we haven't had
hands-on with it we don't know exactly
what's going to be going on right to
those little joy cons have gyroscopes in
them do they vibrate right they need
power because they're wireless so allows
they lower right is that three or four
hours in the whole thing things like
today I'm quick charge that dock that
like I said that dock can't just be a an
HDMI breakout thing there's got a maybe
something else is going on there it's
got to put out 1080p to a TV maybe on
the screen it can only be 720p there's a
lot that we have to do a lot of
questions and will it be I mean Nintendo
doesn't get many answers Nintendo did
send back a couple of answers right that
we're very vague and that one was that
it'll play all the games suggesting
that'll play all games in both modes
right but again we'll play all games in
all with all the extras you know will
there be things when you dock it you get
extra modes and then you're really no
way mode all I know is for a developer
to program a game to work with all these
different button configuration right
what do you types that is not an easy
thing
listen we got to say goodbye for now
Scott Stein thank you so much for
joining us getting lots of questions may
be more questions than when we have
before the questions yeah we were
writing story about coming up how many
questions and realize there were tons of
questions including price and yeah just
what types of games you're gonna play on
this is it is it you know touchscreen we
don't know you don't know big developer
support list though that's that's
encouraging that's very nice to see but
definitely make sure
keep it right here seen it we're gonna
have all the latest on Nintendo switch
because as you can see we're a little
excited about it we'll see you guys soon
thanks much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
