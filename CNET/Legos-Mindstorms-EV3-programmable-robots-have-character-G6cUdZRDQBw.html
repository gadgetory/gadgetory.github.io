CES 2013 and before me are the Lego
Mindstorms ev3 this is the new
generation of Legos robotic platform and
it has a lot more to it than in previous
generations not only does one box get
you 5 combinations with instructions you
can go online and get up to 17 robots
out of it there's so many instructions
there's so many things you can do with
this each one of these creatures these
characters comes from one set the Lego
box itself will give you instructions on
five we go online and get even more the
components consist of a brain that you
can program your program it with Linux
now you can either do some basic
programming on the Lego brick itself
we're taking to your computer to do a
lot more so it goes from age ranges of
10 years old but some basic programming
or if you're an enthusiast it depends
how far you want to take it you can even
hack this thing there are tons of
sensors and motors in this it's all
about the combination that you build it
so you have different characters here
you even have one called Reptar that has
a sensor that's one one six or hand in
front of it it'll give you a bite now
when it comes to commanding your beasts
you can have a remote that it comes with
it's very basic or you can take it to
the nether level use your smartphone as
your controller it'll use the the gyro
sensors if you want or buttons on the
screen it's a great way for kids to
really start learning how to program
Lego has made it so if you just want to
learn a little bit they'll hold your
hand and make it really easy to do a
task or two Lego even gives you a free
smartphone or tablet app so you can go
through how to build it in a 3d world
you're gonna start seeing this second
half of the year for about three hundred
and fifty dollars at CES 2013 I'm
Bridget Carey with CNET with your first
look at the Lego Mindstorms ev3 set
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
