you've got to install a thing
fortunately it's not too hard but there
are some things you want to look out for
first before you plug it in or put
anything in it it's a good idea to make
sure that the fridge is nice and level
with the floors in your home you'll want
to get a level out for this and actually
measure inside of the fridge and not on
a shelf if you can help it sometimes the
shelves are angled in a certain way to
help contain spills if things are
slanted to the left or to the right you
can just pop off the frame on the bottom
of your fridge to reveal the two little
knobs down there that'll let you level
it just give them a turn to the right or
to the left heading on what you need and
you'll have things nice and level in no
time maybe more important is to make
sure that your fridge is properly
leveled from front to back and you don't
really want it to be perfectly level per
se what you want is something that leans
a little bit towards the back so that
the door will close on its own if you
ever leave it open to do this just grab
your wrench and go back to those knobs
at the bottom of your fridge and turn
both of them the same number of times in
the same direction to get it to tilt
backwards just a little bit once you've
done it right the door should just
gently closed on its own one last thing
if your fridge has a water dispenser or
an icemaker you're going to need to hook
up the water line to do this just turn
the water off at the source and then
connect the fridges water line to your
water line it helps to have two wrenches
to do this that you can get some tension
on one end while you twist the other to
get it nice and tight and prevent leaks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
