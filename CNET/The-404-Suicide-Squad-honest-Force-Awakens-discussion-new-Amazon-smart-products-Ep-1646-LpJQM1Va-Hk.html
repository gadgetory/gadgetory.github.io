it's Friday it's four-four time january
twenty second is it snowing I don't know
we're pre-recording is not that far in
advance it's Wednesday in real time so
yes it according to the weather report
it's supposed to snow loads on
Friday us out of an official weather com
headline i believe it was loads
you're so funny about weather com what
in like weather underground I don't know
whether under our nerve and whether on
the ground okay so Weather Underground
is like weather calms totally sane
cousin we're like weather underground's
like okay everyone just relax and
weather calms like world ended
well it's I think weather.com woke up to
the idea of like clickbait oh my god
then all man it's so funny you say that
because the front door of weather com is
like a goddamn oh your mongrel my god I
haven't looked at the front page in a
while mi Cara fying oh my god uh so like
cuz they know people were just there for
weather but what can we make them do to
click another thing it's funny cuz like
the tiles they have usually on the front
door are really incendiary and like
super scary and click baby yeah but like
these aren't even that bad like the only
thing that's here that's weird like I
might weather.com right now why do I
need to click on the latest about a
missing two-year-old like this is lost
in a storm was is is he or tornado so
like that's a thing I guess this Elias
is a weather storm Elias proves
dangerous yeah that's always you did
okay 222 people dying in a storm I mean
it's sad it's sad but it does yeah I
mean it's weird I also like the fact
that they are really struggling to mix
it up in terms of imagery yeah because
all they have are just these in Eric
math yeah it's the clouds and stuff on
them like a few numbers I've been here
and I tweeted a couple years ago or I
had a grab something that was like it
said something like 19 household item
are killing you as you read this stuff
like that really bad because the huge
banner at the top is like prepare now
colon and it's just like blizzard watch
and that's terrifying like this it's
like Drudge Report these huge graphics
it's just and then you go to weather
underground so I never heard of this
site until you mentioned it and it's
very peaceful and soothing yeah because
Weather Underground lives in the real
world things to know about the winter
storm that will hit the mid atlantic
northeast right and they're like what we
know what we don't know how what we
don't know is your day banner would you
like some chamomile tea perhaps episode
Russ we're here to just talk about the
weather and get you the information you
need without having to look at some
missing too would you like to hear a
story from dr. Jeff masters director of
meteorology at The Weather Underground
so the great irony and always using the
great like weirdness is that they're the
same company oh yeah that make sense so
was Weather Underground bought by
weather com I want to say that's the
case here 100 I mean that's like PayPal
buying venmo like you sure the similar
products but obviously you have these
different brands I think it makes sense
yeah I like their little cute little
logo it's cute yeah uh it's uh it's it's
something that always gotta bugged me
yeah and now I I'm glad we could use up
to you I don't know why people why are
you going to that I mean there's so many
apps and stuff that will tell you what
the weather is I i use the weather
underground appt 0 which is uh very sane
yes um so yeah I'm going skiing this
weekend so I gotta get out of here how
much snow has to happen before it can no
longer be skied what that's there's
infinite you can ski on any amount of
snow right but at a certain point you
can't get to the top like my god it
right you know what I mean you are such
a dumbass I've gone skiing before but
pretty much only bunny slope stuff so
and it's been a very long time but there
is like a getting to the mountain
presumably you could like hit of issues
so too okay so two years ago two winters
ago was one of the most significant snow
fall winters we've had ever sir uh I
usually go to killington I usually go to
Vermont oh no no no okie moma big okemo
guy uh I was up in killington to two
winters ago in march of 2013 and there
was so much snow that the lift they had
to carve out like a path yes when you
got off the lift okay because the the
the actual like there was just like five
feet of stir and so when your legs
started would ordinarily like barely be
touching the ground it was like you'd
have to put your feet up oh no like they
carved right right they carve that out
which was I'd never seen and they
actually like for you to get to the top
of the trail it's like a bit of a hike
right and that there was I and I'd never
been to killington where it was a
hundred percent open every single trail
every single thing was open yeah that's
when you know like hey there's a lot of
snow this year it's very scary skiing
it's not for me you move too fast
they'll come at you a good skier so
that's the thing like we like going fast
yes is a part of skiing there don't have
to go fast why you shouldn't even give
me more pizza yeah let's french fries
way more pizza okay pizza when you're
supposed to portray could have a bedtime
yes it's uh yeah it's all about carving
right it's all about making that nags
down the mountain you can do that on on
a double black yeah you but it's what
are you gonna get nailed from behind
like that's no people in front of you
have the right away so you have to wait
for the jerk that's like pizza that's
not a jerk move that's just like taking
your time and a carbon on the map you
know it's tough like skiing yes is
inherently dangerous but as long as you
stay somewhat in control and don't go
super fast right you should be okay what
happened to Sonny Bono that's not
something you want to talk yeah I don't
know I'd rather you keep it in your mind
that you got tree skiing oh that's bad
that's right that's hard okay dangerous
yeah uh I want to say like seemingly
overnight
everybody started wearing helmets do you
wear a helmet oh hell yeah of course
without a doubt is doing gonna wear a
helmet dylan aid scheme Dylan's actually
going to the killington daycare oh
that's great yeah you get a vacation
he's gonna go to the daycare for like a
week straight yeah you guys are just
skiing you'll see them eventually one's
gonna do daycare so it's gonna be cool
that's great that's very nice yeah so
we're excited about that little apres
ski for the babies why not hell yeah
live it up right I love it come back
he's like already like couple beers deep
sitting by the fire sounds more you guys
will meet meet all these dudes inches so
anyway there's that so that's the story
about recording early you won't realize
it because this show will still go up
friday morning if you are going out in
this northeastern wintry weather just be
safe and I think we're gonna pivot into
a real life discussion about Star Wars
oh my god so here's the deal it's a Star
Wars Episode 7 the force awakens here's
the deal yeah I want to preempt this
with like yeah we're gonna spoil stuff
right now yeah we should go yeah it's
been long enough and that's been long
enough even I've seen it I have a kid I
saw it yeah if you're if you're if
you're really if you still haven't seen
the force awakens we want to put a time
on this we're gonna say this
conversations gonna wrap in 10 months so
see they want to skip it yeah skip ahead
10 minutes if you don't want to hear all
right so we're about we're about like
815 into the show okay so maybe by 18
minutes or by 20 minutes God willing by
20 minutes like 20 minutes will be will
be okay so here we go okay here's your
point last chance turn it off right now
okay that movie sucked now I'm kidding
you did that you said before the show
you said you did not like it I enjoyed
it where did you see it and no bouken
with the baby where was this way no so
you left Stacey on the baby yeah so with
the buddy okay yeah got it yeah so my
buddy core you know get ya so when I
when I saw the movie
I was I was enjoying it sure how this
school is fine yeah uh even went to bed
that night happy okay woke up the next
morning yeah and I was like oh I was
hustled I just got hustled that was a
hose job I mean it is very manipulative
there's no question about it they
definitely are playing on emotion
through that entire movie so and maybe
that's my biggest hang-up with it is
that man why is that movie so much like
a new hope it's so much like a new hope
that it's almost insulting so this is my
take on it and it's it's hard because I
totally agree with that state and if i
were to complain about anything it would
absolutely be that is that it's so super
familiar and you like know the plot
beats before they even happen my take on
which is crazy which is crazy but my
take on it is the reason for it the
rationale is that you want people to
have these connections to characters
that they've never met before and you're
sort of kind of making these like
subconscious mental connections like oh
this characters like Luke Skywalker oh
this characters like Han Solo etc but
their new characters so they want people
to like create these bonds with these
characters very early on and so by not
making it a very plot centric movie
which it really is not appointment is so
surface level yeah it's just the
characters that are really supporting
this entire movie I think it succeeds in
what it was trying to do which was
introduced you to those characters the
other example of that is the first Star
Trek movie that JJ Rose did the same
exact thing no one remembers the villain
from that movie or if you do you're like
that feeling kind of sucked at least in
Star Wars the villains at least a little
bit interesting he's whining don't get
me wrong Kyler runs a whiny little baby
he was almost like my favorite part of
the moment I liked him like he was
entertaining and like like I like the
fact I the one thing I did like so sorry
I liked a lot of things but the thing
that really stuck out to me is that
you're dealing with all these same
themes and same pot beats that we've
seen before but they take certain things
that you've seen for
your entire life yeah like stormtroopers
yeah but turn it so like the second I
saw blood on the stormtrooper mask I was
like holy yeah that that I that was
cool that was very cool and they do that
on like they like seeing a character
like kylo Ren be like like throw a hissy
fit like whale away at the computer
happened never happened so they're
really I think they're setting these
expectations of like oh this is all
familiar we've seen this before and then
shifting it where it's like oh I you
know I've never seen a whatever girl
Jedi X so much ass etc right um I think
that's that's the idea of course and
again I I want to stress like yeah I'd
like that movie yeah it was a lot of fun
yeah and I think I don't think it's a
life-changing movie I think it it felt
safe in a lot of ways but it also was
sort of a reboot essentially of the
franchise which is like no it's cool to
like this again you could have fun going
Star Wars movies you don't have to like
dread whatever trade politics yeah it's
funny you brought up the blood part
because I had the exact same react it's
amazing we're like we're like I would
say that moment is probably the best
moment in the entire movie what was
perfect because it it it and that
happens right away it's very early and
it also like marks him yeah and it's
just the it was very clever because
you've seen that scene that
stormtroopers running out into a crowd
they're shooting their blasters you've
seen that you see the hero shooting at
them they're like oh well they're
falling over with us and then you see
that and you're like wait what i see so
i think that plays on so many different
levels because that blood also explains
like oh no stormtroopers aren't really
like robots they're bright people right
and up until well yeah I mean like the
clone wars they try kin that I think the
cartoon which I've never really watched
but i'm sure they play that up more as
well but you're right like they've never
personified it and they also make a
special note in this movie to say
there's like clone stormtroopers yeah
and then these are different so these
are like a special forces right raised
from childhood to be like soldiers and
the right finish
and his whole crew which would be a
witch which I guess at the same time I
also like it also rubbed me the wrong
way cuz I'm like no these guys are
robots why alms and they have like
conferences and stuff like that guy's an
aberration but and I like the other guy
that like shows up he's like trainer
yeah and he's pissed at him summer is
like what you guys are they have
emotions now but now they do just these
guys because they're not clones the
whole new order thing is so is really a
first-order weird it's we they should so
not see and like stupid and come on it's
just very odd because they don't really
explain what the state of the rest of
the unit were like most of my day the
new empire how bigger they like and at
the end they go a planet-sized weapon
they've got to have millions and
millions of people it's ridiculous it is
so we don't just do that overnight it's
not something that some kind of takes
decades to plan okay just a nerd out for
a second what why do laser beams cause
people to bleed yeah and not just like
codify like right away yeah cauterize
cauterize out of 5 that's not a freaking
way it is a word but not not authorized
yes why doesn't like instant
cauterization although I guess you've
seen like in surgery may be like that
could cause someone like if you're doing
eye surgery does that caused you to
believe when they you do like laser eye
surgery no it doesn't cuz you're not
going where the Bloods at in the eye Oh
gross you're just taking off that top I
skin yeah I know is that your big
complaint that essentially it's just a
reboot the reboot the shield on the the
vulnerable shield on the freaking
surface of the Death Star oh yeah it's
just like AB why are they always
building these vulnerable things on the
surface yeah it was very after the
pendant that part with Oscar Isaac he's
just like oh man you remember that first
decimal this was like way big plus 100
days like that so ever again I my one
worry right now even though I did really
enjoy the movie all your points are
valid but I like the movie my concern
the next movie which we should mention
just got delayed to December 2017 that's
the next episode 8 which is when it
should come out any there is a star
where's movie that's coming up between
then there's one coming out this year in
2016 really called Star Wars rogue 10 is
that which is the first I think and the
Star Wars stories or Star Wars anthology
they have a name for it but essentially
these are Star Wars movies that have
nothing to do with this main arc of Luke
Skywalker and it's bro so they'll
probably talk about these people but Jim
well not necessarily i think rogue one
actually the plot of rogue one is that
it focuses on getting the plans for the
original Death Star so it's set before
episode 4 between three and four and
it's all it's like a heist movie about
getting the plans for the death star so
it's kind of interesting who's getting
the plans these a ragtag crew so it's
like guardians of the galaxy I it's
unknown but that but that is the general
plot is that it's focused on them
getting does and all we know about that
so far is that many Bothans died for
that information Bothan what's a boffin
there's a line in episode 4 where they
say after the handover the plans to the
original Death Star they're like many
Bothans died for this information no one
knows what the hell a botanist they look
like really nobody has many finally get
to find out who the boffins are ya and
what if they decide to even honor that
and I was like funny just do it what
else disregarded that'll boffins line
and a half or I was just gonna say my
one fear with the main trilogy is that
all of them are just gonna be like
retellings of the old stories which is
like Oh Kyle runs gonna wake up and
realize oh it's not nice to be mean I'm
gonna be nice now we're gonna work
together to fight the big hologram dude
you know there's no and just like retail
to the Darth writer story where's my
list below but who knows yet we'll have
to see but uh but yeah like I said don't
hate on me don't call me and be like oh
if you're such a hater you have hate
everything you do hit the movies not in
the movie was ok you hated cloverfield
and you hated start work that movie was
just ok it was fun I had I'd give it a a
minus mmm I give it a solid B minus C
pause a minus it's getting a b-minus for
me speaking of grading movies yeah no
particular reason mr. jordan hoffman hey
on the show februari 19th our pre-oscar
it's like a month from howdy we're
already teasing it well not like people
really popular on the awesome i've known
jordan for almost 10 years now he's
great hey you know when he was on I
started following on Twitter and yes
just like a lot of phone on yeah he's
great he's he's great for fun and he's a
mom with Kenny he's like a major big
deal on the Star Trek community key
himself yes is he's a guy he's a guy
what does that mean uh he is like the
one of the main writers for Star Trek
com he goes to conventions and like
covers them and everyone knows him and
wow it's like a thing so he hates Star
Wars I know he like Star Wars 2 I don't
realize you could be both yeah me
neither alright I learned something new
every day I also learned this week about
Amazon's new replenishment service yeah
this has been around for a while though
so this was around in the form of a dash
button they had like the things that had
tied on them and you push it and it
would just get you more tied so the idea
was like you're basically like stuck
that on to your washing machine yeah and
then when you ran out of tide you click
the button yeah the button automatically
ordered and smart it's a good idea it's
a good idea but like what's the stop you
from just like hitting that button by
accident i'm sure there's a fail-safe
but how does that work regardless now
they're like okay that was the test
we're actually going to build that
technology into a few products with some
with some people we've teamed up with
okay so they did it with like a printer
okay that knows to order more ink no one
uses printers anymore it seems like a
add a touch sort of product to start out
with they did it with they are doing it
with the dish wash with a laundry
machine that's going to order more
detergent although how would the laundry
machine right no you need more detergent
you just put all of your determines
there or is it just like oh you've done
40 washes that feels like oh yeah he's
done me no then uh like an automated
Purell dispenser we'll just like order
more okay but that makes sense for like
it from a corporate total standpoint and
there's a few other things they're also
going to introduce one that orders more
battery
when your automatic door lock is running
low on them what the hell is an
automatic door lock so that runs on
batteries well there's like asome door
lock that you know uses like bluetooth
oh it's like a smart doral yeah yes
smart lock I guess it never occurred to
me that they would have battered they
would need batteries but of course that
makes sense yeah how do you expect the
line yes I'd expect the lock to
disengage I've never liked smart devices
before and now I really don't like I
don't know why are we calling it a
smartlock if the dumbest thing kids
might have seems like a dumbass lock
anyway what yeah so we I did the story
yesterday on cnet update if you want to
go watch some entertaining internet
video yeah go do that but uh yeah so
this is just something that's starting
to happen and it makes sense right like
Amazon's device director Daniel excuse
me Roush he you know we enter we talk to
him about this whole thing okay did you
talk to him now the guy who wrote this
for see on it he goes he goes a little
what's like what what's the deal with
this why do this so the guy goes let's
be honest this is not shopping that
people love nobody wakes up in the
morning is like man I can't wait to buy
lingerie is gently right I mean why do
this it's great for them and it's great
for these companies like it's
essentially guaranteed it's like you
have a netflix subscription for your
washing machine yeah so like ordinarily
what people would do what I would do I
run at a detergent I realize it the
second i'm trying to do laundry i walk
next door and pay extra at the bodega to
buy like a tiny thing a detergent just
to get it out of the way right rather
than that we have detergent coming out
on the regs and it's always coming from
amazon's they're always getting a
percentage of it like it makes sense
from a business standpoint totally uh
this is the world we are living and will
be living in for a very long time very
smart things where it's just like stuff
that you do it's eliminating the
 yeah right like for me for the
benefit of a mega-corporation of course
but at the same time giving you back
time and and probably a little bit of
money be yes because like right battle
enjoy you're not you're not saving money
going next door no right
like think about so I I used like this
for me the biggest game changer for me
aside from maybe something like uber
yeah has been two things amazon prime
sure and fresh direct yeah fresh tracks
are big e fresh direct yeah has changed
my life and I feel like oh well I think
it's that's something that's more
universal so like if you just know like
oh I live 20 minutes away from a
supermarket it's like a thing like you
have to like make a problem whether
you're walking or whether you're driving
it's like a process that you don't
necessarily want to deal with and
getting rid of that necessity is a huge
time such a big deal yeah like they
don't have very good produce whenever i
get for fresh direct though do you know
what the lens on where you are totally
disagree depends on where you are that's
the thing they're getting at
geographically yeah geographically like
are you close to a good supermarket that
they're pulling for sure it doesn't do
that they have their own warehouse
really yeah mm okay yeah because I found
it to be very inconsistent well see we
found it to be actually quite consistent
because it makes sense why would they
give you shitty looking produce when
they know you could just complain get a
refund like it's in their best interest
to pick out quality protein yeah I guess
I've just not right very good luck so
far we did use Amazon's fresh direct
competitor pantry I got a fresh fresh
it's called fresh yeah how'd that work
so we did it and actually liked like the
food that came was nice and good my one
complaint with it it shows up in these
bags they're like huge tote bags it's
not like fresh direct where it's like
the cardboard boxes they're like tote
bags and they're enormous and the idea
is when you reorder more whatever
amazonfresh you leave them outside they
take the tote bags away and they leave
you like replacement tote bags yeah we
have no intention of ever using the
thing anytime soon even though we liked
it it just like it's a little more
expensive than just going to the
supermarket whatever these things are in
our house and it took me like a good
half hour of googling to be like can I
just throw these away because they're
not like why they're like good tote bags
with like insulation why would you keep
them I throw em one
what did I live in an apartment i can't
keep everything that come to the
apartment i know you live like hoarders
but some people but what yeah i know you
have your treasures and you can't get
rid of your treasure like these things
are cool man how many pets are dead
under in somewhere in your house thanks
to 76 217 that's all know Jeff's
apartments very nice thanks yeah that's
those disingenuous um okay let's get
switch gears back to entertainment news
for just a second we got to talk about
this new Suicide Squad trailer that
debuted this weekend so Russ fresh dick
is your interest in Suicide Squad yes do
you have more of an interest lesser than
interest or unchanged i would say
slightly more than i did before really
yes was that well let me start by saying
that as we've talked about on the show
before I think Batman vs Superman looks
like a giant pile of dog yeah I
think it looks absolutely awful a 90
just a never ever see it so ok I want to
I want to circle back a second um this
movie feels like it's leaning into this
new kind of take on superhero movies
which is very self-aware and very like
fun and like light-hearted but also like
Barry I guess not holding back I think
one of the big issues with superhero
movies is that the stakes feel kind of
generally made up it's like aliens land
or whatever it is yeah and so you have
these characters they're very archetypal
and strong man and whatever and they
don't have a lot of depth um so here I
don't know this looks just like a fun I
I like the dirty what is it dirty dozen
and like those sorts of movies yeah I
like anti-heroes and like them being
jerks and not wanting to help people but
they sort of just have to rely on them
obviously Expendables is a direct
comparison but I would say so far the
marketing for this movie the posters
look really cool this trailer which uses
Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody I thought they
edited the song and it worked really
well for the trailer personally I'm so
much more engaged with what they're
doing here then then bat members well
it's not even close that goes without
saying
but I like I have no affinity apart from
the Joker and maybe harley quinn i have
no affinity for any of these characters
so yeah so it's telling that i'm like
kinda into it despite that that's like
an accomplishment that they've pulled
off I don't know how to feel about this
movie ok the I've seen some cheese I
don't I am NOT all in on the jared leto
joke worth a uh yeah I know what you
mean at least they're doing something
different like that I think that's the
problem there in is that they can't just
repeat you know Technical Center Heath
Ledger they need to like do something a
little different I don't like the
costume but I think the lines that he
said in the trailer so far I don't know
is the performance seems fine he's a
good actor I just uh I yeah I just don't
I just don't he is a good actor I like
him as an actor I just don't know if I'm
buying what he's selling ok um there's
been a little bit of cheese that rubs me
the wrong way and some of the trailers
like what harley quinn at the end of the
the new trailer something like well come
on we're the bad guys yeah ok does no no
i don't get me wrong this movie could
end up being horrible like really bad
and it's it's tough at least you can
sniff it out with Batman vs Superman
we're like oh no there's no hiding a lot
of the facts they show so much dialogue
in that trailer the bathroom and shower
that like oh you can see just in the
dialogue that it's gross and also the CG
and all that stuff but this is mostly
like action it's like a really well
edited trailer in my opinion that you
don't get any you don't know how whether
it's written well you don't know any of
that stuff I you know I have hopes but
I'll absolutely one hundred percent wait
for the reviews before going I mean look
the biggest thing that we like to do is
look at who's involved and DNA or the
director of an writer of Suicide Squad I
believe I mean this guy did fury he did
outfit people like ferry people like for
hit the training day I love a midi I'm
sorry he wrote tree okay he wrote
training name I'll under watch people
people like end of watch I know I've not
seen that movie ah sabotage I don't know
about that film and then he also did the
wrote the first Fast and the Furious
okay I think he's got some good got some
good writing credits so you know I could
go either way it really could the real
question is whether he had the ability
to like push back so we're a movie like
Fantastic Four went off the rails
completely was apparently the studio
just kept coming in to me like oh we got
to get this guy in there we got to get
this guy at bright and they bring in a
lot of generally they'll bring in like
rookie directors and that in Fantastic
Four was the director of Chronicle
because they know they can push them
around this guy he's been working in the
industry for you know about 20 years at
this point almost 20 years so the hope
is that he knows how to push back but
who knows I mean it is a big movie for
them I love like that's the thing like
mmm can this guy stick up for himself it
is weird like that's all it's almost
like you have an empty shirt directing
the movie right but like think about how
inherently ridiculous that is where it's
like it doesn't matter because you look
at a movie like dress world which is
directed by a very small director and it
became no longer but it was the most the
highest grossing movie ever it doesn't
matter in a lot of cases obviously if
something goes really wrong do but we
don't know about the studio influence of
that movie you would have met which
movie a ver drastic world I think there
was a lot I mean so do i but I'm saying
like we don't know for sure I mean the
second that there's that much money on
the line you don't just like let go yeah
all right well speaking with a lot of
money on the line going back to bed
member super me a quick so what do you
think how do you think that's going to
play out again like you and I clearly
not very specific opinion about that
movie yeah it probably will do okay
though oh how do you financially how
it'll do my own thing is like do you
think they're in a situation where they
go okay we gotta commit like is this
gonna get like the Super Bowl thing like
like I'm so in terms of marketing money
oh they're gonna spend a shitload market
I feel like you're pushing their foot on
the gas pedal one hundred percent right
because now the pot committed they're
all in there like look this is either
going to be because at a certain point
unless it's a major like disaster
scenario stinker if you spend enough
money uh you'll make a lot can buy your
money bomb because you look at a movie
like like Jurassic world which was not
critically acclaimed well because it
wasn't a good no because it wasn't a
good movie um still made a ton of money
because the marketing was so all over
the place and it had the elements that
like people would be engaged was that
what does this all say about us like
don't you find something upsetting in
the like I know it's low-hanging fruit
but like don't you see some like great
cosmic tragedy and all this where it's
like it doesn't even rise all wars man
yeah even with Star Wars cuz like Star
Wars is so much bigger than just that
movie sure it's this culture it's like
it's like football you know what I mean
like it is its own ecosystem that was
like feeding off a lot of gnarly really
slimy stuff and it's just as like
perpetual marketing monster I mean that
is business though that's what happens
like yeah it is but after a while it's
like not it's sort of like a religion
you know where yeah I mean they
transcend I know I know a lot of people
in studios from a studio perspective
sort of look at it like well these are
paying the bills so we can do the piano
sure or sun whatever they want to us I
like that answer sure I hope that's
right yeah I hope it's right for all of
our sakes yeah speaking of the great art
of moviemaking and something that's not
really used anymore yeah in that process
but used to be film Oh film Oh Phil I
recently route well I watched the HBO
series it's called Project greenlight
yeah however that day min left leg right
yeah exactly so they this past season
they brought in some guy and he was like
a real auteur and insisted on shooting
on film and like large chunk of the
series was like people going on me like
it's gonna cost $300,000 your budget is
like two million dollars really this is
where you want to spend your money and
there's like fights over it and they're
taking him to like post production
houses like look this is what digital
looks like you can barely tell he's like
I can tell yeah they uh I don't know man
I don't think I could tell so there was
a time yeah there's like a trends
transitive sort of film
head though totally it was like a
transitive period of time when we were
still like in limbo sure where I could
tell for sure yeah yeah I cannot tell
right totally okay I saw revenant in
theaters and I saw hateful hateful eight
was shot 70 millimeter film very fancy
revenant was shot digitally with a brand
new camera they both look astonishingly
gorgeous and i could not like if i
didn't know that before going in I
wouldn't be able to say oh that's phone
that's digital yeah it's gotten to the
point where I mean and it's probably
more limiting to shoot on phone because
you I have to keep the cuts shorter i
would imagine now and what about the
weight of the camera why can you put oh
my god it's the most inconvenient
ridiculous yes right mention like oh hey
light can't touch this right like if we
screw up this mag yeah that whole real
is done right yeah it's like when I was
in school it was it was it was on the
precipice of like this big change sure
and as a freshman I shot on film as a
senior I shot on mini DV yeah so it was
great to see both don't make kids use
like Sudan super8 &amp;amp; like the first year
I personal Abbott now it's like an
elective although you really should like
understand your roots you're like you
should get to know what it's like the
cotton splice I guess because I think it
adds more value and importance on the
cut yeah because you can't just undo it
right like eaters like I think it
definitely makes you appreciate the cut
more yeah but you could technically
argue the same thing like oh you should
learn typing on a con a typewriter no
cuz you have to wait out that any day
but that's that's what you're saying
essentially no I don't know if I'm
saying that no that's no that's not the
same thing I'm not gonna let you get
away with technology but but you hear
what I'm saying i know i mean again I
don't think it's not it's totally
mandatory balak it's amazing I mean it
is amazing because like just to think
about the process that went into like
cutting the Godfather I mean I
presumably they had a little more modern
stuff but like I think I'm sure it
wasn't a dude with a razor it was
probably like a machine that did try
machine the kind of dish those real
reals that look like yeah but I'm sure
like I've I really do think at one point
guys I'm like bring the hammer down yeah
to the guillotine down yeah anyway uh
yeah so that's crazy that's uh that's
the thing I bring it up because I saw
this on reddit in the explain it like
I'm five subreddit and I was like yeah
that's something I've always wondered
about and the question was why did film
have to start out in black and white why
wasn't there you know a color right away
what part of the technology was missing
that was not allowing there to be color
yes I know you mean because it's
essentially like it's a it almost feels
like you're doing extra work by like
well its color right there in the world
right you're turning in black and white
what the hell it's kind of amazing when
you think about it yeah but essentially
if I were to guess I haven't read this
through yet but if I were to guess I
would say you know the idea of like
color variation is like a very sensitive
thing but just determining like
lightness versus darkness is much more
straightforward so it's a much narrower
scope right you're really looking at I
more or less so the highest voter reply
here says that color film was actually
extremely high-tech it took a lot of
care trial and error and investment to
get it to work right black and white
film is a sheet sandwiching a layer of
gelatin full of silver crystals these
crystals darkened very quickly in a
similar fashion to sunburn cool just
like sunburn you don't get a variety of
colors just different levels of darker
than your normal skin sheriff color film
is actually the same process but with
several more layers of emulsions for
each color so now you have a saying I
think that is like quadruple layered
okay but in order for it to work it has
to be thin enough to go through the
camera so all those layers in protective
her layers are thinner than a human hair
and that's the technology yeah that's
pretty cool which which is pretty crazy
they went from zero to color pretty
quickly though they did like I guess I
mean it was before where servoz
obviously it was color but still like
Wizard of Oz's what 1930 like 39 39 yeah
yeah um well I guess video what so one
was when were the first like movie
pictures are you talking about when the
first video was yeah well look at it
like the twilight zone right twilight
zone by like the third season they're
doing video shooting on video yeah yeah
so that you know I don't know I've gotta
be like 50s right so yeah fifties
sixties I want to know do you know how
they colorized stuff on video and just
in general no no me neither curious next
I'm yeah hopefully lowing it up we'll
add that and hopefully get to edit yeah
the time we're ready to go next week
yeah and then i also i fell into a deep
red at home oh why does that happened
yeah so i got started thinking about the
history of credit cards cuz somebody put
up a post talking about i saw that the
old tiny it was like a metal car there's
like a dog tag yeah that that a certain
restaurant i guess it was sent someone
yeah and it was like a letter is like a
formal letter being like this is your
card for use at all of our
establishments we've opened a line of
credit for you right but it only worked
at a specific place right so presumably
I'm reading here now but like presumably
diners club was like oh here's like a
dozen or whatever it is 50 restaurants
that all agree to like run under the
same credit system am i close yeah yeah
you're nailing it and essentially it
just evolved from there to the point
where like oh I just stopped at
restaurants and more and more and more
people join these clubs and they became
American Express in master garden yeah
that's all it really was was just like
banks coming together saying hey we're
gonna basically you know allow people to
open credit with us yeah I mean you look
at like in nineteen
67 it was just starting to gain
popularity yeah like in 1960 you
couldn't just go anywhere and just sort
of like buy something you had a like
this doesn't really get into like how
you would buy a big thing like how would
you buy a refrigerator write a check
would you write a check I guess you'd
write a check for like thirty dollars or
whatever forger to crawl with a little
more would be my guest but maybe not
that much more right like how did that
all work yeah it's weird anyway yeah and
basically use a bunch of banks coming
together competing against each other
saying oh no we're gonna offer more
compatibility with more and that's what
MasterCard got started but like for me
it's all like I'm super curious about
the technology and that's something this
doesn't really get into um where it's
like yeah for a really long time they
were doing the carbon copy stuff yeah I
guess that's how it started her and then
when it went electronic then you had I
mean think about how much credit fraud
then was must have been when they're
just using the the carbon culture is not
like I feel like it must have been open
since for just yeah various credit and I
still travel like when it sometimes I'll
travel outside the US and like they're
still using like the carbon copy thing
and that's are they really sometimes
yeah it's crazy like what does that even
do yeah nothing like some poor asshole
at the end of the day I like collect all
those in like right I'm i don't i'm like
call someone be like okay I've got 4,500
transactions I need to go through right
now with you seems like overkill right
yeah it's weird man and I have you
noticed like they're starting to ask you
to put your credit card in the machine
now do you have one of those chip cards
so that so that's a new layer of
security that yeah just was supposed to
be apparently widespread by October of
last year it's get it I mean I I'm
seeing it more and more yeah like places
like CVS and stuff definitely require it
apparently it cuts down on a credit card
fraud immensely yeah well because it's
like a two-step verification and
apparently Europe has been using it for
much much longer and that's why almost
all the credit card fraud in the world
uses American cards
because we've been so far behind right
I'm a security standpoint so it's good
it's a little bit of hay me as the
machine buzzes at me whenever it wants
me to put it on like settle down machine
I'll do it I always liked the fact that
when I went to Europe ah they would
bring the credit card machine to you so
like what they would do is you would put
you have a meal yeah get ready to pay
and when you're ready they would bring
this like little you know said a
European thing yeah yeah the Europe I
don't remember ever that yeah her
happiness is everywhere there they bring
them to me literally everything yeah
they bring the machine to you they would
swipe your card and then you would like
push buttons on this little keypad and
you'd be w wouldn't tip them because
that would be boorish is that is that
like you don't well it i guess it's
country to country but certain countries
you don't tell it is a wheat tipping is
a weird that's a whole other that's a
whole other podcast all acts okay I'm
gonna let you do your we're yeah oh my
god in so long has been a while weird
animal facts is here again weird animal
facts um so pick one okay we've got one
I pulled a couple of them but i'll save
one for next week um they found a
crocodile this probably happens a lot
crocodiles haven't changed in forever
right that's what they say crocodiles
are exactly the same I for hundreds and
millions of years hundreds of millions
of years this this crocodile that they
found was 130 million years ago they
found this thing we what would it mean
they found it on well I'm sorry the
fossil that they found okay with it was
like they're mostly ocean years old and
it's mostly unchanged that's amazing
except for this one is more than 30 feet
long and three tons stop it a third
that's like a bus that's like the
Megalodon it's it's basically a school
bus sized crocodile and that was pretty
common back then animals were just giant
because of the I think more oxygen-rich
air animals just got really baby is that
the reason that's one of the actual
one of the many reasons there's that's
not a thing yes yes were you reading
this uh I remember it from school I feel
like I'm having someone crazy talk to me
okay I'm googling giant prehistoric
animals it was like and why and why it
was o rabbits Harris this is great okay
the largest known prehistoric lagomorph
which i believe is are like a rabbit
type situation was a giant lagomorph it
was a 50-pound rabbit how big how big is
it though it doesn't I mean 50 pounds
like three feet tall no it's like it's
like a kangaroo size rabbit maybe like a
wallaby side I just thought I'd owe me
big yeah they grabbed very large right
like there was mastodons and megalodons
equalities like prehistoric animals that
were just like dinosaurs those every
nigga those are big yeah why were they
so big because of the oxygen why did the
good Lord make them so big back there
haha you did a good job like them like
at home how big their will learn more
about giant animals on another time
because I haven't done that research but
this this crocodile that they found they
just found it it is 30 feet long and
three tons in weight was the operative
word who knows no I've seen Jurassic
Park who knows tomorrow they could i
love new blah whatever it's gone isla
new blue Isla Nublar Isla Nublar I would
go there so like would it put that you
know about Megalodon right yeah he was
very big the shark rats sure can oh my
god yeah he was pretty big like that
thing I didn't even find enough food to
sustain something that big like he would
have to eat I mean whales alone like
blue whales I can run around today not
right around but yeah blue whales the
biggest animals like really krill was
enough that's it you're living off the
algae you don't want any like major pro
tip by some bacon me like I'm fine I
gotta lose some weight I've been around
for you think I live with this long just
by uh you know this protein no I gotta
pace myself they also really didn't try

ever seen yeah dude nice blue we got it
Declan I won't have to eat like a
community of seals yeah like an entire
population yeah how do you say oh I
guess if there's no fishing like he was
it he was like a fishing he was like
Japan back then yeah where Japan goes
out and fishes all the whales in the sea
that was Megalodon it's unbelievable
yeah it's crazy yeah so chew on that
this weekend fell down japan with your
whale hunting no one needs it right and
it's a bad look yeah well bud I think
