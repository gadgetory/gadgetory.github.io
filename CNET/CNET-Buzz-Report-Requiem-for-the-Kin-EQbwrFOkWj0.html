buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
it's the iphone for verizon hulu unveils
a subscription service and Google may or
may not be doing something that may or
may not be a Facebook killer but first
it's the gadget of the week the gadget
of the week is the cisco CS tablet cisco
announced it this week but said that
even though it looks like an ipad it's
really meant for real-time video
collaboration among like students and
professionals really i mean yeah it's
built on android and it works with
Cisco's business software suite but it
also has an accelerometer a 720p HD
camera and it offers HD video streaming
for real-time video conferencing no yeah
honest you know cisco just drop the
brett farr back to get in the game the
iPad isn't that scary and now for the
news bloomberg is reporting this week
that okay you might want to sit down for
this verizon may be selling the iphone
in january thus ending the exclusivity
contract with that provider of solid
networks everywhere AT&amp;amp;T now of course
neither 18 teen or verizon is saying
anything about this so we can't tell for
sure if it's a done deal or just geek
bait but of course given how many people
have their hate on 480 a verizon iphone
would probably sell faster than megan
fox's undie pants at comic-con and also
rinse and repeat this rumor three more
times until the verizon iphone is real
and speaking of phone news remember the
microsoft kin it was the gadget of the
week just I don't know a few weeks back
now I was skeptical but I was willing to
give it a chance but actually these are
pretty cool little phones for the social
media set Microsoft and the entire
market of phone buyers not so much after
like literally three months on the
market and untold millions in
advertising dollars seriously they even
put a wraparound ad on the waffle truck
in the alley outside seen it anyway
Microsoft is pulling the plug on the kid
it's cancelled
bed now I guess it's not that surprising
since it got about a fifty percent price
cut last week and also no one could
figure out who it was for since it
talked like a boost mobile Toyota Scion
but it required verizon's lexus is350
data plan seriously though what is going
on at Microsoft these days we start the
bomber Death Watch countdown now yeah
there we go moving on in the news hulu
this week announced a new premium
service called hulu plus for 10 bucks a
month Hulu Plus will offer subscribers
full seasons of shows instead of I don't
know the five most recent episodes not
necessarily in order like you get now
and in some cases you might even get
multiple seasons of chefs according to
hulu CEO Jason Kyle are you can watch
all nine seasons of The X Files seven
seasons of buffy the vampire slayer' and
all 50 seasons of law and order SVU yeah
because it is such a pain trying to find
reruns of that show Hulu Plus will be
viewable on the ipad iphone and ipod
touch and it will also be baked into
some new internet connected TVs certain
samsung blu-ray players and the xbox 360
and playstation 3 yeah that sound you
just heard was comcast and DirecTV
looking death in the face speaking of
death watches not pretty in other news
this week Google may be getting into
social media again hot on the heels of
the rousing success that was google buzz
rumors say the goog is planning to take
on Facebook with a social media project
called google me and on google if this
is real here's the nickels worth of free
advice you need two things if you want
to have a chance a better name and
something more addictive than farmville
have you considered actual crack
and finally let's have a look at what's
clogging the tubes this week it's the
iphone 4 versus the HTC evo in cartoon
kitty cat form where is the iphone 4 i
need an iphone 4 oh I'm very sorry but
we are currently sold out however we did
finally get some more HTC evos in if
it's not an iphone why would I want it
well it's similar to an iphone but has a
bigger screen I don't care the internet
speeds are around three times faster I
don't care it has a higher resolution
camera on both the front and the back I
don't care and it doesn't require you to
be on Wi-Fi to use video chat I don't
care oh stop don't get mad I'm not
saying you're like that just some other
people look around they're all standing
next to you in line and that's the buzz
report for this week everyone I'm
Hollywood and thank you for watching
the monthly bill is cheaper I don't care
it can prints money I don't care it can
grant up to three wishes even if one of
those wishes is for an iphone I don't
care it has an app that will build you
an island and then it can transforms
into a jet and flies you there I don't
care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
