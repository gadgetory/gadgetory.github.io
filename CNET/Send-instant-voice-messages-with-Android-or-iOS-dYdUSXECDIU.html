voice note would be much easier than
texting someone or calling them on the
phone you might have more to say than
you want to type in a text but you might
also want to avoid a lengthy phone call
I'm Sharon Vaknin christina here to show
you how to send quick voice messages
with Android or iPhone using your
phone's built-in tools or an app that
I'm pretty hooked on let's say that I
was supposed to shoot a video today here
in the studio but I forgot to bring my
iPad with me my friend Emily sits right
by my desk so maybe I can talk her into
bringing it down here for me I don't
want to type a whole message explaining
the situation but I don't want to talk
on the phone for too long either let's
try a couple of voice note options both
the iPhone and Android have voiced note
recording apps on the iPhone open the
voice memo app then tap the record
button here and record your message
hey Emily I'm shooting a video and I
forgot my iPad at my desk can you bring
it down to the studio for me when you're
done tap the stop button and then tap
this button here
hey Emily I'm shooting a video and I
forgot my iPad on my desk can you bring
it down to the studio for me now tap the
share button here select message and
I'll enter her name here when I send
this message she'll receive an attached
recording which she'll be able to play
back even though she has an Android
phone
hey Emily I'm shooting a video and I
forgot my iPad on my desk
can you bring it down to the studio for
me if you have an Android phone just use
the built-in voice recorder and do the
same thing the only problem is that this
process takes a little too long when
you're trying to relay a message quickly
that's where one of my new favorite apps
comes in
it's called hey tell it's a freemium app
for Android and iPhone and it basically
turns your phone into a walkie talkie to
get started launch heytell and tap this
button here to add contacts I'll find
Emily in my contacts list the app will
let me know if Emily already has hey
tell if she doesn't I'll be asked to
invite her with a text message when she
receives that
she'll be asked to download the app and
go through a short setup process now
that she's all set up she shows up in my
contact list and I can send her a voice
note hey Emily I'm in the studio can you
come by and bring me my iPad I left on
my desk and I need it for a shoot she'll
get my message almost immediately and
she'll be able to respond right away oh
sure thing Sharon I'll be there in two
shakes oh thank you so much I'll see you
in a few
as you can see heytell is super easy to
use plus it's great because it only
takes as much data as a short email if
you have any app suggestions or
questions on how to use heytell shoot me
a line on Twitter and say what's up on
my Facebook page Thank You Emily
use the welcome for cnet.com I'm Sharon
