called everybody here with some
experiment search for Winona Ryder on
Jimmy Kimmel play the first one here if
they're talking about stranger things
new show on Netflix I might not actually
know what this is about so tell me about
stranger things
l-3 maybe a little bit too much um how
many episodes does it have as you can
see me drilling into that conversation
more and more to find out more what I
want but what you could do now for
example would be open the nest app you
should see video from the front door but
it's night and very black outside turn
the lights purple okay
changing three lights to purple this is
what we launched with Android Oh early
development built so this is not the
final version yet we really think of
this as kind of the next generation of a
program guide of a like an like an EPG
guide you know from cable boxes we allow
apps to create channels and each channel
is comprised of multiple programs we saw
a lot more engagement with with once we
introduced video users really like this
because we they can immediately figure
out what what is this if you see the
background you see the the thumbnail on
the right for the good places like
yellow and blue if I select that you see
the background fading into that color
scheme right so we automatically
actually measure the color palette of
the poster and try to tune the
background into that movie here you see
YouTube and you see two channels right
so you see trending and you see 360
videos so an app can actually publish
multiple channels if they think that
that is interesting to the users we are
doing a lot of work still around
animation we want to make it really
smooth we want to make sure this really
navigation field smooth fast no matter
what hardware you are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
