next to me the adorable the all-new i
bow from sony now we know they release
it out in japan it's yet to be available
in the US right now but let's talk about
how amazing this is there's a lot of
technology packed in here if you want to
talk about artificial intelligence and
something that I want like a real robot
that I want
it's the I've Oh check this out 4,000
parts there's actually 22 actuators or
think of it as motors and/or joints that
are moving to bring this I bow to life
its eyes are OLED screens and you can
see they have articulation they express
themselves also there's three areas
where you can actually touch the eye bow
on its head on its back and under its
chin and as you touch it it it kind of
reinforces and shows love and emotion
the eye bow will react to that as well
you also if you look really carefully at
the nose there's an actual camera in
there and what that camera can do is it
can detect who it's looking at as well
as the voice so you have multiple family
members it can learn to respond to them
and then on its back side they call it a
slam camera it's right at the top of its
tail as it moves around it uses this
camera to pretty much map out your home
like the ceiling the area so it knows
where it is
it also helps it guide it to its
charging station so this I bow has 120
minutes of juice when it runs all the
way down it's three hours to actually
charge it and bring it back up to speed
but this is just I mean adorable look at
how it moves its articulation its
expressions it's going to be seventeen
hundred US dollars they have not
announced when it will be available for
US customers but there you go a first
look at the adorable eyeball I love it I
got to have it now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
