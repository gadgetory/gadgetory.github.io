CNET and this is a first look at the
Sony mdr-1r over ear headphones they're
300 bucks so they're definitely a luxury
purchase but if you're shopping for a
headphone that sounds as good as it
looks
you've won ours are worth considering
the full-size cups on the side here and
clothes and cushion your ears with plush
leather but you may want to stop by your
local distributor to try them on first
Steve Guttenberg actually reviewed these
headphones for CNET and he found they're
very comfortable but I tried them on as
well and felt the inside of the cups
pressing against my ears which got
pretty irritating over long listening
sessions but regardless no headphone is
universally comfortable and at just
eight and a half ounces the one ours are
definitely lightweight the cups
themselves pivot horizontally and
vertically for extra comfort and even
though the gunmetal yokes are plastic
they still feel sturdy and able to
withstand abuse to an extent the 40
millimeter driver design inside the
headphones is unique as well sony
positions them at an offset angle
instead of firing them directly at your
ear that's a design that's started in
80s and still continued in this model
today sony also claims the diaphragms
inside can deliver frequencies up to 80
kilohertz that's three times higher than
most high-end headphones in terms of
accessories the headphones come with two
47 inch long cables those terminate in
three-and-a-half millimeter plugs at
each end one cable has an Apple
compatible remote with a microphone for
making calls and the other is just a
plain wire so in terms of sound
performance our reviewers Steve
Guttenberg compared them to the
Sennheiser Momentum's and the Bowers &amp;amp;
Wilkins p5 on ear headphones he found
those sony's to be much more refined and
spacious with a really natural sound
quality that should complement whatever
music you pumped through them with a bit
more bass than those competing models
they're also great for watching movies
you could check out more details from
Steve and his full review on CNET but
that's gonna do it for me I'm Justin you
you just took the first look at the Sony
mdr-1r s thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
