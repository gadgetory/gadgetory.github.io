Carey on cnet com and it's time to get
loaded it's a huge news day for redbox
the DVD rental vending machines
stationed at grocery and drugstores for
starters redbox will soon be going
head-to-head with netflix with its own
video streaming service verizon has
partnered with red boxes parent company
coinstar and will release an on-demand
video streaming service in the second
half of this year verizon own sixty-five
percent of the venture redbox owns the
rest few details were released but it's
expected that this would be a national
service so it's not just for verizon
fios television customers this would
also be available on a variety of
devices and if that's not enough redbox
also announced it acquired its biggest
competitor the blockbuster expressed DVD
rental kiosks for 100 million dollars
the blockbuster rental machines are
owned by a company called NCR which
specializes in ATM and self-serve ticket
machines and NCR bought the rights to
use the blockbuster brand name there are
about 10,000 blockbuster express DVD
kiosks redbox owns more than 35,000 DVD
kiosks the transaction is expected to be
finalized in the third quarter of this
year Google is in development of a pair
of glasses that can integrate text and
other information in the line of sight
of the viewer you know all those sci-fi
movies like Terminator when the computer
screen data is overlaid on the actual
view yeah kinda like that they're
calling it google goggles and it could
connect to the internet and gps and
ideally be used for augmented reality
that would tie with google maps so
you'll be walking around town and seen
info on the stores you're facing or see
directions on where to turn sources told
the website 925 Google that it looks
like a pair of oakley thumped sunglasses
and would have a front facing camera you
would tilt your head to scroll and
select google is also making news in
Kansas City Missouri and Kansas City in
Kansas where it's starting to lay fiber
optic lines in its high speed one
gigabit per second internet access
project the project was first announced
two years ago but it's been a long
process just a survey and measure in the
land now Google is beginning to lay
fiber for the backbone of the network
that requires thousands of miles of
cable
speeds would be a hundred times faster
than what most Americans have today
research at Johns Hopkins University may
help engineers build insect size drones
for spying on enemies an undergraduate
student has set up high speed high
resolution cameras to document exactly
how butterfly's wings flutter something
that's too hard to study with the naked
eye the cameras saw butterflies twist
and turn their wings similar to how an
ice skater uses arms to control how fast
they spin those are your headlines for
