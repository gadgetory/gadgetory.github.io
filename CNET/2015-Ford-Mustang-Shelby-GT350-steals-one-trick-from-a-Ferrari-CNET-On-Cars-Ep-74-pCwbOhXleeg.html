Mustang show top tech from BMWs new top
ride and do speed cameras have a place
it's time to check the tech PC cars
differently we love them on the road and
under the hood but also check the tech
and are known for telling it like it is
ugly is included at no extra cost the
good the bad the bottom line this is
CNET on cars welcome to see net on cars
the show all about high tech cars and
modern driving i'm brian coulis well the
first special performance edition of the
new 2016 mustang is here the mustang
shelby gt350 and gt350r the performance
cars today can't just do brawn well
they've got to nail finesse as well
let's see if ford got it right in that
balance as we drive the new Shelby's and
check the tech
huh 1966 popular mechanics in the
drive-in with Dan section Walter Eastman
writes in to ask Dan Gurney what's the
best all-round Street track sports car
you've ever driven to which gurney
simply replies a gt350 Mustang guess
what we've got with us today
let's see if gurney would be just as
simple and just as positive in his
endorsement
gord Green gun almost every part of a
Mustang to create the gt350 one of the
most obvious changes you can spot from
the outside is the whole front clip see
they pushed out the front track on the
wheels almost an inch and a half as a
result the bodywork has to reach out to
cover it you've got different fenders
and a different hood than on any other
Mustang now on top of the GT 350 you've
also got the very rare our model only
two seats they lose the back carbon
fiber wheels extraordinarily unusual a
magnetorheological adaptive suspension
of standard on the are optional on the
350 and ideally you order it the right
way no radio no air conditioning no rear
carpet you can spot one by the red grill
badge now we've seen the insides of the
new Mustang before nothing dramatically
different there a couple of additional
gauges three choices of gearbox for the
rear wheel drive six-speed manual manual
six feet or six on the floor learn to
drive it that's your only choice here in
the head unit you can have a basic
display radio like we have here or you
can go all the way up to their latest
sync three touchscreen system or all the
way down to a stripped are as I
mentioned with nothing there no radio no
a/c and here's your drive mode selector
on the steering wheel other Mustangs put
it as a toggle down here it's able to
harness all these different drive modes
you see on the dash but unlike other
Mustangs it can also roll in
an adaptive suspension as part of its
mix this is the first Ford ever to have
that now when you get a 350 or 350 are
you got the same mill a 5.2 liter
naturally aspirated v8 no turbo no blow
or nothing like that
526 horsepower that's nearly a hundred
and two horsepower per liter a number
called specific output and in this case
it's the highest one for its ever posted
without a turbo or a blower in phone the
redline is 8250 peak horsepower occurs
near they compare this to a Camaro z28
which uses a much larger 7 liter engine
to get a lower 505 horse and only 72
horse per liter though it does make more
torque and it uses technologies like low
friction design for internal resistance
free breathing heads and bow lots of
lightning they took away as much weight
as they could
we've heard all that before to be honest
but you probably haven't heard before is
deep in the heart something called a
flat plane crank a crankshaft has
counter weights at 90 degrees offset
what a flat plane crank does is changes
that 90 degree to 180 degrees the engine
buyers from bank to bank and you get
better exhaust scavenging so one
cylinder doesn't disrupt the flow of the
next cylinder
some sale it's a flat plane Craig may be
it's going to sound like a Ferrari oh
yeah like a Ferrari in a denim jacket
with a bar over
I've done
well Oh about this vehicle that I
noticed immediately as it is the godson
3:02 my favorite modern Mustang ever
light crisp muscular but not steroidal
that's my kind of Mustang utterly and
completely drivable every day some
people are gonna find it not hard-edged
enough not feeling special enough
consider them to be purists without a
cause
now I focus on the gt350 in this story
today because it's going to be a lot
more accessible VR is going to be
extraordinarily low production as far as
we can tell and the 350 does most of
what you want at a nice price
psychologically comes in under 50 grand
with delivery but then you've got this
very difficult decision to make you can
get the track package for 6500 which get
you the adaptive suspension heavy-duty
front Springs the drive control a
spoiler in the rear a tower brace and
heavy duty coolers or the tech package
which also gets you adaptive suspension
heavy Springs and drive control but then
adds infotainment like a better audio
system sync 3 power seats and voice
operated nav 7500 for that if you're
curious and are adds about 13 5 to
either configuration I've got a tech
package and that gets you to about 56 -
out the door that's a pretty good value
for a car that has such track prowess
and such nice street manners which is
becoming the theme in the
high-performance market from McLaren to
challengers to Camaros most cars that
are super brawny realize they also have
to have clean fingernails
check out the rest of our experience
with the new Shelby's at Laguna Seca
Raceway it was quite a day over at cars
cnet.com well what's the only thing more
hated than a red-light camera it's got
to be a speed camera but what if they
work and are improving public safety
it's an interesting question to ponder
we'll do that for the smarter driver
when CNET on cars returns
the simplest kind of speed camera is
basically a radar gun on a stick but
those are easy for the speeder to beat
slow down for a few hundred yards and
then pick it up again so the new trend
in u.s. speed cameras may soon be
corridor averaging with ALPR cameras
those are automatic license plate
recognition now if you're one of our UK
viewers none of this is new to you
having debuted back in Scotland in 2004
here's how corridor averaging in a LPR
is used a camera recognizes your car's
license plate at one point on the road
as you drive down the road further
additional cameras recognize your plate
again and again and record at each time
with a time standard since the distance
between those cameras and the times at
which they spotted you is known a little
simple math results in an average speed
and potentially a ticket one of the
first major u.s. tests of corridor
averaging with a LPR was in Montgomery
County Maryland which added the tech to
its standard speed cameras in 2012 the
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety
has since used it as a study base and
just released a few numbers they
estimate these cameras generated about a
30% decrease in fatalities and serious
injuries
that would mean 21,000 fewer deaths and
serious injuries if this was used
nationwide and that in Montgomery County
fatalities and serious injuries fell 27%
even on nearby roads where these cameras
weren't specifically being used a
spillover effect because I know you're
wondering Montgomery County posts the
location of all of its speed cameras on
a County webpage they're moved regular
and you can be sure that drivers share
those locations on crowdsource NAV apps
like Waze and there is of course a
vigorous debate as to whether some
municipalities sneakily deploy traffic
cams to generate more revenue than speed
reductions and in some states notably
California this corridor averaging
license plate camera technology is
expressly prohibited as a speed trap for
now at least
it pays to double check what kind of
speed cameras are in use where you
travel and not give them a reason to
notice you at all
welcome back to see net on cars coming
to you from our home at the Mount Tam
Motor Club just north of the Golden Gate
Bridge a lot of cars actually use
atkinson cycle engines you just wouldn't
know it
I guess lean-burn doesn't make for a
sexy a badge as turbo or 5.0 and notice
most cars with an Atkinson are hybrids
as the technologies dovetail with a
mission of efficiency above sheer power
here's how it all works an Ekans an
engine basically one takes in a little
less fuel and two brings the most out of
it but three at a sacrifice of raw
horsepower when a given piston in an act
instant engine has completed its intake
stroke and begins to compress the charge
of air and fuel it leaves the intake
valve open for a bit creating a sort of
leak and thereby reducing the amount of
air fuel charged in the cylinder
unchanged is the duration of the
combustion or power stroke thereby
giving the engine all the time it needs
to fully burn the smaller charge it
ignited the downside is less air and
fuel going in means less power coming
out when you ignite it all but you spend
proportionally less fuel on your overall
power since most Atkinson cars are
hybrids so what the engine lacks in oh
the electric motor more than makes up
now why is it called an Atkins in' cycle
that's because it was invented by a guy
named Atkinson in the late 1800s a
British engineer back then there was no
variable valve timing as we've discussed
so he literally had to vary the travel
length of each piston cycle with a
combination of wonky linkages you should
be pretty glad we're not dealing with
today in a moment your email when your
breaks are your enemy and reason number
six thousand two hundred seventy one why
manual transmissions aren't coming back
when CNET on cars continues
we have known it was coming for a long
time but Bentley have finally officially
lifted the covers on Ben Tiger the first
foray by the British luxury manufacturer
into the world of SUVs Ben Tiger one
stout luxury and perform the likes of
the Range Rover and the Porsche Cayenne
and to achieve that it's going to have
to come out swinging buy more from the
ex car team of CNET UK at cnet.com slash
welcome back to see net on cars I'm
Brian Cooley here's the part of the show
where I take a few of your emails first
one comes in from zayeed R who says my
question is why would aggressive braking
cause extra fuel consumption it is kind
of a non-intuitive connection isn't it
well as I eat the thing about braking
the wrong way is that you kill momentum
momentum that you spent precious fuel to
create in your car that's how you get
the car going forward they don't throw
it away but when you jump on the brakes
non judiciously first thing you do is
you convert a lot of motion that you
want into heat that doesn't do you any
good and you also create a lot of brake
dust I mean these are kind of useless
byproducts of using your brakes too hard
too late too much now on top of that
remember that 70% of the fuel in the
average gas engine car for example is
creating heat not motion its enormous ly
wasteful so don't add to it by braking
badly the way to do it is what hyper
miles know well folks that can get up to
a hundred miles per gallon out of a
Prius they look way down the road and
read the situation to accelerate very
gradually and to brake very gradually
and do the least amount of both so
you're not constantly scrubbing off
speed and then dumping fuel in the
engine to get speed back that real lumpy
driving kills fuel economy so
interestingly enough paying attention to
way down the road raises your mpg and be
easy on the brakes but don't be
dangerous Brad from Miami writes in and
says when will you be airing that video
you promised showing us how to drop a
McNeal transmission you know a little
late on that one I have some friends
that would like to learn also is there
any data you know of on texting and
driving in an automatic versus a car
with a manual transmission well first of
all you're right we're overdue on
getting you that how-to video on how to
drive a manual gearbox I'm looking for
just the right victim a student and also
the right manual transmission car a lot
of the ones we've had in are extremely
high performance and I'm not going to do
that to a first-time clutch driver but
we're on it now your other questions
interesting I know of one study from the
University of Virginia that looked at
the relationship between attention paid
to draw
with a stick versus an automatic and
they found generally speaking with
adolescent boys who have attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder that they
paid more attention to driving when they
had a manual gearbox in the simulator
kept them more focused now that's not
directly related to keeping your mind on
driving versus holding your phone but it
seems to go down the same Road let's
face it you can't steer and shift and
juggle your phone when you only have two
hands but you know how we are that's why
we have knees to take over the steering
wheel I'm afraid so none of this even if
we found that it's the holy grail of
reducing texting while driving is going
to save the stick I'm afraid the manual
gearbox is suffering a death of a
thousand cuts or already has for a
variety of reasons first of all is fuel
economy modern automatic transmissions
can be programmed by the manufacturer to
seek the most efficient gear combination
with the engine load and RPM that's how
you get the most fuel out of a
powertrain along the same lines emission
goals are getting ever more stringent
and again being able to program the
gearbox gives the manufacturer one more
tool they can use to bring down
emissions the most it's just part of an
ecosystem in the car
that is smart and finally convenience
most of us just don't want a baby a
clutch and a stick especially in our
average driving up and down the freeway
and congested traffic it reads better
than it lives I know there are diehards
out there but the sticks not coming back
it will remain kind of like vinyl a very
popular enthusiast minority choice I've
never done a top five about a single car
before but I'm about to do one now
because the new BMW 7-series has so many
new technologies and it's new for it and
to some degree new for the auto industry
certainly in mainstream production that
it deserves that kind of a look it also
is interesting indicator some people
have a theory that the German premium
car makers are getting a little nervous
that companies like Tesla in particular
are beginning to steal their thunder as
the go-to car for affluent tech-savvy
buyers so let's see how the BMW 7
answers that particular appetite with
the top 5 technologies you'll find
within it
number five the carbon core now I put
this at number five because it is not an
entirely new technology carbon fiber in
cars but pure carbon fiber passenger
cells remain a tedious expensive process
but BMWs done here is hybridized with
carbon fiber reinforced plastic here and
here and here
blended with aluminum and lightweight
high-strength steel the overall result
is a loss of nearly two hundred pounds
now on a big boy like this that's not
exactly earth-shaking but weight loss is
the Holy Grail
and this is an important way of getting
there by the way this technology
trickled down from the iSeries the i3
and the i8 where it emerged a couple
years ago number four Laser headlights
and I put these relatively low because
this is not entirely new technology
howdy got these out in a
limited-production r8 a little while ago
but this is full production in the
seventh series contrary to what you
might think Laser headlights don't
literally aim out on the road like
lasers at a concert they go about an
inch and they hit an illumination
structure inside the lamp and then that
light is projected out but you end up
with a much more efficient and
controllable light huge throw they say
about a third of a mile for these guys
that's way more than your current high
beams while using about a third less
power they're very tiny modules and they
should last forever unless your rear end
someone don't do that
number three is gesture control now a
BMW gives you a lot of ways to control
the center stack you've got the
traditional I drive knob controller
which lately has had a touchpad on top
of that voice command continues better
than before you've got a touchscreen now
I'm still getting used to that in a
premium German car that was very no-no
for the last number of years but now on
the top of all that is gesture command
as well this is the biggest mainstream
push to put gesture in real cars yet
number two is the head-up display not
you may say HUDs nothing new and it's
not but this is the largest one in the
business and that's important in a hood
because the bigger and more expansive it
is the less you have to scrutinize a
small piece of real estate which is not
a great idea when you're driving you
want
big one that is more or less in your
gaze and this one's absolutely doing
that on top of that BMW already in my
opinion did the best infographics on a
hood of anybody in the industry what I
want to see them push the bar on next is
be the first to get augmented reality in
here number one in the words of auric
Goldfinger is what an extraordinary car
key you have Mr Bond this is the first
LCD touchscreen remote key fob now you
slide it up to get to your screens and
you can see if the cars lock you can
check your fuel range check your battery
charge if you happen to have a plug-in
hybrid or something but here's where it
gets really interesting on the last
screen it marries into a new level of
self-parking tech so you hit this button
here the car goes and identifies a
nearby parking space it shows you yes I
have found one they need a stand on this
arrow and the car will start to nose in
all by itself you aren't in the car
notice that that's also a Deadman switch
if I lift off the car stops moving for
safety reasons otherwise I just stay on
the arrow and the car takes itself all
the way in and when it's done it tells
me and all I have to do is turn it off
and it locks and I walk away that's a
crowd pleaser
thanks for watching hope you enjoyed
