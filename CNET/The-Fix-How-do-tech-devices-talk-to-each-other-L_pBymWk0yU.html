amazing times I mean the fact that you
can have one device and then instantly
and wirelessly communicate with another
that's a world away that's pretty
incredible so here's how it all works
in order for device to connect to the
Internet it needs a way for other
devices to be able to find it to know
where it is for example when you connect
your router to the Internet for the
first time it's given a unique IP or
Internet Protocol address by your
internet service provider this allows
other devices to be able to find your
router in an ocean of billions of other
devices so once your router is connected
you have a home network then when you
connect other devices to that network
they're also given their own IP
addresses but there are local IP
addresses that means they have to go
through your router in order to access
the Internet and vice versa so let's
take smart locks for example smart locks
use embedded Wi-Fi chips to connect to
the internet through your router and
during the initial setup process for
your smart lock your smart phone is
giving your smart locks local IP address
so if you add a party and you can't
remember if you've locked your doors or
not and take out your smart phone you
send a command to lock your doors and it
eventually reaches your router and sends
it to your smart lock directly locking
or unlocking your doors now smart locks
are really cool technology and could one
day make our lives a lot easier however
like any new technology there are some
security concerns the reality is that
there are hackers out there so proceed
with caution knowing that there are some
risk involved
