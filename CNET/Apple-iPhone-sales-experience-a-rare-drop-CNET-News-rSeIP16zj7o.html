holiday season but it wasn't quite as
many as the year before the company just
reported its quarterly earnings in a
call with investors and analysts now
Apple sold 70 7.3 million phones in this
quarter which ended in December but last
year during the same period the company
sold 78 million phones it's a small drop
and the company noted that this quarter
only countered 13 weeks rather than the
14 weeks from the year before but the
drop is still significant as this
quarter was the first time we've seen
the base price of the iPhone hit $1000
and although many people expected that
tend to be hard to get due to limited
supply it was actually pretty easy after
the first few weeks
this quarter includes the first three
months of iPhone 8 and 8 plus sales and
the first two months of iPhone 10 sales
now bear in mind Apple doesn't break out
sales numbers for individual models but
CEO Tim Cook said that the iPhone 10 was
the top selling model every week since
it launched also revealed in the
earnings reports net income rose to 20
billion dollars and revenue rose to 88
billion dollars so this slight drop in
iPhone sales didn't seem to affect the
bottom line at all all this comes hot on
the heels a report saying that Apple cut
production on the iPhone 10 in the first
quarter of 2018 in half and in late 2017
Apple admitted slowing down older
iPhones with a software update because
of battery concerns it then offered a
battery replacement program for older
iPhones at $29 during the call Cook
addressed investors and analysts and
said quote we did not consider in any
way shape or form what it would do to
upgrade rates we did it because we
thought it was the right thing to do for
our customers get a closer look at all
the details from the earnings call in
our article on scenic and I'd love to
know what you think about these sales
numbers find me on Twitter at Lexus
