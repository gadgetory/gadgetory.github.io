pen phone all that more in this week's
episode of welcome to android atlas for
februari 22nd 2012 I am Justin Eckhouse
alongside Jane mark the BB hello special
guest Greenlee me hello thank you guys
for having me thanks for coming on yeah
and I don't want to leave out our ampere
Steven yes the Emperor podcast receive
I'm dubbed by the chat room i should say
i'm not calling myself that well i think
you deserve it I think you should wear a
little hood though I mean we never see
his face yes and your face needs to be
far more wrinkled in it is well I think
it's appropriate they're here because I
feel like this episode is at least fifty
percent of rumors I know and I had
nothing to do with that I opened up this
doc that said what we're talking about
today and I was like it's catered to me
that's that's out I love that that's how
every show goes exactly we cater a tour
guests uh well let's jump into it talk
about our first rumour jelly bean mmm
jelly bean condition I like our former
President Ronald Reagan I'm a big fan
jelly beans I agree me too I remember
that yeah did he's one of them didn't
like broccoli that was George George
Bush okay oh noes know these things I
mean what a weird space that is taking
in my brain monday was Presidents Day I
studied up a little bit of essential
food habits that was my theme this year
for presidential study don't you guys do
that they like to eat yes exactly anyway
let's talk about Android I don't know
why it just seems like a good idea so
jelly bean is the name for the next
version of android which we've known for
almost a year now or something like that
a long time and our friends over at the
taiwan-based digitimes have come out
with some detailed rumors about when
jelly bean will come out and what it
will be so let's run down what they're
saying first of all they're saying it's
coming out in the sec
quarter and that you will be able to I
guess dual boot windows 8-based tablets
to run Android and that it's basically
going to be optimized for tablets and
potentially netbooks or notebooks I I
thought the other one was already
optimized for tablets right that was the
big thing with honeycomb was it was
going to be optimized for tablets let's
keep let's keep doing that then write an
ice cream sandwich is also optimized for
both tablets and phones and that just
came out yeah exactly and no phones are
running except for one pretty much right
so as far as jellybean coming out q2
this year I'm gonna have to say digit
times is lying lying straight line I
major just mistaken you think there they
have to be lying it's a black girl I'm
still I silly they were missing well the
first time that they've lied straight to
your face well not straight to my face
oh thank you I mean they're welcome to
come in and be a guest I would like them
to lie to me maybe more Reggie digitimes
yeah come on come on Reggie if that's
his name I think that's his name the
other thing that's pretty weird about
this is that if they did this they
pretty much would be killing Google's
Chrome OS which is already for notebooks
right which wouldn't be a bad thing I
mean is anyone using Chrome OS right
well that's the point maybe that's what
they're you know if they give it a fun
delicious name then maybe people will
start using it more and start
right I mean they are psychological they
are on this path of just colliding very
soon right I mean that's the way it kind
of seems chrome and Android it seems
like at some potentially I mean either
like a chrome browser I mean I don't
really know what they're doing with
chroma so it doesn't really make a whole
lot sense to me to have these different
os's which aren't that differentiated in
most consumers mind I mean most
consumers don't even know what chrome OS
is right right to be shocked to know
that it exists so yeah I mean I think
we're all in general agreement here but
what if i throw a curveball so last week
or maybe was two weeks ago we talked
about this and raid at home thing i
don't think we called a enter it at home
but it was kind of like the media hub
concept and so an article on SlashGear
is basically saying that they think that
android at home and android 5.0 AKA
jelly bean will be released at the same
time but not just at the same time but
there are really the same thing
potentially so that whatever this hub is
will run jelly bean and that's why it's
going to be released in sort of the
second quarter now do you believe this
no I still think that digit times is a
big liar all they do is a lie to my face
Oh rich tell me more about this android
at home this ain't this hub so based on
what we heard about a last week is that
essentially it was sort of your media
hub so that it would download various TV
shows and music and store it all and
then distribute it to your other devices
there's not tons known about it so so
it'd be kind of late I mean what how how
is that different than google cloud or
that or would work with google cloud and
then there's rumors that the google
drive will come out which is there like
how you which is something else yeah
these are all great questions i think
it's kind of your personal cloud almost
okay so that I mean maybe if you have a
massive music collection you don't want
to keep everything there or maybe now
that they own motorola this is actually
your cable box out your cable box bus
it's storing stuff okay so it's a little
cloudy to me
I see what you did there sir touche sir
uh yeah I don't know exactly but I would
like to know so if you know so
interesting so what originally when that
when we read about this rumor and why
we're saying that this doesn't seem
likely is because why would they release
android 5.0 when android 4.0 isn't
anywhere yet nobody has ice cream
sandwich really unless he bought the
nexus great city which you did so good
great keep keeping google and business
one phone at a time so but now saying
that android 5.0 is actually this
android hub or whatever android at home
would make kind of changes the game a
little bit that kind of changes the
rumor and then jellybean might have just
been to throw us a little you know like
you said a curveball so I don't know now
I maybe you want to reconsider my vote
about this android jelly be maybe it
will be announced let me throw out one
more thing there oh god then I think I
don't know why you more is it possible
they're all giving Google way too much
sense for being logical about their OS
releases I mean have they done this
before have they shown that there is any
logic to when they roll it out and no
that's very true right that's true
because then you know they wrote rolled
out this one to only one phone and then
they rolled out honeycomb which was just
two tablets and gingerbread that was to
God knows what and then nobody ate it
really knows what anything is called or
what version number so yeah you're right
maybe maybe it's not even called jelly
bean maybe it's called something else
and now we're all gonna do yeah I can't
remember if they confirmed that or not I
feel like they didn't I feel like even
the name is a rumor that we you know we
just thought that was the lot could just
be jello jello exactly could you be dude
mmm I like that I do except they get
stuck in your teeth right that's true
ute them at the movies all right well
tell us what you think a droid us at
cnet com um so what are we talked about
last week it was a samsung galaxy note
yes we all loved that as I remember is
that how you remember it because it was
the size I was great for pockets yeah
for small hands right right for all of
us that are just dying to write on our
phone screen
with a pen yeah exactly so this week we
have news of the LG optimus view which
is also coincidentally a 5-inch screen
phone nish thing at his design to be
penned friendly I'll and from our good
friends over at lucky gold star also
Korean company like a restaurant looking
good yeah I said it I think Emily said
that last week oh my god she and I are
like on the subway and I said I thought
it sounded like that store that's right
yeah my goldfish from lucky gold star um
anyway five inch tablet what I was
wondering is I don't want to get in
trouble here but in Korea is that just
do people really want to draw on their
phones yeah maybe is there something
culturally that this makes sense they
want big phones that they can draw on do
these companies like powwow and talk
about hey let's come up with some
humongous phones that are Penn friendly
or did they do their own independent
research right or they're like oh look
samsung did it we can do it too right
right good copy it's it's interesting
that like in the past you know phones
and tablets and everything are getting
smaller and then now they're getting
bigger and then what you know and then
are they gonna get smaller again did you
guys see Zoolander he's like talking on
his little phone he's like hello and
that's like the cool thing is his phone
is the size you know of a nickel and now
it's like this big now he's talking on a
tablet basic or phablet which is the
lamest new coined term a phablet yeah i
mean the pee when I we kind of
references a little bit last week what
you're saying is do people actually want
this or do manufacturers just for some
reason think that people want big phones
because i don't think i have met someone
yet who's like oh yeah i really want a
5-inch phone even I who bought a big
phone I didn't really wanted this big I
just wanted the other things that this
phone had do you find that phone because
how big is that work 4.3 inches about 35
feet yeah so I mean it's about this
size of a huge billboard um do you find
that phone cumbersome is it hard to
handle it's not as bad as I thought I
mean I want from the incredible which is
you know much smaller mm-hmm to this and
I thought I was very worried it's not
bad this bigger screen I mean it's nice
again I don't necessarily think I would
choose it but it's not as bad as I
thought but yeah this is 4.3 4.4
right-center 25 is a lot bigger private
you know when Jessica dole court was
reviewing the galaxy note and so she had
one and she was walking around with it
like taking pictures with it and I was
like that is huge like you don't know
what you're dealing with and then you'll
see it in person but I have to say I
played around with the stylus and I used
to have you know a whatever it was what
30 a trio mom buy whatever like and
never loved the stylus I have a nintendo
DS have a stylist don't love it whatever
but playing around with the stylus at
that thing especially the one that's a
little bit bigger that's like a pen
sighs Silas is actually kind of Awesome
and it's super responsive and I don't
know maybe my next phone will be a
12-inch good galaxy whatever note 2 I
look forward to that day when you come
on and I'm like talking it's like the
size of an ipad and you're like hello
yes I'd like to make a phone call you
need two hands and help hold up i need
to make it yeah exactly you so just one
correction by screen size is four point
six five inches so hold your complaint
email I don't know what I'm talking
about yeah please other stories because
clearly I don't anyway this phone sorry
to disappoint you won't be available in
the US immediately will show up in Korea
first next month initially running
gingerbread yes man who even care whose
major releases the exits not good
morning jelly if it's not running
jellybean Jujubee then why do we even
care about this 25 foot monster of the
phone we're KitKat it's not gonna be
running I know kit kat it could be
called karate I was looking forward to
lemon bar actually uh it's dual-core 1.5
gigahertz but they do expect to roll Ice
Cream Sandwich out with
three months or so they say why don't
they just wait three months I don't know
why don't they or why don't we all just
switch to the blackberry playbook what
do you think yeah I heard good things
about that haven't you know mmm well
well the new OS just came out blackberry
playbook OS two point oh and I mean the
reason I think that we care about it is
that they make it easier to for
developers to port their apps their
android apps over to the blackberry OS
right so they pretty much given up on
blackberry development at this point
right right because all their people are
getting arrested and they're too drunk
to it to make any more apps so they're
like you know what you guys you do it
you seem to be doing a coach the Android
developers I mean you can blame them
yeah yeah I mean I think this wasn't
that hard for them because it's you know
android apps are just sort of java based
so it's pretty easy to get sort of a
Java Runtime environment on your
operating system versus like trying to
port iOS apps where it's a subjective
see thing that not is not widely
supported say what say I guess the
process is you just take your existing
app and let it through this thing and it
re packages it yeah I think there's a
down a blackberry packager and then you
you know you upload your apk into there
and then it turns it into whatever a
blackberry runs which I think it's like
a bar star Jar Jar ER I don't know you'd
have to go to the bar u bar and
apparently it doesn't show up I mean I
can't imagine it's like looks like a
native app the same exact way that
native app would be developed right but
I haven't seen it and I guess it doesn't
always work for everything like there's
probably some low-level apps that are
you know making calls to hardware that
only android has do you leave it to
blackberry to come up with this thing
that only works like part of the time
but and then when it doesn't work there
like sorry it didn't work we don't know
why we don't know if it will ever will
but email still works great on
blackberry right and you know what and
that email those keep
words are unbeatable I used to have a
blackberry playbook that doesn't have a
keep the playbook internet the PlayBook
blows my mind but whatever I won't even
get into it but I had a blackberry mmm
yes I i loved it i like to Sandy no on
it yeah I had the pearl yeah in the
pearl broom I the pearl and a gray pearl
phone yeah exactly then I had a at a
curve and then work at the torch the one
with like wow love I wasn't that serious
very I mean I went I was all in it and
then you realized he learned about the
world wide web exactly and then I
realized that there was there was more
beyond my front door I started using
this thing called Netscape Navigator
right and when I was on AOL I was as a
copy serve guy um anyway let's talk
about other geeky stuff other os's that
you could potentially run on your
android phone or vice versa poor segue
there lubuntu i actually got it you got
it all right I didn't get it and I was
saying so there has kind of been this
trend of trying to use your phone as
your desktop computer because we love
convergence and stuff like that there
was a motorola web tops i think they
were called where you could sort of dock
it and get the specialized you I that
was only available you know when it was
docked I was optimized for your keyboard
and mouse I was still android though it
was just a new UI and that didn't really
catch on so now let's try again kubuntu
the i guess the company behind it a
canonical i think is the name has
developed boo 2 for android and what
that means is sort of the same thing
that you have your phone and you take it
and you doc it in your boo boo boo
docking thing and you then have your
monitor and your keyboard in your mouse
and suddenly you're using new bluetooth
so the phone is still Android and looks
totally it is one hundred percent
Android except when you dock it when it
turns to boone two
and I don't really I don't know do want
this um I you know what I think anything
when you can run two things
simultaneously when you dock it it's
like Linux which everybody loves a linux
I guess I don't I've never I don't know
I just make that up but I mean Android
is what subtle hey is it linux is Unix
yeah right so it's the same idea it's
open source which is cool and if it
hasn't you know a different skin or
whatever when you when you dock it
that's and all of your contacts and
messages and everything it's all shared
seamlessly then it's basically like
their version of the web web top thing
but with a more complete operating
system exactly when you dock it so great
what bring it bring it on I like the
concept here I just don't know if people
actually want to boone too so this is
something that's going to be pre-loaded
into specific devices I'm assuming is
that right right so they're looking for
manufacturing partners right now it's
not a download that you can go out and
get right now or potentially any time
ever it's you know I think they want to
sign deals with people who are going to
make phones that can be docked so I i
don't know i think if you just are
looking for sort of a Chromebook type of
computer a netbook or you don't really
care about the apps on there so much
then this might work because you're like
oh now i can use like full chrome on a
desktop environment or firefox you know
because there are a bunch of linux apps
out there that are good but if you you
know i think most people want to use
stuff that is either windows or OS 10 so
it's not it's not going to be the same
thing it's not necessarily going to
replace that until we are one hundred
percent cloud-based and everything is
just cloud and i don't think we're quite
there yet but we're pretty pretty close
I think I agree and I think that that's
what google or whoever is making this is
banking on is that we are getting really
close and that the people who would use
this like I wouldn't use this but the
people who do or not dilly try it well
that's true okay you're right you're
right i used to walk free after all yeah
but if he's a black bear you can
basically use anything in the whole
world um but people who do use this or
who find this cool or useful well
definitely I think jump on board and
would would find this even more useful
once it you know don't go what is it go
seamlessly shares seamlessly with would
you know with all their other apps and
stuff so I do like the concept a lot I
mean I you know if I could do the same
thing with windows or OS tan on my phone
I think that would be pretty cool all
right we are all going to brush our
teeth but stick around and we'll be
right back after this break
ah your mouth feel good now minty fresh
minty minty fresh um so let's talk about
toothbrushes um there's this beam brush
this is your story to Anna intro sure
sure I didn't write this story well but
there is a brush that but there's a new
beam brush which connects to an Android
app that coaches you it coaches you on
brushing your teeth yeah I mean optimal
brushing time is two minutes per session
and it it helps you reach that optimum
time apparently so the deal is this is
an app that connects to their special
toothbrush and the toothbrush has
replaceable heads but it's it's a manual
toothbrush that times you fifty dollars
to time yourself because you're supposed
to brush for two minutes yes to get the
full effect of to brushing right you
have to brush for two minutes so hey
fifty dollars fifty dollars do you know
well how much is a you know one of the
this is what I would like to talk about
yes so I have a Sonicare which i think i
bought for fifty or sixty dollars right
here i'm at costco and they're probably
around pretty cheap and it's electric
which is better than manual i think for
most purposes and it has built-in
two-minute timer right so this is this
is a manual toothbrushes is i don't even
do it for you so 450 for the same price
you have something that does it for you
it does it for you should get this thing
and if in like 60 or 70 bucks you can
get not only the two-minute timer book
one that like beeps every 30 seconds to
tell you to switch quadrants in your
mouth wow that's awesome you're gonna
start your gums are bleeding that's what
you have to switch is the question
though does your sonic care connect to
your android device what is the point of
connecting to it just tells you like how
good you did that day just hit times you
know i'm just trying to you know
trying to give him some credit I don't
know so let me tell you guys about the
toothbrush that my in-law got for me
it's a Justin Bieber toothbrush and it
has to each tooth brush it's manual as
well it doesn't connect to an android
app thank God because it's embarrassing
but it plays a justin bieber song for
how long you're supposed to be brushing
oh wow so that's way more useful than I
think that's Wiggy here that thing and
you can dance to it you could dance you
get your exercise you get your two
minutes of brush time you have justin
bieber in your mouth okay I'm throwing
it away forget it I think I'm not a way
to go I think um I I actually got sent a
toothbrush here like a year or two ago
that sings the Baron simple bare
necessities that that's cuter than so
that's what my son has used for a long
time is its timed as well and then like
halfway through it says good job keep
going oh my god I haven't gotten well I
haven't really used my justin bieber
toothbrush because it's too humiliating
but even though I'm by myself in the
bathroom brushing my teeth up late to
humiliate myself but I haven't I wonder
if he said maybe I'll use it tonight and
see I'll get back to you guys and see
maybe he said if he talks to me at the
end and is like good job mmm sold done
any news i don't know ruin for all my
friends I think you should I don't want
to ruin your your gift or anything but
just so our audience knows the Justin
Bieber tooth grace brush at walgreens is
999 Oh check it by five of those for
them exactly and they'll know another
different songs about you can get it
yeah it's I got two of them one of them
oh wow oh please excuse me one was
purple one was yellow I one of them
plays baby baby baby oh I don't know
what the name of that song it baby bit
that one and then it also does now Never
Say Never Say Never and I think and one
of them's you cry I cry that one yeah I
mean I'm like talking to this hello is
anybody
on like nobody knows I'm talking about
except for Steven that's all the song i
was looking at like it looks like
there's like this graphic things here
does it like measure your frequency too
i think that like her everyday how long
you brush that day see if it measured
like how hard you're brushing or did
anything besides just be a timer um yeah
you know you could get a stopwatch
pretty cheap it also looks like this
your phone actually has a stopwatch you
can you can get that app it's true you
can you can do a duck timer you know you
can also sing to yourself as we're
talking about earlier that you can one
of the commenters on this story was like
you're just sing the ABC song which is
what they teach to infants to you know
what when you're brushing your teeth you
can just watch the godfather series
right and so she wears brushing the seed
for so long that his face melts off to
bleeding gums yeah there you go alright
so we apologize to the people at beam
brush but work harder next time come on
but here this next thing speaking of
android connected devices i love so
android-powered google glasses or you
might call them google goggles huh
trademark copyright 2011 uh yeah these
are did you talk about these on rumor
has it we did a yay or nay section about
these and incidentally i wanna point
because of this Emily Dreyfus said that
they were not coming out and I said that
they are and lo and behold she has to
humiliate herself well I will say this
is still a rumor I think because it's
from an anonymous Google source um and
that's good enough for me that's good
luck alright well I just want to clarify
for our audience and let them make their
own judgment but this anonymous Google
employee is hand by the end of 2012
google will launch a pair of
android-powered augmented reality heads
up display glasses that are basically
like the oakley thumps which I guess are
kind of cool except for the ear piece
sticking out the side
but you know what do I know about cool
there have three or 4g connectivity
forward facing camera gps and a full
array of movement centers and they will
cost around the price of current
smartphones it will cost around the
price of that toothbrush yeah well i
think a lot more than 600 bucks or
something like that wow so you can
imagine that these basically turn you
into the terminator yes did it great
without without Souls oh forget it then
I don't want it six hundred dollars i
want the muscles too well you can get
that for 60 dollars you just have to pay
a trainer for it for your steroids does
it save us a rating system is running
its android it I ice cream sandwich oh
oh it's running froyo it's running donut
it only works part of the time your
terminator glasses run ice cream
sandwich it doesn't sound Bray so you
can imagine you put these on what we're
saying the morning and it tells you what
the traffic is like and you know you're
walking down the street and you're like
oh that girl is kind of cute and it
brings up her google plus profile takes
her picture mm-hmm kind of creepy but if
you think about like if you've used the
yelp what's called monocle yeah which is
pretty awesome like you hold that up and
you can just look down the street and it
shows you the name of every business and
how it's rated ha they could see coupons
for businesses as you're walking down
the street I see people bumping into
each other all over the place totally
because they're trying to like and go to
the frozen yogurt place and so is
everybody else they can't see each other
yeahman tation uh i think this just goes
to show i'm een android is super
fragmented right it's on every device in
the world it's on it's on a lot of
different phones and now it's going to
be in glasses too like how much what
else are they going to put it like where
elsewhere else can we go after this this
is what is great about Android this is
this is where you have you can put it
anywhere you want in a toothbrush yeah
in your glasses in coffee cup limited
like some other operating systems which
were no longer allowed to mention on the
show
I know it does not exist on this chair
anyway I want these so you got you don't
you're not in no muscles going I don't
know I would have to see what they look
like I'm too vain I thanked it is your
picture yeah if they make me look like
the Terminator yes I'm gonna get rid of
the bluetooth thing because that's kind
of yeah that is no that's not that much
does it oakley those play music you'll
actually exist yeah we did a review and
then back when I Jasmine was here okay
so she did a review on them and those
are like for skiing so they play music
through I think it's Bluetooth and their
glasses so there I mean it's all
inclusive so now add to that augmented
reality and google wallet and you've got
a pair of Google yeah I want these it's
just it's like Snow Crash have you guys
read that all right well this is what
it's like we all live in our own little
connected jacked in world with her
goggles we don't we wouldn't even be
able to talk to each other I just have
to text you and then it would come up in
your own text you with my eyes yeah you
can just nod your response exactly whew
this will just make things so much
easier alright wrap it up really quickly
here google has filed a patent for a
siri-like voice control thing basically
to connect with your TV so the idea here
is that sorry I'm having trouble on our
own site loading this article that
unlike so I guess apple TV is rumored to
come out voice control with series so
that you could talk to your TV
essentially and say play me and read
atlas and it would just load up the
download podcast and play it for you
Google's gone a different route and
basically they're going to have voice
control to control your TV but it's
going to be connected to your phone or
your tablet so you talk to the device
which you probably have right there in
front of you rather than something
that's across the room and if you have
your speaker's up really loud maybe
doesn't work as well I kind of like this
approach right rather than yelling at
your TV you're yelling at your phone
that you're already
yelling out anyway exactly yeah I do
wonder about the delay though right I
mean I figure it's going to be it's not
going to be connected directly to your
TV it'll be through Wi-Fi and then back
to your TV right so yeah I mean there
are true I have used some devices like
second screen apps at Google or not
google TV um tivo has a half fried pad
where you can pause and play in fast
forward / wife and it actually works
really fast I mean I think we've become
used to our TVs being so slow at this
point to change channels and stuff like
that right that this won't even be that
much slower right necessarily um but how
didn't I the kinect doesn't isn't that
doing something where you can yell yeah
do you that does do that i have that
it's um I mean I think generally I kind
of think this stuff is a little not the
most useful feature to put it nicely the
connect stuff especially gets me very
aggravated when I'm just like like dude
visited change the channel you look like
a lunatic look like a cheerleader that
doesn't work very well the voice stuff
actually works surprisingly well even
when a movie is playing but you know
what works really well remote the remote
control it just works great I just know
it work well what I mean the the cool
thing about the Kinect is yet that the
voice thing kind of works but you do
have to say like stock phrases like xbox
Xbox who whatever you know you have to
say stock phrases and the thing with
Siri was that it would be a little bit
more conversational so be like Siri
channel to please or whatever you say
and so next next yeah yeah I think
you're right if you can accomplish you
know 10 different button clicks with one
phrase like their example is when is
seinfeld on so if I want to do that with
my remote I'd have to let a guide and go
to search and then type in Seinfeld with
a remote which is hard right so that
stuff makes sense basic like volume up
volume down yeah I mean and like pulling
up the guide and like finding a channel
it's not
that's like making you sweat and is like
the are you know a hard task so it's
funny that they're like making a problem
out of something that's not even a
problem and then you know creating a
solution for it and which is you know
talking to your TV which you know what
how you're right a remote control is
pretty easy to do as it is right already
there and it's free it comes with your
two BR right we don't always know what
we want to watch you know so I can't
always say what channel is Seinfeld
right so surely sign so you would say
bring up the guide which you could just
do with a button browse anyway if we
could answer the question um just find
some find something I like or what do I
want to watch right now mhm yeah and
then I control like that's cool then it
knows your mind but um google TV is so I
mean it doesn't not working that great I
thought yeah but this maybe will work
with the new android at home thing we
talked about early in the show which
everyone's gonna that's juju juju juju
be jelly bean yum yum yep uh this thing
can do one other thing which is it can
work sort of as a home automation device
potentially so you could say you know
turn on my TV or whatever and do stuff
before you even actually start to
interact the TV itself now if I could
control this with my glasses that's a
whole nother story exactly and maybe
that's the next you know the next
iteration of this is that you just blink
and then it turns on whatever you want
no that was a real Blake yeah I don't
don't change the channel this is
important all right I think that is our
news but I think you have a app of the
week sort of angry birds have you guys
heard of angry birds no no mores tell me
about this how do you pray and rebirth
free bird Angry Birds yace irds anyway
angry birds space is the next iteration
of the game and it's supposed to come
out on march twenty second we're we're
assuming it's for both Android and that
other OS that we don't want to mention
is that that which cannot be named yes
Voldemort Voldemort uh-huh but yeah I
think we're going to have to deal with
gravity
issues and all kinds of things that
happen in space asteroids I'm just
making this up at this point but there
is there is a short video teasing the
release
it is so scary so awesome are we sure
that's a game and not like a movie
trailer yeah I think that's pretty
pretty good the angry birds movie there
be no script like Rio right I mean but
yeah it would start um what's his name
Benjamin Button what's his name Brad
Pitt as the benjamin button when i think
about his name um god bless angry birds
it's gotten me through some boring time
waiting for the train well you know I'm
glad they're I'm glad they're switching
it up putting it in space agreed adding
new physics agreed i think it looks mean
well i know nothing about it other than
that trailer that everybody just saw it
looks great looks cool right alright
let's do some email and read alice at
cnet com first one is from our good
friend Larry David Justin thanks for
dressing my email on the last episode of
Android Alice while I'm not the real
Larry David oh bummer I even read the
rest of this yeah forget it I don't want
to know so it's not the real Larry David
or the real Stephen Colbert I do admire
their work so basically sort of
addressing the whole google voice making
Wi-Fi calls thing hey there there is
there we go and he basically says that
yeah i mean some of them are kind of
subverting google to use VoIP to make
calls but some of them are actually VoIP
on their own and they are just they're
their own service and your forwarding
your google voice number to this other
service which is also kind of a weird
workaround hack that i'm not a fan of so
basically you're right it there not also
brooding google service but they're all
hackish and i just want a real service
that works and then he says and a warm
what work wet Wow and a warm welcome to
Jimmer no matter what his proximity to
the mic is
shout out to jmar happy Android Beam um
let's see the next one is from Mike and
Portland dear Android Alice gang just
started listening to the podcast a
couple weeks ago bet him and join them
very much and now look forward to them
every week he's to only look forward to
them every other week right now he's
bumped up a level I have to admit that
the podcast benefited benefit greatly
from the presence of the lovely and
talented Emily Dreyfus absolutely it's
true love us some Emily drive me all
through we're all fans Emily's energy in
it isn't an infectious laugh our good
balance to the low-key low volume of
Justin and the new one Jamar is it it is
it is in fact I'm willing to strike a
bargain on Emily's behalf and she
promises to make regular appearances on
the podcast i will promise to purchase a
new android phone recommended by android
Alice team and act as a volunteer newbie
guinea pig I'm completely died when it
comes to consumer technology all right
let's just stop right here I don't
really care about the rest of email how
do we feel about this deal this almost
I'm sure Emily Dreyfus would love to
come on the show as a regular regular
guest right and so that this person can
have a high class recommendation from
you guys on the phone that they're gonna
use yeah all right what do we get out of
this so we get to recommend you
crappiest phone ever and have them be a
guinea pig and test apps for you mm-hmm
and they get Emily every week I know who
wins in this situation who wins what
kind of a deal is this well we would
also get him well Mike does say anyway
it sounds like a win-win situation for
all google android gets a new customer
android ask it's a new smartphone toting
listener and i get a new phone and
regular access to the cheerful musings
of Miss Dreyfus love the show and keep
up the good work we'll round up by Emily
and we'll get back to you on that one
I'll answer for her yes oh look at that
she says yes um alright so we got this
email from adam from utah hey android
atlas while listening to you guys talk
about the pros and
of the stylus on the Galaxy Note they
began think of an a concept for an
Android tablet that would stand head and
shoulders above the ipad in terms of
graphic design capabilities it would be
a 10 to 13 inch android tablet designed
by wacom and adobe the tablet would be
full-featured and have higher end specs
but would also utilize the pen interface
technologies like the one and the wacom
intuos drawing tablet i'm probably
mispronouncing half the brand names in
this email to complete the package it
will also come pre-loaded with full
feature version of adobe photoshop that
was made specifically for android with
the option to purchase other android
optimized adobe creative suite apps
online the concept is just wishful
thinking I want to know what you guys
thought about it with anyone including
Stephen considering buying such device
do you think it would be successful or
even commercially viable if it was
priced at or below seven hundred dollars
blah blah blah blah blah love the show
Adam from Utah alright so seven hundred
dollar adobe photoshop tablet android
based he's asking you Steven I'm not
really into photoshop or art drawing
like I hate art I mean I'm not like an
artist drawing stuff so I probably
wouldn't be in the two and seven hundred
dollars that's a lot it is a lot yeah I
don't I don't I don't know I they they
do have a lot of they don't have exactly
creative suite but they have a bunch of
fado dia Dobby apps for Android they're
not pen-based right right right i mean i
think it actually think it's a good idea
but i don't think it needs to be a Wacom
adobe collaboration I think you know
could be LG or Samsung yeah I think what
they would have to do is just you know
step up their their pen game maybe
incorporate some wacom technology and
then adobe would have to optimize their
apps for that pen technology and i don't
think this is actually too far off we
talked to our rumors last week that the
Samsung Note stuff was actually going to
come to a samsung galaxy tab 10 inch
tablet potentially even at Mobile World
Congress what yeah I mean why not that
the technology really like until you've
tried drawing with that thing
you don't realize how awesome it is and
how effective it is so sure bring it to
a bigger than you don't even need your
wacom wacom wakeham well I'm I like
whack-a-mole Yakima Yakima YC I thought
Antoine told me was wacom ideas like me
I'm degree I always said we come to Oh
what yours like diet design early we eat
so yeah I mean bring it bring it yeah
great on good idea Adam um alright who
wants to read this next one I think
someone want to do with an accent which
one of the others I think it was j-mart
put your face to the mic hey Android
alliser's I was sad to see Antoine leave
the show but on the other hand I'm happy
to hear Jessica Delcourt I like her very
much I hope I didn't I hope I didn't
murder her name what what I hope I
didn't mutter her name but i suspect i
did sorry motor signed Edgar the mafia
boss yeah we're not gonna make fun of
that cuz he's the Mafia yeah he's just
my best mafia boss voice I wasn't making
fun of them thanks thanks for your email
all right next one from Holly Justin and
Jay mr I love the show thanks for the
news updates i am a t-mobile customer of
16 month less left on my contract and i
would like to change my LG g2x to
another android phone with a larger
screen without losing 4g speed do you
know if i get the unlocked gsm Galaxy
Nexus or galaxy note well I still be
able to use 4g on the t-mobile network
is there any other large screen android
phones except the samsung s2 that you
can advise keep up the good work and
bring Emily back on the show more often
she is fun everybody loves Emily
Dreyfuss Emily I'm just gonna leave now
I'm answer Marcia well I will say that I
didn't know they answer to your question
so I went to our cell phone expert
Jessica sorry what was the teleport
teleport don't matter her name from
typhoon watt inverter and she says that
he could potentially use an unlocked
version of the t-mobile but I can't
vouch that he'll get the same speed or
voice clarity
as if the phone were optimized for the
network and I'll also add one other
thing that if you're just looking to buy
this because you're in a contract you
could still you can like cancel your
contract for potentially less than you
can buy a new unlocked phone for so it
might be like 200 bucks to cancel your
contract but six hundred dollars to buy
the galaxy next is out of contract so
maybe it's better just to kill your
contract or something like that so you
could I would encourage you if that's
all you're trying to get around to just
go and talk to him alone see what your
options are there but um and then if you
want other advice go to reviews cnet com
and click on our best cell phones list
and we have it organized by carrier and
there's a good list for tmobile anything
else on this one all right now let's
listen to voicemail from our favorite
color cherry from Toronto hey guys this
is Jerry from Toronto well the best
thing since four-point-oh is coming out
for Android and that's the Chrome
browser it's in beta right now and
fantastic I first thing I thought when I
got my android phone was I hate the
browsers on this and the beauty is you
will be able to go between your chrome
browser on your computer to your chrome
browser on your Android seamlessly so
bring up one thing on your computer and
it'll be on your phone and vice versa
fan tabulous he was it wouldn't love
that that's great thanks for the call
Jerry I like the Chrome browser as well
I'm sorry that everyone can't use it yet
alright so I think we have one more
email from Sam who has some interesting
opinions on voicemail from Sam about
Jessica let's just go tell court don't
go yes hi this is Sam just finished
watching and Roy doubtless weekly and I
have to say I think Jessica doll court
might be a spy for Apple she definitely
touted off how good Andy
a iphone apps were on a iphone twice
anyways also finding out your sound guys
also an iphone guy just left me a little
bit confused and wondering if I made the
right choice clogged with Android I
think I did but you never know alright
just wanted to make that observation I
actually like Jessica doll court on the
show she adds a lot to the to the
experience and jmar I think you need to
speak up sometimes sometimes a little
hard to see you anyways other than that
I think everything is great great show
I'm gonna keep watching thanks even
though you guys mentioned that which
cannot be named twice I'll still listen
I guess even though you're all spies
what what I don't get is a how that
equates her to a spa right because she
mentioned it twice that means she's the
worst spy in the world he's like a
propagandist or I don't know what the
right word is pretty evangelic all right
she's bringing bringing the Apple
mission I said it oh we need like a
little dunce cap that you need to wear
when you say that on the show oh my god
can we all focus on the important part
of this voicemail though I have gone to
great lengths to increase the volume of
yes please I got him so proud yes that's
good you really took his routes Sam i
