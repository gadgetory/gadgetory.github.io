relies on some technology that hasn't
changed in centuries this is the bottom
of the shell which has gunpowder in it
which is called the lift charge when
this ignites it lights all the black
powder as ancient as can be and creates
gas gas pressure which pushes the shell
out of the mortar at about 400 feet per
second before you grab a big scale
production like this one at the Oakland
Coliseum with synchronized music you
need a burst of new tech to pull it off
the technology as far as firing systems
has really improved over the years
allowing us to use computers with the
show design as well as the launching of
the display shells weeks before the big
spectacular producer Jeff Thomas
assigned specific fireworks to each
moment in the show's playlist in this
case it's music from Nintendo's Super
Mario Brothers slow quiet segments I'll
put some slower quieter effects in big
robust pieces of music put in the louder
more concussive devices fun songs to put
the happy faces in or maybe that heart
love song then it's up to the crew to
lay out the shells in the correct order
this is the main body of the show that's
from the beginning until the finale
everything that gets fired comes out of
here how many shells are there today
would you say over a thousand while the
fireworks show itself may only last 15
minutes it takes hours and hours for the
pyrotechnic crew to fill all of these
canisters each one is then connected to
a firing module with specific addresses
I would have 4d set on this these
address buttons and then it would be
zero through absolutely the shell
address could be four d0o they're all
synchronized with this timecode they
call it and when the time codes receive
we say okay go we're in sync and we just
fire the show three two one fire set P
the sky lights up over the Oakland
Coliseum everything firing as planned as
fans enjoy this summer
we allow fans on the field we take great
pride in in the quality of the fireworks
we put a lot of thought and effort into
the themes we want fans to walk away
saying that was the best fireworks or
they ever saw happy faces in the sky and
in the stands in Auckland I'm Kara
