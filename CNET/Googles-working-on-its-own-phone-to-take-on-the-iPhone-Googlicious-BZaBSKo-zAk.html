google issues for everything google we
can pack inside of a show there's lots
to talk about and we start off with a
new Telegraph report that says google is
planning to release its own
google-branded smartphone that will
compete directly with the iphone we've
heard rumblings about this over five
months ago that Google wanted a more
integrated Apple like experience for
their Nexus phone line now at the moment
Google develops the Android software but
unlike Apple it partners with a rotation
of manufacturers each year for the Nexus
phone hardware the new device is
expected to be released by the end of
2016 according to their sources and
we'll see Google take more control over
design manufacturing and software it's
really just an example where Google
wants to be more like Apple and then
there's the other times where Apple
wants to be more like Google but don't
worry google has stated it's not going
to just stop supporting the Nexus phone
line for example an android police
report says Google is working on a live
support app for Nexus devices it's
tentatively called Google support and
think of it as Amazon's Mayday help
service but for Nexus products google's
app reportedly also has the ability to
share your screen with an agent on the
other end so I would just make sure you
clean out your photo library before you
set up a help session all right the
googs may also be redesigning androids
home and navigation buttons again
according to android police this image
is believed to be the next stock
navigation bar in Android n that we
might see released with the new phones
and speaking of new phone's specs for
the next gen Nexus phones manufactured
by HTC this year have also been leaked
out android police reports two phones
with a 5-inch and 5.5 inch screen sizes
and the code names sailfish and marlon
now sailfish is the 5 inch phone
according to the report with a rumored
5-inch 1080p display a quad-core 2
gigahertz 64-bit processor and a hefty 4
gigs of ram but we expect to efficiently
hear about these new models this fall in
the september-october timeframe now in
other hardware evan blast is back at it
again on his twitter eveleigh
after he revealed the samsung galaxy
note 7 has been confirmed indicating a
jump from the note 5 to the note 7 name
to catch up with the entire galaxy
product line now the note 7 will come
with the long-rumored iris scanner and
evelyn's confirm specs with a 5.7 inch
screen wide HD Super AMOLED display with
64 gigs of storage and an additional
micro SD card slot and more now it will
also bring ip68 water resistance even
with a slot for the Samsung pen that's
pretty slick it's expecting to release
potentially on the August second for
another one of Samsung's unpacked events
and in other Google bits and pieces a
new collaboration with Stanford I do and
Google will bring a new project that
makes learning how to code a whole lot
easier for kids it's a new open hardware
platform that allows young leans to
build physical coding experience is
called project blocks and that's blocked
with no see in it of course it is now
the system is made of three core
hardware components and Google notes
that kids naturally learn to build with
their hands and collaborate with others
project Blox is looking for participants
want to take part of this study so check
out the website if you want to find out
more also at VidCon last week youtube
announced its bringing live streaming
capabilities directly to its youtube
apps on iOS and Android you'll be able
to see audience numbers and metrics with
a live chat happening at the same time
where people keep telling you to take
your top off now select YouTube partners
are getting it and the feature will
continue to roll out more widely over
time and finally Google Earth and the
satellite layers in maps are getting a
huge boost with sharper and more
detailed images thanks to the Landsat 8
satellite it was launched in 2013 and it
captures images with greater details
truer colors and even more frequency now
you can see the difference in this
comparison between the old data and the
new imagery that's pretty now Google
calls it its freshest global mosaic to
date it looks really impressive and it's
definitely worth checking out alright
that's going to do for this week's show
you can email us at google issues at
cnet com or tweet me at brian Tong
thanks so much for watching we'll catch
you all next time for some more I'm
backing delicious
