a Ford Escape Toyota rav4 and Honda CRV
Mazda strides in there with its zum-zum
promise can it hold its own let's drive
the 2015 cx-5 Grand Touring and check
the temp and the cx-5 is a two row
five-passenger crossover no third row
optional or standard in this guy fairly
compact in its line it is - the Mazda 6
when a bmw x3 is - a 3-series to kind of
stack the concept here now you've got a
lean Spartan sporty cabin in the cx-5
that goes with its zoom zoom driving
character the main text Ori is the
optional navigation system in this
otherwise stock Grand Touring head unit
this is TomTom powered stuff it's a
mixed bag in my opinion first of all
you've got kind of a pedestrian looking
overview map that oddly enough puts
traffic in this weird little linear band
on the right instead of overlaying it
really richly on the map that to me is
kind of an odd interface on the other
hand as you get close to a turn or an
interchange it does a great job in fact
it changes to a totally different look
to show you what lane to be in and micro
guide you so that I like a lot on the
other hand you've got a mix of
interfaces hit the screen and you get
this classic TomTom interface you might
know from your pnd but if you want to
drive by voice ready navigation you get
this very different list of choices not
the same as what's on the TomTom map and
certainly not the same look and feel
that to me is not good interface design
and that nav is grafted on by the way
over here in this odd little door on the
side of the dash you slide that open and
that's where the SD card goes obviously
you've got Bluetooth calling bluetooth
streaming under your audio choices
you're not going to be missing anything
we've got an AM and FM radio with a
handy HD toggle I like this as opposed
to letting the radio do its own
switching they tend to make a hash of
that Sirius satellite radio bluetooth
streaming is right next to Pandora
working off your app everything is kind
of slow on this connected stuff
especially on the Bluetooth and Pandora
I just feel like this system is kind of
overburdened
it doesn't move very crisply so your car
glancing back after you invoke something
to see if it's up yet and that takes
your eyes and mind off the road same
thing goes for acquiring the iPod and
other sources but at least all the
things you want are here as well as
traditional optical discs and aux beyond
that pretty pedestrian 6-speed automatic
only in this trim level of the vehicle
you've got a sport gate on the side no
paddles are available though it sounds
surprising given Mazdas sporting
intentions and this vehicle new this
year has a sort of city braking
technology to prevent rear Enders of
automatic braking something Volvo
pioneered a couple of years ago now
under the hood they used to stick only a
2-liter in these cars now they have an
obstacle two and a half liter in the
higher trim vehicles like we have here
this is a SKYACTIV inline 4 sitting
sidesaddle SKYACTIV means high
compression 13 to 1 yet using regular
gas if you don't understand the high
compression thing it's very simple it
means getting more power out of an ounce
of gasoline if you will by compressing
it's that much more but that tends to be
a difficult thing to do in most engines
especially with regular so they use a
combination of some interesting piston
dome shaping direct injection and some
kind of long cooling exhaust runners
that come off the back of the engine in
other words very efficient but not that
tricky you know electrification nothing
like that no turbos the bottom line is
184 horsepower 185 foot-pounds of torque
pretty respectable numbers for a car
that weighs about 3400 pounds rather on
the light side thanks to the use of a
lot of what they call high-strength
steel that is strong but weighs less
less mass in the actual metal 0 to 60 is
about 8 seconds in this guy nvg 2532
front wheel drive you get about a 2 mpg
haircut if you go all-wheel drive and at
this higher trim levels 6 B automatic
only lower trim cx-5 do offer a
six-speed manual
okay underway the main thing I want to
gauge here is does Mazda deliver on its
engaged driver zum-zum stuff that's
always been sort of their claim to
differentiation at first blush I'd say
somewhat yes this is not an overpowering
car but it does have good responsiveness
compared to a lot of vehicles today that
have got this rubbery kind of drivetrain
I missed the fact that it has no paddles
I'd like to see that on a car that has a
fairly taut feel power deliveries pretty
good the suspensions not wallowing and
yet the ride quality is good it doesn't
punish you with too much road chatter
feedback and last thing is ergonomics
are quite good in this vehicle
everything kind of falls where your
hands naturally are and visibility yeah
it's very compromised in the rear those
giant sea pillars are just one of the
defining characteristics of compact
crossovers but beyond that it's a it's a
very comfortable vehicle to get natural
with very quickly now pricing the cx-5
Grand Touring top of the stack automatic
only twenty eight eight another twelve
fifty gets you all wheel drive you're
also gonna take a two mpg hit more or
less on your fuel economy 1425 for the
tech package I get you the TomTom
navigator voidance in city traffic also
bi-xenon hid headlights with automatic
headlight control as well
