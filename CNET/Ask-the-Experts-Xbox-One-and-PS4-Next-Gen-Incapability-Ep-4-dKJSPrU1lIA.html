experts on my right is one expert Jeff
Bakalar from seen it yeah and I'm Peter
Brown from GameSpot today we're going to
answer your questions about media
functionality on the next-gen systems or
lack thereof whoa let's not get ahead of
ourselves Mohammed from facebook wants
to know well the playstation 4 support
media playback functionality including
mp3 mp4 s ati's stuff like that it
doesn't even play CDs yeah yeah you're
right it doesn't even play audio CDs ya
know the real answer here is that no
none of that stuff is gonna work why not
what's the problem the problem according
to Sony is that they didn't really think
that it was important they said that
it's going to come so it's not you know
the ps3 was such a versatile robust
media playback device it was the
greatest DLNA all the movies I had on my
nest I'd play right off my ps3 it was
fantastic throw anything at it accessory
I'm cavies throw anything at it it would
play the xbox one isn't any better off
no in fact it's just as bad yeah it will
play an audio CD but that's about it
there's really no way to bring your own
media yeah and it's actually really
shocking this to me when you offer
especially with xbox one playstation 4
has no saving grace in this either but
with xbox one it's the all-in-one Home
Media Console that's got to include
bringing your own content yeah and being
a versatile media player which neither
of these consoles are ya I mean they do
have some functionality one of the more
important things in addition to bringing
in your own media formats streaming
netflix hulu amazon prime all those work
for both systems right I think YouTube
is only on xbox right now okay and
you've got blue right now in the xbox
one which is not an option on the 360
correct that's worth something Microsoft
is also gone to great lengths to support
their xbox fitness program right which
is different than traditional
entertainment like a movie or TV show
what it does do you a year free service
where you can work out watching all the
I don't know p90x insanity videos all
the new line of work out videos that
out there and popular the xbox one gives
you those actually uses the connect to
judge your performance that's correct so
it's got some interesting stuff but it
doesn't have the things that people are
really asking for the big thing with
that sort of stuff is it's up to you
like it's a good crunch sure but it's up
to you to be honest don't think that
you're just going to lose weight because
you bought an xbox one oh they're
probably going to gain weight to be
totally honest with you I'm nan wants to
know well USB drives work with the new
consoles the way they used to in the
past nowhere near where they used to to
be totally honest can really only do
like managerial sort of stuff game saves
I know people were downloading the
update to xbox one yes before it came
out and the PlayStation so that they
wouldn't have to just you know plug in
their console and sit there for three
and a half days way to update the short
answer is that no you can't bring
anything on a USB Drive outside of you
save files and updates and stuff like
that my little conspiracy theory in
regards to the Xbox one is that
Microsoft really wants you to buy this
stuff they don't really want you to
bring it over and have it for free you
know they want you to use their service
right I mean and then you get into the
whole sort of complexities with their
proprietary you know interface they love
that I love look what I Drive so if
you're thinking about buying the new
consoles it kind of comes down and
what's really important to you a lot of
people love the functionality we've
talked about today that's absent in the
new consoles when it was present in the
ps3 and xbox 360 we were let down yeah
and I think if you're going into these
systems thinking that they're going to
be the all-in-one that they used to be
you're also going to be a little bit
disappointed guess again some of these
things may come down the road but that's
still just talk at this point we'll see
what happens but uh yeah Jeff you have
anything else you want to add just
bummer City yeah you're bummed out well
thanks for joining us today folks will
be back tomorrow with another episode of
ask the experts for gamespot i'm peter
brown and for CNN i'm jeff bakalar
