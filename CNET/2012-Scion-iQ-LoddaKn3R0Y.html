in the same box your smart car came in
they call cars this size city cars you
know a lot of folks see what they call
city cars they scoff and say I couldn't
get anything in there how would I get my
groceries I don't know we did ok filling
this one there's three more guys in
there still let's go for a ride in the
2012 Scion iQ and check the tech first
off let's understand the IQ it's not
small to be commercially cheap you can
get a much bigger Corolla
for about the same price you can also
get a bigger mp3 player than a nano for
about the same price the idea is
miniaturization done well is worth
something and in certain cities where a
parking space may only occur when two
other cars park sloppily this little guy
can be a rolling mental-health clinic
now the first thing people have to be
convinced of about little tiny cars like
this and I do this all the time is that
they tend to be spacious inside I don't
get it
you can get into an Audi a6 like I was
10 minutes ago and feel more cramped
than you are in this a smart fortwo or
my 68 Fiat 850 it's just a weird thing
about little cars it's also not small in
basic head-unit technology it's a
pioneer unit but different than we've
seen in scions beforehand you've got a
touchscreen panel right here for gain to
your various options let's go around
them one at a time here's my phone
screen I do have my phone paired it's a
very clear basic interface bluetooth
streaming is also in here contacts are
imported very nicely and I can scroll
them very quickly
that's a nice response I like that ok
our sources are shown on this kind of
needlessly tricky Cover Flow looking
thing I prefer to say screw that let's
go to the all button AM FM we're also HD
radio enabled on this guy CD single
optical slot up here no DVD playback
ipod lower-left that hooks up to this
USB + aux jack down on the cone
so check out Pandora again I've got an
iOS device paired the Pandora apps
installed when I launch it I get a scion
brand on it the screen goes blank and
control and logic are shifted to the
vehicle notice Pandora carries over all
the metadata as well as the thumbs-up
thumbs-down functionality everything
you'd expect on the actual app now while
you're asking how's the nav well there's
no nav on this head unit again being a
pre-production car I don't know where
this sits in the line this could be the
base head unit or one notch up have to
wait till this is actually on showrooms
and can be configured on their web
buying guide but so far that's all I can
tell you right now you may want to make
plans to bring your own nav device based
on past Scion factory Navrang we've seen
bottom-right corner of my sound settings
these are interesting here Scion sound
profile natural hear and feel
they're just presets of EQ if I go under
sound I can roll my own EQ with treble
bass front rear and left and right for
the fader and the balanced DSP will give
you the ability to turn on or off the
automatic volume control it's pretty
common in most cars Oh check this out
under DSP I like this I've got the
advanced sound retriever it's a pioneer
technology that tries to retrieve some
of that lost detail in compressed
sources I really like using this on
bluetooth streaming because bluetooth
streaming sounds like hell you can turn
this on at three different levels either
not at all low rate or high rate Oh
unlike some Scion products where they
add this horrible Bluetooth system that
has no interface it's just a button over
here a black rocker switch and a
microphone this one's got the cheapy
microphone up here on the wheel but now
finally I've got the ability to go do
settings on the phone from the screen
thank you
yep that's the engine all this much of
it 1.3 liter inline-4
pressed up way by the nose here
sidesaddle front-wheel drive nothing
about this spells performance it spells
efficiency you've got 94 horsepower 89
foot-pounds of torque
them's little numbers but so is the
weight of this car it's about 2,000
pounds was the last time you had a car
that only weighed a ton
zero to sixty more than likely and the
mpg is 36 37 and all of that gets done
through a one choice only CVT
continuously variable transmission and
there's electric power steering on this
guy which is part of how they bring up
the mpg so no hydraulic pump to run it
it's an electric motor that gives you
that assist the IQ has much the same
high-top sneaker look as a smart fortwo
just kind of Falls here and it's 14
critical inches longer making it just
big enough to look weird on a shelf at
Toys R Us oh and when getting in or out
of the back of one of these do it on the
passenger side that seat slides farther
forward so you're less likely to turn an
IQ into an eyeful
our delivery is now parking it's a
little trick that manufacturers will do
they have a car with a place wallet and
they'll give it really vigorous initial
tipping with a front load a lot of the
engines response early in the
accelerator pedal travel it creates the
appearance of power but then it runs out
of steam runs out of breath higher up
this car is in that range but that makes
it a good city driver the engine is
particularly literally intrusive unlike
a smart fortwo the engine of course is
in the front the smart fortwo it'd be in
the back but I'm hearing a lot of you
know kind of unpleasant engine note it's
a $16,000 car so I don't think it gets
any demerits for that but it doesn't
sound as smooth as I'd like it to the
ride quality is quite good it's much
more civilized car than a smart fortwo
in everyday driving visibility is
actually pretty good
it's funny you get a blind spot not in
the rear corner but on the rear side
because you've got this huge panel over
here between the porthole window and the
back light in the rear and of course our
wheels on the rear are all the way
pushed out to the end of the body that
will result in a lack of dampening
weight overhang of the rear that tends
to give some cars a little bit of
dampening against road gems in this car
you're going to hit something on the
rear wheels you're going to feel all of
it go nothing counterbalance is that
hanging past the axle money okay let's
price this little Scion iQ it's a 2012
that's coming out in a rolling launch
beginning in October 2011 for the west
coast and not wrapping up until March
2012 availability around the middle of
the country about $16,000 base
inexpensive little car of course the
options are still a little TBD in terms
of Tekin it up from the factory but of
course that head units pretty hot mostly
this car is a blank canvas the idea is
to get a scion and do a lot of your own
thing after market but generally
speaking we're looking at a new 45 added
to the album that is Scion
