right now we are at LG's launch event in
New York City for the LG optimus g pro
now this is the US version of the
international device which launched at
Mobile World Congress but this new
product is actually going to be coming
to AT&amp;amp;T now pre-orders for the LG
optimus g pro go on sale basically on
May third and the actual device starts
to hit stores on May tenth so as you can
tell this device is very large in the
sort of hybrid tablet and smartphone
range you can see it has a very large
5.5 inch screen 1080p that's 1920 x 1080
it has an IPS LCD display you can see is
very bright has lots of really nice
colors and it's also powered by a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor one of
the newest ones you can get also really
nice about the device is it connects to
a TT s 4g LTE network for fast data and
as you can see it's very thin has this
sort of nice metallic trim on the edges
which is pretty cool unlike the european
version it does not have an antenna to
get digital TV and stuff like that but
it does have a headphone jack up top
you've got power button right here on
the right side and on the left got
volume as well as a dedicated camera
button you've got USB on the back on the
on the bottom right here then on the
back you have a 13 megapixel camera that
has an LED flash as well on the front
it's a 2-megapixel front-facing camera
and what's interesting about that is you
can do some really cool camera features
where you can actually see both the
what's happening through the front and
also through the going through the main
camera at the same time so you capture
both of one so that's an interesting
feature something you've seen on other
phones like the samsung galaxy s4 so the
operating system is Android
a jelly bean which is very nice very
modern OS you can see you have LG's spin
on things it's very fast very responsive
have their own UI over android but it
looks pretty clean pretty modern and on
all pretty handsome handset so there you
have it folks I'm Brian Bennett for cnet
com and this has been a first look at
the LG optimus g pro for a cnc check
back soon for a full review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
