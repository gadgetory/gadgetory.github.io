the Philips hue tap this is a remote
control for your Philips hue lighting
you can put it on the wall or stick it
in your pocket or just leave it out in
the coffee table and you'll have a
series of buttons you can press to
trigger your hue lights now the Philips
you tap gives you four buttons in total
to control your lights with there are
these three buttons on the face of the
device and then the face of the device
is a fourth button itself now that gives
you the option to turn one light off or
turn one light on or turn an entire
scene of lights on or off so if I press
this button I get this light turning
purple
if I press this button I get all the
lights turning red and then similarly if
I press the third button I turn off just
one light and if I press the big fourth
button here I turn off all the lights
and that's really it
you just turn your lights on and off
with this thing so it's a pretty simple
device and it costs $60 which might be a
bit steep for some but if you've got an
existing hue set up a lot of lights that
you like to control I think having the
practicality of a physical remote is a
really nice touch one thing though this
thing's called the Philips you tap but
it's going to take a bit more than a tap
to get these buttons to work if you just
press them down they'll click but they
won't necessarily work you have to press
and then give it a little extra oomph in
order to get the entire face of the
button down before they'll work the
reason for that is that the hue tap
doesn't use any batteries it actually
runs off of the kinetic power generated
each time you press a button that's a
really cool feature you don't have to
change batteries you don't have to worry
about charging it but it does mean that
it's not quite as usable as you might
like all in all though I like this
device a lot I wish it cost a little
less than $60 but it's still pretty cool
and if you have an existing Philips you
set up you're going to like being able
to control your lights without having to
fish your phone out of your pocket for
seeing that I'm right Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
