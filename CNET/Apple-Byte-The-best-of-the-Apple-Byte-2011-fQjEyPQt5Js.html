welcome to the Apple bite now our entire
office is shut down right now but we
wanted to give you a little some some so
we put together a few of our favorite
tips and moments from the past year in
this show now iOS 5 was released this
year but there were plenty of hidden
secrets inside of it that you probably
didn't even know existed so let's check
it out hey guys Brian saw here with
cnet.com and Apple recently announced
some of the new features that we can
expect to see in iOS 5 for AI devices
when it's released this fall now
customization has always been one of iOS
his weaker points and they aren't
bringing widgets but there are other
ways to trick out your phone how about
keyboard shortcuts going to general and
your keyboard settings and you can now
create a shortcut you type in that will
display a phrase to make life a whole
lot easier apples also improve the
accessibility options that can be
helpful for all of us you can turn on
the LED flash for alerts but you can
also turn on custom vibrations on your
iPhone now it's not what you think so
you guys can stop giggling now go-to
sounds and find vibration patterns you
have the ability to enter and use
pre-made ones or create your own custom
vibration by tapping on the screen for a
contact that you know is more important
than others now on the iPad you can also
use a custom gesture to open different
menus on your screen by turning on
assistive touch at the moment you can't
assign it to unlock your screen or
launch any apps but it's probably coming
in the future and the multi-touch
gestures we've seen from previous builds
have returned in iOS 5
now Notification Center is one of the
big revamps and you can create the alert
style if it's more important the option
to view it in your lockscreen and how
many notifications show up at one time
you also have the option to purchase
more ringtones or alert tones in the
preferences if you check out the photo
app it allows you to create albums on
your iDevice and also move photos into
different albums Safari the web browser
has a nice option that allows you to
open a new page in the background
instead of interrupting the current
window you're viewing and the weather
app has a panel for your local weather
instead of adding a new one for every
city you visit and for all youth
sketching people with something
hide you will now be able to delete
individual calls from your call lists
plus one of the biggest ones you can't
see right now
iOS 5 supports 1080p video playback
which sets them up for better video
output directly to TV sets and higher
resolution displays for future I devices
now there's plenty of other features
buried in here but we wanted to show you
a few of them that you can expect to see
in the fall I'm Brian Shawn with your
first look at some of the hidden
features in iOS 5 use it wisely
I guarantee you learn something new
there but I also learned something about
relying on iOS apps a little too much
especially when it comes to girls look
out boys boom goes the dynamite aces on
y'all know that money well smell it's
all mine Wow Brian seems loud 9 lately
what's with you but things are going my
way remember those iPhone apps iPhone
yes they've helped me meet a girl I'm
actually seeing someone right now you're
seeing some girl a girl hey baby yeah
what do you guys doing are you guys
gambling again you know that's a great
question but uh before I answer that
I'll just check my phone for me check
your phone
I'm really really sorry tell you I'm
sorry aren't you yeah rub my back a
little more you know what I'm also
thirsty
hopefully through mist in the control
room could you get it for me I think
maybe yeah just over that direction you
just saw it you know what I need that
app right now get on that call oh nice
your tea my tea like that you guys
Cheers
cheers to that and that's how we do it
all right all right
oh okay what can I say I learned my
lesson in I will never do that again
now people have been talking and saying
I've had a very close relationship with
my gadgets there were rumors flying
around that I made out with my iPhone
totally untrue it even went as far as
saying that I had a physical
relationship with my MacBook Air that's
sick it's completely sick
to
you
you guys really believe that stuff you
know there's a lot of things that you
can do with computer animation and
graphics you know alright well we'll
wrap things up and address some of the
criticism I get because people say I
care more about my Steve Jobs statute
than I do about them people say I don't
treat my staff nicely well I would say
the same thing about them but sometimes
talking a big game isn't all that it's
cracked up to be
Charlie you know playing a little home
run battle 3d home run baseball yeah
like you mind if I give it a try yeah
okay that's Charlie that's my phone
sausage fingers what are you doing I
want to see you at 3 o'clock the real
baseball diamond and we'll see who can
play baseball
you
hey player let's get it on
Jamie right down the middle of the plate
okay real blood bled from my knee I just
like to let you guys know that I bled
for the occupier all right that's gonna
do it for this week's show special
