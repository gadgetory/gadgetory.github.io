disturbing I am Bridget Carey this is
your CNET update take your Christmas
celebrations of a notch this year with
some high-tech help
let's start by spicing up the
traditional Yule Log video when guests
come over you may want to put on a
soothing video of a crackling fire but
why not instead stream a video of actor
Nick Offerman sipping whiskey near a
crackling fire for 45 minutes yes it's
really just one big add for that whiskey
brand but there's something meditative
and soothing about staring at this
continuous video maybe it's the beard or
perhaps more fitting for your home is
the Darth Vader Yule Log created by
YouTube user Benjamin Apple you could
just watch Vader's dead body burn in the
fire in this five hour long clip little
known fact that helmet of his was pretty
fire resistant now if only someone could
make a version of this for Jar Jar Binks
it really is easy to play this on your
TV if you have a streaming box with a
YouTube app like the Roku or chromecast
or a smart TV with YouTube built in you
may also recall a few other unique you
logs from years of Christmas past such
as little bub the cat purring in front
of a fire the four-year-old feline
internet sensation didn't make a new
Yule Log video this year instead bub has
been busy making a billboard
chart-topping album seriously the album
is called science and magic a guide to
the universe and a hit number two on the
top dance electronic album category and
25% of the proceeds benefits special
needs pets but if you're looking for
some Santa fun to keep the kids busy
Google has once again created a digital
portal into Santa's Village
go to Santa tracker google.com to access
a number of games videos and educational
activities like a translation tool for
holiday greetings around the world and
you can also learn some coding basics
with the help of the North Pole elves
Google also has an Android Santa tracker
app with games and some extras like
watch faces for Android powered smart
watches and there's a virtual reality
mode to use with Google cardboard and on
December 24th you can start tracking the
big man himself and see where he
is on Google Maps Google isn't the only
high-tech way to keep tabs on Santa the
home improvement retailer Lowe's has its
own home monitoring system called the
iris and it's app you can track when
Santa arrives at your house
you don't need to own the iris system to
use the app but it helps you set up
magical cloak sensors around the house
like near the tree or the stockings to
catch them in the act
you can also set up a Santa cam for
photo evidence that's it for this tech
news roundup and there's more at sea
Netcom from our studios in New York I'm
Bridget Carey merry Christmas to all and
to all a good update</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
