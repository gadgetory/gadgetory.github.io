com I'm here at CES 2012 here to show
you the Nokia Lumia 900 that is
initiating phone for a couple reasons at
nokia's president today CEO stephen elop
was very adamant that this marks Nokia's
returned to the US market in the North
American market this is the second Nokia
Lumia device that's a windows phone 7
device to make it to a US carrier so
also big deals we're excited about that
the very premium design I do like it a
lot nokia through its histories always
been very good about design making
really solid making them almost
indestructible and just making it very
slick and very comfortable hold on the
hand I have to say that this this phone
it's exactly the same on the display
you'll see we have a typical windows
phone 7 interface so we have all the
squares you need to call them cubes or
hubs whatever want to call them but a
lot of people have different names but
you scroll through and you can see all
the different features like Internet
Explorer you can go to the menus you can
go to xbox live you can go to your homes
you go to your calling menu your
contacts list messages but just scrolls
up and down of course you can drag and
drop these tiles like you do on previous
Windows Phone 7 devices is running
windows 75 75 mango so that add a few
extra features that came out in the fall
so good to see that on the back have the
camera lens it's an egg megapixel camera
it is a Carl Zeiss lens at a 28
millimeter and it is f-stop of 22 so a
lot of power in this camera really
excited to see the pictures it takes we
did see a demo earlier of the picture
taken ability it looks really good all
in all pretty exciting phone excited to
see Nokia come back to the US market
especially with this it will be out an
AT&amp;amp;T we don't know released it yet we
don't know pricing yet but will be out
sometime this year I'm kin Sherman here
at CES 2012 with the Nokia Lumia 900</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
