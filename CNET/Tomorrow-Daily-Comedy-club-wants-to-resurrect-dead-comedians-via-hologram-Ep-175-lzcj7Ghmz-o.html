that looks like a big old light break we
find out just what it takes to get to go
to the Star Wars Episode 7 premiere and
a comedy club right here in America is
gonna let dead comedians perform which
is weird smart daily
greetings citizens of the internets
welcome to tomorrow daily the best ski
talk show in the known universe I'm
Ashley sceva join he's always on his
invisible motorbike kale anonymous
ashley Esqueda gets to see Tomorrowland
tonight today today tomorrow yep
figuring that out I do we produced the
look is gonna see it to you Lee you're
not going I'm not going i'll bring you
next time i should just go to disneyland
you could you know what you could just
go ride Space Mountain 15 times are you
excited about it pretty excited yeah I
really mean I'm a Disney kid so I'm
really looking forward to I love Brad
Bird Iron Giant Incredibles so I've I'm
excited about that everybody loves
George Clooney yeah but you can look
forward to you're actually gonna have it
you're gonna go to the interview Brad
Bird director talked to brad bird yeah
it's exciting so that'll be sat at some
point in the future we're doing stuff
we're not just locked in the studio
we're going out there and talking to
famous people and people that are
smarter than us good humans everywhere I
got a day pass okay but let's talk about
all the stuff we have today we get
people hyped true let's hit headlines
okay so who's your favorite comedian who
has passed away Mitch Hedberg that's a
good one yeah i would say Richard Pryor
mmm i would say George Carlin or George
Carlin Lenny Bruce why I'd feel like I
feel like there's a ton there's a pretty
big valuable engine legends who passed
on okay so comedy is not quite dead um
this story is pretty incredible there is
a comedy club in New York that will be I
like to try to figure out the best way
to says they're going to let comedians
who have died perform famous sets that
we've seen them performed before via
hologram in their comedy club okay which
is like what crazy crazy so can you
imagine like seeing Richard Pryor but as
a hologram walking around doing a set I
think this is really cool i love comedy
i love going out to comedy shows you and
Logan our big music fans you go out to a
lot of music festivals and stuff like
i'm a comedy girl like i like to go see
comedy shows and i like I've performed
santim comedy I enjoy it I'm not very
good at it uh but you know not but
regardless i love good comedy so um so i
love this so it's this club is called
the national comedy center it's not just
a nightclub they want to open next year
in jamestown in new york and they are
going to have Holograms of stand-ups and
comic actors from various eras so not
just you know 70s comics or not any of
that they're going to have a whole bunch
of different kinds of comics and he the
chairman of this Center described the
comedy center as and this is a quote a
comedy club or folks can go back in time
and witness a classic routine in a
setting God knows where it might have
been and experienced that as if they
were really there and I think this is
awesome because a lot of people never
got the chance to see Richard Pryor
perform like I didn't I was too young
and and George Carlin and in these great
great comedians mitch hedberg we never
got the chance to do that and now we
might get the chance to sort of cease a
comedy routine in a club with other
people because that is an experience you
know definitely that's the way you want
to sort of cds
sets it's great to watch for example
unlike a netflix comedy special at home
it's awesome but it never beats being in
a crowd with other people who are there
to laugh so I love this I think this is
a great idea it's very interesting they
they're going to be working with
hologram USA which is the Beverly Hills
company that did Jimmy Kimmel remember
when he did the country i think was at
the end he was in nashville the same
time he was in Los Angeles doing Jimmy
Kimmel Live this is the same company
hologram USA and they want to spotlight
comedians like Milton Berle uh Bob Hope
George Carlin Rodney Dangerfield but
yeah but they did say that Bill Cosby
that would be good to see him he's I
think he's still alive nice dead to me
dead to everybody I think at this point
um but the guy the chairman said that
there are not quite deals in place with
these comedians families yet so there's
no like lineups in place or anything and
I yeah it sounds like a lot of work well
there's another there's sort of another
hurdle that might be a thing another one
all right um well so Holograms aside I
mean comedians like Robin Williams who
passed away last year actually
stipulated in his will that his digital
image could not be used for any
commercial purpose for 25 years after
his death so you have enough foresight
for that apparently somebody did either
he did or maybe his his lawyers did or
they saw that hologram technology for
like Tupac and Jimmy Kimmel and they
were like we have to protect your image
for the next however long so we're never
going to see like a CG Robin Williams
Hawking something on in a commercial or
you know basically his image can't be
sold after his death for a certain
period of time so um so you definitely
won't be seeing robin williams in this
comedy club but this is a very
interesting sort of digital rights issue
like where there are going to be times
where people who are famous I mean
clearly after we die we will continue to
do this show in hologram form because
you're welcome everybody but but for all
of these comedians families there's a
question of is this a thing that we want
to do that like do we is do we feel
comfortable about this is this something
that
you know they would have wanted that's
obviously a good question to ask so
there's a lot of kind of it sounds
amazing on the surface and I and I as a
comedy fan would love it but then
there's also all these other issues you
kind of have to consider so it's a
pretty pretty interesting sort of thing
that that they're planning to do I
really like it I definitely do that
would you you go go check it out yeah I
would too I feel like I would too that's
really neat I think it's real cool and
that actually brings us to our hashtag
of the day which is TD comedy ok which
comedian would you want to see which
comedian would you see comedy and you
see you said I said a million different
comedians million of conveyance um yeah
I mean I got there so many if Lucille
Ball did stand-up I felt like I would
want to see that oh yeah that'd be good
I don't know that she did a lot of that
she's an actress primarily but I would
have loved to have seen her talked about
so there's I would love to see George
Burns Georgian and like it's good one
too George Burns have been good I don't
want to say anymore cuz I don't want to
take any from anybody that's gonna yeah
yeahs tags shut up now uh there you go
TV comedy send it over tell us who you'd
want to see a comedian has passed away
um performer wise man wouldn't it be
cool to see like stop it really old yeah
stop saying comedian but that means that
could be he's gonna go like even like
older oh yeah performers and said I'd be
really cool cheap ugg do some stand-up
that would be pretty funny hilarious
real shot for the dark anyway all right
come on so we all want to go to the Star
Wars Episode 7 premiere we all do yes
but these guys want to go a lot more
than we do now so they fit to make it so
that they could play with JJ Abrams to
go to Star Wars Episode 7 premiere why
did they sent an x-wing up into space oh
wow look at that footage legitimately
scented x-wing up his face okay now this
is a tiny little X what is back to
though so this guy named Matt Kings were
Kings north and phil st. Pierre uh have
a program called Project helium tears
okay in which they send stuff they
photograph stuff up in space so they
decided to launch a model x-wing up into
space with a GoPro when Phil genius look
at these guys like all right this isn't
the first time people have done this
I've seen a pizza get sent up into space
donut
yeah a donut got sent up into space but
yeah the site they sent up this x-wing
up in his face and then they like they
filmed it and then they added the Star
Wars text crawl in it to the footage to
the footage with the plea of the JJ
Abrams please send us to the Star Wars
Episode 7 premiere and of course he
loves practical effects so maybe this
will happen this is yeah there's the
text bro ah yes so there's yes that this
is basically their plea again project
healing tears of you want to check out
more of their stuff I think this is
awesome I think this is how we should
start sending people I think there
should be a special premiere for all the
people that go crazy and and do like
cool i love these I think everyone
should do this yeah um high fives to you
guys I there's no word on whether or not
they're getting snow word yet but they
have a hashtag if you want to follow the
saga it's just hashtag hey JJ hey JJ hey
JJ um but yeah I think this is amazing
and it I love this because it makes the
x-wing look like it's huge and flying a
lot lower to the ground and look like a
giant x-wing flying like maybe you know
500 feet us so super cool that is pretty
glorious um I hope they get it I hope
they get it I if I was JJ Abrams i'd be
super impressed with you that and I'd be
like yes you can come too then they
don't even want to go the LA premiere
they wanted to London permit well that's
the one where you know that I guess the
production house is there so all right I
gotta tell you about the future stick
chandelier that you're gonna want in
your house oh yes he is gonna want this
every yes you're gonna swing from it of
course um so this is pretty sweet this
is a huge LED chandelier that was
created with a by company called a
screen it's in Russia and they worked
with a few other companies and
collaboration on this this was made for
the leningrad center in st. Petersburg
in Russia and there's a thousand 89 LEDs
there software-controlled so here they
are they put them all up there they
light it up and this thing is pretty
cool because it is software-controlled
meaning this thing can move so are you
ready for it are you ready for it wait
for the drop oh look it it's alive wrap
isn't that awesome for anybody just
listening like you
to see this like there's really no other
way to describe it yeah it's amazing and
I want to go to there and see it in
person and the cool thing about this is
is that not only does it give the
illusion of sort of this like fluid
movement as if it's light and water it
also does these really sharp geometric
shapes as well so you can see a look
right back to flat plain nuts square I
want to see if it can do like a face
maybe I would imagine like a face and
like shapes and stuff like this I mean
listen right there's almost 1,100 so
what are they what are they using it for
the it's just it's a peacemaker led
chandelier that they installed in the
Leningrad center and they wanted
something that was really sort of
futuristic and that was kind of a
showpiece for the Leningrad center and
so this is this is what they came up
with and I want a small version of this
in my house immediately like a little
tiny LEDs like in little little white I
think that would be amazing or any music
to this because it seems like it would
be awesome against some music I think
they were just showing like how it works
but I would imagine when it's actually
alive and the Leningrad center is open
there will be I'm sure there will be
music exactly i'm thinking some sick EDM
music of course of course Sam no you got
to and it took them up it took them
three weeks and the installers were
suspended 30 feet near like installing
everything which is crazy not for three
weeks straight I don't know maybe it was
Russia they must force them to do it who
picked up people off the street um but
if we get in in Mother Russia chandelier
lights up you but I love this it looks
like a giant light bright in 3d space
and I thought that was so cool and and
also it makes new patterns and sequences
every time it turns on so the software
creates new ways for it to run images
thats NT and it just kind of rng sort of
base almost like a like a visualizer in
winamp if you recall those the
visualizer and winamp oh my god yeah I'm
getting old school there I'm a 90 year
old woman I love winamp um or I used to
love it until it went away but yeah so
that's the LED chandelier really I think
chandelier in the future but that's it
for headlines we're going to come back
and
with our into its which are actual
physical items that we have both brought
into the studio which is exciting mine's
a cheetah mine is not a cheetah but it's
cool anyway and we also have your user
feedback for oculus rift and our phone
talker for the day so don't click away
it's tomorrow daily but before you go
check out this beautiful fly through of
3d space this is amazing
welcome back to the show we've returned
it's a Thursday which means it's time to
tell you about all of the things that we
are super excited about this is into it
go where's your cheetah it didn't make
it through the break it didn't get past
security gate did you not get a drive-on
pass for it the terrible Kennedy can
just run past security but he has not
been working out so fair enough we all
practically everyone the whole world saw
Avengers 2 age of age of Ultron Sri oh
uh and left a lot of people asking so
what's next right where is this Marvel
Cinematic Universe going obviously
there's going to be you know the Civil
War and there's going to be the infinity
infinity of yours right well my into it
this week is the Infinity Gauntlet okay
so basically this is the direction they
could go it's scott Thanos the guy that
was in the after credits thing that's
not really a big spoiler because
whatever a lot of people in the theater
were like who's that guy and then here
are the gems know that they were
collected I'm kind of speaking in
layman's terms right now I'll get there
um if you're interested to kind of know
where it could possibly go because
they've said that it's not gonna go this
direction for sure you can read this and
kind of see maybe some of the threads
that could go you'll learn a little bit
more about Thanos but more importantly
there's some amazing art look I I only
recently got into comics but this has
been one of my favorite um as far as
arts concerned there's some really all
you can go back there yeah there's Tim
focus that way nice clothes there's a
lot of really incredible art in this
book and it's one of my favorites so
yeah you can also see that you can also
see how they would deal with death uh I
marvel cinematic universe I can't spoil
too much but it's pretty short and if
you wanted to hop in and see how they
blend in x-men and spider-man and the
Avengers all into this world yeah
artists I mean look at the back cover
everybody there's Wolverine somebody
carried her man yeah that's all I so
it's pretty cool it's one of my
favorites it has a really satisfying
beginning and ending you get to meet
Thanos and see the
angels again it's not a hundred percent
and there's another infinity series that
you can read okay um but yeah this is
this one this one is a blast and I love
it so I was like twelve fourteen dollars
on amazon if you want seems like a good
cost for that amount of entertainment
yeah so there you go that's what I'm
into I've already read it i'm gonna read
it again so excellent i'm gonna borrow
it when you're done okay can I show you
what I'm into alright so Ashley what are
you into okay so this is for the camera
nerds out there because I just got my
fuji x100 teen I've been looking for a
bag and I finally found what i like to
think is maybe the perfect bag um I love
bags i'm obsessed with good camera bags
and good like laptop bags like i love it
i have a lot of bags so here's my
problem i can't carry my mirrorless
camera around in my purse because it's
hitting everything in there I didn't
want a little tiny sort of like pouch
case I don't like that I wanna be able
just reach in pull out a camera and
start taking pictures but I also need to
be able to carry my laptop or my iPad
for the show and I just want one frickin
bag like I hate carrying a purpose that
you're selling them and a messenger bag
like I hate that I hate it so this is
the ona it's on ona bags ona bags ona
and this is the Prince Street bag I
think this is a newer bag that they
released I just got it at samy's camera
this weekend and I went again I went
down to samy's camera like hoping I
would hate it because I video yeah they
have a little they have little videos
and stuff a little promo videos bag porn
it is i love these types of videos i
just love bags guys okay like I'm really
obsessive back so i bought this this
weekend at sammy's I went down there
kind of like kind of crossing my fingers
that I would not like it because I
didn't want to spend the money these are
not cheap like they're not like you're
not gonna pay 50 bucks for this I think
this is how much 279 so yeah on there
but there if they feel super durable I
really like the the leathers really good
the wax canvas is nice but ok here is
the inside of my bag so it's got all of
my different compartments and there you
can adjust them so they have all the
adjustable camera bag compartments which
now I have like my wallet my glasses my
camera everything's in there and then it
has a back pouch that fits my 13-inch
retina MacBook
or my iPad which is really all i need so
i didn't want a bigger bag because i
always feel like I overload larger
messenger bags with a bunch of stuff
that I never need so this forced me to
sort of size down keep it simple and but
no I'm really enjoying it and and i will
say that i've gotten many compliments
while carrying it around a lot of people
have really liked it I liked dia it
feels sturdy and I will you and I like
that there's a little short handle to as
well so it's uh it's I totally love this
bag and I'm sorry for totally nerding
out bag nerding out on you guys but it's
you're into it segment but ya know this
is what I'm into this week I really do
love this Baggett's I'm obsessed with it
so next week it'll be I already have my
into it lined up for next week is it
another bag no it might be in the studio
and remote controlled it's not a cheetah
it's a remote control bag cheetah so
real quick though I want to address
another into it which is logan's into it
for this weekend Logan what you're into
it no next weekend next weekend he'll go
next weekend we'll save that was yours
daredevil this weekend he's gonna try to
finish it hang in there Logan you're
gonna make it Logan but until then let's
talk about your user feedback is so
excited for him you know it next week
but I just was like here it is um we
asked you guys to use hashtag TD riff to
tell us about your thoughts on the
oculus rift is it too late that's the
big question is it is it too late are
you in are you out are you waiting on
the fence a lot of you guys wrote in on
this you and wrote in and said depends
how hollow lens develops in the next 12
months might be obsolete on debut which
we kind of I kind of agree with that I
baby may be obsolete I don't know but
it's a VR VR na are completely different
different yeah um Ramsey's wrote in and
just said out doesn't that he doesn't
want well I will say this like if like a
people are less likely to buy a VR
headset if they're going to buy an a or
they are head centuries they're not
gonna want to own both know nobody's
gonna well I will it's where I don't
work but we're weirdos who buy
everything yeah so I think that's sort
of but a normal person who is not a
freak of nature and not obsessed
with everything that turns on and has a
screen and lights up and has circuits is
probably only going to choose I tell you
I tell you what so someone goes okay
you're gonna buy a hollow lens right
let's say you're gonna buy one that I'm
like hey Nintendo's releasing a VR
headset well even oculus rift like I
gotta have it yeah I gotta have some on
both it said like a guy gotta have both
so I think if you intend to release one
of only word i don't think i buy that
yeah it's a question of are people gonna
want to get both of them so again
content content is king it's got to be
good stuff and then shawn rhoden said vr
is super limited there is a Goldilocks
point between AR and VR that is actually
doable without sim sickness so out so
Sean's out too oh no oculus and out I
killers broke the mold like like broke
into the market and then lost it passed
in the CC will see you though I get a
lot of skeptics lastly a Jerry rodents
had not excited about the idea of gaming
using VR but if I can visit places that
might be too risky or dangerous in
reality maybe and I liked that because
it was like don't care about gaming that
like that doesn't really interest me but
if I can go to these places like you
know maybe Mars or even places that are
too dangerous to travel to right now in
the world like you know maybe that's a
thing that you would want to do you oh
I'm gonna go to Antarctica like I can't
or the top of Mount Everest like I
that's too dangerous for me i would
definitely die on that mountain but like
I would love to be able to experience it
be a virtual reality even though it
wasn't quite the same thing like I would
love to be able to see that so I get it
I totally get that and I agree with you
if they can somehow put me into the
wasteland and fall out you've sold so
your headsets do you really think that
they won't do like I'm sure fallout 4
will have some VI I'm just I'm just
never taking that headset off if they
put me in the wasteland I'm just a
minute and all the girls moving to make
it on DVD like Roche me to get full into
the simulation I've ever had Brenda like
had tested for radiation bad terrible
episode yeah alright yeah Bri job like a
lot of people are kind of really
teetering about this they're kind of
like well and now that I've seen
hololens i don't i'm not into it
out or or they say you know I I like
both or they'll say like well now I've
always been on VR and I'm going to stick
it's just got to stop being a gimmick
yes and we are like people are just
buying a gimmick and they're buying an
actual like game player like you're like
okay this game came out sixty dollars
and it's 40 hours worth of content okay
cool i really want to experience all
that I agree but wolves wheels III is
coming up so well I guess we'll see if
anybody that said out changes changes
back end yeah because they're gonna have
a lot of information elder scrolls like
if there was a Skyrim game everyone's
gonna be like oh well I guess I'm in
yeah well okay I'm gonna know um Skyrim
VR okay guys well it's time for a very
