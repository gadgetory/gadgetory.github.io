and it might be the best apple ipad
that's out there this is an upgrade to
the ipad air 2 last year instead of the
larger screen 12.9 intro this and the
smaller size includes just about all of
what that head plus a bit more this has
got a 12 megapixel camera it also has
the ability to color correct on the fly
this technology called true tone that's
in this screen that's new that claims
much better quality color accuracy plus
better anti-reflective features and
better brightness on the last ipad it
also has improved speakers like the ipad
pro did it has the ability to connect
accessories like this keyboard through a
side smart connector just like the ipad
bro plus it works with pencil so you
have the ability to use that
pressure-sensitive stylus you got to buy
this separately to connect and be able
to sketch and do really high-quality
work with that one difference here is
price this starts at five ninety-nine so
you're getting 32 gigs of storage you
can also stay up for 128 gigabytes or
even 256 which is a level of storage
that wasn't available on iPads before if
you add it up this is a more powerful
for the price iPad than any of the
others out there but you are sacrificing
a little bit of screen size some people
might like that I like the portability
we'll see when we play more with this
but on paper this is the best iPad that
we've seen I'm Scott Stein here at
cupertino looking at the 9.7 inch model
