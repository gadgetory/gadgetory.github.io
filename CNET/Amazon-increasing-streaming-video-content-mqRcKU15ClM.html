Richard carrion Cena calm and it's time
to get loaded amazon has added Viacom
shows to its prime instant video library
making the service a stronger competitor
to Netflix Amazon is adding videos from
Comedy Central MTV Nickelodeon and BTW
amazon said that it brings the total
number of videos on the service to more
than 15,000 an amazon streaming video
service is included with a $79 yearly
prime membership prime minister video
streams have skyrocketed in recent
months reportedly up nearly three
hundred percent in the fourth quarter
the up-and-coming photo sharing network
called path has taken a wrong turn in
the minds of many users after a blogger
revealed the path app automatically
uploads iphone users entire address
books to its servers it's causing a stir
because the app never asks for
permission to upload names emails and
phone numbers paths founder and CEO dave
morin responded saying the data was
being gathered to help users connect
with friends and family on path Morin
said the data collection will be
optional in an upcoming update another
young social service is also causing a
stir for not being straight forward with
what it does Pinterest is the site for
sharing cool finds on the web and it's
seen immense traffic growth with a
reported 10 million u.s. monthly uniques
but as one blog or discovered its adding
tracking code still links users share so
that it earns money from those clicks so
for user posts the link to a cool thing
they found on amazon for example
Pinterest would make money from anyone
who ends up clicking that link and
buying the product now lots of sites use
tracking codes to make money what's
noteworthy is that Pinterest does this
on the down low and it's a tactic some
bloggers say should be disclosed there's
more change in yahoo's leadership as was
expected after Yahoo's co-founder Jerry
gang stepped down a few weeks ago
Yahoo's chairman of the board Roy
Bostock and three other board members
announced they would not seek reelection
this year in a letter Boss Hogg said the
effort to sell Yahoo is still active but
also filled with complexity sprint
reported that it saw its biggest surge
in new customers in six years all thanks
to people flocking to get the iphone
with unlimited data contract but that
growth came with a price sprint reported
a lost of one
three billion dollars and the big hit
came from subsidies and had to pay out
to Apple Google is launching what looks
like to be its own version of TED Talks
those educational short presentations
from industry leaders and creative
thinkers Google is calling it solve for
x and it's designed to bring experienced
entrepreneurs innovators and scientists
from around the world to talk about
solutions to the world's problems it
started last week with a gathering and
is expected to be held a few times a
year the topics live on the website we
