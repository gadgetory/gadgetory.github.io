home computer it's been a while you're
not alone
year after year PC sales have been on
the decline some blame the demise of the
netbook or the rise of the tablet or all
the confusion around ultrabooks and
hybrids but I don't believe any of it
I'm Donnell Bell and in this episode of
top 5 I'm counting down the top 5
reasons not to buy a new computer unless
the show is sponsored by Microsoft or
Lenovo or something in which case go
computers starting off at number 5 smart
TVs
over the past few years connected
televisions have gotten smarter and
cheaper you can stream netflix on them
you can connect over Skype you can check
the news it's all there
even the remote controls have built-in
keyboards on them now the Smart TV is
quickly becoming the modern home
computer why else do you think Apple is
so hot to make one at number 4 the web
everything we do is on the web now we
used to live in a world where if we did
update our computers every few years we
couldn't even run the latest software
and our work would just Rhind to a halt
but now our software is in the cloud our
email is in the cloud so as long as your
old clunker can get online it's looking
at the same web as anything else out
there coming in at number 3 apps you
want them and all the cool ones are made
for phones and tablets why would
developers waste their time and money
creating software for a platform that is
rife with piracy and illegal downloads
there are exceptions but for the most
part all the interesting consumer
software out there is being made for iOS
and Android I'm looking at you candy
crush saga at number 2 uninspired
hardware today's machines may be
skinnier faster or make more clicky
sounds as they convert into pseudo
tablets but are they really offering you
something useful right now display game
performance it's not really my thing I
mean those giant Windows 8 tablet all in
one's kind of caught my eye but that's a
lot of screen smudge a lot of weight on
my lap area now before we get to the
number one reason to pass up on a new
computer let me qualify this a little so
you really need a new computer if you're
a student a hardcore PC gamer or someone
who works with media like music or video
then frequent updates make sense also if
your computer is just more than five
years old I mean some of you are holding
on to your old computers with the
delusional idea that it will magically
become some kind of valuable antique but
your candy-colored
imac is not a badge of nerd honor it's
just an indication that you still listen
to the chumbawamba
on CD on your disc man go treat yourself
but if none of those apply to you then
here's your number one reason not to buy
a new computer because your old ones
fine
maybe spruce it up with a super-fast
solid-state drive or update the OS or
buy some extra RAM because if you think
about it the past five years have been
about dumbing down software in the web
so that everything can run on your phone
your computer has just been sitting
there pretty much waiting for your phone
to catch up so your computer is fine
probably just resents all the time you
spend on your phone collecting virtual
candy so there you have it five reasons
to quell your primal geek instinct to
upgrade your computer but don't let me
stop you
truth be told manufacturers are bending
over backwards to sell you a computer
