smartphone there's great news there's a
lot of really affordable options out
there I think a favorite I've seen is
the Moto G this is an update to last
year's Moto G and there are a lot of new
things in it they make it worth your
while it's got LTE if you were worldwide
customer you could have gotten that
before but in the US now this is the
first moto G that has LTE it's also got
an improved camera 13 megapixels on the
back 5 on the front and it's
water-resistant ipx7 so you could put
this in water 1 meter of water for 30
minutes which means you could drop it in
a puddle you could possibly take it in a
quick bath or a shower but it's not
really meant for swimming it's meant to
ensure against dunks and accidental
exposure to water this has some
customization to like always moto likes
to have some ability to change colors
here this backplate can snap off and you
can put on different colored backs you
can also pick different colored trims
here it's all made of plastic with a
gorilla glass front but it feels really
nice and solid there's a 5-inch display
720p which looks perfectly fine and it's
running pretty much a pure Android this
is android 5.1 point 1 and it feels so
clean it's like using a nexus phone now
the processor it's not that great it's a
qualcomm snapdragon 410 similar to what
was on the g before it's just not all
that fast but it's fast enough to get
your basic stuff done if you're really
into playing games or doing a lot of
work on your phone you'll feel that it's
laggy compared to premium phones but the
battery life is really good its water
resistant feels nice cameras good and
it's affordable this one hundred eighty
dollars with eight gigs of storage and
one gig of ram where you can pay up
forty dollars and get one with 16 gigs
and two gigs of ram that's the one I
would pick there are a lot of affordable
phones now that are unlocked the Moto G
might be my favorite I'm Scott Stein at
cnet with the Moto G 2015 my favorite
budget smartphone
