today we're gonna take a look at the
Dell XPS one 27 so this is a 27 inch
all-in-one PC from Dell and it's unique
mostly because it has a 2560 by 1440
resolution display that makes this the
highest resolution windows-based on one
and it's in line with a 27-inch iMac
so Dell sells the system in four fix
configurations this is the $15.99 model
it's in the middle of the pack comes
with a core i5 CPU from Intel's third
generation chips eight gigs of ram a
terabyte hard drive and an nvidia
geforce 640 m graphics chip there's only
a standard DVD burner in this system
that feels a little bit in Congress for
the rest of the market given that
blu-ray is so widely available if you
want blu-ray you have to spend for the
1999 version of the system otherwise the
system is pretty fast and given its high
resolution monitor the fact that it's
unique it's actually pretty fairly
priced now this is not a touchscreen
like most modern on ones but the benefit
of the high resolution is that you can
fit lots of windows on screen and
everything just looks crisper it simply
looks like a better PC now the system
isn't really meant for professional
level video or image editing arguably
unlike the iMac there's a glossy
treatment on the screen the iMac has
that too but here it seems even worse
and it picks up images from pretty much
all around the room now of course we
also try to watch the video on this
system and it actually looks pretty good
the black levels maybe aren't exactly
what we'd like them to be but overall HD
content in particular looks great
standard def content though it looks
pretty muddy up close so you want to
watch that from a distance there's a
webcam here up top and there's actually
a little shutter you can slide to
completely close that off if you're sort
of concerned about privacy or anything
like that
down here you have the basic display
controls and their proximity activated
which is kind of nice the problem is
though they're actually pretty limited
for display for example you can swap out
the signal if you want to connect to the
HDMI device you may have connected to it
you can also adjust the brightness
setting on the screen but that's
probably too limited for a system as
high-end as this one now here on the
left side you'll see some basic inputs
you've got headphone a microphone a
couple USB three jacks as well as an SD
card one nice feature about this system
is all the USB ports are USB three here
in the back panel you'll see inputs for
a TV tuner
digital audio input HDMI in and out and
over here you have four more
USB ports than an Ethernet jack the TV
tuner is probably the one sticking point
we have with the features in the system
we'd much rather have a blu-ray drive so
for its speed its high resolution and
it's fair price I can recommend this
Dell I might wait a couple months to see
if Apple comes out with a new iMac I
wouldn't be surprised that it happened
over although this is among the best
high-end windows-based all-in-ones
