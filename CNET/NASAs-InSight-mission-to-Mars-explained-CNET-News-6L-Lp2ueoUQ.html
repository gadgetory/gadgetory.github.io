and it's launching to Mars on the 5th of
May takes six months to get to Mars and
once we land on Mars we're actually
going to listen for the vital signs of
Mars what the goal of this is is to
really understand how rocky planets are
formed and how they differ from each
other and why so it has a seismometer
it's going to listen for mouse quakes
and that gives us an idea of what the
interior of Mars looks like because from
the seismic waves we can understand what
the different you know whether it has a
mantle or a core or multiple cores and
how it differs from earth it also has a
heat flow and physical properties probe
which is a self hammering nail and it's
going to go down the surface of Mars by
five meters of 15 feet so that's pretty
far down that's the furthest we've ever
gone under the surface of any other
planet and the probe once it's down it's
going to try to understand how the
interior of Mars is cooling so it can
measure the heat along the tether that
it drags down with it and that gives us
an idea of the heat differential under
the surface and then we have rise which
is a gravity science experiment that
uses the radio signals that we already
have and that will learn how the how the
planet is flexing or wobbling so it has
solar arrays similar to what you might
have on the roof of your house about the
same quality in fact but that gives us
power at mouth so we don't need any we
don't need any plutonium or anything
like that like other missions do we
solely rely on our solar arrays we also
have two color cameras there over here
on the arm that you see so the cameras
both give us context imaging of what's
going on around laws and it also helps
us with the deployment of the
instruments so one of the most complex
things that we're doing with insight
that we've never done in terms of
technology we've never done on any other
mission before is that when we land our
key instruments are on the deck of of
the lander we need them to be on the
surface so they can listen to Mars so we
have to take that robotic arm pick up
the instruments from the deck
and put them on the surface so that last
meter or so that we have to go from the
deck to the surface for me is actually
the scariest thing let alone launching
or landing on Mars going that last meter
and deploying those super sensitive
instruments that is something we've been
practicing for we're ready for it but
I'm both excited and nervous about doing
that so together the three instruments
should help us discover what the inside
of moss looks like and how it differs
from Earth and that might give us a
better idea of how planets form not only
planets in our solar system but also
exoplanets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
