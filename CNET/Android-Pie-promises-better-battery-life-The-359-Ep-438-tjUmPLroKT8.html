to the 359 podcast this episode 438 my
name is BBG today's episode as always is
being sponsored by USB technology the
USB implementers forum reminds consumers
at USB I of logos are displayed on
certified USB products so next time
you're shopping for a reliable USB
charger cable or device look for the
logos get the whole story at enabling
USB dot-org and here are your hosts
today Joan salesman and Roger Cheng hey
morning so we've got a busy PI pack
today we'll be talking about Google's
latest version of Android which they
announced late last night and it's it's
pi I'm talking about Alex Jones and
Infowars that whole controversy and then
we'll will end with another PI a GTI
admitting that the claims of a DDoS
attack on the FCC's common system wasn't
actually wasn't legit it wasn't a real
tat so we'll dig into that as always if
you have any questions leave it in the
comment section but I will pick out the
best and we will get to them in three
minutes and 59 seconds from 3 to welcome
to the 359 I'm Roger Cheng I'm Joanie
Sultan Google has unveiled a new version
of Android Android 9 and it's it's pipe
John what do you think I would have
preferred PES or peppermint pattie
myself but what do you think about pie I
love pie guys good it's classic that's
true savory guy and pie can be savory
you're right these versions although
Android is I mean it's it's a sugary
thing it's all about sweets so I can't
imagine they're thinking about a savory
pie when they're thinking this with
Android 9 so a big update with Andrew 9
really a bunch of little updates but the
one we care about the most least I care
about the most the idea that they're
working to improve battery life right
that's I think probably one of the the
issues that just remains as something
that plays all phones and so I'd love to
actually see material impact improvement
and also the use of AI for instance
it'll like it'll know in the background
what part of
like you're looking for and like
automatically load that up I mean what
are you excited about well not support
obviously that that's true it's
following in line with Apple they're
they're gonna have official support with
notch for the notch
we've seen those phones already I've
seen a bunch of Android notch phones but
now it's it's official means we're gonna
live with notches for a while right but
how do we know when actual people are
gonna start getting these yet I believe
a beta will be available when rollers
version will be available in the fall
and then the presume the next pixel will
be the one to get Android P no word on
like some of the official OEMs like a
bigger ones like Samsung or HTC
they're probably take a bit longer so
alright so some of the biggest names in
tech said no more Alex Jones with Apple
Facebook YouTube Spotify and LinkedIn
all banning him and his Infowars program
the conspiracy theorist has long been
criticized for pushing fake claims like
9/11 being an inside job or the Sandy
Hook mass the hoax which by the way
those are all fake let's just be clear
about that that's all not 100 cent wrong
but it definitely represents he his
banning represents a pretty thorny issue
for tech companies right like they've
supposedly create this open platform but
they're now kind of cracking down on
individuals I mean you've been following
this right so it touches on this central
tension that a lot of tech companies are
facing right now where they premise
their massive growth on being good for
the world and that's based on the idea
that freedom of speech and diversity of
voices is an inherently good thing but
when they empower people that that
pollute conversation to the point that
you know grieving families are getting
harassed and have to move towns so they
can escape this escape harassment I mean
that's not good right it's yeah yeah and
so it really highlights how they're
having such a difficulty not being
neutral right right I think they're
making things worse by it I mean they're
not super clear about how they're going
about you know passing judgment and
forcing these rules and how like what
who are are these are they the
gatekeepers are they the ones saying the
standards right so that's the thing they
like to claim that they're not but they
really are and the frustrating thing
back in the old days before the internet
when we had gatekeepers we knew who they
were they were the broadcast networks
they were the big newspapers because it
was all very concentrated we know who
they are now but they're not telling us
what rules are playing play like even
the fact that this all happened in 24
hours it's it's perfect fodder for a
conspiracy theorist to say that's a
coordinated effort they're shutting me
down
was it coordinated we don't know because
they're not talking about what really
went into their decision-making lastly
it turns out the the FCC comment system
wasn't taken down by a DDoS attack after
all let's we have to rewind it last year
when John Oliver spurred his viewers to
weigh in on the net neutrality debate
the following day the site crashed
because the comment system went down
they asked to see a claim for a while it
was a DDoS attack turns out yeah after
an investigation chairman octopi
admitted that no there was no attack but
then he said basically it was a CIOs
fault and he was hired by the previous
administration and he's gone now so yay
for me I don't know it was a interesting
way to disclose that information yeah so
we didn't get the actual report but we
did get this disclosure for majid PI
which hit on it touched all the hits of
the Trump administration there was a
conspiracy was the previous
administration's fault and not actually
you know telling us what they know right
right hopefully we'll get more on the
report from one of the stories chicken
sounds seen it I'm Roger Chen I'm Johnny
sawsan thanks for listening
and welcome back everybody thanks for
joining us for the recording of the
audio podcast now just a disclaimer
front I know these are gonna be some
touchy subjects I just wanted to say
this isn't about politics let's try to
keep things mellow and civil in the chat
we're not going back and forth about
meanings right wrong speeding up Alex
Jones or however you want to put
perspective on it this is about the
impact that's being taken from the mass
media market from social media
specifically where tech companies play a
role in this how they are reacting to
this and this isn't about free speech
this this is about the the business side
the electronic side so just keep that in
mind please I know that we have a
tendency as humans to get heated about
stuff like this but remember this is a
tech show not a politics show that's
that's where I'm leaving out thank you
thanks Brian came here I'm never worried
our viewers have generalized smart
questions that are pretty informed and
oh yeah our viewers are dick to tech
topics I'm not I'm not super nervous I
do feel obligated to say things once
yeah it's a very temperamental society
we have we you it isn't it is a free
speech issue just in a tech way yes how
how to expand expand on that will you
well I mean obviously when we're talking
about in this case with Alex Jones we're
talking about Apple the most valuable
company in the entire we're talking
about Facebook we're talking about
YouTube which is Google these are the
most powerful companies in the world and
they are gatekeepers in the sense that
they have such control over our public
discourse and how we connect with people
how we converse with people and so the
idea that all that power is concentrated
in one group you know on one side the
people that would support Alex or maybe
not even support Alex Jones but be
cheaper here right wary of this slippery
slope where these massively powerful
companies get to decide and what we get
to talk about because that opens up the
possibility that they could you know
censor people that don't deserve to be
sense people that aren't necessarily
violating their Terms I mean the the
nightmare scenario is that they start
censoring people that they specifically
don't agree with and that could have
clued not just like
make news but Paul see that they don't
agree with right for instance like net
neutrality is a very touchy subject
right there they're generally pro net
equality and all of a sudden I mean do
they start censoring like you know anti
like that different pinyin that that's
sort of an extreme and in it I imagine
these companies would get a lot blowback
but that's I think that's what that
slippery slope is all about right if it
starts with Alex Jones does it go
further down right where does it that's
you know where does it stop just to be
clear like there's this isn't a First
Amendment right like a lot of people
talk about just being a First Amendment
thing it's not you know obviously the
government protects free speech but
these are private companies then they
can do whatever they want right on their
platform so they had they are within
their rights to censor to you but it
just it just creates a really tricky
precedent if they start doing that one
person who's to say where that stops and
it's part of this reckoning that we're
having with technology where like at the
beginning of the Internet's emergence as
this communication platform in at least
in America we set these laws that said
that a safe harbor that these companies
aren't held responsible for what their
users say and that's how these companies
were able to grow so big they weren't
held liable for crazy stuff or copyright
infringement or you know hate speech
they weren't regulated like the
broadcaster's right they weren't
regulated like utility exactly because
they weren't but now that they feel like
utilities people feel like their first
amenities are violated if they're taken
off right Facebook because how else are
they gonna communicate know so yeah it's
it's we're in a very different time than
when the internet started and we haven't
kept pace oh yeah I still remember when
Facebook started and we were like poking
each other and like playing stupid games
and now it's like games I don't Democrat
Democrat democracies toppling right well
that weren't that malicious back then
well we we think yeah I for one missed
the stupid games but that's just me this
actually kind of segues into a fantastic
commentary being made by Dominic in the
chat he says social platforms already
provide the user with mute or blocking
options allowing users to censor what
they want to censor we
the government or the companies to
decide what we are allowed to read or
not and then he goes on to ask if
YouTube for whatever reason decided to
remove CNET today and the other big five
follow what would you guys do and I
think I would say that we would do
exactly what Alex Jones does he has his
own massive Network that's he
self-sufficient it's something to be
admired no matter how you look at it he
doesn't need the syndication necessarily
yes there's massive fiscal benefits to
that but I think that's what would what
we would do and it's exactly what you
guys were saying you know Minh trep
resent these syndications messages then
they have every right and their means to
pull that plug yeah something that we
overlook is that Alex Jones specifically
his one instance he makes all his money
from selling fake merchandise yeah I'm
like nutraceuticals and supplements and
things that all cure you of like
government interference in your brain
from drinking water that's poison and
stuff like that so that's that real
because that sounds plausible actually
so it isn't it is significant to out
students to lose these methods of
distribution but he ultimately makes his
money from his own website and he rose
to prominence not necessarily through
these platforms he had a radio show
Donald Trump came on in 2015 and that
was a big legitimizing factor or you
know distributing factor it brought a
lot of attention to him so there are
very traditional ways that he makes
money and has risen to prominence well
let's think I mean let's really look at
this for a second it's one of the
greatest things happened to him because
he's getting more attention than he's
ever gotten yeah people ask why are they
why are they picking on poor Alex Jones
although the squeaky wheel gets the
grease man well it's definitely more
than squeaky wheel but I mean red-faced
he kinda sounds like a dying tractor
engine when he speaks I'm just you don't
like that gravelly voice not
particularly but hey that's effective
there's no gravitas there I know but I
mean to your earlier point I mean the
fact that like these four or five big
companies all
yeah we're almost like a coordinated
effort like that definitely feels the
conspiracy theorists out there and it
definitely gives them free press I mean
I have to imagine the traffic to his
site is just surging and you know what's
really interesting is during his
exclusive response to this conspiracy to
kick him off Technic to kick him off the
internet which he live-streamed which I
thought the irony of that was delicious
he livestream his responses to being
kicked off the internet
you gotta give him props for that one of
the things that he kept in addition to
like these nutriceuticals that he sells
during his at he had advertisements
throughout this you know very long
response some of them are furs they're
all for him his own businesses some of
them are for these pharmaceuticals fake
pharmaceuticals and a lot were for his
app which is available in Apple's yes I
think it was at least this morning it
was the number for free app on the news
category in the App Store yeah it's
really so he got plenty of attention for
ways that Apple it still says that's
fine you know they took him off podcasts
on iTunes but not out of the App Store
right okay that was a fantastic civil
discussion thanks everybody for keeping
it cool
I just relieved this is good stuff like
this and yes our viewers are awesome
let's swing over to Android PI or as it
should have been called Android Pop Tart
oh I like that one that's a missed
opportunity in my book so many missed
opportunities P in Mon says what about
explaining how exactly is Android Pi
going to make your phone's battery last
longer yes so there's a little bit of AI
in there but the idea that it's I guess
it's an adaptive battery setting that
that works more efficiently I think it
it optimizes the use of the battery for
like if you're if you're not using it as
much or if you're using a TAS like
browsing it doesn't use the full
horsepower of the chip I think it's also
optimized for slower processors so even
if you don't have like the super
high-end snapdragon 845 processor that
is supposedly more power efficient even
with the slower chips or the less
efficient ones this is supposed to run
faster or run longer
and basically allow you to prioritize
tasks or apps in a way that lets your
battery run a little bit longer hope
that helps
that's fantastic you actually you just
straight up answer the question we
rarely do I know I know okay we've had
the couple of Dodge a couple of
questions in the last few days cuz we're
out of our depth of fortunately actually
knew what I was talking about there
Matthew dad sure says was it supposed to
be pi as in P I that would have been a
smart play on their book I feel like
that would have been very Google I would
have gone with it I would have liked to
bear them this this pie what what are
the other ones that you guys thought
would be would be better titles I'm just
PI has was I mean that was Shara's idea
actually I came and steal that one cuz
she said that would be a perfect
marketing opportunity like create little
Android Pez dispensers which would be
cute and like in sort of keeping what
there a theme of trying to make Android
cute and cuddly for everyone right as it
invades everybody's phones I mean I've
got a little toy Android at home that I
get in my kid he plays with it what else
is there life improvement said
peppermint peppermint peanut butter
peanut butter or just PB&amp;amp;J
I don't know a lot of Pete titled
candies though I don't either
like pizza would be great but again not
I mean unless you put that pineapple on
it sweet does that qualify I kind of
want to test your skills and see if you
can go a through P every single Android
Raven which would be fascinating for all
the viewers all right Alex Mitch I'll
tone it down first to were what's a B
apples and bananas no I don't know I've
already I've already lost I like I know
the more recent ones but I guess to get
back to like
that's good it's a deep cut and be your
deep cuts they are anymore questions bro
yeah let's tackle a couple more before
we wrap it up Michael Brown says how did
we miss all the hints when it came to
naming Android Pi Google talked about
slices and Android at Google i/o slices
yeah I was like totally in the on the
pizza bandwagon I heard that but mostly
because we get pizza during big live
events like WWDC my brains usually on
pizza
dacher says peanut brittle would have
been a good one Oh Drive fast as they
missed out by not releasing it on March
14th yeah it's still a great one anybody
out there we've got a few people in the
chat talking about how they haven't even
got an Oreo yet and that makes them kind
of apprehensive about pie
how many out there are running Android
and haven't gotten Oreo yeah I'm running
Oreo you guys have iPhones right yeah so
I'm just curious to see where we're at
what was this what why are so many
people missing out on Oreo just because
it wasn't a forced update and people are
just comfy no because that's Android
doesn't do forced update I'm still new
to androids
yeah so that's the biggest knock on
Android is still a real minority of
folks or an Oreo it's largely because if
you've got a carrier phone that is you
know that's not like a Google phone
you're waiting way long you're waiting
like months for that update if you get
one at all older phones cheaper phones
tend to not get updates at all so it's
it's definitely that the whole
fragmented fragmentation those markets
are the biggest knock that you're if
you're on an Android phone unless you're
like on like a pixel or like a Google
approved phone chances are you're not
gonna get the latest version anytime
soon or like you have to wait months if
not years for them Michael Brown says
he's got PI already on his pixel to
excel how's your experience so far sir
what are you feeling whoo yeah let's
know
is the beta already available I thought
the bit was uh wasn't available yet
Michael's got some juice in the industry
I think I guess so I looked it up and
there was no A or B it started with
cupcake yeah so that's why I couldn't
figure out a and B that's so look at the
list what comes after do you like five
what's after cupcake what's a D D donut
II declare F Rho G is gingerbread yeah H
is honeycomb yeah eyes ice cream ice
cream sandwich ice cream sandwich sorry
J is jellybean olivine not my fault
Matthew dashers got on the list right
here kick a marshmallow new Oreo in PI
so before we call it a day what's Q
gonna be oh good question
Oh cuz it's hard huge huge so I can't
believe we're already at the up to Q
that's crazy
what are they gonna do when they run out
of letters - that's true those like the
lost letters maybe I could switch to
savory and we finally get Android there
are two candies in this world with the
name that starts with Q in the entire
world
there's quirks which I'm looking up
right now because I've never heard of
and quench gum which is long since I
believe oh my god I wonder if like a
bunch of developers at Android are
furiously doing desserts starting with Q
and realizing I actually did that right
now it's really really slow you think
they're mad that they back themselves
into that corner maybe maybe they just
break out and do savory quesadilla I
mean they could make us like a sweet
quiche technically okay I found I found
quirks here they are what the hell are
these and also I know they tended to
stay away from Brandon stuff I know
there was like a cat there's jelly bean
no don't worry Oh Oreo right
but Morial is kind of like Kleenex
though like it's a brand but everybody
just knows it yeah
right I don't think I ate Oreos when I
was a kid I to whatever the Hydrox I
draw is that what they were called
yeah I think that's it sounds like
something you'd clean your bath I know
they're just as delicious alright so and
our closing thoughts Michael Brown says
so far pie is pretty solid having
experienced any crashes or issues so far
it's definitely faster than the
developer review as it should be that's
a good place to start yeah definitely
that's that's a good sign for you know
the 5% of Android users will actually
get to try ooh wait wait one more from
Alex Mitchell Android quick even though
it's Nesquik now oh yeah I'm down with
that
like it's delicious it's catchy now it
makes me wish that they had done Android
Ovaltine cuz secretly I'm a 70 year old
man anyways we are
I like over to you I love Ovaltine it's
good for your bones you are an old man
listen I just want more sponsorships
that's all and speaking of thank you to
USB for once again sponsoring the show
we are at at time so let's wrap it up
thanks everybody again for keeping a
civil conversation about a touchy
subject we love you you're the best and
fantastic questions we want to hear more
about anybody who's actually got Android
Pi as it starts to filter through and
yeah who wants to take us out today I
will the 3:59 podcast is available in
iTunes tune in stitcher feedburner
google play music google podcasts the
amazon echo of course cnet.com we'll see
