first Windows tablet and it's selected
Windows RT 8.1 as the tablets operating
system Windows RT is a more limited
version of Windows 8.1 limited in that
you can't run Windows 8 programs but
apps from the Windows Store are fair
game thankfully to make up for this
inherent disadvantage Windows RT comes
with a full free version of microsoft
office the Nokia Lumia 2520 also
includes nokia video director an app
that allows you to very quickly and
easily edit together short video clips
it also has Nokia here maps Nokia's own
mac app as for the tablet itself it's a
bit heavy especially in light of recent
releases from Apple and Amazon but it's
still lighter than the microsoft surface
2 however the pointy heart plastic
corners are really uncomfortable when
holding the tablet in both hands it's
also a bit thicker than the surface 2
but does little to earn its girth unlike
the surface 2 there's no kickstand and
no full USB port there is however a
headphone jack micro HDMI a micro USB
3.0 port and key accessible microSD and
sim card slots AT&amp;amp;T a verizon are the
current supported cellular providers
there's also a window sensor on the
lower bezel and NFC chip inside and dual
cameras a 2 megapixel front camera and a
6.7 megapixel back camera however given
Nokia's history of great cameras on its
phones it's really disappointing that
these cameras are just barely decent
especially compared to the surface tues
cameras the screen features the same
1920 x 1080 resolution as the surface 2
but it's half an inch smaller and
there's a slight yellow hue to the
screen now this isn't a huge problem and
its really only noticeable when looking
at a white background or with the tablet
right next to the surface tunes much
more superior screen there's also an
optional keyboard accessory ave
but unfortunately Nokia didn't send it
along for our review without the
keyboard it's difficult to get a real
feel for what the Lumia 2520 will feel
like when use in the wild at this point
i can say that i like the surface 2's
design more sure it's a little bit
heavier but i really like the kickstand
and the full USB port also love the fact
that i don't need a key or a paperclip
in order to access the storage expansion
slot as I do on the Nokia 2520 the Nokia
2520 is available on contract for three
hundred and ninety nine dollars and off
for four hundred and ninety-nine dollars

has been a first look at the nokia lumia
