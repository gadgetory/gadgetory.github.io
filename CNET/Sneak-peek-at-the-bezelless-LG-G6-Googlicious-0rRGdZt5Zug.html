welcome to google issues for everything
inside the world of google and we lead
with the phone with the biggest buzz
right now the LG G six the phones with
bezels they are so 2016 especially after
LG has officially announced their bezel
list LG g six with this invite for the
5.7 inch 2880 x 1440 display with an 18
by nine ratio they call full vision now
it'll be announced on februari the 26th
at Mobile World Congress and we'll know
everything then the screen they're
showing pretty much fits exactly over
the rendered hand holding it so it's
safe to say there will be almost no
border whatsoever now Xiaomi was the
first to do it late last year with their
me mix phone that was extremely limited
and rumors point to Samsung's sa with a
minimal bezel as well it's all screen
our thing for 2017 and we're not
overlooking google's official
announcement of Android wear 2 point 0
for the LG watch style and the LG watch
sport with a cellular connection that
they announced this week it brings the
Google assistant directly to your wrist
improvements in fitness tracking with
the Google fit app and new ways to
respond to messages if you're all in
with Android wear I think you're really
going to like the improvements in 2
point 0 but I still don't think there's
a super compelling reason we're smart
watch is still a must-have but you know
what it's getting closer now the LG
watch style retails for 249 and the LG
watch support is 349 we've already seen
leaks of the galaxy s 8 thanks to Evan
blast on VentureBeat who gave us the
best look we've seen with the screens
off now they'll come in a five point
eight inch and 6.2 inch qhd Super AMOLED
screen that covers about eighty-three
percent of the front panel but that's
not all a new report from Sam mobile
claims Samsung's artificial intelligence
virtual assistant will be called bixby
it will be even more deeply integrated
into the system and will launch with
support for seven to eight different
languages that's even more than the
Google assistant now it's expected to do
things like communicate with the front
and rear facing camera with a feature
that's been trademarked called Bixby
vision and it will work with all native
s 8 apps and remember Samsung acquired
the startup that created Apple's Siri
that company then made the next
generation
of their a I called viv that's
significantly better than really
anything Apple has right now with the
ability to handle multiple in-depth
queries it was pretty amazing in these
live demos Samsung is also expected to
bring the Bixby AI to their other
products like TVs home appliances and
other connected devices now the samsung
galaxy s 8 will reportedly be unveiled
in New York on marks the 29th and will
be available for sale in south korea and
select markets on april of the 20th and
youtube they might be a little late to
the live streaming party but they don't
mind taking their time you'll soon be
able to live stream to youtube from your
phone but popular youtubers and accounts
with over 10,000 subscribers will be the
first to get mobile live streaming now
check this out youtuber clintus
McGuinness made nine hundred dollars
from a 30 minute live stream in a target
thanks to a feature that lets people pay
to get their comments at the top of the
page so you know what good for him
youtube already supports live streaming
from a computer but a live button will
be added to the mobile app on your phone
or tablet you know what I'm a periscope
guy right now but I'll definitely be
checking out the youtube live stream if
they're nice enough to let me in on it
early hey you to call me alright that's
going to do it for this week you can
email me at Google licious at cnet com
or to me at brian Tong thanks so much
for watching and we'll catch you all
next time for some more of that Google
issues
