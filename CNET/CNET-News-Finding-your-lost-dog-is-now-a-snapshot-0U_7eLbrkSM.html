traumatic she jumped out the car window
I was freaking out I was really young
but he was gone for like four hours
that's what spurred John Palomino to
create finding Rover a new free iOS app
that uses facial recognition designed
just for dogs I thought well if we can
do it for people why can't we do it for
dogs whether you've lost a pooch or
found one finding Rover can help reunite
pets with their families you can put 100
dogs of the same breed and your dog will
come up ninety-five percent of the time
in the top five the core technology
developed by software engineers at the
University of Utah uses an algorithm to
detect a dog's unique differentiating
features such as I shape and fur color
to use the app you first need a good
well lit picture of the dog we have a
cool little feature called a bark button
because one of the most difficult things
to do is get to a dog to look at the
camera then make some quick adjustments
to the photo you move the circles up to
the eyes and the triangle to the nose
and then you hit enter and it basically
registers your dog a close-up is best
but if the dog isn't friendly a picture
from a distance can be used to the app
searches through puppy profiles for a
match using the picture and other
information such as breed in size and if
you search by location you can narrow
down results to the dogs cited or lost
near you in just a few weeks finding
Rover has helped several pooches find
their way home to be truly effective
though the app needs more people using
it Sao Paulo me know is working with
shelters and Animal Control centers
people often don't even know where to
look for an animal so you know in this
day and age of technology having
something like this is pretty amazing
palomino wants to help other animal
lovers to a version of the app for your
feline friends is also in the works
finding kitty should be available in
about six months high tech for your pet
now that's something to bark about in
