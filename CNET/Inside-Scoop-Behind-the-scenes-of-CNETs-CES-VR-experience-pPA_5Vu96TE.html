big thing and of course cnet is bringing
you all the latest VR news we're also
shooting VR video ourselves this year
we're showing you the CES show floor in
360 VR that is right we've teamed up
with VR content provider IM 360 to help
us out here to tell us more about it is
Myles McGovern CEO of I'm 360 thank you
so much for being here it's a pleasure
thank you very much everybody thank you
for allowing us to capture CES in
virtual reality we shot that video
that's going to be up on cnet very soon
and you can use it in a VR sort of
headset it's already on YouTube and we
actually are going to play a little bit
right now so can you kind of like give
us an idea of like how this was able to
be captured it was using this very
impressive sci fi looking device
absolutely so we have a number of
different cameras and that we use but
they're basically using multiple sensors
and they take all of that imagery and
pull it all together stitch it on the
fly and it can automatically be streamed
out either live or on-demand so in this
particular instance we walked around the
floor on an on demand environment
captured it all put it together into
some small snacks sure that highlights
of the show and really put it up for
people to have the experience and
interact with and if you can see right
now Bridget its interactive my little
scrolling when I video in real time
we're on YouTube right now so anyone can
do this and you can watch the mouse
cursor sort of drag the video around
right now Brian's in front of the intel
booth and he's jumping around all over
the floor oh there's a drone behind him
oh now he's a friend of a car it's kind
of amazing it obviously gives you an
experience that gives you the control of
where to look and I feel like that's a
really powerful tool to give an audience
so I mean where do you sort of see that
moving forward I had what other
applications can this technology be
applied to I mean we believe the
applications are huge our heritage we
started working in the military
intelligence side we are actually the
guys behind Google Street View so you
know going out capturing street
it's a great app and you know we see
this as far as you know education you
know educate meant you know these types
of experiences whether you know you're
able to bring millions of people to CES
sure and let them virtually experience
this and walk around and it's not only
as much as Brian's doing a great job you
know curing them through but they can
turn around and look you know what's
going on behind them at the same time
and really get a feel of being there and
you give and you give an audience member
that choice which totally is a game
changer I mean absolutely where you
would have this sort of one-way street
now it's this interactive situation yes
and I'm curious to talk about like the
bigger picture of that and where that
kind of drives what's being shot and can
and how that's being considered for an
audience we talked earlier a little bit
about you know other applications of
entertainment wise for wise live
broadcasting it's really powerful stuff
absolutely i mean we we believe this you
know i hate using the disruptive
technology phrase but the reality is i
could drop one of these cameras you know
ringside or you know courtside at a game
right and be able to stream that i can
pull out and stream it to tens of
millions of people whether it's on your
laptop your mobile phone where you can
move around look around drop that into a
cardboard or you know you can actually
stream what we have posted on cnet have
that to your gear VR and any other VR
device at the same time we see this
evolving so that quite frankly if it's a
big screen TV you know if I'm you're
going to stream the Super Bowl I want to
have 40 people and I want to stream it
to some sort of set top box that I'm
streaming in 1080 or 4k and when
something cool happens i can reach
forward grab my remote and go wait pan
left pan right and move around that view
simultaneously somebody could experience
this with a headset or mobile device
what's the conversation right now in
terms of storytelling with VR because
like you sit with the Super Bowl example
or whatever sporting event you're not
going to sit there and watch the whole
game like this it's the kind of thing
you just pick up and go so is is there
more talk now on like different ways of
thinking about storytelling Oh
absolutely I think this is reshaping the
way people you know look at things
though the whole idea we call it
spherical storytelling and that concept
of you know putting people rather than
putting a camera in the corner and
filming something that's setting a stage
you really have to rethink about how do
you create some activity around get
people to move through environments we
did some great stuff in the past Taylor
Swift video with that radical and
american express and that won an emmy
for them it was a fantastic kind of
based on the Sleep No More so you're
moving through a building and you know
it's that type of thing that becomes
very exciting for this space that's
really cool we talked a little bit
earlier about you know sort of like
holographic got applications more
entertainment motion-capture can you go
into a little bit of detail about sure
what kind of applications that's used
for and I mean that's part of our vision
when we we formed a partnership with
digital domain right and that was really
focused around taking what we do in
live-action video and combining their
heritage expertise in CG special effects
and digital humans so that the two
pocket coachella rent created to pas
everyone knows exactly so imagine
starting to bring Tupac into a VR
experience or you know digital humans
and they're very real-looking and it
becomes a neat experience and then the
other piece is is you have we we have
the luxury of having a moat cap studio
at DD which is bigger than a basketball
court and you know you put on the suit
but you can put on a headset and walk
around it's like a huge vibe you're
walking around and we create space most
recently we did a project with Mars it's
Nassau sponsored thing and it was Mars
and you're actually walking around a
huge basketball court and it looks like
Mars yeah and you're walking up these
little ramps and going over bridges and
you think like after you start walking
around for a few minutes you start your
brains tripped it's very neat so you
should come out and have the experience
I don't ask me choice yeah I feel like
you know once you sort of get somebody
to wrap their head around just what's
possible and
applications for VR that no one really
thought of before you know you talked
about visiting places that we will never
physically be able to go to what do you
think like the biggest challenge for VR
is to permeate that sort of mainstream
understanding and for people to really
you know have to wrap their heads around
it I guess one of the big things is
everybody talks about being a massive
revolution and I don't think this is
going to be like the Russian Revolution
and it happens overnight everybody sure
I believe every household will have a VR
headset of some sort he'll be like
growing up with a viewmaster or
something and it are we all going to
jump right into that and have it I
believe that there's it's going to
evolve more and more like the Industrial
Revolution over time you know the
digital era has enabled us to do what
we're doing and I see this as being part
of any screen that you touch is now
going to become more of an immersive so
that when you want to take over control
there will be those opportunities and
whether it's a headset or whether it's
an AR type of experience or whether
quite frankly I'm streaming the Super
Bowl or something and there's a moment
where I go well I want to pause this I
want to back it up I want to look at the
coach now and see what happened when
they fumbled that pass it's like being
there definitely dictating natick that
viewing exactly sure I want to ask about
the evolution also of the equipment the
camera equipment itself here at CES
there's lots to talk about different
types of VR cameras people are doing it
themselves now very easily there's
they're leavin units that are under a
thousand dollars so from your
perspective as as a professional company
who makes these what where are things
going to the point where like anyone can
just buy this and make it themselves how
is that changing the whole the whole
medium I I think it that's a very
critical piece I mean when we first
built these we built the first ones with
the three-letter agency and it worked
with them on developing for 3d
reconstruction and tell us about the one
you have here because this was not yes
forget so this this is just we call this
our hex and it's it's a camera that
takes six has six sensors on it captures
it all stitches it we have a platform
that it ties to that stitches it all
together but where we're going with this
we just recently completed a project
with DARPA and it was building us camera
very small deployable it's about the
size of a racquetball and you know they
see the price point coming down those
are 4k cameras very high resolution
small portable type systems there's even
a camera on the top that's where it
screws in and then on the top that's
right so that this one has what we call
a nadir so it attaches to something
there are other ones that are nadir less
I know and now you here google you know
like we just heard earlier in the year
they have the things where you put like
all the group GoPros around there's a
lot of different variations of how to do
this video yourself but I don't know
we're professionals see things compared
to amateur taking 360 video I think
you're going to have you know both ends
of the spectrum so we're pushing the
upper limits to push this to very high
resolution high frame rates and so forth
and you know at the same time getting
something into more the lower end
consumer side that lets people go out
and if I want to shoot something and let
you know grandma grandpa experience a
birthday party or something at home
level it should be as easy as getting
the you know out your camcorder quite
frankly your phone and you know
integrating it to that and be able to go
live stream this or you don't record it
and post it up on youtube or some
private channel are there any
restrictions with the file size issues
that like with how much is being
recorded at once they're bigger I mean
there's no doubt yeah six rolling yeah
but we we just we use the same pipeline
that you use for your existing so if you
have a 4k network here we take this all
compress it down to a 4k and move it
across that network so we're only as
strong as the weakest link all right
well thank you so much miles fresh
appreciated thank you writing this
technology again you can check out the
video up on cnet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
