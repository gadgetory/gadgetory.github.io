friends that I'll just venmo them later
apps like venmo are becoming more
popular because they let you send and
receive money almost instantly using
your phone it's great for when you have
to pay a friend back for a meal or give
your roommate that rent money here's how
it works no matter what app you choose
and i'll get to a few of my favorites in
a moment you'll begin by entering your
bank account information the app will
then make a small deposit in your bank
account to verify it once that process
is complete you're ready to start
sending and receiving money most of
these apps do the same thing they host
transactions but each one offers a
slight edge to make it stand out from
the others venmo for instance lets you
make payments through your debit or your
credit card but credit transactions come
with a two point nine percent fee what's
cool about venmo though is that it adds
a little social element to these
exchanges so here I'll launch the app
enter in the amount I want to request
from Chris who owes me for lunch and
then I'll leave a comment here I can
choose to make the transaction public
where everyone can see it show it to my
friends only or just keep it between
Chris and I once I complete the
transaction Chris gets a notification
and can easily finish the payment
through the app when you receive money
you can either keep it in your venmo
account to use for future payments or
you can use the option to cash out and
deposit the money directly into your
checking account for something a little
more private there's Google Wallet with
it you can send and receive money
through the Google Wallet app or attach
money to any email so I'll just write an
email as usual and then down here click
this money symbol and a Google Wallet
window will pop up it works a lot like
venmo except without the new suite of
too much information and all
transactions are charged a two point
nine percent fee as a third option
there's square cash when you think of
square though you might think of those
little credit card readers you see at
small vendors but square cash is a free
peer-to-peer payment app what's great is
that you don't need to set up an account
with square all you need to do is enter
your debit card info and square handles
the rest the only drawback is that it
doesn't work with credit cards so those
are just a few ways you can send and
receive money quickly using apps so now
you don't need that anymore if you have
any questions or tips of your own hit me
