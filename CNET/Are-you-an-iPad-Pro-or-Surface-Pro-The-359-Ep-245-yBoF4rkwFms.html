it's episode 245 of the 359 podcast and
another packed house today Alfred and
Ben Fox Ruben and Josh freakin Goldman
Josh Goldman is in the hold man for his
debut debut on the 359 it took us nobody
lets me talk to it so yes two hundred
and forty-four episodes but we finally
got it right and decided to invite Josh
Goldman they can talk about the iPad pro
and surface pro which you spent white
like four days delving into the
differences between these two devices
yeah not really just a writer's block
that's legislation so we're gonna spend
most of our time talking about that
story which Josh published today and
then we'll wrap it up with fireball
which is a malware it's actually not new
it's from 2015 but there's some new news
about it I'm basically a security firm
found out about it in like June first
and now Microsoft saying that it didn't
infect as many computers as it did
before so when they found out about is
like 250 million computers were infected
by this Microsoft came out with a report
today with some data that they've been
tracking it since 2015 saying now it's
probably more like 5 million which is a
lot so let's let's get to the podcast as
always sending your questions and
comments BVG we'll get to as many as you
can at the end of the show without
further ado let's make podcast history
for the uninitiated we are going to
record four minutes worth of valuable
questionable information and then after
that we open it up to Q&amp;amp;A so you were
free to hang out with us or you are free
to move on leader lives after four
minutes but until then you're stuck so I
don't go anywhere we'll be back in three
minutes and 59 seconds from 3:00 to
welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm
Alfred aang and with us today is special
guest ace reviewer and generally awesome
dude
Josh Goldman thanks for coming thank you
so Josh you spent a couple days delving
into the differences between Apple's
iPad pro and Microsoft Surface pro I
wanted to start by asking you about
operating systems I got the impression
from your story that if you wanted to do
a lot of like heavy
if ting and multitasking the surface pro
was the clear winner here right
absolutely
that's basically because it's a full OS
it's the desktop OS on a tablet whereas
the mobile iOS on the iPad is still
working in an app world where
everything's locked down can't really
get to what you want to get to okay so
if that's the case like why would I want
an iPad like what are what are like the
clear advantages of the iPad like for
instance you mentioned security was one
of them right so because it's all walled
garden and everything you don't have to
worry about getting you don't have to
worry about installing that executable
that comes in through your email or
installing some sort of application that
maybe you shouldn't have installed it's
now stealing your information and giving
it to I don't know who lose the
information goes I don't know some
hacker in Russia yes so I mean that
that's part of it um well what if I have
battery life my pad is much better on
battery life
yeah like considerably more so yeah like
nearly twice that's pretty awesome but
I'm wondering like why is this even a
debate as far as like the surface pro
and the iPad pro if one is clearly a
full-functioning like laptop that you
can do work on like ones like a real
competitor we had to write a story
because it was like Thursday we said
something um yeah I mean there is really
that that's it if you need a full
computer you're gonna go with surface
pro if you can live in an app ecosystem
where everything you do can be done on
an iPad then you can go with an iPad
frankly so they both started at $800 for
the 12 point 9 inch iPad pro and the
surface pro which has a 12 point 3 inch
screen they both started that $800 price
point and you can actually if you can
live in that app ecosystem of of Apple
you can that's a better deal because in
order to get more power you're gonna
have to spend a lot more money on the
surface pro and that's not even
including the fact that they're neither
of them include the keyboard or pen yeah
I suppose
interesting the surface pro can go up as
high as like over $2,000 yes means that
like people are probably going to be
using it for like some pretty intense
stuff if they're going to be spending
that much on a laptop right and that's
it I'm sorry
tablet exactly so that's where you're
you're basically getting into the point
which is if you're spending that much
money you're either using that as a
laptop and you're spending more money on
the on the keyboard and the pencil yeah
or the pen for the surface or you're
going to be able to do everything on an
iPad so so also we wanted to get to some
more news there's some news about a big
malware attack called fireball which can
take over your computer's browser a
security company claimed 250 million
devices were infected but Alfred you say
the Microsoft claims it was actually a
lot less than that right yeah Microsoft
said it was more so about 5 million so
the way that this malware is called
fireball the way that it worked was that
it infected your browser and it
basically changed your homepage and your
default search engine to a fake website
where then they rate in the revenue like
from advertisements on that website so
they made a ton of money off that at
about 250 million visits but Microsoft
is basically saying look like visits
doesn't mean that it's infected you know
I can go to the same website multiple
times it doesn't mean what my computer
has been infected that so it's it's a
problem but not as big a problem as a
security company was claiming so anyway
if we want to read more about these
stories
check them out on CNET I'm Ben Fox Ruben
I'm alfred Aang and Josh thanks for
coming yeah thanks for having me there's
an entire show going on in the chat
right now that we read nothing to do it
what nice we're talking like we just an
off set wish I could just dial in
everybody right now in just the comment
section it's just way better than our
actual podcast oh okay I have a shitty
in their own show they should everyone
in here should start their own podcast
called the 953 which don't be dramatic
readings of these comments like just
print it out as a script do if we ever
get a good celebrity voice to do
something like that though right like
the captain we did notice you
it's a reading recumbent so the the this
long and short of what I'm pulling out
of this beautiful mess is uh some people
like one some people like the other yeah
no kidding something like both some
people like so even like none oh my god
nice absolutely or shattering we need to
make like a pie chart for this
well that was partly - admittedly I
don't use a lot of tablets that's why I
wanted to have Josh on if we wanted to
talk about Amazon fire tablets those are
the ones that I actually have a lot of
them worked
yeah well was do you buy your tablet on
this limits and I was thinking about
this after you told me to come on here
was um do you think Amazon would ever
make a competitor to this maybe I don't
know like after they decided to buy
Whole Foods I'm not gonna like put
anything against them and say no there's
no way I'm a song to ever do this but
you know their position in the market
that they're very well known for
particularly with devices is the lower
tier like the cheaper stuff that's where
I better than you would expect it to be
for $50.00 but they could do that for
the ball wouldn't be $50 but they could
write that with this they could make one
that's in you know well on fire or less
what what apps would you be able to
download on them all those all the
office apps right all those and there's
the things I would be a my I hadn't
named and you could shop you could yeah
yeah that's what I think sure that's
what I do I do that at work all the time
I had a quick question about your
security point though with you know
you're saying the iPad pro has the
advantage because it has a walled garden
kind of approach to it I mean isn't that
advantage really you're just gonna be
cut off once you know Windows 10s comes
out yes but you're talking about
millions of apps in the Apple App Store
compared to all 10 that you'd want to
use yeah Microsoft one so yeah
eventually if they can I mean they got
Apple onboard so cuz iTunes is going to
be in that store so maybe with that
they'll be able to get other people in
and then yeah once once that's running
you know Windows 10s you would have a
walled garden but right now this is
Windows 10
Pro because they're aiming at people who
were going to install their own software
I want like full of dope stuff when I
wrote my fireball story there was a like
part of the blog post for Microsoft like
obviously they had to like plug
themselves and where's you know this
Bret like Microsoft edge is not affected
by this browser hack and also you can't
get this virus if you have Windows 10s
so that those like they're a little like
pat on the back for themselves on this
whole fireball thing right but nobody
wants to use those things so one of the
things that I also thought was pretty
interesting that I learned from your
story was that with the iPad pro you can
even though it doesn't have like the you
know like the file manager stuff and in
it you can you know multitask multiple
apps different things like that that you
could do with the surface pro right it's
still powerful enough to do as you
mentioned huge spreadsheets and
presentations 3d modeling 4k video
editing yeah which you know like so it's
not just a toy like it no and it does
earn its pro name is what I'm getting at
and I say you see a lot of the comments
like I said that that that are all oh
that is just totally the the surface pro
is a real computer it has a real
computer it's a real cut they're both
real computers it's just the one well
more capable than the other type of them
fit means do you consider the iPad pro a
computer though I saw a tech that's I
mean it's having are you yeah the thing
that thing's pretty powerful I also
liked Josh going on is really powerful
on the collar window that was my out
though ISM that was your Alec Baldwin
doing Donald Trump on SNL being a tech
reviewer pay money to see that
yeah he just hi alright so something
that sparked a little controversy and
the chat was the somebody brought up the
Chromebook and though what's that really
polarized a handful of people say good
point
that's a good point the Chromebook could
have definitely been thrown into this
but that's more of like a laptop I mean
like it doesn't have a you know not a
two-in-one it doesn't have a removable
look there are two there's a lot of them
that are like that there are two in one
there are two in one Grum books thank
you but nobody I'm not nobody but it's
not what they're known for but yeah
right yet
it's gonna all change as soon as
gets the apps all we know they're like
waiver apps mm-hmm aren't there like way
more Chromebooks and schools and there
are you know children yes all the chairs
are actually Chrome but like are there
like more Chromebooks in schools and
like there are Microsoft or Apple like
devices not like I don't Peter's I've
never I've never done the count myself I
mean I think definitely polite I thought
I was a mole mark I came like Windows
10s anecdotally for my kids schools is
that they are currently switching over
from iPads to Chromebooks yeah and oh I
feel like I think where they've got
everyone else beat is like on the price
point yep there and if we're talking
about like if you're okay with you know
living in like an app centric world I
like if I'm if I'm gonna do that I don't
want to spend like 800 something dollars
for that I'd rather like pay like like
an average Chromebook price which I
believe is like 250 or something right
is it that low it's 130 you get like the
super low-end version yeah but if you're
going if you're buying in bulk for a
school dance yes even rice and get lower
they pay you
yeah well I don't know that that's true
pace but yeah they get cheap so yeah
that's a very good point from the chat I
run well Chromebooks
speaking of the chat we should probably
try to get to a few questions before the
day gets out of course I just have to
the chat is getting kind of meta right
now just like I had the address yet has
become sentient yes I have to address
this comment from Raja manikkam who says
just curious how this live chat is not
flooded with junk is it moderated room
for the record it used to be full
flooded with John and it can still be
unnecessary but for by and large we
attract only the highest calibre of fan
base on this greatest fans of all time
uh Danny Green says our boys are energy
I saw a surface pro tear down over the
weekend you pretty much have to destroy
it to try and get an upgrade how we not
done what do you mean get an upgrade
like if you have a hardware yes yeah I I
saw that it was basically like it got
rated like a zero unlike the fix ability
scale of it after like a breakdown like
come on that makes sense though because
like to make those tablets you have to
like they're super thin and they're
mostly glued together I think so I hate
that like all devices
that like started moving toward that
like I remember being replace my
keyboard my speakers like literally
everything on my laptop just by taking
it apart and now it's gone to a point
where it's like well which buys what you
get like I absolutely hate that that's
like that let's move to the easiest way
to get you to buy a new device I'm aware
which and I hate that yeah all right
let's get back into some more chat uh no
Matthew - who says Josh has a great
voice does he do narrations he can I
don't but thank you and and what's up
Matthew - thank you the question was
actually my voicemail message this is an
Alfred that could happen don't joke I
could do it uh David Morgan says guys
calm down the Amazon fire phone is the
best phone hands-down
oh the best pho hands down as and you
put it down I never I've never used
whatever is anybody in this room has
anyone seen one seen it it's like a
unicorn I think you can still probably
get it off of Amazon or Ebay for about
three cents so yeah I'll probably buy
one and try it out yeah that's one of
the ones you turn away from your friends
to use I mean wait didn't we didn't
Samsung have like a fire phone last year
though hahaha good night everybody
speaking of it's coming right then yeah
only way to change yes change topics but
yeah we will talk about it it could
simply excited about I don't think we
have much to talk about as of right now
right as of yo anything at the moment
yeah I'm sure we will do many rumour
roundups over what that note will look
like the best part of this job one last
little meta comment between Diego and
imma do I apologize if I mispronounced
your name they're coming back and forth
about how much they want the red chair
behind Josh oh yeah it's a very nice
writing say it's completely stolen the
show so I'm at the ready let's take a
second
I would join as a chair 59 he readily
readily admit that the anatomy carbon
rod that is that chair give that chair
or compasses we should absolutely okay
at stake for the day we're writing it
either five hundred thirty one thousand
episode we will give away the red chair
shipping is gonna be a pain the chair
that's the red chair my father
empty alright so let's have a serious
one uh hsj said I'm sorry but I didn't
see the exact name let's remind them the
security is she was called fireball
fireball yes like the drink or the
Hadouken like just a fireball why do I
invite you on let's get a quick
refresher company about what we're what
the fireball was for those who maybe
came in late
alright ones actually this is actually
valuable information as opposed to a
string around so on June first a
security company called checkpoint
released a report saying they tark they
found a Chinese like operating like
hacking operating company yes it's a
marketing company that's who they're
accusing it of being behind this where
it's a malware called fireball where it
comes to your device if you download it
through like software bundling so if you
try downloading like a movie illegally
or like music or video game it like
there's chances are it comes in through
that like just you know bad downloads
and then it basically infects your
browser so nothing really on your you
know hardware itself but on your browser
and then it changes your browsers like
home page and your search engine and
then it takes you to like a bunch of
different fake websites and they're all
mostly search engines but the way that
it works is that this marketing company
they get the views based off of that and
then they get money based off of those
views off the ads that are on those
websites and they're basically fake
Google cuz like you'll go on the fake
search engine and you'll type in like
whatever you're looking for and then
it'll give you Google results anyway
like it'll redirect you to that so you
kind of get what you want anyway they
get the money you just end up using this
terrible website um so just to be clear
to this is not as insidious as like a
ransomware no like wanna cry but we say
but if you've got malware on your
computer that's not a good thing it
could but the issue is is that it could
have downloaded ransomware because once
it has control of you
browser it can do a lot more than just
you know redirecting you to a website if
anything it could have downloaded other
malware so it you know theoretically
could have like installed ransomware if
it wanted to and that was the issue that
a lot of people had with it where it was
like basically this is this could have
been really bad and I got on all these
devices um
but all I did was really just go on like
this like because they were trying to be
low-key about it they wanted to just
keep making money as opposed to if it
installed ransomware then it would have
been you know you wouldn't be going to
that website still you'd be trying to
get rid of it so they were trying to be
hidden about it good I'd like to get in
on that deal that sounds like a pretty
sweet bit had about 250 million page
views just off of their like fake
websites but they kind of misconstrued
it as that's 250 million devices that
have been infected so Microsoft came out
with a report today saying that they had
been tracking this for a while now
actually since like 2015 or so and it's
only been on about 5 million devices
which is still pretty bad but it's been
like logged into like their Windows
Defender program so if you have it it it
should be able to like blacklist it nice
thank thank you thank you for that info
and we got serious for a second ya know
arey it seems like a more polite way to
steal yeah yeah they're not taking your
healing format right I'm not paying you
those guys suck they should they should
have called it the Robin Hood I would
have been way better name than the
fireball well I don't know I'm giving
yeah we don't more they're a marketing
agency let me get to ourselves
halfway down the line right alright so
before we do wrap it up we have a
slightly off-topic question from Youssef
but he's been very adamant about getting
this answered so it's obvious if we
should address this what do you guys
think about Bigsby voice I've been using
it a lot since it came out and I'm a big
fan hit or miss in your opinion okay
good question I haven't used big Bigsby
voice that makes a baby 6b picks big
speed pick six they needed me
accidentally
alright they purposely put the X in
there in the name because it like most
voice recognition like software like if
you have an X sound in it that's why
Alexa like also has that it's easier for
the table so either way I haven't tested
Cortana
that's Microsoft that was from Halo it
was it yeah the voice assistant in Halo
his name Cortana okay get up being a
gamer so to answer the question I
haven't tested it that much but in
general from what I know about it it
does not have nearly as many
capabilities as Cortana Siri or Alexa it
may be because they're really young it's
still young and I think that the real
potential for it is smart home
integration with a lot of other Samsung
products but we're not really quite
there yeah I don't think that that's
going to happen quite yet I don't know
about the smart home integration I know
that when they were like advertising it
was more so basically instead of being
like a smart assistant like Google
assistant or Syria or Cortana or Alexa
or anyway it wasn't supposed to be like
a search assist and it wasn't supposed
to be like hey how's the weather or you
know right where's this restaurant I was
supposed to help you navigate your phone
itself so if it was something like turn
the volume down or if I wanted to you
know change the language on the phone or
like go to this photo that I took on
July whatever that that was the idea of
it was supposed to be an assistant for
the device itself not right yeah it
sounds from the commenter that seems to
be doing that job pretty well I would
argue that strategically they did that
and I've said this before on the podcast
because it can't go toe-to-toe with
Google assistant which I would argue is
probably the best one right now right
the problem is that it got confused
early on as an assistant and people like
oath doesn't do anything yeah and I
can't even ex renounce the name right
yeah truth bixby you know out there I'm
really insulted by that name only
because so they had two other names that
tested better with their target if
they're like little test audience or
whatever and they picked Bixby because
it tested the best among Millennials
you're Antonio and I'm like how in what
universe like what test audiences is
we're like yeah Bixby I'm like I really
want to know what the other two names
were that they liked audiences that
thought the Incredible Hulk
was hip and ironic I don't know that
Bill Bixby the actor the obscure actor
he's real big in Brooklyn right now he
is very big in Brooklyn
that's I have no anyone
that's the only reference point I've
gotta keep going to it cuz I know comics
why is it never mind alright so probably
about time to wrap it up we were gone
way over time today but it's been really
fun yeah and then this is a nice all
right another week of podcasts yeah yes
time for us to wrap up the whole week
okay bend Rings home alright enjoy the
weekend everybody and in the meantime
