out camping or just me and extra-tough
portable Bluetooth speakers you should
consider the monster superstar backfloat
if you're down to spend a little more
money I'm Justin you forsee net this is
a first look at the monster superstar
backfloat
bluetooth speaker so now that there are
a ton of options for these wireless
portable speakers we're starting to see
more niche devices that cater to
specific features this one by monster is
a variation of a superstar bluetooth
speaker but it's designed to throw in
the pool or the bathtub it looks like
your average rectangular speaker but the
two speakers and the bass radiator are
positioned on the front because it's
designed to float on its back the
buoyancy is aided by this removable skin
that's made of silicone and you can
easily remove it to wash it if it starts
to get grimy inside but even if that
does happen you shouldn't worry about it
breaking it's extra durable and rated at
military standards protecting it against
light impact dirt and of course water if
you flip open the window on the right
side you'll see a couple ports for a
direct wired connection with an
auxiliary cable and there's a microUSB
port for charging up the battery life
which is rated at seven hours but I
should mention here that the speaker's
only waterproof if the ports are sealed
so don't let any water get into this
section or the speaker's toast in terms
of sound quality this thing is pretty
good but not great there's only two
small speakers inside so don't expect it
to blow you away with its base qualities
but the radiator does do a pretty good
job at giving you an extra bass boost I
did notice though that pumping up the
volume all the way has a tendency to
produce a lot of distortion which is
pretty typical for a Bluetooth speaker
it's a little disappointing though
considering the high price tag at the
time of this review but if Monster does
end up lowering the price this would
definitely be a fun way to add a
soundtrack to your next pool party you
can check out all the details in my full
review on SEANET but that's gonna do it
for this video thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
