bizarro version of the Nexus 7 each is
about the same size although the memo is
slightly heavier and not quite as thin
aesthetically the memo is missing the
silver highlight trim around its screen
and instead of a smooth comfortable
backside like the Nexus 7 it instead has
a bumpy unpleasant feeling texture on
the back there is a 1 megapixel front
facing camera a headphone jack on the
top microUSB on the bottom for file
transferring and charging and something
the Nexus 7 doesn't have a microSD card
slot for storage expansion but
unfortunately that's kind of where the
similarities end
the me ball has a 1024 by 600 resolution
screen which in 2013 is low and it could
be forgivable but for the tablets panel
while most tablets use IPS panels giving
them wide viewing angles the MIMO
receives no such privilege and its
viewing angles are horribly narrow
that's not that big of a deal when
viewing the screen head-on but if your
view gets skewed too much things get
really difficult to see the MIMO houses
a single core 1 gigahertz CPU and while
normal navigation is fast enough with
some occasional hangs if you're say
downloading something while trying to
play a game even a 2-d game like Angry
Birds performance is adversely affected
and more taxing games like Real Racing 3
it wouldn't even run without
periodically hanging the tablet
requiring a complete reboot the mineral
does include several mini apps that run
concurrently but if you're running say
the movie player and a browser expects
sluggish performance the memo costs one
hundred and forty dollars for 16
gigabytes of storage and it includes a
micro SD storage expansion slot for $60
more the Nexus 7 offers faster more
stable performance with a higher quality
sharper screen now that $60 difference
may feel like a lot if you're on a
budget but I feel it's worth it to
simply pay more now and regret less
later I'm Eric Franklin and this has
been a first look at the a
