time to round up all the best the worst
and everything else in between so let's
talk about the best geek movies of 2018
this is all completely unscientific and
was done via straw poll here at the
office but that doesn't matter let's
have fun anyway coming in at number 5
The Incredibles 2 we all worried when we
heard there would be a sequel to the
first Incredibles which is generally
considered a classic
fortunately Pixar delivered a fantastic
follow-up to the original with new
dynamics and challenges for the PAR
family oh and it also made over 2.2
billion dollars at the box office
coming in at number 4 the strange and
unsettling world of annihilation it's
hard to talk about this movie without
completely spoiling it but once you've
experienced the horrific wonder of the
shimmer you'll never forget it
especially that fair Oh still have
nightmares about that bear it only
pulled in about 43 million at the box
office but that doesn't matter once
you've seen it you'll be thinking about
it long after it's over coming in at
number three was a movie that was also a
sequel but it definitely wasn't a family
film we're talking about at full -
Deadpool - might have claimed to have
been a love story but it still managed
to shock and delight us with how far and
often it was willing to cross the line
audiences loved the Merc with a mouth so
much that it brought in over seven
hundred and thirty four million dollars
at the box office and it was also so
delightful that it got cut into a pg-13
Christmas film coming in at number two
our second-place finisher was a movie
that was not only a Cultural Revolution
just an all-around excellent film and a
great superhero movie that's right
talking about black pimp
the story of two challahs fight to
protect his people and take back what
Conda from kill monger was thoughtful
fun and totally badass
it's also the second highest earner of
our five vests this movie brought in
over 1.3 4 billion dollars at the box
office
well Conda forever indeed now it's time
for our number one movie of the year our
geekiest film that brought the most joy
to our little nerd hearts you know what
I'm gonna say
it's Avengers infinity war Santos's
quest to bring balance to the universe
by collecting all of the Infinity stones
and battling more Marvel superheroes
than we've ever seen together before
brought us to our collective knees in a
single snip but that didn't stop us from
emotionally abusing ourselves and seeing
it over and over again leading to an
absolutely ridiculous worldwide
box-office take of over 2 billion
dollars and we're all waiting on pins
and needles to see how it ends but
that's for 2019 there were a few movies
that couldn't make the cutoff for this
top 5 list we're talking about movies
like Aquaman spider-man into the spider
verse and of course
bumblebee which you've been hearing good
things about but I'm sure you're ready
to scream at me down in the comments
tell me what your top 5 movies for 2018
were and I will see you at the movies in
2019 for all of the great Tiki movies
that we can't wait to see you get humans</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
