premium in-ear wired sports headphone it
comes in a couple of different colors
and retails for around a hundred and
fifty dollars it offers a great fit and
is one of the better sounding sport
headphones out there though it is a
little pricey hi I'm David Connelly and
welcome to another CNET headphone review
I'm a fan of the ice board victory and
have been using it for a while though
I'm gravitating more towards bluetooth
headphones for running and working out
at the gym these days so part of me
wishes this is kind of came in a
wireless version as it stands however
the headphone has a few things going for
it first thanks to the included sports
clip winged stabilizers it offers a very
secure comfortable fit it can get a good
tight seal second thanks to that tight
seal bass performance is very good and
overall the headphones sound quite good
and over more refined sound than the
earlier and less expensive I Sport
immersion which has been discontinued
and finally the headphone is sweat proof
and can literally be rinsed off which is
nice my only gripe is with the inline
remote design the buttons are small in
the middle control talk button which
also advances tracks forward and back is
stiff and hard to use Android and
Windows users should also take note that
some of the remote features won't work
with their phones because this is an
Apple friendly remote you can however
make calls using the built-in microphone
I mentioned that this headphone retails
for a hundred and fifty dollars but
what's interesting is that the green
version seems to be selling for less
than this black version I've seen it for
$120 online which is closer to what this
headphone should cost anyway aside from
some small shortcomings it's a well
designed sports headphone with strong
sound just be aware that the headphones
do seal out the outside world quite well
so you may not hear cars coming if
you're playing your music loud while
running or riding your bike I'm David
Carr noise and that's the monster I
Sport victory thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
