it is 16 degrees outside here in
Louisville Kentucky but that's not cold
enough for us so we're testing out desk
fans today and right here I've got the
dyson amo1 update on the amo one am
standing for air multiplier and as you
can see this is a bladeless fan it's a
fan that you can stick your hand right
through it doesn't have any blades
doesn't spin anything and how this thing
works is there's a bit of a jet like
turbine in the base that draws air in
and then circulates it through this
hollow ring there's a slit here along
the ridge where the air comes out over a
foil and that directs it into a cone it
also in trains air which is a term that
means to pull in to an existing current
and that makes a multiplied current of
air that comes at you and that's all
great design it works well it circulates
there just as well as you would like and
our tests that felt about the same as a
standard desk fan and it blew out air
and a very steady stream now if you
compare the amo six to the amo one that
came before it you will notice some
differences first off you'll see that
the amo six has a remote and this is how
you'll control the thing it's got the
power button it'll turn oscillation on
and off it's got the sleep timer setting
and you can adjust the intensity as well
now none of those controls are on the
fan itself except for the power button
and that's one complaint I have if you
lose this remote or if this remote
breaks all you'll be able to do is turn
the fan on and off you won't be able to
turn oscillation on and off you won't be
able to dial it up or down or set that
sleep timer you lose all of that if you
lose the remote now the remote stores on
top thanks to this magnet so it's less
likely to run away but still I found
myself walking off that in my pocket by
mistake a few times I could see that
getting lost pretty easily in addition
to the new remote there's also a new
vanishing LED display that looks very
stylish and on top of that the amo six
is also a much quieter desk fan it's up
to 75% quieter according to Dyson
additionally it's also 30% more
efficient drawing less power to produce
the same current of error
so overall the amo 6 is a better
engineered desk fan than the amo 1 was
so how much is a state of the art Dyson
desk fan retail for well this 10 inch
model of the amo 6 sells for two hundred
and ninety nine dollars that's a pretty
whopping price tag but it's actually the
same price as the amo one debuted for
five years ago so they haven't jacked
the price up even though they've added
the remote and made it quieter and more
efficient and that's a little
encouraging but still wow a lot to pay
for a desk fan I don't know that you
need to spend that much there are
Destin's out there that do perfectly
good work at 30 bucks or so but if you
want a state-of-the-art classy
top-of-the-line futuristic desk fan you
can't do much better than this
for CNET I'm right Chris
