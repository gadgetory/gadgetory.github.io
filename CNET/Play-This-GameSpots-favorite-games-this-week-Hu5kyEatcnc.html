show where gamespot and cnet editors
tell you what you should be playing this
week so I'm playing life is strange it
is an episodic game about a young girl
with time-bending powers she can rewind
time and stop time to solve puzzles so
I've been playing journey on the
PlayStation 4 this is my first time
playing through it and it is stunning
recently I've been playing a game called
no pineapple left behind and what that
basically is a scathing critique of the
No Child Left Behind Act for me
personally it's King's Quest a night to
remember the first episode in the new
King's Quest series I was a big fan of
King's Quest back in the day and it's
coming back in a really nice way she has
just gone back to her old home town and
reunited with her old best friend and
they are trying to solve this weird
murder mystery and this lot of crazy
stuff going on and it's generally kind
of weird but also shows young women in a
very sweet way I really like the way the
characters interact with each other and
it's pretty well written definitely
worth checking out visually it's a
masterpiece it's it's a work of art if
you get the chance I definitely
recommend giving that a try in the game
you're constantly pushing for turning
children into pineapples because
pineapples a more uniform and more
consistent than the children and how
you're constantly firing teachers when
they get too exhausted because they're
trying to teach too much it's still
really rough it just injured open alpha
and there's a free download online you
can go try it out I really likes my time
with it good blend of whimsical humor
some neat puzzles and just very
accessible it's just kind of a feel-good
game really lighten up my week
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
