buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
I got to go to Vegas and drink martinis
and poor bill gates as kids didn't get
to have any ipods let's begin in Vegas
with the gadget of the week the gadget
of the week is what is most likely my
new camera the sony cybershot DSC HX one
which unfortunately they have tether to
this desk here it was unveiled at PMA
2009 here in Las Vegas and I have to say
it caused quite a sensation the deal
with this camera is that it has super
fast high-quality burst mode so that I
could take a bunch of pictures as my
child is he's running across the room it
has mega zoom so that I could zoom in
really close on my child it does this
amazing panorama so that i could get
every single moment of my childs
baseball swing and it takes high def
video for when I want to take high def
video of my child possibly I need more
things to take pictures up but it's a
really great camera so I'm coming to you
from PMA 2009 which is the photo
marketing association annual trade show
it's a digital camera show I can
understand why you might have a hard
time telling that is a digital camera
show since I'm sitting in an Aston
Martin but I have a rule that if there's
an Aston Martin around I stayed in it
anyway this car is part of the digital
experience party which is part of PMA
2009 it's james bond themed but i have
to say I've been surprised at how many
non camera related things I've run into
at this show now let's do you think that
this camera show is only for cameras
there are tons of accessories here
including some
camera bags designed specially for girls
how does pink really pink but here's the
thing there aren't actually any girls
here and everybody only wants to see
this bag the crumpler which has this
cool new feature where you can cover up
the velcro so you don't make any noise
and then you don't piss people off in
every press conference like Charlie does
Charlie and this is the my studio from
pro psychics basically for taking really
high quality pictures of your really
small valuable items I totally saw this
thing in skymall on the plane on the way
out here but they tell me this one's way
better wave but obviously PMA is about a
lot more than Aston Martin's and funny
little bags there were plenty of actual
cameras too and pretty much I did video
and almost all of them you can see all
our PMA coverage at cnet TV com now back
to the news yes indeed the news facebook
announced that it's making some welcome
changes to its homepage profile page and
status updates for one thing they're
getting rid of the 5,000 follower limit
on public profile pages which thank
goodness because people are beating down
my door oh no sorry it's so that real
celebrities in like Dell and coca-cola
and BMW can have as many friends as they
want for branding their friends also
though Facebook will post status updates
to news feeds in real time they'll make
it easier to separate groups of friends
and then you can more easily put links
videos photos and much more in your
updates now these are all features that
users have been asking for and some of
them are starting to look a lot like
Twitter yeah watch your back Twitter
Facebook is a stone killer moving on to
kindle news amazon released a free
kindle application for the iphone this
week it downloads your kindle books onto
your iphone let's you read them and then
it uses the whispersync network to make
sure you're always on the same page on
either device will it save you 350 bucks
on a kindle maybe you can't get
subscription content delivered to your
iPhone and you can't buy books directly
from the app so it's really meant to be
like a little supplement for times when
you're on the go and you don't have your
kindle handy or a way to save 350 bucks
on a kindle if you only want books and
you don't mind you know buying your
books on the computer having to go all
the way to Safari to get them on your
I phone the horror in quick tidbits this
week palm confirmed a March fifteenth
release date for the treo pro yeah sorry
about that nope um there's only one
release date we care about right now
preemie preemie now now last week I
promised you some celebrity gossip that
was mostly a lie but here's a little bit
Melinda Gates apparently told Vogue
magazine this week that bill won't let
his kids have iPods or iPhones at all
yeah they would probably hate him a lot
if it weren't for his will but hey kids
you're probably not in there go get
yourself some iphones he won't know and
finally let's get a look at what's
clogging the tubes shall we this week
it's biscuit the sleepwalking dog
you know this is how they get away with
it the man can like take my money
handout huge corporate bailouts be all
corrupted take private jets everywhere
whatever they could seriously nuke the
world as long as I could just watch
funny dogs run into walls on YouTube
thank goodness for funny dogs and that's
the buzz report for this week everyone
I'm mollywood and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
