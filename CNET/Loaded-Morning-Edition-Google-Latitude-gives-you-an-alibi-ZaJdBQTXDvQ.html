Conte and it's time to get loaded barnes
&amp;amp; noble now has an ipad app so the
company can sell books on apple's tablet
reader barnes and noble already had an
iphone app so this isn't a big departure
for them still it does give customers
access to the barnes and noble nook
library which is the only program that
allows you to lend a book to a friend
for up to 14 days a new feature in
Google Latitude will tell you where
you've been latitude is a location
mapping and sharing feature inside
Google Maps for Mobile location history
will give you a dashboard view that
reports your travels in a linear
chronological way it also groups your
trips by trends handy if you're accused
of a crime and you need to prove your
alibi bill shrink is launching a new
feature to compare cable and satellite
TV services in your area bill shrink is
a service that shows side-by-side
comparisons of services like cell phone
carriers and credit cards the beta TV
comparison includes the 100 largest TV
markets in the US I did it for my house
and unfortunately it didn't know that
Verizon has just started offering FiOS
in my building so it still does have
some catching up to do but it's a start
and we'll end with an iphone rumor the
latest one has the iphone 4g coming to
sprint not verizon we're not talking
about the fourth generation iphone that
we expect to be announced in two weeks
we're talking about the 4G version
Sprint is the only network to have
phones up and running on 4G so it would
make sense that Apple would want its
phone on a proven network we'll see
those are your headlines for now I'll
see you this afternoon with more thank
you for watching i'm natali del conte
with cnettv
and you just been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
