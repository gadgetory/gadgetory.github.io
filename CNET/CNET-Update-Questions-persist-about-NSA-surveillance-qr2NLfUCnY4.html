surveillance continues I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your cnet update questions
continue to be raised over what
authority the National Security Agency
has for snooping in on domestic phone
calls and other electronic
communications the demand for answers
began after Edward Snowden a former NSA
contractor leaked classified documents
that accused the government of
conducting broad surveillance on
Americans the Director of National
Intelligence has not been clear on what
legal authorization is required for the
NSA to eavesdrop on phone calls
meanwhile USA Today published an
interview with three former NSA members
who were punished years ago for speaking
out against the surveillance tactics of
NSA these men backed up Snowden's claims
and said he did the right thing by
leaking the documents and the Washington
Post reported Sunday that the NSA has a
program called nucleon it intercepts
telephone calls and routes the spoken
words to a database several internet
companies including Apple Microsoft
Google and Facebook want to clear their
names and they're asking the US
government for permission to be more
transparent in the info they're giving
to the NSA as of this report the
companies have only been able to share
broad statistics that sum up all of the
government requests they receive for
user data including those from local
police agencies in other news metropcs
customers are able to buy new phones
that will work on t mobile's 4g network
among the new phones is a t-mobile
version of the samsung galaxy s3 that
runs on faster wireless speeds but it's
only for a few cities right now t-mobile
bought metro pcs and this is just the
beginning of that migration there's more
kids television programming coming to
netflix the streaming video service
announced that by next year it'll have
300 hours of original show programming
based on dreamworks animation franchises
like shrek any skype user can now send a
video message to someone who is offline
members of skype can record a three
minute long video message and share it
with another user and the message will
be waiting for them when they get back
online just like leaving someone a
voicemail message this feature is a bit
mobile for desktop and mobile users and
there's no limit to how many video
messages you can send for free this
feature was first tested in February but
it's now for everyone Facebook is having
an event later this week on Thursday and
techCrunch reports it has a source
saying this is about Instagram adding
the ability to share videos there's also
been talk of Facebook launching an RSS
reader so stay tuned for that that's
