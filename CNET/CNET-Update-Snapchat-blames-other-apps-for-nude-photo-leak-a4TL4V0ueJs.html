good karma I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your CNET update how about we start off
with some advice don't trust snapchat or
any app as a way to send or save private
photos because everything you share
online has a way of getting out and
here's yet another awful example it's
reported that 200,000 photos from
snapchat users are being leaked online
and the database includes nude photos
collected over the course of four years
many that could be from underage users
some have nicknamed this scandal the
snapping but it's not snapchat that was
hacked rather this is coming from a
separate app that people downloaded to
save the disappearing snapchat images
the whole point of snapchat is that the
photos and videos you send to people are
automatically deleted after being viewed
as of this report there's debate on
whether this is a hoax questioning if
these photos are really from snapchat
users some debate which app is to blame
but it could be something called snap
save snapchat has distance itself in a
statement saying that it's not
responsible and it put the blame on
outside apps just realize everything has
a way of being hacked these days not
even your Orange Julius is safe Dairy
Queen is the latest company to be hit by
hackers customer credit and debit card
numbers were stolen from nearly 400
Dairy Queen stores along with some
Orange Julius stands if you shopped at a
Dairy Queen between August and October
you should order a new card with all
these hack attacks we could use some
good karma to turn things around and the
CEO of Microsoft is also in short supply
after putting his foot in his mouth by
giving terrible career advice at a
conference for women in technology Satya
Nadella was asked how women should ask
for a pay raise he responded that women
shouldn't ask I'm just trusting karma to
give them the rewards they deserve
considering women don't get paid as much
as men that whole karma thing hasn't
really worked out so well for women he
has since backtrack to say he was wrong
and mitting there is a gender pay gap
problem and women should ask for raises
so how about we cheer things up a bit
before we end with some
quirky gadgets PlayStation fans may be
interested in Sony's new smartphone the
Xperia z3 which could be hooked on a
controller to play games stream from a
ps4 console a special version is coming
to Verizon later this month with
wireless charging abilities and how
about a tablet with a built-in projector
Lenovo's yoga tablet 2 pro has a rounded
hinge with a kickstand to prop it up
but inside the hinge is a projector the
tablet costs $500 and will be out in
time for the holidays that's your tech
