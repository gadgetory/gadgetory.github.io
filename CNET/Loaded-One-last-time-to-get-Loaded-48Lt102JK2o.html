carry on cnet.com and it's time to get
loaded there's lots of Google related
news today and we start with the blog
post about Android security that's
causing quite the stir a researcher from
a security group demonstrated that
Android apps are able to access
sensitive personal information even when
the app itself doesn't require
permission to access data these know
permission apps that can appear to be
harmless can still access a device's SD
card handset identification data and
files stored by other apps and the app
can transmit information back to an
outside party so what can you do well
until something is fixed Android users
should avoid saving sensitive data like
photos and work files on the SD card and
be aware of what you download just
because an app doesn't ask for
permission to access data it apparently
still can Google Plus has gotten a
facelift the social network has been
redesigned with the hopes of making this
site easier to use the navigation bar
moved from the top to the left its
customizable and photos posted will show
up larger on the page but it also has a
good chunk of unused white space on the
right side about 40% of the right side
is blank
leaving users to poke fun at what they
could put in that space one user took a
picture of their cat sitting in the
space another user filled the space with
Facebook in another browser window or
perhaps the white space is for Betty
White
Sony has introduced a watch that would
communicate with your Android phone it's
called Smart Watch and has a price tag
of one hundred and fifty dollars and it
will allow users to read text messages
get social media updates check email
manage calls and control music it
connects to an Android phone via
bluetooth and when there's an event
alert or upcoming call the watch
vibrates it supposedly will run for four
days on a single charge and a splash
proof
this is Sony's second attempt at a watch
that works with Android phones back in
2010 it created the live view which
ended up being a flop and we end today's
show with a big announcement this will
be the final episode of loaded but don't
you fret because in the next few days
I'm coming back with a brand new daily
tech news show it's called Cena
update and it'll be available five days
a week you'll still get a quick
breakdown of the biggest news in tech
but it'll be delivered every afternoon

developing stories were watching as well
as emerging trends and new apps to check
out when you visit Sina communist in an
update in a new interactive video player
that will give you links to more
