Friday I mean Black Thursday I mean
Cyber Friday Monday I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your scene at update black
Friday has begun and I'm quite serious
the sales already started online Amazon
kicked it off a few days ago pushing out
a new sale every 10 minutes and Amazon
Prime members get special early access
to deals you probably just missed a sale
because you're watching this video did I
give you anxiety well relax because
although Black Friday has turned into
Black Thursday with stores opening on
Thanksgiving you shouldn't feel like you
have to skip out on pumpkin pie to fight
the crowds for a deal the major
retailers want to compete with Amazon so
you'll find online promotions from
Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday also
you'll see more free shipping deals
Target is offering free shipping for
online orders no matter how much money
you spend that continues until December
20th but if you do love the rush of
going to the stores cNN has combed
through the circulars to find the best
tech deals several retailers are
discounting iPads Walmart knocks $40 off
the older iPad Mini and also throws in
another $30 gift card which is worth it
since the older model isn't that much
different than the new mini best bite
Knox $100 off the new iPad air 2 and
staples also cuts iPad prices as much as
$80 it's a better deal than what you get
at Apple stores because Apple just hands
you a $50 gift card when you buy an
iPhone or iPad now this is the second
year for the new game consoles so there
are some decent deals Toys R Us and Game
Stop are selling Xbox one bundles at a
70 dollar discount and other stores are
throwing in some free games now Best Buy
has some deals on gadgets we liked but
who knows how many items they have in
stock you can get an 11 inch macbook air
for seven hundred and eighty dollars
it's normally nine hundred or a 15 inch
HP Envy laptop for five hundred bucks
you can save $50 off the nest smart
thermostat the GoPro Hero 3 plus as well
as the older Dropcam HD home monitoring
cameras you see everyone usually puts
the older models on sale you can find
the full list of details up at CNET for
you to scroll through and when
our standing in a store line for 30
minutes you might as well get out your
phone and do some research on how much
your item costs compared to other stores
there are apps that make price comparing
easy when you scan the barcode like red
laser and shop savvy most major
retailers will price match competitors
including Amazon so pays to do your
homework on your phone while you wait
also google upgraded its shopping search
results for phones so if you're
searching for a product you'll see more
details than before including
availability at nearby stores reviews
and related products that's your tech
news update happy shopping from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
