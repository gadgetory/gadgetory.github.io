netflix reported its worst member growth
in three years the streaming service
lost some users in the last quarter due
in part to price increases in markets
like the United States Netflix also
warned that it will not meet analysts
expectations on subscriber growth in the
next quarter so who did netflix blame
for this lack of growth the press at
first that seems like an odd idea
Netflix increased prices so shouldn't
that be enough of a reason to get
certain members to cancel the service
Netflix explained that in April the
phrase Netflix price increase trended on
Google Trends the company said it saw
members who are not subject to a higher
price canceling their memberships for
those of you who are wondering Netflix
increased its us pricing on a standard
plan from roughly nine dollars to
roughly ten dollars that plan allows a
member to stream netflix on two screens
at one time at 1080p HD netflix the
stock price took a hit dropping fifteen
percent the service still has over 83
million subscribers worldwide which is
pretty impressive Netflix CEO Reed
Hastings says that with the increased
revenue Netflix will invest in better
content can someone please tell him to
stop backing Adam Sandler movies then
it's enough enough's enough well that's
it for this tech news update amaya's
