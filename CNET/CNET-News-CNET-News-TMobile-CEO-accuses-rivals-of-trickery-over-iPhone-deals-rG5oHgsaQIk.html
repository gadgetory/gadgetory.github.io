obviously sprint I showed a little bit
of life with the new CEO Marcelo Claure
a what do you think about Marcel have
you met him for one and I have not what
do you think about the task ahead from
this guy's hands full and you know I
think there's you know let's understand
the guys been here about a month right
and you know you got to give them points
for showing activity
and so you know I think one of the most
important things we don't need sprint to
fail for us to succeed that that's not
what this is about
I don't think they think about you know
us that same way either the AT&amp;amp;T and
Verizon control 85% of the profitability
of this industry and over 75% of the sub
one gigahertz you know spectrum 70% of
the market share so you know just by
doing the things that are right for
customers there's plenty of little to
grow so you got his hands you think you
both spread and t-mobile can actually
grow in this market of course and it but
you know remember we are in a totally do
with had five quarters of over a million
net ads of customers and you know we're
at a peak of our growth they're trying
to get to the point where they stop
bleeding so let's not move from they
made a few announcements to they're
grown they got their hands full and
frankly they still have a long way to go
before their network is competitive so
the harder part for Sprint would be that
they unfortunately had to get into price
competition right before their network
was ready and I think that's his words
and your networks not up to party up to
compete on price but if you if you could
you would do that later
you mentioned before I mean when you
made the comment about surpassing Sprint
this very probably to fork in it they're
you know we're they're done they're done
yeah they're done we're not there yet
but come on mr. you say Sprint's done
it's funny you say that given you know
up until a month ago you guys were
seemingly headed towards a merger I know
never publicly confirm but the fact that
it actually collapsed publicly the way
it did was come surprising and rare but
for you I mean how do you approach tip
do you approach t-mobile differently
what this deal wasn't we what was most
important to me in this entire pairs the
same thing is that I want to keep the
momentum of my company continuing my
employees focused the brand being
defined as the thing that we're about
and right through all those rumors and
right past we continue and I think more
difficult for them is it seemed as if
their answer to how to fix their company
was t-mobile so they had to announce
that the answer that they were banking
on wasn't happening Sprint Verizon have
all announced special plans for Sprint
has a specific plan a $50 plan for the
iPhone and Verizon's offering a free one
I guess if you trade in an old iPhone
what do you think of these programs are
you also thinking about a promotion of
your own yeah listen we're not we're not
announcing our iPhone plans yet and
that's something you do in partnership
with Apple and I'm actually surprised
some of these to come in or or were they
you know were they authorized and where
are they and trickery is my first
reaction okay no trickery come on the I
was a little surprised at the Sprint
plan did you said $50 plan but you
missed the iPhone for life 20 baller
which is actually a rental but it's what
really is is it's a financing plan with
no residual value and we talked about
sprint a lot of AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon I mean
these are two really your two big
targets right there's 250 billion
dollars with the revenue between AT&amp;amp;T
and Verizon that's more than the GDP s
of Portugal or Denmark they they have a
built-in inherent reason to not change
you know and Verizon more than anybody
why would they change they're having a
party there's so much I'm actually
they're doing very well yeah but we are
doing just fine beautifully moving and
if they're happy I'm happy
if the porting ratio state two to one
even the whole industry it's only a
matter of time do you think by that with
that same situation that that spring can
actually mount its own
back and getting shader really got a
sprint thing going over they give me no
old no pay older on the side you afraid
the guy cuz he's so big Oh what the hell
is going on come on give them some time
right you know their die they're
bleeding customers they've got to go
through the layoffs right their brand is
miserable look at the store across the
streets and ugly yellow there's no
people there they got no sorry about
that guys stuff hanging on the window
and and the guy came in and made some
aggressive price you know yes changes
you know ten lines 4x by the way the
price for ten lines is the same as the
price for two lines I mean come on and
and you know it family got killed the
poor hamster has no jobs the groups of
family members are stranded so people's
prices are going to go down all of their
pricing plans are only for new customers
which means their loyal customers are
pissed off so you got some work to do
but let's not declare victory it's a
long game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
