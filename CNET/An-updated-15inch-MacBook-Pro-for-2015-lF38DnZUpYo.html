just ever so slightly updated I'm Dan
Ackerman and this is the 2015 edition of
Apple's
15 inch macbook pro now this looks and
feels a lot like last year's 15-inch
MacBook Pro and that's because it's
essentially the same system it's gotten
a few minor tweaks fewer tweaks actually
than the MacBook Airs have gotten in
2015 or even the 13-inch MacBook Pro we
do get the new force touch trackpad that
is a trackpad that is actually a flat
piece of glass that's on four sensors
doesn't have that sort of diving board
click down mechanism anymore what it has
is a series of little haptic feedback
centers underneath it so when you click
on it it gives you a little jog it feels
like you're clicking down although
you're really not it's actually uncanny
and if you press down harder you
actually get two levels of click you
also get faster flash storage drive in
here
you know from moving a lot of files back
and forth certainly that could be
helpful we didn't notice a huge
difference in our benchmark tests one
thing you don't get however that other
new 2015 Mac books new models and
updated ones have gotten is Intel's
Broadwell generation processors that's
the fifth generation of the you know
Core i3 Core i5 core i7 processors this
guy keeps last year's core i7 still
plenty fast enough frankly performance
wise you're not going to notice a big
difference you do lose out I think
probably on some potential battery life
games Apple says that this model due to
some new tricks with the battery
chemistry should run a bit longer than
last year's similar comparable model we
found this thing ran I think for about
nine hours pretty much the same as last
year's 15-inch MacBook Pro this is both
the largest and most powerful laptop
that Apple makes right now especially
since the much-beloved 17 inch version
of the MacBook Pro has been discontinued
for many years and of course you get
that super high resolution what Apple
calls the Retina screen and lots of
ports and connections even though it's
very slim for a 15-inch laptop you also
get in the higher-end model we have here
a new graphics card it's the Andy Radeon
r9 M 370 X which was decent and 3d
gaming certainly not as fast
dedicated gaming laptop will be but on a
Mac your gaming options are pretty
limited anyway without that this guy
starts at $19.99 and this updated
version with a graphics card is $24.99
I'm Dan Ackerman and that is Apple's 15
inch macbook pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
