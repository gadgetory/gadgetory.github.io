avec on glyph isn't a VR headset it's a
head-mounted display you can plug it
into your phone or a game console or
your tablet you can wear it anywhere you
can watch movies on your face glyph is
like a giant pair of good sounding
headphones but with tiny projectors
inside the headband that beam images
directly into your eyes
flip them down and suddenly you're
watching TV the 720p display is super
bright and it looks like a tiny movie
theater you can adjust the view with
focus tiles change eye distance and you
can swap the nose bridge for the best
fit a lot of knobs and a lot of dials
even so the glyph is also a little hard
to get a perfect fit with and it's weird
to use while in motion it made me
totally sick in a cab and it's $700
basically the price of a VR headset this
is mostly good for looking at the things
you'd normally be looking at while
you're looking at your phone but now
it's on your face instead at least you
can see around you while you're wearing
them enough to grab a drink without
taking them off so you can wear them all
day or until the battery dies after 4
hours of playback you can use glyph to
play 3d content to sort of or use head
tracking to control 360-degree videos
and even drones but that stuff's not
fully up to snuff yet in this early
adopter version we'll try that next time
glyph is one more thing to wear on your
face but it's probably one thing too
many for most
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
