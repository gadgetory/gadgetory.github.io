and this is a review of the piper home
security system piper is a cute compact
DIY security system from Black sumac it
got its start on IndieGoGo and the
campaign did so well that they're
actually taking pre-orders right now
what I love about this device is that
it's an all-in-one security system that
means that it includes a siren a fisheye
camera and a motion detector all in one
unit it also has a built-in sensor that
picks up on temperature humidity ambient
light and ambient sounds so in addition
to home security it also does a couple
other things I also love that this works
as a z-wave hub so you can pair it with
a ton of different home automation
devices each unit costs 239 which is a
little steep compared to say canary a
similar product which goes for $1.99 but
I really love Piper while you can have
up to five Piper's for a larger home
larger business I think it works best
for a smaller space say a condo or an
apartment and it works well the app is
available for Android and iOS and it's
very easy to use there's no monthly fee
associated with Piper but it may come at
a price it won't call the police for you
but it will send you alerts when there's
a security event and you can decide how
to proceed all in all I think it's a
fantastic value a great entry-level DIY
option and perfect for a smaller home
thanks for watching I'm Megan Willerton
for seanut appliances and this has been
a review of Piper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
