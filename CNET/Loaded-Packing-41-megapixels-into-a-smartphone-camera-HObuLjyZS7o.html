Bridget Carey on cnet com and it's time
to get loaded a slew of new mobile
devices are being introduced this week
at the mobile world congress in
barcelona spain but one model that's
getting lots of attention at this trade
show is the 808 PureView a Nokia phone
that packs a bizarre 41 megapixel camera
41 megapixels sounds absurd but it's
worth noting that it's not saving a
massive 41 megapixels snapshot but
rather the sensor collects 41 megapixels
of data then shrinks it down to a more
manageable file size it also records in
full HD 1080p video has high-quality
audio recording and is due out in May
for about six hundred dollars before
subsidies it's running on a symbian
operating system but Nokia says they're
working on taking this better camera
technology to windows phones scientists
at IBM say they have made a breakthrough
in quantum computing proving that a
quantum computer is not only possible
but within reasonable reach a quantum
computer goes far beyond what the best
super computers can do today a
traditional computer bit has two states
off and on or zero and one but quantum
computing means it can exist as on and
off at the same time and at all points
in between it allows for millions of
computations at a time IBM says this
would be key for doing highly sensitive
and extremely fast encryption work Yahoo
is threatening to wage war on Facebook
in court the new york times reports
Yahoo is demanding that Facebook license
about ten to twenty pence held by Yahoo
Facebook representatives said Yahoo
brought these demands to them the same
time Yahoo talked to the time so
Facebook hasn't had a chance yet to
evaluate Yahoo's claims the patents in
question deal with advertising website
personalization social networking and
chat services the social network Google+
boasts it has more than 90 million
members and is growing fast but one
report says users hardly spend any time
on the site comscore reports users spend
about 3.3 minutes a month on google+ and
that number has dwindled as each month
passes compare that to facebook users
spent an average of seven and a half
hours on
Facebook in January a new smartphone app
is about to make it really easy to
instantly send a gift to a facebook
friend the moment you read about
something big going on in their life
it's called karma and will scan through
Facebook posts and highlight once
someone got a new job is having a
birthday or maybe he's just having a bad
day pick out a gift from the commerce
store and if you don't know their
personal taste narrow it down to a
category and let the receiver choose
their favorite style you can even send a
digital greeting card to go with it all
the receiver has to do is tell kamar
where to send a gift those are your
headlines for today I'm Bridget Carey
