contributor and today we're going to
take a look at how to save maps for
offline use in the latest Google Maps
for Android the update was pushed out
yesterday after Google i/o and all the
big news we saw yesterday this was
something that kind of got pushed to the
side it wasn't really announced or
talked about but it's something they
rolled out and it's a great feature to
have in Google Maps on Android so what
you do is when you pull up the map and
you're looking at where you're at and
you want to save that area for offline
use you actually hit the Menu key make
available offline and then you could
zoom in zoom out and select the area
that you want to save or cache on your
device so when you get to an area that's
too big you're actually told that area
is too large you need to scale it down a
little bit and so you could zoom back in
and then you're actually told how many
megabytes that backup is going to be for
that area to be saved offline so once
you get the map just right hit done and
then it's going to download that portion
of the map and save it to your device
it's gonna take some time depending on
how big the download is all right so the
download of the offline section has
finished and as you saw it was just over
66 megabytes but it took probably 10
minutes or so to download and I'm I was
connected to a pretty high-speed
wireless network it shouldn't shouldn't
have taken that long to download that
file that size of file so I'm in
airplane mode and I don't have any type
of connection and as you can see if I
try to zoom in on just la here for
example the maps isn't refreshing you're
not able to see any lower views but if i
zoom in to my location here as you can
see the offline section is an exact map
what you would expect if you had a data
connection for that section and how you
access it cuz through the Menu key again
show your offline list and you could tap
on it and it will let you know what
you have save for offline and once again
once you zoom in you're actually going
to see that area as you would if you had
a data connection when you go to other
areas you don't get the detailed view
like you normally would expect that's
because that area is not saved for an
offline view so once again it's Jason
Cipriani is seen at how-to contributor
and that was how to save an area for
offline use with the new Google Maps
update for Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
