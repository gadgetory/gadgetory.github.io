I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update google has made another tweak to
its search engine and for its 15th
birthday the company announced that
search has evolved to better understand
long and complex questions it's the
first major update to the search engine
in three years and Google executives
said that they observed more people
typing in long questions and phrases
into the search bar rather than just one
or two keywords as people did years ago
but this upgrade also involves voice
search if you've been following Google's
changes you've seen that they've been
rolling out new ways to do voice
searches not just on a smartphone but
also from your desktop browser
understanding the different ways we may
ask a question is also a new challenge
for Google and some answers to basic
questions are now popping up right in
the search results for example if you
type in how many calories are in a
milkshake you instantly get the full
nutritional breakdown and that means you
don't have to click the fit day or
myfitnesspal websites for the answer if
you're nostalgic for a time when Google
was more simple here's a little easter
egg that'll take you back in the search
bar just type in the phrase google in
1998 for those of you buying the new
xbox one the live gold membership will
include fitness training that uses the
kinect sensor along with interactive
workout videos featuring celebrity
trainers the xbox fitness online workout
program uses the kinect to check your
vitals it can measure your heart rate
your muscles and evaluate your
performance like how hard you're
punching or how high you're jumping the
program is free through the end of 2014
Apple's iOS 7 comes with many updates
but one of them is a feature that helps
make it easier for programmers to use
radio frequencies to send messages to
smartphones it's called I beacon and
Major League Baseball is in the process
of using it to enhance its app called at
the ballpark I got a chance to see a
demonstration of the technology at Citi
Field home of the New York Mets the
developers of the app put Bluetooth
beacons in different locations
throughout the stadium in this test the
app had to be running in the background
and the phone
needed bluetooths turned on walking
through the main gate showed a pop-up
notification welcome message the app
suggested I go near the old Shea Stadium
home run apple to learn more about it
and when i did a video began to play it
also pushed a coupon for hot dogs at the
ticket gate and another coupon for
merchandise when i got near the main
store MLB plans to roll this out to
stadiums for the start of next season it
works for the new iPhones as well as the
5 and the 4 s down the line they can
also program the same beacons to work
with the Android app that your tech news
update you can get more details on these
