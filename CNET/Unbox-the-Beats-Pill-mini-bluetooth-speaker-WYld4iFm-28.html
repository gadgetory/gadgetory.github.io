Buy get the right gift at the right
price all at your ultimate holiday
showroom in here we've got a little
speaker with a lot of sound we're
unboxing the beats pill let's get to it
bubble pack
yeah here it is small as promised the
beats pill and we've got it here in the
color blue it also comes in like a red
white black
I think they've even got some neon
colors so lots to choose from already
good let's see how it's packaged even
here it says small but loud excellent so
you can take to the park to the next
festival you go to unbox it here and it
looks just like a pill so before we get
to the actual speaker let's see what
this guy comes with okay we've got a
micro USB cable and thankfully it comes
with an auxilary cable so you can set up
a direct line between your device and
the speaker excellent and then we have
our power brick so this is how this guy
powers up nice
okay that's all the accessories let's
get to the good stuff
uh-oh look at what they did it's not
gonna like a pill that's genius I love
it and in here we've got our paperwork
so we've got our trusty QuickStart guide
which will be useful because some of the
buttons on the sky cool double duty and
do other things like the volume button
and the answers calls things like that
okay ready time for my medicine
oh wow we've got this nice high-quality
feeling carrying case and here's our
pill so it's this beautiful blue color
alright and here we have instructions
for answering the phone call putting it
on hold switching so if you're streaming
music from your smartphone to the pill
and you get an incoming call the music
will actually pause and that call will
come through the speakers awesome now
it's a great if you're picnicking and
you have an important call coming but
great option okay so let's take that guy
off gorgeous and on the back here now
this is interesting it has built-in NFC
so if you have an NFC enabled phone like
the Nexus 5 or Galaxy S 4 you can
actually pair it with this speaker by
just tapping it and then the Bluetooth
connection will automatically be
initiated it's nice and light it's also
got this rubberized bottom so if you're
playing music and you really crank up
the bass it won't move around this guy
is small compact and definitely a
splurge for you audio files at $1.99 so
there you have it we've unboxed the
beats pill by dr. dre verse Tina calm
