groove blue vibe DLX a generically
styled wireless on your headphone that
you can pick up online for an affordable
$80 patently middle-of-the-road
it's the classic definition of a product
that's good enough it looks okay pulls
up into an included protective carrying
case that's pretty nice and delivers
reasonable performance particularly when
it comes to battery life which clocks in
at around 14 hours to their credit the
headphones are fairly comfortable and
seem durable enough though they do feel
pretty plasticy and make a crinkling
noise when you bend the headband or
adjust the headphones they have volume
and transport controls on either side of
the right earpiece you can also plug in
an included cord and use them as a wired
headphone as with all of these types of
stereo bluetooth headsets they have an
integrated microphone for making
hands-free calls their sound is what
I've come to expect from budget
Bluetooth headphones it's okay but lacks
the clarity and vibrance you get from
more expensive premium Bluetooth models
which can come close to sounding like
good wired headphones for those with
critical ears anyway the Blu vibe DLX
never lets you forget it's a bluetooth
headphone in the end there's nothing
great about the go group Blu vive DLX
but there's also nothing terribly wrong
with it
it does offer some appeal to those on a
budget looking for a wireless headphone
however the only problem is if you poke
around Amazon you'll find plenty of
other products like it some of which
cost a little less I'm David Carr Noy
