today we're gonna take a look at the
Asus essentia CM 6870 so this boring
looking desktop is a thousand dollar PC
and it comes with Intel's brand new Ivy
Bridge CPU now what that means is that
this system has a new processor as well
as a new motherboard there's some
interesting features here but nothing
that's really earth-shattering or that's
gonna change the game as for the desktop
PC market so the specific chip in the
system is the Intel Core i7 3770 it's a
quad core chip it runs at 3.4 gigahertz
and it's a little bit more power
efficient than the previous generation
2000 series core i7 CPUs so you won't
see a big leap in performance over say
older systems that have the Core i7 2670
threaded and multitasking performance
gains along with the new CPU is a new
motherboard this system has an H 77
chipset and it has USB 3 built into it
now if you bought a new computer in the
past year or so you've certainly seen
USB 3 before but with USB 3 baked into
the circuitry now you should be able to
get USB 3 for less and you'll probably
see it in systems that cost much less
than this one you'll see the usual
assortment of ports on the front it's
got a nice blu-ray DVD combo drive on
the front as well otherwise this design
really isn't much to write home about
on the back here there's a lot of nice
connectivity options you get USB 3 7po
and audio USB 2 so let's some kind of
useless video ports and they're useless
because that comes with a graphics card
that's a budget 3d card it'll play most
games at reasonable resolution but
you're probably gonna have to dial down
the image quality now despite the new
CPU and motherboard of course the system
looks pretty much the same as any old
off-the-shelf desktop you'll see the CPU
here it's a standard fan over here
you've got the graphics card there's 8
gigs of memory with a couple slots to
expand a 2 terabyte hard drive which is
a little bit more than we usually see at
this price and down here below the
graphics card to get a little bit of
expansion room you've got 2 1 X PCI
Express slots and a single standard PCI
slot overall this is a relatively
unexcited commodity PC it's got a
reasonable price for its components at
$9.99 the new Intel chip is kind of
exciting we'll probably see that across
all kinds of new systems throughout the
year but overall it's kind of hard to
recommend a system without any real
standout features over the many others
that are going to use that same CPU so
I'm rich Brown this is the Asus essentia
CM 68 70</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
