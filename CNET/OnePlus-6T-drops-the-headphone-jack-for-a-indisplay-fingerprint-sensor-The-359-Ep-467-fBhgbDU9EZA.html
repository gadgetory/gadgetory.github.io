359 podcast episode 467 on Tuesday
October 2nd and before we get started we
want to send a special special shout out
to our friend of the show a peck
he's having surgery this morning we want
him to know that he's in our thoughts
and please have him in your thoughts or
your prayers or whatever channel you go
down we're thinking of you buddy thanks
for being such a good friend for so long
and we wish you a speedy recovery and
until then let's get on with the show
here's Ben and Roger hey hi
good luck a pack yeah good luck yeah
definitely so we've got we're gonna be
talking about a little bit about the one
+60 the upcoming flagship phone probably
released in the next few weeks sometime
this month I will also be talking about
Verizon's 5g home service it launched
yesterday but we'll talk about the sort
of fine print on the limitations of that
launch and then lastly we'll talk about
Amazon raising the minimum wage works
workers yes so it any questions on any
of these stories leave in the comment
section but I will pick out the best and
we will get to them in three minutes and
59 seconds strong three two
welcome to the 359 on Roger Chang I'm
Ben Fox ribbon
CNET's Lin la got an exclusive interview
with 1 plus CEO Pete lo who broke down
his decision to include the in screen
fingerprint sensor but remove the
headphone jack which is a controversial
move you know it'll be the first phone
in the u.s. sold in the u.s. through a
carrier worth an in displayed
fingerprint sensor but is it worth it to
lose the headphone jack then I like the
idea of an in screen fingerprint sensor
more than getting rid of the headphone
jack for additional like speakers
because I know that's what Apple did and
I'm kind of like well how much do I
actually use those speakers anyway like
sometimes for a speakerphone but
otherwise it's it's not like I'm like
blasting out music like using that so
that to me feels like it could be good
it's good to know real potentially I
don't know I'd like to try it out but
he's always phone is also the thicker I
like the idea of an
in screen and fingerprint sensor and
I've got an iPhone 10 that has no
headphone jack so I've been kind of used
to it I have Bluetooth headphones
oneplus actually released these uh
oneplus like bullet bluetooth headphones
earlier this year so they've clearly
been getting people ready for this
mmm why can't we just have it all it's a
Verizon yesterday officially launched
its 5g home service installation began
yesterday but after talking with one of
the the network executives yesterday I
got a sense of just how limited this
would be this is as a reminder in four
cities la Sacramento Indianapolis and
Dallas but I found out even within those
cities it's a few neighborhoods and it's
using this proprietary 5g technology
that they're not actually gonna be
expanding they're not going to actually
roll that out to anymore what the few
markets that are involved with the
commercial launch now or like that's all
we were gonna get for this year I'm also
curious like how close is this to actual
5g because this is not the industry
standard 5g that we're expecting later
right so is this closer to like 4G or is
it closer to five definitely it's great
question it's it's definitely more
similar to 5g it uses that super
high-frequency radio airwaves to
broadcast huge amounts of bandwidth so
it's it's definitely more more akin to
5g in fact really all they really didn't
need to do is put out a software update
next year to get on to the standard so
it's not a huge tweak but it means that
if you were looking to get 5g home and
you're not eligible then you're
basically stuck with until waiting till
next year until they actually roll out
the industry standard and actually
expand the service elsewhere okay when
does the industry standard hit mobile
phones though we're looking at 18 T's
looking to launch later this year but
it's probably gonna be very limited just
like with Verizon is doing
I'd expect broader adoption next year
but even then it's gonna be kind of
sporadic and then it's gonna be more
broadly available 2020 and if you're an
Apple customer expected to show up
whenever in 2035 iPhone 20 alright
lastly let's talk about Amazon the
company has been under fire for the
wages and treatment of its workers but
today responded by raising its minimum
wage to $15 in the US then is this
enough well that's that's really like
the fight for 15 movement has really
been pushing for $15 an hour so this
should definitely cual some of the
critics from Amazon Bernie Sanders who
has been a very prominent and loud
critic to Amazon about this he said you
know let's give credit where credit is
due
Jeff Bezos did exactly the right thing
according to him so as far as some one
of the biggest critics is concerned they
feel like this is a pretty good move and
they're calling on other major
corporations to do the same thing right
they're advocating for this $15 federal
minimum wage level right yeah they're
they're calling on Walmart to do the
same thing
fast-food companies like McDonald's so
we'll see who else ends up moving closer
to that $15 an hour all right for a full
coverage check us out on CNN I'm Roger
Chang I'm Ben Fox Ruben thanks for
listening
Thanks you ever had me on backup there I
got it I was Benny this mount goes too
fast for me sometimes I was doing my
best Mariah Carey impression huh I stand
by that so anyway yeah it's time to go
ahead and submit your questions and
comments so we can keep the conversation
going right out the gate let's take one
from Timothy says what's the next
analogue for the headphone jack USB C or
a different port coming up next these
days or are those days completely over
yeah and by the way is one Plus gonna
provide like some sort of dongle in case
you like everybody else has like a
million of these I know that's a really
good question
yeah cuz Apple gave up Apple gave up on
the dongle for its newest iPhone yeah
somewhere I am yet so I have an iPhone 8
for work and I have the Lightning jack
headphone yeah headphones that I never
use they're just like I have one of
those and then I have all these other
headphones with headphone jacks and like
as long as I have the dongle somewhere
and I'm like must have dropped it or
misplaced it or accidentally swallowed
it a bunch of times but yeah as long as
that's there we're okay swallowed it
well yeah so I mean they're gonna rely
on the USB C port for the connection but
yeah terms of dongles who knows yeah
next question comes from Alex Mitchell I
know people love the headphone jack but
if it makes room for more room for
battery I'll take it personally switch
to wireless music years ago that's
really more a statement than a question
sorry
I myself have switched to wireless
largely but I like having the option
because I have these really nice mixing
headphones that sometimes I like to like
review some of the mixes and masters
I've done as an audio engineer on my
phone but that's a very niche thing I
get it I mean we we run the joke into
the ground because that's what we do
here no but yeah I guess what's your
final real takeaway guys yeah yeah I've
learned to live without a headphone jack
I've had Bluetooth headphones for a
while if it meant having this injustice
on screen a fingerprint reader I'm I'm
all for it frankly I know I'm probably
for an iPhone or Samsung phones - I'm
yeah I have a Samsung phone as my
personal phone now that it has a
headphone jack I'm not switching that
phone for at least another year or two
so but but I'm now aware of the fact
that at some point I'm gonna be forced
to switch over and probably do like
bluetooth headphones or something which
is which is probably fine you know so I
I do go out running once a season and um
and it would be nice it would be nice to
have like you know like wireless or like
bluetooth headphones for something like
that yeah for sure I wonder what else
would you trade for the sake of the end
screen fingerprint touch like what where
where's the cutoff I don't know would
you trade like water resistance for that
I would trade read the screen foreign
fingerprint no we show you kind of a
gray slate kind of backing there and you
just stared that yeah I just want Apple
to hear me for once I wanna I want you
to eliminate the screen screen this
phone like let's go he's talking about
just the regular like core phone yeah
yeah those old phones and they'll charge
you more for it yeah rotary to scan my
finger and understand that it's me I
don't think there should be a trade-off
where while I get it from oneplus why
they needed the additional room for it
and the headphone jack is it does take
up quite a bit of space that's why Apple
got rid of yeah - that's why the Google
pixel got rid of it
these phones are getting increasingly
more expensive so why fourth customers
into making a decision as far as like
one or the other to be fair this we
don't have a price on this phone yet but
it's rumored to be around 550 which is
significantly lower than your iPhone 10
or your Galaxy S 9 right yeah so there's
that it's it's not you know that one
plus is claimed to be this premium phone
and less than lower than premium price
and for the most part they've generally
done it right they've got sort of the
top tier processor the specs are usually
fairly high in well yeah there you can
see some trade-offs right it's not you
know it's not IP water resistant dust
resistant they say it is water resistant
but it's not
i p rated so it's not like officially
rated you know still doesn't wireless
charging so there's so few things that
it's missing out on it's not it's not
exactly you know the full-fledged super
phone yeah and we'll see samsung an
apple make will see how much of a splash
it makes in the US because this is the
first time that they're gonna be getting
a major carrier that's right i connected
to them with t-mobile obviously that's
their their ascendant they're doing
better than they used to after you know
years of years of work but they're also
not AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon which are the top
two so right what are your thoughts on
that I mean I think this is this gonna
only help one plus I mean it's it's
always an extra set of challenges when
you have to optimize a phone
specifically for a carrier but I think
for the for t-mobile customers looking
to get the one plus I think this is the
best way to get it cuz this will be a
phone optimized for some of the specific
bands that t-mobile runs on so that
means better coverage higher speeds and
just better service overall from well
that's optimized for the network nice
yeah next question comes in from Alex
Mitchell I know people love the
headphone jack
oh sorry we already covered that one I'm
out of place Timothy do how will the
screen protector affect the in display
sensor ooh
it's unclear at this point I think I
think I should be fine imagine they took
that into account with the in screen
fingerprint sensor they're like that
sticker that you say it's gonna if your
fingerprint can get read through glasses
I'm pretty sure I can get read through
what completely supplies they haven't
confirmed it blue I suspect as this is
because some of its sister companies
have used technology they use optical
fingerprint sensors which basically
shines the light up a little bit and
actually reads the image of the
fingerprint so having an extra layer
doesn't really affect anything if it's
transparent so it shouldn't be an issue
nice yeah there you go although next up
from James ooby dooby doo thicker phone
does that mean a bigger battery uh I
don't think so it's still kind of
unclear I don't think he broached that
subject of battery life so we'll find
out hopefully means a bigger battery but
I think the way the way he made a
comment
the thickness was really attributed to
the the sensor hmm yeah I want more
battery - from Walid
why does oneplus have a similar knotch
design like the iPhone why not something
more innovative I'm calling it next why
indeed why indeed well it's because no
one's really figured out how to do a how
to embed a camera into the front of the
phone without you know that's getting
really hard I mean the only the one
we've seen is that weird prototype one
with the prototype that the pop-up
camera which always kind of freaked me
out because it fell like a part that
would break very easily oh yeah
accidentally like knock it into a wall
yeah yeah I think that the the thing
with the notches is that it's become
shorthand for premium yeah yeah you know
like kind of like an attractive design
as much as I don't like it it's just
kind of this is this is the next every
level - yeah Google's doing it you know
you did it already
Samsung is the only one that's been
resistant but if you look at it like the
the bezels of the top and bottom are
kind of like kind of look at you're like
yeah I kind of wish there was really
less okay I don't know the knotch thing
but you know it's yeah look you said
it's become shorthand for a premium
phone apple set the agenda or set the
the standard for what a premium phone
looks like and as usual a lot of
companies are sort of crowding in there
and I definitely feel like from from
what whether the person was mentioning
is it would be nice to see a little bit
more diversity as far as design is
concerned absolutely and we probably are
gonna get there I hope eventually we're
not gonna be stuck with the notch I
think for years and years and years that
would really surprise me but where
exactly we're gonna go after the knotch
I have no idea I think getting getting
the camera embedded behind the glass to
me so yeah really difficult and having
like a pop up camera I just feel like a
lot of people would be really
uncomfortable pop of camera to me is
sort of a temporary solution I think
getting the camera beneath the glass and
we have seen companies patent that kind
of technology I think Apple actually has
a pen for that
that doesn't mean they'll actually
implemented but that's sort of the
direction that I think it will have to
go to get just everything to be all
screen you're just holding a big screen
at that point yeah I mean like I feel
like that's Johnny Ives like ultimate
goal oh yeah and he's talked about that
a lot where it's just like a simple
sheet of glass and yeah apparently even
see through which III can't imagine how
you're supposed to make a battery see
through but maybe water processor yeah
all right like the wire yeah
do we have a tolerance level for the
kind of notch that we're seeing out
there I've been seeing terms like I drop
in water drop being tossed around I'm
not familiar with these design changes
cuz I have a phone is that essential one
way you don't like the thickness of the
knotch III that's what I assume this is
in reference to your style or design the
amount of occupation that the notch has
what do we think is like the cutoff
point or are we zero tolerance show I'm
young I have an iPhone 10 so I'm pretty
tolerant of my notch at this point it
kind of like fades in the background
yeah you can kind of like just I think
the essential I probably had best ride
that the little tiny notch at the I mean
it's a single camera though so you're
seeing companies put out multiple camera
systems obviously face IDs run by a
significantly more sophisticated
front-facing camera system so it needs
to be a little bit thick or wider and
I'm ok with that like if it means I
could do portrait mode selfies I'm cool
with the extra notch with yeah I mean
like you've had that phone for like a
year now yeah and it doesn't really seem
to bother you that much though yeah I if
I had a notch phone I'd probably like
not notice that after a while but oh
okay here's the freaky with my Luddite
lifestyle of headphone jack and how
knotch
so here's the thing with the with a lot
of these phones the the dimensions the
screen ratio are as far longer than a
normal video format so even when you're
watching a video on your iPhone or
Samsung phone there are black bars on
the left and right so usually the black
bars are where the notch is so it
doesn't really obscure your video
experience do we think that there is a
conspiracy out there to kill the
headphone jack and boost Bluetooth
technology yeah continuing on the
Bannack company that is in fact
benefiting from the wireless headphone
trend is bluetooth is that i'm not a
company not a company to technology
yeah well it's a standards body there's
like a group that meets like a group of
engineers that meets and agrees on
standards it's not a company it doesn't
really benefit I mean I guess it does
benefit from adoption from a kind of I
don't know for a mile yeah because who
sits on that level yeah yeah but yeah
it's more the companies are selling you
Bluetooth accessories are benefiting so
and there is probably some truth that I
mean look I think there are some
physical issues with headphone jacks
that that why I understand why they're
removed but I don't think there's like a
grand conspiracy I would be very
interested to find out if there was like
some sort of cabal that was meeting that
was like dead set on getting ready yeah
yeah and like the headphone jack folks
because the headphone jack has been
around for so long or all like very old
and crotchety and don't know what's
actually being done to them I
unfortunately it goes back to the same
thing with like Apple where Apple set a
standard and then everybody else yeah
followed suit so Apple was the first one
to do it and a lot of people complain
one indication that there isn't this
like cabal of you know headphone jack
haters is the way they've kind of the
way headphone jacks have been eliminated
like progressive looper fades it's like
Apple did first you know everyone kind
of crapped on them and then Google did
it like a year later and the Samsung
continues out the headphone jack and
they're crapping on everyone all these
other companies the had crapped on Apple
have now basically phased out their
headphone jacks as well so it's done
like if it was more coordinated I feel
like that that would be proof of
conspiracy but I don't know why I mean
like like I'm like offering a very
serious answer to this question and
really this is some good facts yes a
facts based show
hang on I'm digging for the Illuminati
graphic to try to bring up there we go I
you know let's just put a kibosh on it
the Bluetooth technology works perfectly
fine it's great I use it I give sleep
headphones at night so it's like a sleep
mask with speakers built-in so I can
fall asleep doing nature sounds
Nancy gale force winds by the way works
hold on all right
I feel like I've read that having like
an actual headphone jack like wired
headphones are supposed to like sound
better yes see that's where I'm getting
at though like with the headphones like
that the trade-off is I had several
wired ones before and I rolled over and
broke like seven of them so I finally
went Wireless there is plenty of
benefits to technology we're talking
about fidelity let's be honest most of
us are listening to lossy quality audio
and video compressed audio and video on
our phones it's just more convenient
that way it carries over 4G better for
those of us who are audio files or those
who are musicians like Carlos talking
about using them with its guitar and
drums and piano sounds and doing mixes
and masters and projects like that
live music myself included sometimes you
want that extra boost that's why I still
enjoy having the option in case I'm
actually using my phone as an interface
for something is it that frequent no
let's be honest but some of us still use
it but it is niche hmm there you go good
info yeah
switching gears over to 5g as we're
coming down in the last few minutes of
the show
are there any phones using 5g yet life
improvements asks I wonder what was
struggling the most that'll benefit from
5g I think we've talked about automated
cars a lot hmm yeah and then Bailey's
asking who controls 5g the 5g mobile yes
yes they sit across from the guys they
yeah they shared off the space because
it's Oh so I'll try to take all those
questions well in terms of there is like
the 3gpp Center there are there is like
an industry group of multiple companies
that get together and and kind of work
on a common standard the standard is
called
v GN r and r stands for new radio you
don't really need to know that all you
need to know is that that's what
everyone is sort of agree to what
Verizon has is a slightly different one
it's the five GTF I think technical
forum standard which is their own
proprietary thing leave it to Verizon
yeah yeah I know what were so they were
so many are there I need phones there
are no phones there are definitely no
five
motor phones that will be coming out
this year you're looking at probably
sometime in the first half maybe even
the first quarter of next year but it's
still kind of unclear I think Sprint and
LG have committed to being the first
here in the u.s. to have a smartphone
that runs on 5g but it's they're all
gonna come out fair and fairly short or
I think there's even some rumors that
Samsung's next flagship phone the Galaxy
has 10 or maybe the s10 plus we'll have
5g you have to imagine though that just
like in the early days of 4G these
phones might be a bit bulkier they might
the battery life might not be that great
the first I think the first generation
of 4G phones are really kind of terrible
in terms of the experience so Earth's G
of anything is kind of terrible exactly
so you have to imagine that that first
run 5g phones may not be so great
hmm running out of time what is the
current minimum wage in the US and will
Amazon customers feel any residual
effects from the raise that the
employees got else the current US
federal minimum wage is $7.25 that
hasn't been raised since 2009 Wow
whether customers are gonna feel any
residual impacts from this I feel like
that's probably unlikely it's such a big
company and Amazon already claims that
its full-time employees when you include
incentives and bonuses those full timers
already get $15 or more so are you gonna
see prices creep up yeah probably but
for other reasons you know like you know
not necessarily for this but for like
reasons of translation or tariffs yeah
we've got our yeah or just the fact that
like Amazon such a big retailer now that
it could raise prices because people use
it for convenience so if you do see
prices go up
I wouldn't immediately point to the
higher wages and claim that that's the
reason so it's it's like with a lot of
things it's probably got a lot of
factors attached to it and last but not
least from our buddy sir enjoy the in
screenreader was expected headphone jack
exclusion was not any scoop on the
improvement in charging since sister
brand Oppo upgraded to super V ooc
charging and I just want to go ahead and
put it out there we need to start
calling it Super Buu
going forward there is - charging I
don't think it's got the improvement
that you reference but I think we're
still gonna we'll find out Larry this
month when the phone actually launches
we've gotten like they fed us bits of
information with this interview but we
will get the full story
oh that few weeks thanks guys and thanks
to the audience as always for joining us
one more well wish to mr. a Peck we hope
to see you back in the chat soon
take care we'll be ready for you and
we'll see all old guys tomorrow from the
back same bat-time same bat-channel
