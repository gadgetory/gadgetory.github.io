BB GV we can't hear ya there's no audio
the only reason we heard you just now is
because you're very loud I'm alive oh
they're EVG V guys it's me its Alfred
it's Marian for the first time ever Mary
and Joe she's gonna be talking to us
about a deep dive she worked on for a
long time about voter data so send in
your questions and comments about that
we're also going to be talking about
Siri being a really kind of sad laggard
in smart home I wrote that story today
so check it out on SEANET and alfred
just wrote a story you see in sinner or
and super smash brothers okay alright
cancel his taunt and Petey Petey piranha
Peter prizes final smash
it's just piranha plant was the normal
character but piranha plant is gonna be
DLC for the new Super Smash Brothers
ultimate which comes out in December 7th
I didn't write about that though is
actually a date of privacy law data
privacy law data privacy bill a draft of
a data privacy bill Friday right Alfred
Panza
plans on interrupting me repeatedly
about Super Smash Brothers so that's
what the podcast is gonna be like today
so buckle up for that anyway let's get
to the podcast and we'll see you in four
minutes
okay are we rounding up now is that what
the show is all about I screw I don't
know what's happening we're that lazy
and inaccurate anyways alright stick
around see you back in the chat sending
questions and comments about today's
stories we'll see you back there in 3
minutes and 59 seconds from 3 to 1
welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox ribbon
I'm Alfred Inge and with us today
special guest in super speedy speed desk
reporter Mary and Joe hey guys how's it
going
starting off Apple this week held its
second product launch event in as many
months but didn't unveil any new smart
home devices and barely discussed its
home bad speaker guys do you think
there's still a chance for Apple to
really do anything there's always a
chance for Apple to do anything like
they can come out ten years late on
something and people will say that they
innovated a product it's yeah god you're
right but I'm so sad to know about that
that is true though I mean yeah I think
the big advantage that Apple always has
is that even though they're late to the
party they seem to always you know get
it right in a sense the more polished
product they're much more polished they
like kind of like they hit the pressure
points on like what people actually want
and that is not me saying this to say
that like apples are the best or
anything like that but it just seems
that like a lot of people do enjoy their
product for that very reason even though
they're late I wouldn't disagree with
you however the analysts that I spoke
with for the story that I wrote about
this today said that smart home is
rapidly becoming an ecosystem play and
if you're not in the Amazon ecosystem or
the Google ecosystem it's gonna be
really hard to transition over to
something else unless you're a really
big Apple fan I mean you could say the
same thing about Android though right
like how many yeah like Android is in a
lot of operation oh yeah but the point
is is that like apples doing pretty well
without that ecosystem for Android yeah
I guess that's true and we'll see if
Apple keeps things up and I'm still
waiting to find out if a home pod Mini
is gonna come out Mary and are you
expecting a home pod mini or not I mean
only if it's rose gold then I'll
consider it
okay good idea next it's not just
Facebook and Google and Amazon who know
everything about you it's also
politicians lucky you Marian today wrote
a deep dive piece about the subject
ahead of next week's midterms so Marian
what type of info might people be a
little surprised to find
these folks know about them well
apparently everything because when you
fill out the form to vote you have your
date of birth name home address and
voting history and race gender depends
on where you live they can access that
information about you from the state's
office I know so they get a lot of data
from consumer data which means you know
where you shop how many kids you have
how you work you know like you also
mentioned in your story property
ownership marital status wealth and
income magazine subscriptions club
ownership exactly just to get a sense of
who you might vote for and how they can
get you to vote for this so I noticed
some of these in your story some of
these data brokers make inferences on
you know the type of voter that you
would be based on the apps that you have
on your phone so if you have an app like
say CNET they might think that you're
very informed intellectual absolutely
genius brain level person but then they
also mentioned you know if you have an
app like candy crush on it
what kind of inferences are they making
based off people that like to play
puzzle based games on their phone well
from what my source told me if you have
just games on your phone they'll assume
that you're not very educated and if you
guys to be like brokers also aren't very
cool and and if you are data brokers
listening to this I don't like you at
all okay we have one more story to get
to last Senator Ron Wyden introduced a
new bill this morning I believe called
the consumer data Protection Act which
would impose harsher penalties for
companies who violate your privacy
alfred you wrote about this tell us a
little bit it's important to note that
this is still a draft so this hasn't
made it on the floor or anything like
that no senators have offered their
input on it but this is actually one of
the first data privacy bills that is has
been introduced at least in any way
shape or form a lot of other lawmakers
have been talking about wanting to draft
their own but this is the first one
that's really come to light and you know
there's been a big push for this for a
long time coming after Equifax is breech
and Facebook
you know issues with Google and privacy
and what are the harshest things that
they're doing here is that they're
saying if you do they're bringing
criminal charges to
breaches in the past all you could
really do is sue them in a class-action
lawsuit or the FTC could find them so in
this scenario a company CEO for example
if they purposely lied to the FTC they
could spend prison time for up to 20
years which is oh yeah this is pretty
big so how similar is this to the gdpr
in the EU only in financial terms not in
criminal charges terms because the gdpr
doesn't bring like you won't go to jail
over that like this is interesting so in
some ways it could actually be more in
Sahara yeah okay also check back on CNET
to read more about these stories as well
as follow us today about the Google
walkout that's going on I think right
now I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Alfred I know
Mary and Joe thanks for listening
all right thanks everybody for joining
us for the recording of the audio
podcast you can check out the links to
subscribe to that in the description
below as well as get on board with pub G
Mobile who is our sponsor this week
which is pretty cool that's a fun game
I'm not good at it but it's fun I'm not
good at mostly you also paid to say that
all this we are paying
that's how sponsorships work and
downloading that game will result in
data brokers thinking that we're not
very adjective we're not very educated
which I guess might that's a terrible
assumption of me but I'm I'm very
frustrated about that because I have a
lot of games downloaded on hey to avoid
that I'm tracking you maybe you should
oh speaking of which that's one of the
questions I wanted to ask you is there
anything people can do to restrict this
type of thing from happening like for
instance if you're a Facebook user you
can remove some of your information like
your hometown or your employer whatever
is there a corollary to that for data
brokers or you know politicians too like
hopefully no just a little bit less
about you actually it's not that it's
not really possible because he shop
online you wouldn't give up that
delivery at the door and then you
definitely need link and then you need
all this online stuff to you know to
come back to the world so so arguably
you would have to not shop online you
would buy everything in or dine in cash
you would have to go dark and then you
would be able to restrict some of the
information you they know about you we
have a privacy yeah so that again is a
draft so there's it's not set in stone
or anything like that but a part of the
draft would create this kind of central
do-not-track website like in the same
way that you have that for your phone
number or like do not call this kind of
things so it would be like it do not
track website that you can go on there
and see all the websites that you are
being tracked on and just do it all like
there because right now the only way
that you can really do that if a website
even allows you to opt out is like you
go to each individual website so like
I'd have to go to Facebook then Google
then Twitter then seen it then
ah geez and from a consumer perspective
I am digging this bill so we'll see if
it actually gets any movement whatsoever
mm hmm all right it's time to take some
questions starting right out with the
whole smart home story we had about Siri
and other voice assistants Hugh yeag
says Siri has already been lapped by
Alexa and Google Timothy do follows up
with which is worths Siri or Bigsby yeah
sorry to say that there are actually
voice assistants that are doing worse
than Siri as hard as as hard as it can
be to believe yeah Bigsby is well behind
the curve even in Apple terms and so is
Cortana Cortana I would argue
basically like throw up the the white
flag when they decided to pair up with
Alexa that's not true all right they're
friends yeah exactly
we're not things were partner that's
that's exactly what happened but the one
thing that could be interesting about
both Apple and Samsung is is that these
are giant companies they're not startups
and they're both just kind of getting
started in smart homes so there is a
possibility that they are gonna be
making more waves but yeah I won't son
doesn't even have their smart speaker
out yet yeah I will say this though
Samsung does have an advantage over here
over Apple with its voice assistant only
because they're not just trying to put
it on your phone or a speaker like what
Apple is doing with the home pod and
like Siri like they're trying to put it
in their fridges like Samsung has all
their smaller plants and worse they're
putting their TV they're putting like TV
remotes and all that washing machines
like you're supposed to have Bigsby true
however I have a samsung phone I use
Bigsby because I write a lot about voice
assistance Bigsby is pretty bad yes like
I try to just say my wife using Big D
every day I feel like it gets worse it
somehow doesn't recognize yeah the like
the same thing that I tell ya every time
just saying that Samsung has that
advantage that it is more of an
electronics company than Apple is or it
has yeah builds more stuff yes yeah cool
hello
all right next question coming in from
oh let's take one from Priority One
haven't heard from you in a while well I
was asking the guys and gals at our home
automation on reddit saying that the
home kit is very hard to pro
gram has anyone had an experience here
with the home kit I personally have not
I don't use home kit I have is Google
home I have I have a Google home in my
house just one of them and I also have a
bunch of echo products I have the echo
show the echo spied a bunch of echo
speakers but yeah I don't generally use
home kid so unfortunately I don't know
much about that one but yeah shout out
to the home automation folks at read it
what say yeah you did her name a there
right I did huh hence the shout out got
some fans now I guess so good job burger
Larry a next question from Timothy do
what is the next step for Siri and the
smart home what features need to be
there in order to set them apart from
the others now I just want to contrast
that against Ryan's recent comic that
says remember and Siri was an synonymous
with voice assistant boy did they fall
behind fast like how are they going to
play catch-up at this point they're
basically AOL the the rumor has been and
I think it's more wishful thinking than
a rumor at this point is that they would
come out with a home pod mini which
would be like the smaller version of the
home pod which knowing Apple it's going
to be at least a hundred dollars if not
a hundred and fifty dollars but it'll be
a smaller version and if you have the
money to spend on something like that
you would be able to put it in a lot
more rooms in your house as opposed to
what they have now which is no just
three hundred fifty dollars just make
the air pods home pod that's a tiny yeah
and then you would walk around your
house with them and yeah listen to your
you know I don't know whoever else yeah
or yeah I wouldn't listen anybody yeah
so I mean so the battery life on the air
pods kind of suck though air pods are
perfect is everywhere no I mean
batteries specifically oh yes okay so
the home pod mini is one idea the other
one would be that they would create a
smart display similar to the home hub or
the Lenovo smart display or the JBL link
view the problem is is that Apple
doesn't really do a lot of like new
product developments they really wait
for things to develop alfred was talking
about this earlier that they wait for
markets to develop and then they kind of
swooped swooped in and out
an opportunistic moment yeah remember
maybe they'll do that remember when
Apple invented the smartphone the tablet
that you could also smart on and this is
yeah they invented a lot of products so
maybe they will continue to invent with
like a smart display in 2025 but at this
point there aren't even really rumors
about this stuff coming out so if you're
like holding your breath for an Apple
product for your smart home you will die
anyway yeah those are good questions
definitely very good questions about
that very good questions closing
thoughts before we move on to the next
topic
Huey yang wouldn't it be better for
Apple to partner with Amazon or Google
that wouldn't happen yeah I really don't
think that would happen seems very
unlikely I mean the thought process
there Hughey is solid like you you're
not off base conceptually and from like
from a consumer perspective yeah but
from a business perspective I think
because Apple likes money that they
would not do that because they want to
make the most money out of everybody so
that they can I don't know what you do
with money but they just like it a lot
yeah they like money so much that
they're sitting on nearly a quarter
trillion dollars in cash and cash
alternative so they want to put more
money in that money pile yeah I'm not
really sure why though yes but the point
is is that they would not partner with
Google or Amazon because they don't want
them to have that money right that's
that's the way the world works playing
it like I'm five that's what we're here
for
hey Marion uh-huh nice to have you on
the show finally I know I haven't worked
with you since we were talking about
eSports a couple months ago huh yeah
topic so let's let's talk a little bit
about something maybe a little more
pressing at the time with the midterm
elections coming up literally right
around the corner you've been you've
been quiet let's talk to you for a
little while I've got your map open here
tell me tell me what you want to talk
about in regards to the to the voter
right so on the map we made an
interactive map that if you move your
mouse around you can see in your state
how much is that your voter data sold
for and
was like type of informations included
and what are the limitations if you go
to like dark orange color you can see
that Ohio let's say they don't have any
limitations on your voter data that
means anyone can go online and download
your name and home address and use it
however they want to
looks like Ohio's the darkest stayed on
here right because I literally went on
their website and downloaded what yeah
like some states even just email me oh
here you go
like there's every voter in our state
some of them they charge per voter
though is that right or they charge just
to get access to the data well usually
it's like a statewide a voter list that
you can buy so that's like an excel
sheet or something like that and you pay
what's like the maximum that you usually
pay for those max mom I believe is more
than okay yeah but the some states give
it to you for free fewer politicians so
every state has different law we don't
have a federal bill that protects that
that's bonkers just look at some of this
I'm glad you made this for anybody who's
curious about your state if you are a
u.s. resident and we have a lot of
international listeners go ahead the
links in the description right now check
that map out it's kind of daunting and
horrifying to an extent alright moving
on let's talk more about some of these
data breaches Timothy do I like this is
there a plain English version of these
long long long versions of the User
Agreement laws there is not you're
talking about like as privacy policy
stuff like when you sign up for
something or that yeah that's what if
he's interested there there is not there
have been lawmakers that have called out
Congress
I mean called out tech companies for
this if you remember during one of the
Mark Zuckerberg during the Mark
Zuckerberg hearing one of the Senators
basically told them you know I feel like
I'm reading Swahili when I'm looking at
this which was also controversial after
the fact but the there's been other
people basically saying you know your
privacy policy is
crap and basically you reads it yeah
nobody reads that so you can't use that
as a defense and you know there have
been some frameworks of data privacy
bills that basically say that you know
you need a plain English version of your
privacy policy which by the way they are
also called for I think that they did a
bit they did a bill
what is this dodd-frank I believe did a
bill related to banks and credit card
issuers where it was more plain English
descriptions because it was it was way
too confusing for people and it was
related to their money where it was like
we're gonna give you 0% APR for the
first three months and then after that
it's gonna like we're gonna jack it up
to like 20% or something like that
so I if I remember correctly it was
dodd-frank said you have to explain to
people and plain English very clearly
whether this is actually costing them so
I yeah I for consumers that would be
great if you did something similar I
know that Twitter told Congress members
that they were working on revamping
their privacy policy and having it more
visual if like pictures that actually
tell you what you're like what kind of
data or you're in effect it I mean like
make fun of you want but like it would
be a lot more helpful in a private
privacy policy I wish everything I
signed had a little coloring book on the
side of it but this privacy bill draft
though from senator Wyden does not
introduce anything like that so his bill
draft is a lot more about giving the FTC
the ability to prosecute tech companies
not so much like what a tech company
should be doing for privacy stuff I'm
sure these tech companies would be super
on board with this going in jail yeah we
love this idea that we could potentially
go
all right swinging the pendulum back
before we call this show a day or day a
show what the hell my trying to say
let's talk a little bit more about
election data or voter data rather
Timothy dude did you get any pushback
when you're making these requests for
the data Marian yes I called almost all
the states and trust me I waited a long
time and called them a couple of times
yeah so definitely got some
watch back you know when I try to talk
to them but luckily we got a story and
please give it a read so it's definitely
an ongoing issue as well so definitely
contact us if you have any thoughts
oh that's what you were concerned about
here's another really good one from
priority one if I do a mail-in ballot
does this still take place yes do you
have to put your name and home address
when you register as a voter so
essentially even if you're not doing
anything digitally you're still like
there they're compiling your data into
their own database and it's their
database that they're it you can access
right everyone has to give their some
sort of information when they'd register
so that's correct
and data brokers are also used by
advertisers in general it's just
politicians when they're trying to get
elected function the same way as
advertisers and that's why they're using
data brokers the same way and a lot of
data brokers that as so like data to
politician those who work with business
so that's also concerning as well yeah
there there was an app called vote with
me that a lot of people in the privacy
circle have been talking about recently
which takes advantage of how public that
data is it's supposed to look through
your contacts for their voting history
which is public records and it tells you
like all your friends in your contacts
like if it's basically if they voted
should have been friends with if they if
they like register to vote and they use
their phone number that you have like
this app can like look that up and it's
incredibly creepy the whole point of it
is to tell your friends like hey get out
and vote I know you haven't like voted
recently but like that's really weird
and maybe you should so it's it's the
voting history as in which elections
they voted in not who they vote or
status which party they're registered
with and whether or not they voted in
the most recent elections but it does
tell you if you're right so I'm looking
at a screenshot of the app right now it
says like show me friends who are
Democrats Republicans and/or all and can
vote in a tight election and it acts as
your contacts for that so super cool
definitely intrude on your friends
privacy to get them to vote that's a
really cool thing to do definitely very
chill person and you know what just one
more thing
companies like i360 has an app for
campaign volunteers from knock on your
door and before they do that they know
that you live there who live there with
you and what your political leanings are
yeah somebody stop by my house and was
lately yes they were like are you
Benjamin I'm like nobody calls me that
but this is gonna go well I'm Ben Fox
not Ben Fox Ruben they're like well
you're gonna vote for this guy I'm like
are you my Amazon delivery person no get
off my property
Jesus all right here's a good tough one
to kind of close out the show from the -
do you think we'll see something like
the gdpr come to the US yeah yeah yeah
that's happening yes yeah there's a
pushing tell of your series yeah because
tech companies are even pushing for it
here's the thing like so there's been
like multiple hearings on this now like
Facebook has said that they're open to
it Apple with Tim Cook last week who
made that massive speech about calling
for a federal privacy bill in the US
Google is on board for it Amazon is on
board for it Twitter's on board for it
AT&amp;amp;T is on board for charter community
like every major tech company wants this
in the US but here's the thing they want
to be able to influence it right they
want it to be they they want to write
this law so that it like favors them the
most of course because they really
didn't have a hand in writing up gdpr
and they're furious about that where
they basically like you know they've
complained about gdpr a lot like in
these hearings they talk about how
they've spent millions of dollars of
resources into making sure that they're
compliant for gdpr so what they're
trying to do now is basically have
control of this federal bill so if
you're seeing all these tech companies
saying like yeah we welcome a federal
privacy law like gdpr in the US
that's true but they won't want wanted
on their terms
so there are privacy advocates that are
going out there and you know basically
trying to say yeah yeah don't like fall
for this don't like really make the
argument they're making this argument
that like just because they're into it
doesn't mean that it's good for you it'd
be as if like tobacco like big tobacco
come
he's like we're like hoping one idea
regularly yeah yeah which does also
happen so let's started positive but
then ended super dark so thank you very
much for that that's what I do okay we
have to wrap it up here's here's a
thought for everyone to bake life
improvement says I'm gonna start a
subscription service company three bucks
a month and you get a tldr version of
all your terms and conditions life
improvement if you pull this off
let's if you start a Kickstarter for
this I'm in dude I am so in I like this
idea well done if you can make it happen
we'll plug it all right we are finished
for the week thank you again to pub G
mobile for the sponsorship we'll be back
on Monday with regularly scheduled
program until then have a good weekend
