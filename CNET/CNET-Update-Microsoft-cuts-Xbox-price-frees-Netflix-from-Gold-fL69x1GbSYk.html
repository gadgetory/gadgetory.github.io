wait before buying a new game system I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your CNET
update Microsoft is making some bold
changes to the Xbox system that has many
fans saying it's about time you no
longer have to pay for an Xbox Live Gold
subscription to have the ability to
stream video from apps like Netflix Hulu
Plus YouTube and HBO GO you also don't
need to pay the live 60 dollar yearly
fee if you just want to use Internet
Explorer or Skype the Xbox was the only
home entertainment system that blocked
apps behind its own additional pay wall
and on June 9th Microsoft will sell a
cheaper $400 version of the Xbox one
that does not include the Kinect motion
sensing camera accessory that means the
Xbox one now costs the same as the
PlayStation 4 and speaking of saving
money Motorola has a new cheap Android
smartphone it's called the Moto e and it
costs only 130 dollars and that's
without any carrier contract normally if
you want a good phone you have to pay
$600 or more off contract but Motorola
is trying to change that with new budget
price smartphones even at that price the
Moto e still has a good battery it's got
a customizable back cover a gorilla
glass touchscreen display and it's got
the same design and feel as its higher
priced motorola siblings but there are
trade-offs for one there's no
front-facing camera sorry selfie lovers
the Moto e is just a bit cheaper than
the Moto G which is 180 dollars the G
came out in November and it's already
the best-selling smartphone in
Motorola's history because of that low
price let's switch gears to talk about
search engines we all have googled
ourselves to see what comes up when we
search our names and if anything
embarrassing or awkward pops up well
there's not much you can do about it
but what if you could just call up
Google to have the embarrassing links
about you removed from search results
and that's exactly what people may be
able to do soon across Europe the top
european court has made a ruling stating
that citizens have a
right to be forgotten and that means
they can ask Google to delete search
results that might infringe upon their
privacy this is great news if you were
once tried and then acquitted of a crime
yet the outdated news of your arrest
haunted you on Google however what if
this goes too far into censorship what
if news stories just start to vanish
from search results because powerful
people don't like bad news about
themselves it's a battle between the
freedom of information and privacy
rights Google says it's taking time to
analyze the implications of this ruling
that's your tech news update you can
