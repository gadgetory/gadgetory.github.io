with CNET and this is a look at the
Canon PowerShot ELPH 100 HS but with so
many point-and-shoots released
throughout the year some fall through
the cracks especially at the low end and
that's the case here the 100 HS was
released in the first half of 2011 and
it's notable because it was canons first
sub $200 elf with its new high
sensitivity system with a 12 megapixel
backside illuminated CMOS sensor now it
also has a 3-inch LCD on back and a 4x F
2 8 v 9 28 millimeter wide angle lens
and it shoots Full HD video at the press
of a button its photo quality is very
good for the money
subjects look noticeably softer from ISO
200 and above but colours are excellent
and in general the results both indoors
and out are better than you'll get from
the average smartphone which is really
what this class of camera is competing
against these days plus you get a bunch
of canons creative shooting options such
as toy camera or miniature effect and
it'll even create small high-speed
movies for slow-motion
a shooting performance is decent for its
class my main issue is that its
autofocus can be slow and inaccurate but
if you're not afraid to leave Auto you
can get better performance from it again
for the money it's a very good pocket
camera and since it's a little older now
you can find it for a little more than
$100 which is an outstanding deal I'm
Josh Goldman and that's the Canon ELPH
100 a chest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
