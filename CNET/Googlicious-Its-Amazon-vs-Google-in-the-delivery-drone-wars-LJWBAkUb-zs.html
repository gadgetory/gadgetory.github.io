Google licious it's all the Google that
we can pack into a show each week so
let's get to it and the past week has
been dominated by holiday sales and
Cyber Monday but one of the coolest
stories that surfaced was Amazon's big
reveal on 60 minutes that they've been
testing octocopter package delivery
drones that might someday get it
packaged to you within 30 minutes
now before you skeptics attack the idea
it's a concept amazon's testing that
still requires Federal Aviation
Administration approval and is something
that could happen in the next let's say
four to five years so what does this
have to do with Google well Google has
also been working on a local delivery
service of their own called Google
Shopping Express that's being tested in
the Bay Area with same-day delivery from
retailers like Target staples and Toys R
Us now in the long run Google plans to
use their own self-driving cars for
delivery and flying drones have also
been discussed as a means of delivery as
well
now all these ideas are being fleshed
out of their Google X lab which is their
secret facility that works on future
technologies or big ideas like Google
glass and their driverless car that are
the offspring of the Google X project so
put all these things together and it
looks like Amazon and Google will be
directly competing with each other in
the retail drone delivery wars and also
a Jeff Bezos that laughs I don't like
that okay I've heard it enough
all right Amazon's also getting a little
boost in the press for their Kindle Fire
HDX 7-inch tablet after display mate a
company that specializes in display
testing and calibration gave top marks
to the Kindle HDX 7 calling it's display
almost magical with the Nexus 7 taking
second and the retina iPad Mini taking a
distant third now the Kindle Fire HDX 7
was applauded for being the first tablet
to use quantum dots technology it
produces highly saturated primary colors
for LCDs similar to those produced by a
LED displays that increase the color
gamut to 100% and improves power
efficiency at the same time now this
playmate says the tech will
revolutionize LCDs for the next five
plus years and Amazon takes a page from
its competitors going directly after
Apple with its latest ad pitting the
Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 against the iPad air
and even mocks Johnny I've take a look
this new iPad air is astonishingly light
the new Kindle Fire is actually 20%
lighter
yes but the iPad is only $4.99 the
Kindle is only 379 I see oh snap now I
don't know if you guys been paying
attention lately but Amazon is
positioning itself as the next great
tech company with its hardware offerings
content ecosystem and its biggest
differentiator price also talking about
prices cyber monday has always been the
biggest online shopping day but it
didn't come without its casualties
Motorola was offering 150 bucks off the
Moto X including developer editions and
unlocked models the problem their site
was down for pretty much the entire day
hashtag now in some quick software
update news KitKat and since 5.5 is now
being rolled out to developers and
unlocked versions of the HTC One in the
US and AT&amp;amp;T is officially bringing the
Android 4.3 update for the Galaxy s4
it's big at around 727 Meg's so you'll
need to be on Wi-Fi for that and they've
also released a galaxy gear update to
allow complete compatibility with the s4
and let's stick with Samsung right now
there's always rumors swirling around
the Korean giant leaked pictures
surfacing from France point to a metal
chassis which is not normal for Samsung
and could either be for the Galaxy s5 a
rumored Galaxy F series but also shows
Samsung possibly moving the headphone
jack to the bottom now rumors have also
persisted that will see the s4 successor
in February or March of 2014 and it's
also rumored to be offered in possibly
two versions one boasting a flexible
display with the metal casing and the
other being a more traditional version
with a plastic body and non flexible
screen and ET news is reporting that the
next-gen Samsung Galaxy gear to watch
will also be launched at the same time
with the s5 in early 2014 which makes
sense and I
actually seen real concepts of the
next-gen watch but if I told you you
would probably never see me again and
some of you might like that all right
now how about some real factual Samsung
news Sammy is rolling out new Merlot red
rose gold white and rose gold black
colors for the Galaxy Note 3 line so
feast your eyes on them they really
don't make phone colors like they used
to and now I know what rose gold looks
like alright that's gonna do it for this
week's show email us at Google issues at
cnn.com or you guys can tweet me at
Brian Tong and I'll respond to you when
I can
thanks so much for watching i'm brian
tong and we'll see you next time for
some more of that google issues</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
