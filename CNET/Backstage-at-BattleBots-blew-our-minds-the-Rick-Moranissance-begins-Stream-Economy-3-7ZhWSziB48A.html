Esqueda and your team is money this is
why we look at the news across movies TV
and video games and tell you whether to
buy or sell your fan investment in your
favorite franchises speaking of favorite
franchises billing Twitter back the
official title of the third installment
in the franchise is going to be Bill and
Ted face the music and Keanu Reeves and
Alex winter are confirmed to reprise
their roles as Theodore Ted Logan and
bill S Preston Esquire here's the
synopsis once prophesized to save the
universe with their rock and roll middle
age and the responsibilities of family
have caught up with these two best
friends who have not yet fulfilled their
destiny they've written thousands of
tunes but they have yet to write a good
one much less the greatest song ever
written
with the fabric of time and space
tearing around them a visitor from the
future warns our heroes that only their
song could save life as we know it
everything sounds pretty great but the
question is will this movie be any good
and no one can answer that I'm sorry
what are you doing here what is the
meaning of this trying to shoot a show
here the movie it's it's good it's
really good wow really
yeah it's awesome hey two minutes are
you super cool future Ashley or you evil
robot me lying and telling me the movies
good when it's really heinous once you
get your own time-traveling telephone
booth
that was rude random weird you know what
else was random and weird Rick Moranis
showed up on a sitcom this week
that's right mostly retired comedic
legend Rick Moranis showed up on the
Goldbergs earlier this week reprising
his role as Lord dark helmet from
Spaceballs one of everybody's favorite
outerspace movies well the plot of the
episode is actually really cool so Adam
Goldberg sees Spaceballs and then
decides he's going to start a Mel Brooks
Club now I won't spoil Rick's appearance
or what happens in his cameo but it is
worth your time you should check it out
cuz it's pretty cute anyway the
Goldbergs is a great show and you should
be watching it a hundred percent but
what we need to talk about here is Rick
Moranis because I am ready friends for a
Moranis anse and if we're gonna do that
Rick Moranis is going to need some
prestige television and CEO of Hollywood
if you are watching do we have some
ideas for you
first of all Fargo town full of weirdos
the characters here are creepos and at
the end of the day guess who plays a
good Creepo Rick Moranis yeah that's
right secondly uh another town full of
weirdos Twin Peaks we can obviously have
my favorite weirdo Rick Moranis show up
on that show if we do another second
revival and of course Rick Moranis left
acting to be a good dad to his kids do
you know another show needs good dad's
big little lies which is why Rick
Moranis should definitely star in season
3 they have a season 3 but at the end of
the day I think we can all agree that we
need to buy Rick Moranis because he is a
legend we miss you buddy you guys out
there go out there watch all the
classics get your Honey I Shrunk the
Kids you got to get your Ghostbusters
one and two and of course you've got to
watch Spaceballs Rick Moranis you're the
best all right guys we got to move on
from TV to video games a Nintendo switch
online has more information we already
know a lot about switch online it works
very similar to PlayStation Plus or Xbox
Live you get online play you get special
deals if you're a subscriber but there
are a couple of differences for starters
it's a lot cheaper than its competitors
at just 20 dollars a year if you pay
upfront there are 20
loaded NES games that you'll get access
to if you're a subscriber and finally
finally we'll have access to cloud saves
which those other two have but the
switch has not had it which has made me
very scared for my Legend of Zelda
breath of the wild file which has over
200 hours of core exceed hunting on it
there is one feature that Nintendo said
would not be part of switch online that
gamers are very upset about and that is
Virtual Console a lot of gamers are
saying where is my virtual console
Nintendo and you might think that I am
going to say sell uh Nintendo switch
online but you know what no no I'm gonna
say sell on you viewers who are angry
about Virtual Console you're the sell
your the sell you know why because
nobody cares you're gonna play your NES
game for a day or two you're gonna feel
fine and be happy to get you a little
nostalgia get your little nostalgia
sandwich or whatever and then you're
gonna be back to the new stuff that is
what you're going to do just like every
other gamer it's just this whole
backwards-compatibility stuff drives me
crazy because at the end of the day just
play new stuff and let Nintendo develop
weird cool things for us to use like
Nintendo labo for example which is a
whimsical cardboard set that kids can
put together and jumpstart their little
imaginations and you know who bought a
Nintendo Lavo Mark sterols he bought it
for his kids and he had a lot of really
nice things to say about it Wabble
Wabble
that's the law bobble look at this
beautiful Nintendo magic Ken's weird
bike box gets bent a fish you know you
make stuff at a cardboard you throw on
it you put on there sprinkles I guess
I'm one of your like my old childhood so
our beautiful kids it's gonna be our oh
man kind of mean online that's not a
week make down these people love kids
didn't even have kids I don't see kids
when I'm warm your life Bible new life
naw man well I was then I spent like
pornos holding keys well this wine
just to I mean I mean provolone man
being all these keys so I can make a
keyboard and then this goes blink blink
point point and then there's my wee boy
he's like daddy can you know go faster
how long is it gonna take
I'm like we mined five minutes ago I was
waiting us in the bog
I know you're telling me I need to in
you know I mean speed up with the keys
are you gonna do it
can you there you can t who might get
him s and then father we want his - he
was just stop my boot because he's only
turning in like five minutes later after
I built the keyboard they just wrapped
it in - gonna go dealer calling order
pop the keys when I spend our deep time
I make them and then I was waiting that
guy's else and then he's like where's my
keyboard this all bro
that's the LIBOR LIBOR nah man nah boys
rubbish man ah no thanks sorry
we're here at an undisclosed location in
Southern California and we are checking
out behind the scenes for BattleBots
yes it's all the robot fighting you've
ever wanted and it's gonna be coming to
Discovery Science in May unlike old
previous seasons this is gonna be
probably ten times more exciting that we
can guarantee excitement in every single
episode every bot needs a crack team of
builders and they're all here in the pit
this is backstage this is where every
team fixes their boss before and after a
match and gets them ready to shred what
is the one thing that fans don't
necessarily get to see that you wish
they knew about being a builder in
BattleBots there's a great deal of
skills you learn and you pick up along
the way it's an amazing amount of stuff
you learn every time everything to show
there's a tremendous amount of
camaraderie in the bits so we're all
friends sort of at home in the shop in
the arena we're trying to destroy each
other so we're constantly borrowing
parts even if they're very expensive
doing favors for each other they're all
sort of in it together we all like
building things we're helping fill their
out how much work actually goes into
making the bots and how quickly the
turnaround time is for these guys in
order to get their BOTS prepped for the
next match I mean a lot of these bots
literally get destroyed and they have to
do complete rebuilds and it is on such a
short time schedule for them what is the
worst thing you have said to your robot
usually some string profanity often just
banging into a corner in the side so I'm
sorry I swear I get hurt sometimes that
sort of thing okay yeah the day is over
the fights are done some of the robots
will live to fight another day while
others aren't as lucky but one thing's
for certain these builders have worked
incredibly hard to get here and that in
itself is a victory you can check out
battle bots this May on discovery
science
you know I love me some fighting robots
thanks so much to our friends at
Discovery for letting us come to the set
check things out and otherwise have a
great time watching robots beat the hell
