thin oh you don't need a TV thin no
speaking of which ah here we go ah if I
to give it foot again show TVs but here
everyone that's got 3 30 days it's right
there getting all right ok now now tile
you'll be very familiar with it so this
is uh this is at the LG stand they have
one of 20 leads look at that organic
light-emitting diodes shown at the show
as we've worked out today this is using
a white OLED so it's essentially a
screen which is just a whole bunch of
white pixels which uses a color overlay
with the whole whatever it is six
million pixels all over the screen so
essentially it's a white TV you put a
couple of filters over bits of glad wrap
or whatever do you have glad wrap in
America yeah it's called glad wrap yes
oh if it's made by glad yes the Medusa
ran why Uncle Sam Uncle Sam wrap so
essentially so it's it's a big TV with
lots of little light emitting diodes in
it that organic made of some sort of
liquid stuff and they pump a signal
through it and that's what you get a
really thin TV with really really
excellent black levels and it's so thin
that you can't even plug an hdmi cable
into it well that's the thing it's got a
separate cable box that connects by
proprietary cable not even a hdmi cable
so we're looking forward to looking at
those are coming in September of this
year on my guess is that they're going
to be around the seven thousand dollar
mark so when Sony came out with theirs
which was an 11 inch back who doesn't it
I remember believe was about three
thousand dollars mhm so you're looking
at about five times the screen real
estate so you're looking at probably
only half or twice the price because I
guess it's coming from Korea not the
Japanese made sony sauce doesn't have to
price premium it involved but if you
think about it even at seven or eight
thousand dollars that's what the very
first plasma consumer plasma TVs were
back in like you know almost ten years
ago when people were like wow I cannot
believe this 42 inch 420p ed
TV is only seven thousand dollars I need
to get 1 2002 is going to rock and then
the prices came down and the resolutions
went up my first plasma was with was a
420 because it was like 2004 yeah and
that's what you could get for well i
think when i bought a 2,500 bucks my
first plasma my first plasma my first
like my little memo do his podcast 42
inch it was also it was five thousand I
think and what was the resolution so
mine was 1080i okay okay how was it a
high tachi it was yeah I touching my
1080i plasmas and I don't understand how
that works you have 1080 lines but it's
only int'l i sire and it didn't accept
1080p signal no it's a very strange
strange and it also had a breakout box
that connected via a proprietary cable
so yeah I don't know you don't know how
what I don't know how that was really
good story the end well I I started with
the 420 yeah when I went to 720p those
broke down and now i have the 1080 look
out if now that's new thing i mean
there's a lot of buzz this year about
the types of technologies that were
involved i'll it's anything but there
was talk of 4k and even 8k aj so you
think the 1080 eyes were you know the
bee's knees are not look forward to 4000
pixels by two thousand pixels coming
next year and they're looking at blu-ray
recorders that one so blu-ray players
will actually play the new spider-man
movie in 4k on you know it's ever been
shot in 4k no that's no one's one thing
maybe but spider-man sponge impossible
and I the facebook movie what was that
cold brilliant social occasional because
their shot on like super HD digital and
so they've got that red camera okay
right that's full k but you can never go
back and find old material and
re-release it in that 4k format not that
the human eye can discern that from
living room distances they're not going
to go back like old black and white TV
shows they put out on DVD and now even
blu-ray ridiculously there's never going
to be a 4k seinfeld box that has an egg
drop them with 3d it has a shop to move
blu-ray for a lot of this old material
also is for
kate is basically for your ray bradbury
felt like wallscreen that's just right
have your top to bottom eight 80-foot I
don't know because where else he can
appreciate that was going to be
emotional more mad for like movie
theaters and stuff yeah i mean that's
exactly if you're going to have a
gigantic screen if you're going to have
a 60 inch screen I don't see where 4k
makes it like you say a difference in
naked eye for connects you hear that
thing to cover your entire bedroom wall
like tight yeah don't you know this when
you go to a movie theater and they have
digital projection of a digital signal
what is the resolution on that that is
definitely a 4k screen okay so they're
already already out there in the
professional world absolutely what
you're looking at is the sony usually
it's a sony camera out in the cinemas
and what they do to give you 3d
passively is they have the revolution
resolution to 1080p so you're actually
so you're not seeing interlacing all
right sort of thing but I mean it is a
huge screen so you could see artifacts
if you're really looking for them so
what they're looking to do is bring that
technology into the home what we're
going to see this here is an 84 inch LG
screen probably around September time
and coming in two weeks or less is going
to be a toshiba I think it's a 70 inch
it's 3d passu sorry it's not even
passive it's auto stereoscopic which
means it's glasses okay I saw you know
what that is one technology that is not
ready for prime time I looked at all i
love 3d I like I left 33 d scott and i
have done a lot of work on the laptop
side with both with active and I am
glasses free all right there sometimes
and I've hated it other it's not ready
for prime time I look at all the stuff I
even stood on the axe at CES were you
supposed to stand right in front of it
does not work what do you think it's
just really hard to look at I don't know
if you remember those magic eye pictures
of years it's like trying to watch one
of those for 90 minutes at a time
imagine trash it's a pirate ship don't
you see it a part of sin and then it
pops out that toshiba one it depending
on where you looked may be in the center
of the screen sometimes it looks
amazingly clear and then instantly on
the edges it doesn't look clear and then
you're out of it and then it pops in
again and yeah had movement across the
screen doesn't work well with those I
tell you you're doing an awesome job
with this camera sky thank you i pressed
another button i don't know
it did but yeah everything looks like
all right I have a very important oh we
actually know I have I have one more
show off actually Scott we'll get you
out first now this is something a little
bit different it's not in any of our
categories but I thought it was clever
enough to show off and capture but I'm
not sure anyone would ever actually buy
and use one and that is the that is the
I'll do it hmm so our tune cartoon is
materialized thank you for describing
that I don't know a button type rest but
there we go again that is weird I didn't
get out now yes the person was sketching
on the note dizzy now yes it's a shame
if you like caricatures your dream has
come true and see if you like yes like
doodling while waiting for the bus so
this is the samsung galaxy note it's a
5-inch it's it's a phone and they're
saying it's a tablet is really just a
really big phone or a really small
tablet and they were showing it off with
a caricature artists and stuff and
people drawing I thought was an
interesting concept I was like hey
that's kind of cool looking I just so
big and so small at the same time I
can't imagine anyone would actually buy
one so they have to be a monthly date
you can't choose a tablet it's the phone
so you gotta pay a monthly data and
voice the thing with a tip I told my
samsung PR friend that yeah that I had a
if I was going to do a Deadpool for CES
2012 the note haha she wasn't happy you
know it's funny we told them off too
because they had a data chrome dated new
Chromebook remember the Chromebooks the
thing that I do from operating system oh
you review the samsung idea but we saw
the rise laptop we saw the new one
hanging in there and we were like oh you
still have one of those I like how much
is this I went over what did you know
it's like a low-powered you know
notebook I guess yeah it's either got an
atom or now some them just have an old
falak cell Rockefeller r celeron and it
just runs no real storage on board just
runs the chrome browser / operating
system I was like so what if these
things like 199 or something to like 449
okay get the a fatty I never said in the
middle of floor you have got to be
messing with me although I didn't say
exactly like that I think you have got
to be completely insane if you think
that you can buy a perfectly good
11-inch you know a AMD e350 laptop for
like 3 99 or a little bit more for like
an intel core i3 that runs like Windows
7 anybody pay the same amount for the
chrome and the atom every time I say
that to somebody they are that are big
chrome I don't know you go to Chrome and
you go read my post there's people the
really yeah I get it trying to defend uh
there there are these items are only
laptops are they built by they buying
these solution nobody's they're buying
their building a chrome if I solution
you me am not really a solution at all
you can't do that now so no no what
they're saying I one well it doesn't
want you you won't get ever all day
battery life with that you you gonna
kill have to charge it it's for people
who enjoy all the battery life in a
browser that does not a trackpad and a
keyboard bonded to it like I don't want
an ipad it's idiot once I want the
laptop version of the ipad you don't
need security software that i can close
and use and run flash also productivity
proof which is I which is sad because
they know i will tell you they know that
thing is not does not yes leave me there
they were not actively offending the
hardware they both both a suring samsung
the hardware's fine the hardware is not
the problem it's the idea yeah the first
gen had like Intel Atom zinnemann stuff
it just may well no I'm just saying a
thing for google you don't need a lot of
you don't need a lot of power to run a
right freakin browser so it's not like
the end of the world that it has an atom
in it I'm sure that there's no point I'm
sure the opportunity presented itself
they made a thing for google to show off
chrome and that's where it stands like I
don't know if it's anything that's
that's the nature of the whole
relationship is a contractual obligation
is to protect it's like our guy that's
my theory I no evidence to make one of
these I guess it's is where's the knee
there's no they say they manufacture it
is a proof of concept of a concept
alright alright let's just let it all I
say Scott nice a lot of samsung laptops
there that we liked Emily the light
should come out at some point just not
that chromebook which is what I'm saying
the hard game yeah yeah I make very nice
hard work yeah they're gamer laptop was
potential yeah that was really cool yeah
that was cool series 7 and the end the
series 9 15 inch really thin 15 inch
yeah I thought that was cool too I have
a practical question we're gonna go
around and take a little survey since
we're talking about laptops what laptop
did you take to CES why and were you
happy with it and since we started late
we're already going over we're going to
keep this a little bit on the brief
sighs I'll start I'm gonna start with us
I'm looking directly at you is my silent
way of indicating i thought i would like
your answer so essentially i took i
think it's Adele its can t remember the
name of it it's one of them really this
line a lot of juice it's been provided
to us by our kind employees ok so you
took your work left exact yes oh wow
that's so it's my 1330 that we've talked
about on the show before sort of died
the battery kind of fell out and the our
key doesn't work anymore you can't be a
pirate against our or it heats up it's
horrible and so yes I took my work
laptop and it worked very well I really
like the new dell business line there no
well in the back like a battery life is
good for you yes rano know about two
hours wasn't oh my god and and it says
the same was it too heavy to carry
around all the time no it's about two
kilos whatever that is in Paris I've no
idea what going for what about what's
that an American that's probably about
four pounds 4.44 pf4 okay yeah I'm full
pounds there we go what about you Josh
sir look at Wolfram Alpha over here hey
know as I've explained to him before a
key of coke is 2.2 that's coca-cola kids
yes coke sorry yes Miami Vice Oh anyway
uh HP DM 100k 11 inch yes ultraportable
yes low-power the long battery life
decent performance yeah and only it only
wasn't good during the live blogging
because I don't know it
it got really bogged down and I can't
tell if it was the whole live blogging
and of it or my computer but ok ok I was
the only hiccup really a had edited
video and that is a favorite of many of
us yeah now that's what last year scott
and i both bought 11 or 11 / 12 you know
ultra portable size laptops i took the
macbook air 11-inch and scott took a
lenovo actively a 12-inch but you know
same class and we both like them but i
felt battery life was not as good as it
should've din i had to go and recharge a
lot my bad that was my big thing my
battery life was good i really hate the
touchpad on mm-hmm yes I great let's get
that's your 399 laptop touchpad yeah it
tends to erase things just hot because
bring in yes hits the exactly you're
talking bear the finicky touchpad yeah
that was right on the fence with me with
my decision literally the night before I
was leaving in the morning it's like the
most important decision we make all year
yes as a picking your sword a two
laptops right next to each other both
charged both ready to go I was psyching
myself out illness I no one was the one
was the macbook air 11-inch which seems
like a perfect choice which I took last
your ways yeah and the other was the HP
folio 13 which I was currently working
on a review which is so new it's like
untested right so I thought I don't know
if I really want to take a leap with
that one at the moment and because i've
had problems sometimes like that last
year I took the lenovo you 260 liked it
a lot the battery life was short now in
the end i did take the folio 13 that
being around the bush the reason was
simple I went with workhorse decisions
because I know it's CES things go down
wireless networks get weird and there's
no direct ethernet port so it was as
simple as to me I could get the dongle
but I thought the folio 13s got the
Ethernet port and it's got the SD card
slot which again last year i think i
forgot to bring an SD card reader and so
i had to go buy one and I to make sure
it was in the bag and I just like in
case someone hands me although this year
the photos were all uploaded I don't
think we really need to transfer photos
from an SD card you never know and then
I thought battery life on this
theoretically should have been good in
the end I do not regret the decision I
was actually quite happy I was surprised
I think that showed through y-yeah the
review was so positive i think earn an
editor's choice because this made it
through CES which they got let's show
some Beauty shots they're on yeah here
it is I mean not a bona fide uh that is
a top know before you have the gold ores
are just a lot in here um it's a sort of
i just called not the lighting is a
yellow in here it's a titanium it's a
it's a brush metal it's sort of a little
bit in that direction but it's it's it's
silvery um it's a it's a it's a business
e-type look it's very clean it's got a
cloth keyboard though it's a backlit
keyboard not um and the battery life was
really good the best we've seen on one
of these I quote ultrabooks you know the
ones that are officially being called
ultrabooks six hours uh and it's a
little thicker but heck this thing is
light it's about three points still
qualifies it again enjoy I sit here to
help finiti right it's light enough it's
lighter than any I mean it's lighter
than a macbook pro and thinner than a
macbook pro for comparison obviously
thicker than a macbook air and and the
ports are great on it's got everything
you need USB 3 if you've got anything
which I didn't but the back the keyboard
was fantastic mhm and I got me through
everything easily writing very fast wake
up from sleep very fast boot time the
one problem i agree with you and it you
know happens on a lot of Windows laptops
but maybe some of the HP ones I've seen
to the trackpad it's a click pad it's a
little bit finicky and again I was
working on stuff and cutting you know
cutting and pasting or highlighting yeah
it within within our tools and all of a
sudden something we get shifted because
I use tap to click and it got really
weird okay I mean that's across a lot of
HP laptops that touchpad especially the
chinger scroll oh yeah that Apple does
so well haribol kind every time you know
what they updated the firmware on I
could have used a small touch pad but
the two finger scroll works fine it's a
yeah everyone thought it would be no
that's nice that's not an old sure that
it doesn't feel ultrabook light no not
compared to the others either
technically it beats Intel's I mean it's
still having enough to kill someone with
it's a little over three as opposed to a
little under 30 that's the number one
fan experience there it's always
somebody with the thing is it awfully
sad I feel like I get his jam also what
I like
because it's kind of not precious so you
don't you feel you just jam it into a
backpack and not worry about it um you
know I mean about flex going on so I I
liked that it got me through a lot of
problems and it did not have to be
charged very much at all so good kudos
to that but yeah I could have done
something a look I would have liked an
11 inch or 12 inch version maybe with
the same type supports but do you feel
like you made the right choice I do
although i think the i think the speed
and convenience of some like the macbook
air 11 sure that sexy you take that
around but yeah made the right now i use
the previous generation of that 11-inch
macbook air last year and my problem was
again yeah the battery would not last
all day especially when you told press
conferences at the venetian and
everything well that's where that fell
down I took the 13 inch air this year
and that would actually I never had to
worry about that running out of power i
think the the delta between the 11 inch
and 13-inch battery life is actually
pretty big it's about two hours and
pretty significant yeah you're doing
stuff like we do that worked out great
and it's light and it's thin so you
don't really know she have it I didn't
take my iPad around instead and try to
work from that I've done that before
that one thing we were talking about
before you know productivity versus a
toy and I know that there's been some
internet comments about the fact that an
ipad is not a toy but i believe that is
it doesn't have a single using a vote
stories and live blog stuff live blog
from the ipad at events did you feel
like in an innie and what no way we're
great for the live blog to we just have
to type it's a great that was great real
life and i filed I filed stories on the
ipad and cat3 last year just as an
experiment to see if i get as and when
you go back to ya guessing something
that's real but efficient critical
though I mean I don't even want to
experiment I've used this I think the
iPads great free not essential work
getting work done travel computer like
if you need just to get a few things
done like when I went to England with my
family is just enough you can get work
done if you need to but it's not like
anyone saying in one hour you get to
post up and then you get a live blog
this event and then you've got to make
sure you over here at three o'clock that
stuff I would ever bring an iPad for
like if I had to go to a live blog of
event that was being live blogs and I
was just doing like the color commentary
on it like we often do and I didn't have
to do anything else I would feel
comfortable the ipad yeah yeah
because i can type really good on the
screen I would except i get annoyed if i
had to then I like simultaneously may be
working on a story and then if there's
something yeah why blogging then you
have to file something with a knife like
I said if that was the only thing I was
doing yeah why is the keyboard in all
caps what the HP o-o that one hmm why is
it no games yeah sorry it's a secret I
isn't it it's always bugged me I don't
know I mean not that the regular
keyboard isn't in all caps just I don't
know anyway Thank You Josh just me sorry
well oh here but it turns and instantly
turns to lowercase me oh also just what
cuz it's a letter yeah wait at the
moment you type any it'll automatically
happens yeah they don't stay that way
they just turned whatever you need no I
understand but the the actual letters on
the sorry it doesn't matter but then
look on my phone which is an android
phone Oh as soon as you hit the first I
know that's what I'm saying that regular
keyboard it's it's the same as a regular
keyboard adjust you want to transform ya
does transform done yet no it doesn't it
doesn't which is in all caps and so I
can't see that's weird yeah I never
noticed that yeah me neither I think on
the iphone it does transform ya maybe it
does NOP that doesn't it's it's an iOS
good thing Hey look at that we've
learned something new today all right I
think I think it's a good interesting
discovery I think it's a good moment to
to continue wrapping up just because we
started late and you know we don't want
to run away too long yeah but does
anyone have any III know we had some
other stuff to talk about we can come
back to that next week maybe weirdest
stuff Scott played around with another
new on live product from the streaming
guys but maybe we can shows the video
that or just demo that live next week
they'll talk about it on live desktop
which allows you to essentially make
your ipad into a window 7 environment
and other and the apps do that also
right but but none of them are very good
to date maybe maybe this one is better
although where is their iPad gaming app
so now we're previewed back in December
and I guess the stories that Apple has
never approved it so essentially is that
on live desktop went live right at the
moment that they said it would and yet
the eye on live gaming app which is
really it is ready to go we have it
installed
provisioning on our iPads and it's great
I had my back you notes I I'd installed
it on mine already oh how did you do
that I got a provision code oh no so I
mean we're saying is it's good enough to
go yet it's interesting that Apple is
not approve that as rapidly there's some
problem there we don't know whose whose
problem is I have it on my phone so as
you guys remember we voted best of show
at CES oh yeah they just redone enjoyed
to that that oled TV mm-hmm I agree with
that I voted for that Scott would you
have agreed with that vote yeah I do I
did agree with oled TV just because I
didn't think there were very few
interesting technologies it was the
visual of the show it was the
eye-catching moment yes as a story to
tell your parents i don't know after
seeing the maker but and make a basket
to that I know oh I was that I feel that
stuff it's been around for a while yeah
but not in your consumer ok ok I know it
at the maker faire in New York doesn't
make her fair this is C yes same thing
though same products a manufacturer I
mean the reason with myself and David
Katz Meyer deliberated over this was
because the two standouts were basically
Samsung and LG and I'm just thinking in
the next couple of years we'll
ultrabooks matter you know there's a lot
of shifting going on in form factors at
the moment and ultra ball called
whatever it is that they're little Foley
regular yeah well be a million little
different form factors but what's going
to become quite apparent in the next
couple years is how good ol it is and
we'll look back now and say if we put up
with those crappy little TVs we've got
OLED now oh yeah we never need to go
back your TV envy even if you just
bought a brand-new TV totally true yep
so it's like she sees it was winner of
the show I mean he voted for samsung
sorry he voted for LG i voted for
samsung but it was not only due to see
well yeah they were a bit we'll see
native about what it actually was here's
a question I want know about very
quickly is it eventually something you
could it almost sort of paint on your
wall because if any enough you could
apply it and make it sort of like the
wallscreen you've always wanted but yet
they're talking about it being thin
enough to print on t-shirts like you
know you get that led t-shirts now
you'll be able to roll it up into a
newspaper so we're talking really really
thin
it only needs to be pixel size so
basically whatever the size of a pixel
is less than a millimeter whatever that
is ninjas I don't know but so we're
looking at understand millimeters we
don't send kilo metric millimeters
lillimae did you get I got that we that
we get is so I don't get micro inches is
up with you probably never heard of that
like you a new marketing speak micro and
macro inches yes but a 3.4 micro inches
thick the new LED LG is having high
anyway next week on live desktop demo
listen it's all because of the tech
problems we started late for obviously a
little uh well something today also i'm
going to show you some interesting stuff
I found out about how to stream the
