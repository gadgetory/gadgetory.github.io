hand as Apple almost apologizes for the
iphone antenna problems go for a test
drive in the 2011 ford mustang shelby
gt500 sedam Ackerman's favorite laptop
of the year and I countdown cnet's top 5
desktop computers it's all coming up
right now
hey folks welcome to cnet tech review
rounding up our hottest videos of the
week and telling you which are good
which are bad and offering some tech
wisdom in the form of a bottom line i'm
brian cooley filling in for molly wood
while she's out covering comic-con now I
know Molly usually kicks off the show
with the good section but I'm gonna go a
little different direction that's right
we're starting things off with the bad
at the end of last week Steve Jobs held
a rare press conference to try and put
antennagate to bed brian Tong broke away
from his hair stylist for a couple of
hours to bring us the full story riot on
here with cnet com for the Apple by now
we know Apple threw a little wrench into
our show so we're gonna jump right into
what they announced and they'll figure
out how the rest of the show plays out
now first up Apple will be giving out a
free case for all people who own a
current iphone for every iphone user is
going to get a free case so that could
be a bumper case or you could go online
in order one from a variety of vendors
that they have the other thing that
they're going to do is also offer
purchasers of the iphone for a full
refund it doesn't matter if it's outside
of the return date now when Steve Jobs
came out on stage it really crafted this
story to give you data points and really
make you feel like you could understand
situation they demoed off apples phones
comparing it with other phones like the
samsung omnia two they also did the
blackberry bold 9700 to show that other
phones do have this symptom then they
also push the fact that only a half a
percent of all iphone 4s do exhibit this
symptom and then on top of that they
want to show people that well are people
really returning these things still a
third of people who returned the iphone
3gs returning the iphone 4s they really
wanted to pound across the one that
this is really not happening sometimes
on the internet things appear bigger
than they really are but the bottom line
here our consumers going to be happy
with what Steve Jobs said we asked Josh
Lowensohn from cnet com I think people
are going to be split this is a big
dividing thing a lot of the people the
critics of the phone are going to say
yep told you so and a lot of people with
the phone I'm going to look at their
phone and say okay now I have a case so
this will work right and Apple just
acknowledge that I think that's really
troubling but as
iphone odor myself you know I do i do
feel okay the fact that they
acknowledged it and they're very upfront
about what's wrong with it and then
compared to other phones where this
happens to so I think you know that's
the best case scenario we can have until
iphone 5 so there you have it free
bumper cases or cases for everyone if
you want to return your phone you can do
that as well now let's get back to the
show what's up i'm brian Tong and
welcome to the apple pie for all the
good things and bad stuff inside the
world of apple and last week yeah was
not really a good one for Apple but
could it get any worse well apple
recently posted the first beta for iOS
4.1 and it appears that it includes the
signal bar display Corrections you can
see here that signal bars 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 have
increased in display size incredible now
we all know Apple is infamous for
ripping on other companies like
Microsoft and Adobe well now they're
getting a taste of their own medicine
after motorola and verizon use a
full-page ad in The New York Times to
tout the droid x's ability to be held
any way you like then Microsoft coo
kevin turner said the iphone 4 might be
there vista oh snaps you know the only
thing lower than that in the geek world
is like making a mama joke or if your
last girlfriend says you have a floppy
drive that I know all right an iPad
rumor news digit times is reporting that
Apple is planning to release a smaller
version of its three million units sold
and Counting tablet in the first quarter
of 2011 reportedly 5.6 inch and 7 inch
screens are being ordered by Apple
alongside the standard 9.7 iPad screen
the smaller screen iPads might be geared
more towards the e-reader market but
what will they call these things I
already have my ipad nano right here we
didn't get to this last episode but with
sep tember getting closer that means
ipod refreshes are on their way you can
always count on chinese websites that
claim they have the front panels for the
next gen ipod touch now online pictures
show a hole at the top quite possibly
for a front-facing camera now I fix it
did the breakdown for mac rumors and
show that the iphone 4s camera won't
fit inside a current ipod touch unless
they change the form factor now we're
confident we'll see some sort of camera
action on the next ipod touch but
FaceTime uses AT&amp;amp;T s network to initiate
the call so Apple is going to have to
tweak the software if we expect to see
this on the touch and in other ipod in
music news apple's lolla calm
acquisition a few months ago has sparked
dreams of an iTunes streaming service
MPD data recently surveyed close to
4,000 users and fifteen percent of the
respondents would be willing to pay a
minimum ten dollar monthly fee access to
itunes content on multiple devices now
if you apply those numbers to the 50
million US itunes customers that would
represent 1 billion dollars waiting for
Apple in just its first year the main
obstacle to make this happen is getting
the music labels on board and those
dreams aren't coming true anytime soon
alright that's gonna do it for this
week's show send your emails to the
apple bite at cnet com i'm brian Tong
thanks for watching and we'll see you
next week for another bite of the Apple
honestly antennagate is almost a bigger
scandal than Watergate since most iphone
4 users are missing a lot more than just
18 and a half minutes of their calls
maybe AT&amp;amp;T can hire some plumbers
couldn't make things any worse moving on
in the bad in this day and age of cloud
computing why is it so hard to have your
browser bookmarks show up on whatever
computer you're using not to mention on
your smartphone some recent upgrades to
Firefox have made this a little easier
but we're still a long way from using it
on our iphones
Firefox users has long been awaiting a
version for iphone but with apples
ironclad restrictions firefox on the
iphone seems like just a pipe dream then
those clever folks at mozilla came up
with a different approach I'm Jessica
doll court with Cena taking a first look
at firefox home one point oh the closest
you may ever get to surfing Firefox on
the iPhone simply put firefox home is a
free syncing app that gets you access to
your firefox search history bookmarks
and open tabs on a laptop or computer it
ties into the Firefox Sync extension
that Mozilla recently rolled out so you
can't use the iPhone app without the
browser add-on once you install Firefox
Sync on your home computer you can log
into firefox home on your iPhone you
start typing into the search bar to
scour your history and bookmarks for a
URL you recently entered you can also
pull up your list of bookmarks to
quickly get to sites you previously
saved from your desktop the app also
remembers the last set of browser tabs
that Firefox had it open you can view
those within the apps viewer or open the
URL and Safari to fully interact the app
also lets you email the URL to a friend
or copy it to the clipboard we should
note that Firefox Sync in Firefox
homesync periodically not every time you
make a change so you should manually
refresh the ad on a nap if you're intent
on getting to a certain website from
your iphone also because you're syncing
data is stored in the cloud Firefox
doesn't have to be open on the desktop
or laptop for you to plumb your history
with firefox home firefox home is a
great tool for taking your work with you
and saving you from having to search
safari for urls that you've already
visited somewhere else it could still
use some more tweaking like being able
to share URLs to Facebook and your
social networks because of apple's
kibosh on competing browsers were
unlikely to see a lot of additional
functionality in the add-on space but we
are glad to connect our desktop browsing
to the iphone i'm jessica doll cord and
this is firefox home one point 0 for
iphone
come on Apple just let us have firefox
on our iphones have you seen some of the
stupid apps you've approved okay enough
slumming let's get to the good stuff one
great thing about hosting the show this
week is that I get to play lots of my
videos for example this news cnet top 5
best desktop computers yep we still use
them
poor desktop computers for like a decade
they were the sensible shoes as things
like notebooks netbooks smartphones and
tablets came out but desktops are hot
again I'm Brian Cooley with a scenic top
five best desktop computers according to
cnet's reviews number five the painfully
named gateway SX 2840 dash 0 1 are they
kidding this a budget PC that is the one
to beat it's a quad core with really
smooth video playback a terabyte hard
drive and an hdmi output so it's a real
good candidate for the living room
especially since it has a small stylish
case that doesn't say i'm the kind of
dork who puts a computer in the living
room number for HP touchsmart 600 now
the windows industry has been trying to
crack the imac recipe for ages and
honestly not doing it but HP comes the
closest with this one solid apps that
leverage the touchscreen great media
features and you know it actually looks
pretty good it's not an imac but it
doesn't cost as much as a cheap used car
either number 3 another winner from
Gateway oof the FX 68 31 dash 0 1 we're
not real big fans of the red exterior
lighting or the fact that the case looks
like a robot's lunchbox but this is a
really hot gaming PC priced like a
utility machine number two the origin
Genesis with Intel's Core i7 920
processor okay I haven't spent this much
on all the pcs I've ever owned but if
you've got about 5 grand freed up for
your next gaming rig this guy is our
unqualified recommendation best
performance we've ever seen enough said
before we get to our number one best
desktop computer why our desktops hot
again two main reasons windows 7 got
really good reviews especially coming
off the mess that was Vista and OS 10
machines are enjoying the halo that
works around all things apple oh by the
way the average selling price of a new
desktop computer this year six hundred
and seventy dollars
okay now it's time to reveal our number
one desktop PC it's apple's imac the
27-inch with a two point eight gig intel
core i7 with that voracious core
processor a 27-inch screen that looks
even bigger thanks to that edge-to-edge
glass seamless ability to run OS 10 and
windows and a perfect 10 from us for its
overall design you can't do any better
for a high ability desktop desktops hot
again didn't see that one coming well
that's it for this edition of top 5 i'm
brian cooley from cnet com we'll see you
next time no really desktop computers
hot again well hot in a cougar he kind
of way anyway I'll show you something
really hot later in the show now if
desktops seem a little antique dan
ackerman has his computing to go at a
much fresher level with a couple of
first looks at his favorite laptops
I'm Dan Akron and we are here with the
asus eeepc 1018 now I know you're used
to hearing a lot of numbers after EPC
model numbers like the popular 1005 or
the less expensive one thousand eight by
pumping the number all the way up to
1018 asus has actually gone back to the
drawing board at least aesthetically and
come up with a new design for the super
popular epc line the internal components
haven't really changed that much but
from the outside it's a whole different
animal now it's cladded brushed metal
it's thinner than it used to be it's got
a much more upscale sophisticated look
we like it a lot feels a lot more sturdy
than the kind of plastic netbooks that
you might be used to even though at
three hundred and fifty dollars it's
only 50 bucks more than the Super
entry-level 299 models but even though
it looks really cool inside it's kind of
the same system it's still got a 10 inch
display at 1024 x 600 resolution still
got the same intel atom n450 1 gig ram
windows seven starter so not anything
really new there it's got the island
style keyboard that asus has been using
lately we like that a lot this model has
a new touchpad it's a little bit bigger
which is great and the left and right
mouse buttons even though they're on one
bar down here they're at least textured
kind of big definitely better than we've
seen on previous epc model the new pc
still is the same great battery life
were used to from asus eee pcs or even
other netbooks performance wise it's
still going to give you that netbook
experience you have to really temper
your expectations you know good for web
surfing basic productivity some very
light multimedia playback that's about
it as long as your expectations are
modest you can definitely get away with
using a netbook some most or even all
the time if you're not doing anything to
intensive since netbooks are essentially
commodity products in a lot of ways
because they really do all have pretty
much the same components inside you're
really buying based on price and based
on look and feel so because they're
keeping the price down and they've got
this really cool new design there's a
lot to like about this new version i'm
dan ackerman and then is the asus eee pc
1000
i'm dan ackerman and we are here taking
a look at the toshiba portege r700 5 now
there's really no such thing as a
perfect laptop but this guy hits a lot
of the right notes it's a 13-inch laptop
in support of toshiba portege line we
really like a lot of the previous models
like they are 500 that was a 12 inch
laptop for this version they bumped up
to 13 same size as the basic 13-inch
MacBook while keeping the price down and
keeping the opponents pretty good this
version has an intel core i3 processor
in it there's actually a industrial
version called the r700 rather than the
705 where you can get core i5 and core
i7 processors this one's got the core i3
it's got a 500 gig hard drive it's got a
bunch of cool extras like Intel's
wireless display technology which lets
you connect the video output from this
laptop to let's say a big-screen TV you
need to get a $99 external net your
adapter for that but if you want to just
send your signal basically through
wireless HDMI that's a great way to do
it that's only built into a handful of
laptop so far and this is one of them
but for about 8 99 or even 799 on sale
you get a 13 inch display you get this
solid magnesium alloy construction it's
got an accelerometer on the hard drive
so it'll park the heads if you drop it
or jostle it too much and of course you
get in SD card slot in a SATA port and
an hdmi port all things you're not going
to find on the one to two hundred dollar
more expensive basic white macbook the
keyboard is the basic island style
similar to what you find on a macbook or
a sony vaio and the touchpad it's about
as big as any we see on a 13-inch laptop
except of course for the macbook because
they've got a mix of decent components
really good price and nice high-end
design this is very likely going to end
up being one of our favorite laptops of
2010 i am dan ackerman and then z
toshiba portege r700 5
one of our favorite laptops of 2010 it's
only mid-year pretty bold statement to
make at this point Danno not as bold as
that tie however okay folks time to take
a break smoke em if you got them but
keep your ticket stub because you'll
want to come right back in for a hard
drive like you've never seen in a car
you need to drive hard right after this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all the things
good and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on now with the good it's
hard to get too excited about external
hard drives I mean at the very least
they just sit there at worse they sit
there and make too much noise and ideal
easy just hold stuff so compared to most
external drives the hitachi life studio
mobile plus is downright interactive
check it out if you have a lots of
thorough and often have a hard time
fighting a particular one among them
then have something for you this is the
live studio mobile plus external hard
drive from hitachi this is a rather
special external hard drive and it's
come in three parts the external hard
drive itself a docking station and a USB
key essentially the key is a thumb drive
with storage being included four
gigabyte microSD card you can change
this card for another and upgrade the
keys capacity to up to 32 gigabyte of
storage however if you already have
another thumb drive the key is rather
redundant unless you want to use it as a
micro card reader the last video mobile
plus is bus power meaning is included
standard mini USB cable it is for both
the data connection and to draw power
directly from the computer's USB port in
case one port doesn't provide in AB
juice the dry also come with a second
why shape cable that use to port at a
time in our trials however the drive
only needed one USB port to work
unfortunately the dry does not support
you speed through point O and has no
firewire connection either to make up
for this it come with Hitachi's live
studio software this is a flash based
application that automatically is by all
the contents on the computer's hard
drive both internal and external and
display them in a visually clear
chronological order you can even view
them in the form of 3d world must like
the cover flow of fake of the ipod you
can use the live studio software to hook
up the computers content with social
websites such as flickr or facebook and
vice versa you can also view facebook
photo and brooms view the software 3d
interface unfortunately the live studio
software does not support network
storage devices at 130 dollar for 500
gigabyte and 100 dollar for 320 gigabyte
the live studio mobile plus is a pretty
good deal to check out it is live studio
software is something that serves you
well check out the in-depth review etsy
com once again my name is dumb low and
this has been the first look at the live
studio mobile plus external hard drive
from cat I like how you can actually use
the thumb drive portion as a card reader
I'd call that the Swiss Army knife of
USB drives except it's already one of
those and now it's time for this week's
bottom line you know I've only played
one of my videos so far in this show
that's pretty big of me now I go petty
let's wrap this week's tech review with
one of mine a taste of the 2011 ford
mustang shelby gt500 giddyup yeah it's a
550 horsepower mustang but that's just a
speck what really sets this car apart is
the name on its rump and the man whose
it is let's get into 2011 ford mustang
shelby gt500 check the legacy and the
text
I Shelby's unique among American hot
rods because of this guy carroll shelby
a tall lanky texan who's been making
cars go fast his whole life and doing so
with a certain american style in 1959 he
drove an Aston Martin to win if LeMond
in his chicken rancher overalls in 66
for gt40s he developed took first and
second in the same race something
Ferrari thought would never happen but
his longest legacy is the shelby mustang
the original pony car given the nads of
a quarter horse owners of vintage ones
flocked to have Shelby sign in their
glove box and I'm the last guy you'll
find getting a picture with a celeb
unless it's Ken
now you buy a gt500 for the engine
period 5.4 liter v8 supercharged kind of
hard to miss that there it is sitting
right on the top course the traditional
Ford competition blue valve cover tells
you that you've got a very special motor
here it's a hand-built mill what they've
done here different from 2010 though is
they've gone to an all aluminum block
versus last year's cast iron that shaved
a hundred pounds or so and more
importantly it shaved 100 pounds over
the nose so this car doesn't plough the
way the last year's model did and all
the previous Shelby's before it it's a
more expensive way to cast a block but
it didn't really move the price of the
car another exotic thing here is they do
not have pressed in iron cylinder liners
which most aluminum block
high-performance cars have instead
they've done up exotic treatment of the
inside of the cylinder wall to really
hardened it and make it durable and
result good numbers 550 horsepower up
ten from last year 510 foot-pounds of
torque good numbers what's wrong with me
crazy numbers and yet the MPG stays
reasonable 1523 is that reasonable which
is good enough and better enough this
year to beat the gas guzzler tax this
car used to get and thanks to that
engine and a nice throaty H pipe design
exhaust system the best seat in the
house for audio in this car is not
between speakers in the front but
between these tips in the rear
one proper gear box for this car at
remax six-speed manual that's as heavy
as a boat are in quick dry cement short
throws but sort of unrefined our car has
the Shelby Performance Package a
limited-slip rear end with a shorter
ratio to get out of a hole quicker
tighter suspension special 19's on the
front 20s in the rear q-ball shift knob
different strikes now our cars loaded up
inside with just about every toy which
isn't a lot we have the electronics
package which is Ford's generally good
though not class-leading navigation
system the I button is one of the
interesting things on a ford vehicle
like this because you have serious and
serious travel link that brings you all
kinds of information including traffic
weather fuel prices movie listings a lot
of folks haven't seen this in action yet
so i tend to point that out bluetooth
hands-free of course is all part of the
sync system which is stock on this car
so that gets you your media integration
in your hands-free communication we have
am FM and sirius satellite radio HD
radio on this guy and kind of a nice way
of portraying it i think notice this
little area of the screen in the upper
left the HD icon comes on when you're in
HD radio and it does a nice job of
showing you the multicast stations you
know because HD radio has those hidden
stations within the station's you listen
to this one shows that the station I'm
listening to now has its primary
frequency that I'm on a multicast
station on to and of course technically
they can go all the way to eight though
no station I know does that and the last
thing that's interesting is a little
kind of an easter egg here you've got
the traction control for traction on or
traction off but if you double tap it
you get a sport mode for traction
control that's the one that I liked
get this car without the LCD head unit
and you'll still get synced traffic
directions and information with a send
from google destination feature with a
hundred fewer pounds on the nose the
2011 gt500 turns in quite nicely instead
of ploughing on twisty roads we're
splitting around cnet on the ride
quality some found it punishing i found
that exactly what car is like a Nissan
GTR need to be firmly compliant though
you'll still feel every bottle cap you
drive over and might even be able to
tell what brand it was now remember Ford
weaponize as the Mustang in this trim by
giving it a supercharged motor you've
got to really get into it to get the
blower to wake up and what it does the
rewards are ample but it's not a car
that has overwhelming power at initial
tip in which I find both satisfying and
not in everyday driving that makes the
car very livable beast in performance
driving sometimes the power actually
comes on a little late for me but
there's enough of it to make up for any
delay maybe the word of 2011 this
Mustang Shelby gt500 is still a live
axle car in the rear so on the cutter
roads I love little windy twisty little
European style roads it's a handful the
rear ends dancing and hopping all over
the place the other minor frustration is
the way that 510 foot-pounds of torque
be Devils the hell out of traction
control they kind of don't belong
together on a car so I just turned it
off otherwise traction controls on a
whole lot of the time and you end up
with numb throttle response and this may
drive some of your nuts but one of the
things I value most in it is the fact
that it's got a nice compliant every day
suspension and can acquit itself well
when you push it not every performance
car can do that
ok let's price our little red stripe and
friend about 50 grand is your base price
for a gt500 not a cheap toy but it's got
some great numbers three big packages to
look at 3,500 bucks for Shelby
performance kit 2500 for the electronics
rig which is mostly about the hard drive
base nav and media system 1304 shaker
1000 sound but not with the electronics
rig that's a little frustrating to me
one big ala carte piece and that would
be the full glass roof here kind of
booze wall but I think I'd do it and
it's two thousand dollars but you're
buying more than a collection of specs
and options here you're spending 50
grand on a Mustang because you want
something fast iconic and unapologetic
like the guy whose name it wears the
bottom line this week always ask
yourself what would Carroll Shelby do
unfortunately he probably grind his heel
into your iPhone laptop external drive
or browser bookmark cloud thing and tell
you stop being such a sissy that's it
for this time tune in next week for
another look at the tech that was
including molly's coverage from
comic-con until then there's fresh video
coming out of the oven every day at cnet
tv.com see you next time thanks for
