you're going to really want but amazon
made it nearly impossible to buy it I'm
Bridget Carey this is your CNET update
the Amazon echo smart speaker is one of
the coolest and most versatile smart
home products out today hands down this
voice controlled speaker is taking us
closer to that Star Trek computer future
where you can ask you to do all sorts of
tasks by calling its name Alexa and now
the speaker comes in two new forms the
normal echo is $180 but for just half
the cost amazon sliced off the top and
calls this the echo dot it does
everything the main echo does but you'll
need to plug it into an existing speaker
to hear anything or use bluetooth if you
want a wireless connection so this
sounds great
it's half the cost you just use your own
speakers and you get all the cool
features right but here's where amazon
will annoy you you cannot buy this on
Amazon's website the only way to
preorder the dot is if you have another
device with Alexa voice controls and you
need to be a prime subscriber so that
means you need to already own the
original echo or use the amazon firetv
voice controls to buy one of these yeah
Amazon will not say when it'll open up
sales to everyone but the first
pre-ordered units will arrive at the end
of March so I guess everyone else just
has to hang on tight in the meantime
there is another echo speaker that
anyone can preorder this is the tap and
the big feature here is portability the
original echo always had to be plugged
in but the tap is battery-powered to
take it anywhere and to not drain the
battery it will not be always listening
for you to call out the name Alexa to
give it commands instead you have to hit
a button to ask something hence the name
tap you can buy a colorful bumper case
for it but it does come with a charging
dock and the battery lasts nine hours of
continuous use the tap is a hundred and
thirty dollars so you see about 50 bucks
compared to their original but they can
do the same tricks and speaking of
tricks all echo products are gaining the
ability to also control more smart
thermostats by the end of the month a
voice command can change the temperature
on a Nest Learning Thermostat right now
the echo works with the eco b3
thermostat but other companies like
Honeywell and Insteon are also jumping
in so you can just say things like Alexa
set the heat to 70 degrees that's it for
this tech news update you can head to
