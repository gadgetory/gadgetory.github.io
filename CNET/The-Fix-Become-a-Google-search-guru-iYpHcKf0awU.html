information it's also about being able
to find the information you need most of
us that first point of information
retrieval is Google but not every Google
search is created equal
I'm going to show you some advanced
features of Google search that will help
you pinpoint exactly what you're looking
for the first thing to know is that
Google actually has an advanced search
page that they kind of hide over at
google.com slash advanced underscore
search now using that you can search for
exact phrases you can define subjects
that are going to be excluded from
search you can even filter the results
by language or region or even filter out
explicit content for example let's say
we're looking for some Star Wars fan
fiction that's written in German and
available as a PDF and doesn't mention
Jar Jar Binks and for the sake of this
video is not pornographic I'll put in
fan fiction as the general search term
and then Star Wars as a specific search
term and I'll say excluding Jar Jar and
I'm gonna filter this by the German
language turn safe search on and then
select PDF as the file type boom it's a
lot of German Star Wars fan fiction that
doesn't have Jar Jar Binks doing
horrible things the great thing about
searching this way is that you already
have a template for how to structure
your search it's great also if you're
looking for something pretty complicated
and you really want to be able to define
the parameters for your search now you
can perform a pretty similar search
right from the Google homepage if you
use some choice punctuation Google calls
these search operators and there's
dozens of them out there but I'm gonna
talk about the ones that are the most
useful now let's say you're looking for
a specific phrase if you put in
quotation marks Google will acknowledge
the entire phrase instead of each
individual words for example if I want
to search for people who are talking
about the best doughnut they've ever had
I'll type the phrase this is the best
doughnut I've ever had inside quotation
marks and Google will filter just the
results to have those exact words
that exact order I see results here from
Twitter and if I want to filter those
out I could adjust the search by adding
a dash or a minus sign in front of the
word Twitter or let's say I want my
results only from Twitter I could adjust
the search by adding site : twitter.com
and then I've only got results with that
phrase from Twitter finally a few quick
tips now Google is not only the most
famous search engine in the world it's
also a great calculator it can even
handle scientific calculations can also
handle unit conversions if you want to
know how many Ounces are in a gallon
just type it in and you got the answer
if you want to define a word you can
just type in define colon and the word
you're looking for and for an easy way
to pad your term paper with some
impressive citations you can go to
scholar.google.com and you're gonna get
a searchable index of articles and
abstracts and books all from academic
publishers so that's it that's how to
take your Google search skills up to the
next level</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
