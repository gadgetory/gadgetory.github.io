first ever Silicon Valley Fashion Week
this is really a crazy combination where
tech meets fashion meets art meets
performance we've never seen anything
like it so let's go check it out
Modelling I don't think that's been done
before ever in the world so that was
pretty spectacular there's a kid that
you guys put together yourselves from
scratch yeah this one basically the
reason why we went custom with this is
because it's got a really simple flight
controller the flight controllers that
are more advanced are better for when
there isn't something hanging off the
bottom but when there is they're a
little too smart for their own good and
they get a little confused by all this
going on down here as a fashion designer
was there anything that stuck out to you
the most excited about the bikes and the
drones at the light-up jacket the fairy
light up jacket was really awesome I
would surely wear that seeing that
motorcycle at the beginning was just
phenomenal seeing that kind of stuff for
the solar backpacks it's a suit thing as
I enjoy the most fashion and tech I
figured it'll probably weird probably
fun and so for us proven right it's
giving a runway to people who would
never find themselves on a runway
normally and so that's people who make
wearable tech it's people who are
developers and hackers and plenty of
fashion designers too and we're seeing
though that tech and fashion are
starting to merge slowly from the wrist
we're gonna see a lot of examples of it
of how its integrated you he noticed he
noticed some of the fashion people might
poopoo it but what's your take on this
whole thing of bringing these two worlds
together well I mean the same fashion
people whoo-hoo-hoo it are actually
staring at their iPhones right now
actively poop doing it by blogging that
way
the integration of Technology and the
innovation and it was simultaneously a
lot of what I really like about San
Francisco a lot of what I don't
quite feel I relate to but I very much
enjoyed seeing all the creativity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
