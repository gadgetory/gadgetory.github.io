time we meet we capped out another hot
CNET list I'm Tom Merritt 2008 has been
a great year for downloads so far with
hits like Diggs B and Photoshop Express
but why concentrate on the good
download.com senior content manager
Peter Butler has donned his hazmat suit
and waded in amongst the dregs of
downloadable content let's count down
the worst downloads of 2008 so far at
number five masher say it like a 1940's
game nasiha thus carpal tunnel cording
wander counts the number of times you
clicked your mouse in 20 seconds and
gives you an average click per second
rate oh I'm sorry were you waiting for
what else it does cuz there isn't
anything coming in to number 4 scat a
fun card game for fans of German and
human sized mice it's a niche market how
do you play this game the rules are in
German das it's nice to look up to
number-3 date doctor for men and I like
it too and women
it promises targeted dating strategies
it delivers a lot of text and databases
and some advice you could pretty much
get from any bartender at least the
retro interface gave us a laugh sliding
in at number 2 Brit view sadly not a
spycam of England no no it's photos of
the apparently underexposed Britney
Spears 480 K of them that's 33 pictures
couldn't have exceeded that with a
Flickr search good eye 33 that's a
Masonic number I've said too much before
we get to number 1 let's check in on the
back half of the worst downloads list I
don't know a Peter Butler cursor hider
sounds pretty compelling alright let's
get to our number one the worst download
of 2008 so far as determined by download
comm at number one its mb free psychic
color test use your psychic abilities to
select the color secretly chosen by the
computer start with 5
work up to 10 and become an expert with
20 can you read the mind of what wait
what mind my laptop has a mind
you know the best part is when you exit
the app you get a lovely nag screen
asking you to donate to the publisher
but if their psychic why do they ask
wouldn't they know well that's it for
this edition of CNN top 5 you can find
plenty of good downloads at CNET's
