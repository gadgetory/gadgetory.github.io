episode 122 of the 359 podcast with
roger chang and alfred and good morning
guys good morning it is wednesday yeah
happy Wednesday everyone halfway through
the week almost
we're like 45 minutes away from halfway
through the week right exactly at 12:00
I don't technicalities all right depends
what time zone you're in yeah I don't
say it feels like it feels like Friday
already for me it's been such a long
week but we've had a lot of lot to talk
about
lots of Samsung means we will get into
Samsung but first we want to talk about
Amazon's new music service we will talk
about Samsung but in the context of its
effects on virtual reality and then
lastly we'll talk a little bit about
Facebook and Twitter getting to a little
hot water for providing user data to the
police for police surveillance I will
say it's a little bit more complicated
than just that you can help break it
down to me because I'm gonna give the
very simple pitch line and you could
talk about the the nuance yeah and
wherever time we'll have now at that
point as always if you have any
questions about any of these topics
leave in the comment section or producer
Brian will will pick out the best all
righty all right let's do it
and we'll start our recording for the
three of the ion podcast episode 122 and
three - welcome to the 359 when we talk
about the top tech news of the day now
we have crap we want to throw in I'm
Rocco Kane I'm out for doing
Amazon launch its new music unlimited
service today it's an all-you-can-eat
plan similar to Spotify and Apple and
like the other two costs $10 a month but
the real standout option here is a
special $4 a month rate if you only plan
to stream the music through your echo
device so it seems like Amazon's really
pushing echo right yeah so what do you
think is this something that that you'd
actually you know invest in if you had
an echo with this the $4 offer be
appealing to you I'm actually planning
on getting an echo dot and I think
Amazon's
got a really smart strategy strategy by
just making everything you know as cheap
as they can yep
so it you know gets out to everybody and
then everyone has it and then here's all
these other side services that we have
with it it's really interesting that you
know folks like Apple and Spotify really
focused on getting people to subscribe
using the service on their phone
focus has always been on the phone and
so for Amazon to kind of come in here
and create this kind of like side
service for specifically for the echo
it's an interesting move right sort of
like side steps everyone yeah I just
don't think that people are gonna buy
and echo specifically for Amazon music
especially for that discount of four
dollars you're saving six dollars a
month and I think it's a lot that's a
lot of money and I seventy two dollars a
year a month though I mean like that's
like what like fifty cents a day like
laugh true of you know it's just and
then the only advantage I would see to
it is that you know it comes with it but
if you have an Amazon echo me chances
are you already have Amazon Prime yes
which would most likely mean that you
wouldn't even have to pay for that so no
that's that's not true there's two
different so there are two different
services there is the existing prime
music that's been around for a while
it's not that great the music slug has
really slim and the user interface isn't
that great this new service music
unlimited is more like Spotify and more
like a please the breath of songs is way
higher the user interface is a lot
better
it is a legit service that can compete
against these other two like prime music
was sort of like this little analog
right it wasn't that great but it was
you're not paying extra for it so
whatever this one they acknowledge that
this is a service that you have to pay
extra for it is better so this won't be
a part of prime know it's not part of
prime to breakout service so you'd have
to actually again you have to spend ten
dollars for the service or if you're
Prime member eight dollars a month so
that changes things then but I still
think you know people are gonna want to
listen to their music on other other
platforms I'm interested in it I I'm
planning on getting an echo dot and I
think most people that have Bluetooth
speakers to begin with already have a
subscription or something like Spotify
or Apple music so Amazon's gonna have to
really entice people with you know
exclusives or like what Apple is doing
sure or its massive library like what
Spotify is doing so next up we are
talking about the note 7 to buckle still
we wanted to look at it from the context
of virtual reality you know the note 7
was really supposed to push geared the
gear VR and virtual reality as a whole
oculus and Samsung we're really counting
on people to buy this phone and then get
into the virtual reality world now
there's no more note 7 what does this
mean for VR visit blue this is
bighead mostly because the Samsung gear
VR was you know kind of the middle
ground between you know having a
ten-dollar like Google cardboard kind of
device and then $1,000 oculus right it
was like it's sort of a semi polished
experience right yeah and it a lot that
was kind of where the oculus was
reaching a lot of people and now with
you know the note 7 gone and the and the
Samsung gear you know basically tailored
for the note 7 that's kind of like it's
a big step back and it's gonna affect
oculus and you know the VR Justin no the
gear the new gear VR actually has a USBC
plug-in so it was really designed for
the note there is like sort of a dongle
or attachment you can make it backwards
compatible but you know no one's buying
that new dad gear VR for lastly the ACLU
accused Facebook and Twitter providing
user data for police surveillance just
the latest incident in which social
media is being used to track civil
unrest and crime how would you get a
more nuanced take yes so it's a lot more
than just Facebook and Twitter providing
the data more so that it was a Chicago
based company called geofeedia yes that
basically took you know public data and
they can get into Twitter and Facebook
API through it
so the blink is not really on Facebook
and Twitter so those companies
restricted access or cut off access to
geofeedia as soon as they were cold yeah
right but I will say this is that it
really hurts a lot of like political
movements you know those that are born
on Facebook and Twitter and you know
organized through those so it does deal
the blow to those and you know right
people might want to organize on
different websites as a result alright
so for more on those stories check us
out on CNN I'm Roger Cheng I'm alfred
Aang thanks for listening and right out
the gate I think we can you've already
kind of covered this but just to
reclassify this is not for pre the
Amazon music this is not for pre
existing prime customers know the only
the only benefit is that you'll get a $2
discount if you're a Prime customer so
this is a standalone music service again
it is a legit service that is on par
with what Apple music and what Spotify
offers so that's not and not the prime
music that you have now your
subscription but is it built upon that
similar or same prime library
no no dependent much wire library ok
that's that's another big
question my music library is restricted
I think everyone knows this very right
it's because you're not paying extra for
it
so they're just sort of giving you and
we've talked about this the service
isn't that great the user interface
isn't that great it's kind of confusing
to use yeah this new app that they
created for Music Unlimited is much
cleaner simpler and has access to a much
much wider library music that's
interesting though that that inputted
underneath the Prime umbrella I thought
that they would have done that only
because Amazon usually likes to keep its
the ecosystem all all in together always
better incentive you know more than a
two dollar discount yeah yeah well I
mean look that's where the I think
they're experimenting with different
models as you saw that with the four
dollar plan that I mean that they're
really trying to push the echo hard
there's there's a different kind of mode
of motivation here for Amazon I'm
interested to see anyone in the chat
what music services you have preferred
we a have a lot of people who are fans
of Apple we have a lot of people fans of
Spotify I've actually dabbled in a lot
of them myself yeah just be having a
colossal library I'm on my own and
looking for contingency plans because I
have lost that life or due to an
unfortunately placed mountain Dew bottle
oh no I will say YouTube red is a very
underrated music service oh yes yeah
like YouTube has like a huge selection
of music yes you know some of them might
be not supposed to be on YouTube but
yeah I mean it's there right listen to
it so as of right now I myself stick
pretty loyally to Spotify I've just yeah
an inbred and the same I'm enjoying it I
have yet to really be disappointed by
you pay for Spotify I do actually and I
I find the price to be pretty
comfortable thing about Spotify what
sort of sets it apart from everyone else
is it's the only one with that free tier
right it's and that's I think that's
what gets people and to Spotify a lot
easier of that but with all the rest of
them you so pay ten dollars up front but
yeah but if I like I'm on I'm on the
free tier I didn't pay for Spotify in a
long time but it's good enough for me I
mean aside from the occasional ad that
kicks in every half-hour I mean it's
pretty handy yeah when you're DJing
weddings DJing ard definitely I like to
actually have access to that on the fly
it's fast downloads the quality is fine
it's no no loss list but it's right
pretty okay I can live with it but whose
losses are just title losses yeah I
think the average like listener I can't
really even tell the difference correct
especially like it again like I say I'm
using in party scenarios where the
fidelity is not too high is concerned
right liquors flowing exactly really the
fidelity is not priority I'm not gonna
walk up to you hey there's a little
exactly it's not truly lossless quality
what's going on here I really like
Google Play as well oh yeah I jumped
right on that bandwagon as soon as I
came out years ago
and then I hit the ceiling with the
uploads which I know has sense increased
and I have yet to get back and fix my
yeah library but that was where I kind
of like they lost me was I have way more
than that could handwrite I at the time
I think of all of the music services I
think Google Play Music probably has
like the best playlists I mean they they
pretty much just took over songs uh yeah
yeah and I'd been using songs there for
a really long time so do they and sorry
I'm not as familiar with Google Play
Music is it the same model where it's
like all you can eat or all you could
listen to well I was attracted to
because you could upload yours okay
modify - that's true but it's more of
like a cloud syncing this is more like a
like a store worried yeah yeah and again
when I've already lost my entire library
was due to an action I take no risks
anymore but if you're going in with no
library at all what free does is the
best service like what is the one that
you feel has the most access to music I
go to Spotify to find stuff I don't have
I occasionally dabble around YouTube to
try to find the real dark horse buried
rare type stuff and it's it's it's
ever-changing cuz they like they gain
and lose licenses all the time the
libraries are constantly changing and
I'm always wondering which which service
has the best library it could be just
I'd be up to your personal reference I
would argue it to youtube if you're
gonna because the crowdsource yeah
pretty much I mean it's not all that
legit yeah yeah Spotify prop I mean
Apple music probably has the best
library and I think you can count on it
always being there was especially with
some of the exclusives yeah yeah a lot
of people do miss the the other
services not having the free tier yeah I
mean that was something that Spotify
kind of hammered out ahead of time like
now that's that's locked up like no one
else is doing it mm-hmm
I really I don't mind me honestly they
don't I don't either they use the right
algorithm in traffic try to sell me
stuff I want way awful ads on Spotify oh
you're like really bad I didn't think
they were so bad I I hate when they do
the like the promo filler stuff yeah
there's a journal answer I always I
always got car commercials or like how
to fix her car cons things that I've
never googled car about there they're
the one that car companies always buy
the I guessed yeah say overs yeah you're
gonna get that no matter what because
this is America damn it this is all
you're driving Leonard in the chat what
is what is K box we have not heard of it
if you guys are of k box as a streaming
service no Leonard Phyllis in yeah what
is you're interested in Leonard hope
it's not something dirty
Randall asks what about you music it's a
direct enemy of Spotify an apple don't
you think I'm assuming you mean YouTube
music again oh right unless there's
something called you mean I'm unaware
like you use the letter or use in y-o-u
why are you you YouTube music I guess um
well if it is YouTube music I'm gonna
say that you know I think YouTube has
the largest library out of 30 there you
go KK box sorry I said it's not K box
kkbox I misread his original message oh
it's an Asian music collection
oh is it region-locked is it available
internationally or is the K for like
karaoke yeah what does what what are the
letters mean but there's two kids where
their surveys and karaoke we're
intrigued yeah
Hyrule and Leonard we are very
interested in finding out more about
this yeah cuz actually I don't this
there's certain songs certain like j-pop
k-pop songs that I can't get on Spotify
yeah right yes they're definitely on
youtube there's a great anime playlist
on Spotify that I put on
yes sir yeah I just did to my girlfriend
do you need to share with me cuz I might
I would actually genuinely appreciate
that there's that and like on Soundcloud
soundcloud there's musicians that speak
of like self-sustaining ecosystems like
SoundCloud is kind of its own beast yeah
that you're not going there to find
necessarily chart-topping music specific
genres you're going there as like an
electronic typically not exclusively fan
DJ's or mix clouds welcome Natalie
SoundCloud is my favorite place to find
like joke songs and meme songs Joe yeah
there's like all these like Seinfeld
like remixes on cloud and it's hilarious
there and then all these joke rappers
that are on soundcloud like oh that's
great i use it like that's why that my
second most used music up well I like
SoundCloud as a discovery service they
have real fun algorithms like I'll just
start and let it kind of go down that
rabbit hole when I just like I don't
know what I want to listen to I'm
looking for something yeah something
different surprise me that's what I
appreciate SoundCloud for yeah it's a
good place to listen to indie artists
too that India is surely I find a lot of
great dance on there the rapper got
started on soundcloud also right yep
yeah now look at him yeah no kidding
yeah oh I lost my train of thought is
gonna say something more about well i've
it has anyone ever used Mixcloud know
it's like come catered more towards like
full DJ sets but there's also like no
holds bar I've put podcasts like old
podcast used to produce up there I
remember when music streaming sites
there was like kind of like a wild wild
west kind of thing there was like
Grooveshark and my restaurant teams yeah
tune in still around really yeah yeah
but tunings more for streaming radio
yeah
not again not exclusively but that's
largely what it's radio and the internet
let's go way back go way back to the
origins and who used certain download
clients that we may want oh yeah I don't
think I can say this on live on-air
sure we can I can say yeah it was bad
user Napster Kazaa cos ah I used all of
them there was bare cher LimeWire
frostwire bear I don't know
and I was supposed to be like the clean
version of it but I think I didn't use
it ma'am
no no generation now will ever
understand the risk of giving your
computer cancer just to get it was not
it was not a great time I mean that's
how I discovered some of my favorite
bands back in like high school and I
mean I will say this though like vote
that risk is the reason why I'm like so
like I became like technologically like
literate yeah things where I'd see
something like oh there's no way this
song is only like 15 like kilobytes like
it's gonna be some other thing oh yeah
that's also kind of how I figure out how
to like that's true like like that's how
you found out about like sample rates
yeah it's like I wouldn't have even
known about you know like my computers
like registry Keys if I weren't trying
to get rid of viruses on my own oh wow
because I wasn't like how am I gonna
tell my parents had tried like putting
the song on my computer and I got a
virus oh I was like I just fixed it on
my own
yeah nice oh man that was terrifying
time what I mean you learned from it
right but you know what we take away
from it too and this is something I say
all the time like give me an excuse to
pay for this content yeah yeah why these
TV and music service put their stuff
behind them not just paywall that's a
problem that you still try to figure out
it's like how do you reprogram people to
think music actually has value to it
like it's not all free look I'm happy to
pay for Spotify because I'm happy with
the service and the giant selection I
can get on if it granted they need to
work on how they're actually paying the
artists out cuz there's a lot of
controversy surrounding that's ado we
don't need to get into now but you know
it's the same like we wouldn't have
torrents if you would just let me find
the episodes of the TV shows I want kind
of thing yeah yeah yeah you know
rhetorically of course yeah that videos
its own I mean what's own best we don't
want to give that rabbit hole today
Michael wants to know what we think is
what is needed for a music streaming
platform to be the absolute best whose
offline listening free listening moment
ears what are like the essential
ingredients to the perfect streaming
recipe Wow
well we all blind streaming is the Vegas
thing yeah yeah like an offline mode
would be great a fridge here
because not everyone's gonna want to pay
and the only way to hook no people in is
to have that free tier and the figure
out how to better traffic those ads yeah
that's true
smarter more appropriate ads but it
would always be appreciated yeah tell me
something I want yeah because I mean
it's I'm okay with ads that are actually
helpful generally yeah good yeah if it's
ads for cars and you don't own a car
then maybe that's why I'm getting ads
for cars though because they're like it
knows that you just you haven't searched
for a car in a while yeah but yeah as
far as like I do think Apple music has
like a lot of these elements that like
make like a top tier music app but I
think I just think it's although I feel
like the user interface for Apple music
is still calm yeah I when I when I first
started using it it had the whole weird
like tutorial thing it well the initial
version of Apple music I felt was so
complicated to use there were so many
different like levels that you had to
get into just to like access the
playlists or add a song to a playlist
that it wasn't really weighted to me I
will say this I really did like and this
might be good news for you know the echo
dot and this new or just the echo in
general and this new music streaming
service that they have you know I really
liked controlling Apple music theory
that yeah that was so actually that's
one of the main highlights for this
Amazon music and limited features that
they were really pushing the whole voice
command thing like you could you play
the sort of like that you could sort of
rattle off a few words from the lyrics
and like have it see if they can guess
the song so there they really put a lot
of effort into kind of making the voice
command the central feature of that echo
package or that echo option so I don't
know I mean that there might be some
people families who might invest in that
right it's just maybe they don't need it
for their phones but it's sort of a
central hub in the home you know you
know would make a music app you know to
me top tier at least if it had a Netflix
like feature where you know you can make
profiles for other people that log on to
them yeah because you can't do that
modify if I log in on it and someone
else tries logging and I get logged out
and if there's like a shareability you
kind of I mean you have the multiple
devices it was the same thing like it's
an organizational type but no you can't
both be logged in at the same time but
there's a multiple account option there
but if I have like a family plan I think
but everyone like it's still like go
like just Alfred yeah oh really
yeah yeah you would have to have your
own account and you pay for it on your
own with your own I think that's a great
idea
there you know some people brought up
stuff like exclusive albums and I I mean
I think that's a very subjective right
consideration I don't like the exclusive
things on streaming services I think
it's killing like you're gonna drive
people to its cannibalizing yeah you're
gonna drive people to wanna like pirate
music again again if you do that yeah
what happened well that's exactly is
like oh I need I'm signing up for sling
TV but I need to have a Time Warner
account to get this shows episodes kind
of things yeah like there were all the
like last year there were a lot of
albums that came out you know
exclusively on tide or exclusively on
Apple music like Kanye West's album you
know the life the problem when I was
exclusively on tidal
yep got illegally downloaded like
millions of times the same thing
happened to Frank Ocean I'm right and
then you know we haven't we hadn't seen
reports like this for a while when it
was all over and everywhere but then
then it started having these exclusively
on this app and then you know here come
all the illegal download yeah and if you
still use an iPod Nano you can have
access to FM radio if you recall that I
do still use an iPod Nano it's funny
that there's FM FM radio classic radio
really in here yeah
I do listen I listen to what I'm like
walking and I'm like because it's an
iPod I'm generally I'm tired of these
songs that I had yeah yeah but I keep it
for when I'm on the train cuz I don't
pay for any of these other subscription
like you know Spotify all this stuff so
I don't have offline listening so it's
basically when I'm on the subway and I'm
underground I have no reception I listen
to that because I can't stand listening
to people talking on the train
look at that Wow all these decades later
an FM radio still hanging out oh yeah
I'm a radio junkie I'm a fan like that's
how I was raised it's how I ended up
here where I'm doing this crap so
alright no there's been a great a great
conversation very interesting stuff guys
we're definitely gonna check out kkbox
com
