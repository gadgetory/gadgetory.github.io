but most of them require an iPhone to be
paired with it to make them work that
doesn't mean it can't do things without
your iPhone there are a handful that it
can do pretty well you can sync music
from your iPhone onto the Apple watch up
to 2 gigabytes of it and then from there
if you want to listen to it you're going
to have to pair bluetooth headphones to
it because there is no headphone jack
you can listen to tracks look at artists
or shuffle songs on the go you can also
use fitness apps apple's activity and
workout apps work without the iphone
other third-party apps don't for now in
the future they might you can track your
steps your distance and even look at
your heart rate or you can pair a
bluetooth heartrate monitor like a chest
strap on the go and apple's workouts app
allows you to time workouts and look at
your pace distance all on the go the
only thing it doesn't do is check gps
that it needs your iPhone for and
finally Apple pay you set up Apple pay
independently from your iPhone but
through the Apple watch app once that's
done the credit card information is
stored on the Apple watch no iPhone
necessary and you can take it to any
store that supports Apple pay and use it
with a double click it's extremely easy
to use there are a few more things you
can do too you can look at photos on the
photo app you can read downloaded emails
you can even check voicemails that have
synced on to the Apple watch and you can
set timers and use the clocks hopefully
in the future there will be more but
that's what the Apple watch can do
without an iPhone
