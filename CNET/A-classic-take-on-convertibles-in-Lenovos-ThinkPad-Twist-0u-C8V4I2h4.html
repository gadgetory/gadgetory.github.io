a look at the lenovo thinkpad twist now
even though the system has the thinkpad
name from lenovo not more
consumer-friendly ideapad game it's
actually got some of the features that
we've seen on those ideapad laptops that
are maybe a little more design heavy a
little more consumer friendly it's got
the flat top island-style keyboard with
those little kind of convex cut out to
the bottom of the keys that you find a
lot on a lot of lenovo systems these
days makes typing a lot easier it's got
a big button free click pad which I
always liked better than let's say
having a separate left and right mouse
button although you still do have the
extra set of mouse buttons up here for
the track point that has still not gone
away yet still there if you need it and
it's got some nice rounded corners and a
cool matte black finish so for a
thinkpad it's pretty design heavy
thinkpad kind of like the inch line that
lenovo has but much more important than
that because this is a Windows 8 laptop
it is a touchscreen laptop see it goes
like that just put your finger on it and
even more important than that it is a
convertible laptop something actually
the Lenovo and thinkpad we're doing for
many years before Windows 8 made touch
screens and convertibles kind of cool
for windows again it's called the twist
which means that you can take the screen
and you twist it around like that now in
this mode maybe I'd call that kind of a
kiosk mode so you can maybe play a movie
here show a PowerPoint presentation
without having the keyboard in the way
it's sort of a good presentation mode
but then you take the screen you fold it
all the way back and then you have got
basically a tablet and it's not the
thinnest or lightest tablet in the world
but it's certainly a little more
easy-to-handle then let's say the lenovo
ideapad yoga which has a screen that
bends all the way back but then leaves
the keyboard exposed on the back here in
this case the keyboard is hidden is
probably a nicer overall tablet
experience than the yoga and of course
you just twist it to bring it back and
that is why of course it's called the
Lenovo twist the other thing I liked
about this is that with a basic core i5
configuration and the touchscreen like
you see here it's actually only 899 and
this is a premium looking and feeling
laptop for 899
that makes up for some of the flaws like
let's say having a lower resolution 1366
x 768 screen i'm dan ackerman and that
is the thinkpad twist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
