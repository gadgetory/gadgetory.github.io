fleet of flying cameras over the past
year and at the top of its ready-to-fly
line up is the inspire one and it's
awesome why is that well for starters it
looks amazing like a flying cow skull
with carbon-fiber legs that
automatically lift up and out of the way
when it takes off that means they won't
get in the way of the 4k resolution
camera with its gimbal that keeps the
camera steady and rotates a full 360
degrees and tilts 125 degrees while
grabbing excellent video and photos the
camera is also removable so there's
upgrade potential down the road and
there's a mount that will let you use it
handheld flying the inspire one indoors
it's easier thanks to a set of sensors
underneath and when it's outside the
improved GPS keeps it hovering wherever
you leave it and guides it back to you
at the press of a button the controller
delivers a steady live HD video feed
from the drones camera from more than a
mile away to an external display or a
mobile device it also has physical
camera controls and can be paired with a
second controller so one person can
pilot while another controls the camera
so all of that awesome what's not so
awesome is battery life maxing out at 18
minutes and an extra batteries running
about a hundred and sixty dollars or you
can hand over $200 for one that gets up
to 22 minutes and there's also the price
of the quadcopter itself which is $2,900
with one controller or 3400 with two you
could read the full review on sitcom but
basically the DJI inspire 1 handles like
a dream but the costs put it into pro
and deep-pocketed enthusiast territory
I'm Josh Goldman who's seen it thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
