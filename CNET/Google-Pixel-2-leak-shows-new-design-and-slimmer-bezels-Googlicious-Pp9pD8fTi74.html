welcome to Google issues for all the
Google you can think of the big drop
this week comes from Android police who
posted the first renders of what's
believed to be the 2017 pixel XL it's
the larger phone of the two pixel phones
codenamed Timon now the rear edges are
still curved the fingerprint sensor sits
below the glass window and the front
features a six inch AMOLED display with
minimal bezels and rounded corners it's
also believed to have a squeezable frame
similar to the HTC u 11 that will allow
you to interact with the Google
assistant now this pixel XL render based
on their information clearly looks like
a modern design phone throw in pure
Android the Google assistant and if they
can maintain their status as best camera
come on you've got another great phone
by Google here so we'll wait for the
official announcement but this can be
taken seriously with android police's
track record all right the Galaxy s8 is
arguably the best Android phone at the
moment but according to the Korea Herald
in the first two months the s8 sold
roughly 9.8 million units compared to 12
million units in that same time for the
galaxy s7 si that's about a 20% drop now
there's a lot of factors here one of the
big ones increased competition from
Chinese brands and people even waiting
on the iPhone 8 as an option but
remember Samsung was bragging about its
record pre-orders before the phone went
on sale now they're telling the herald
that the s8 started selling in three key
markets compared to the s7 that sold
globally so they won't compare the two
and in case you found the workaround to
use the s8 Bixby button to launch a
different app because that's really what
everyone wants to do with it Samsung has
released their latest update that shuts
down any of those methods now including
even the Bigsby button remap wrap now
baked sweet voice is set to come out in
a few more weeks but imagine if they got
the software right from the start didn't
delay it at launch and it was actually
an assistant that people wanted to use
instead they're blocking people from
using the button they put on their own
phone and you know what that gets come
on some and the first commercial for the
sh dex desktop dock is out in yes we've
seen similar things like other phones in
the past
for example the Motorola Atrix or even
recently Windows continuum phones but
it's the first mainstream push that's
getting an actual TV ad but how many
people are really going to do this right
now
not that many just not yet all right
Google is launching a brand new
initiative called pair which stands for
people plus AI research get it
Pai are now their goal is to study and
redesign the ways people interact with
AI systems and if there's any company
that can do this right it's Google with
all of their knowledge and their
expertise in AI for example the Google
assistant and Google lense is just the
start their goal is to also build an AI
that benefits and empowers everyone and
treats users equally without prejudices
now this sounds like a huge undertaking
but I got to give props to a company
that actually identifies this as
important with AI being the next
platform in the tech world ok Google's
Project loon hit a speed bump after a
key patent was cancelled by the US
Patent and Trademark Office Project loon
is their free-floating Wi-Fi balloon
project to deliver Wi-Fi in remote areas
from the sky Google's patent was for
increasing or decreasing the altitude of
their balloons until they hit winds
traveling the direction they want it to
go
the balloons themselves have no form of
propulsion and this method would help
keep them hovering in one place now
wired reports another company called
space data says they came up with it
first and the Gube sivan had acquisition
talks with that company back in 2007 now
the patent has been cancelled and a
trial is set for 2019 between the two so
yeah that sounds like fun
and finally Android wear users now have
a luxury option thanks to Louis
Vuitton's first Android wear watch the
tambour horizon it's rocking a
Snapdragon wear 2100 512 Meg's a ram
with four gigs of storage there's no
heart rate monitor but a one-point 2
inch round AMOLED display isn't that so
pretty now Graham brow models start at
two thousand four hundred and fifty
dollars and a black model you know the
most common Universal color starts at
2900 and I dug around their website to
find this fancy charger which will most
definitely cost more than $30 all right
that's gonna do it for this week you can
email me at Google assist at cnet.com
we're tweeting at brian tom thanks so
much for watching
I won't catch all next time for some
more of that google issues</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
