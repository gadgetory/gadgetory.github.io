november seven november seventeenth i
just said it out right before we started
i'm already lost so all right we're done
shut it down goodnight number 17 oh my
god it is no the last Friday is next
week yes oh wait no Thanksgiving too
yeah really get excited most American
thing I've ever heard sorry everybody
America merica America's what do we
what's great about America blood running
above you America speaking of America
what are we talking about today what
Zach not America we are talking about
sex that's oh my god better you can be
able to get to this without giggling no
but it's so why it's a big deal no we're
gonna talk about a recent survey that
found that the nearly four in 10
Americans would give up a year of sex uh
for a lifetime of free of hacks
guaranteed free of hacks the cyber cyber
cyber okay getting a lifetime observer
survey of a hypothetical right okay I
mean look it's it's a legit survey
harris poll did it I was completion it
was commissioned by scientific it was
commissioned by a password management
company so okay it's not surprising but
still weird over time on that we'll talk
about Qualcomm's latest flagship chip
Snapdragon 835 and why you should care
about it there are reasons and not just
like super kinky reasons I don't then I
understand which we'll talk about on the
show we will talk about I then lastly
we're going talking about Firefox's new
browser for the iphone the Firefox focus
up which blocks ad tracking technology
which is no nice if you want to look at
procedure let's speed things up beat
things and also speed things up and
privacy right perhaps they market
themselves and that privacy browser e
all right let's uh let's get it going if
you have any questions as always leave
them in the comments section Brian Wolfe
will pick them out and we'll do our best
to answer them alrighty we'll get this
podcast recorded be back to answer your
questions in three minutes and 59
seconds starting from 32 welcome to the
359 when we talk about the top tech news
of the day and all the crap of the crap
number we're just gonna start that over
again take it up pick it up welcome to
the 359 where we talked about the top
tech news of the day and all the other
crappy the hell are you serious yeah
it's you know I'll a you're going on
going into vacation mode or I am sorry
guys I'm like some of us are stuck here
let's get this done hutch sorry yeah
I've already checked out mentally
apparently sorry all right um welcome to
the 359 when we talk about the top tech
news of the day only the crap we want to
throw in I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox
Rubin would you give up sex for one year
in exchange for a guaranteed lifetime
free from hacks nearly four in ten
Americans say yes according to a harris
poll commissioned by password management
company dashlane the numbers illustrate
just how important the cyber as our
president elect would put it is
important to our lives then is this
something you would give up oh come on
that's what you're gonna ask yeah yeah
I'm a serious journalist I swear oh
nothing magnetical your life that's a
hypothetical when we see in that place
is fun calls are often wrong yes but
it's a fun question that's an
interesting question and obviously as
you said conveys the fact that you know
hacks are becoming much more prevalent
and people are very concerned about them
to actually ask people if they'd give up
sex over them I think which is on one
extreme but but it's also kind of
standard survey type question totally
always hear the whole I would give up
sex for whatever right so in this case
it is for a lifetime free of hacks
that's I don't know it's not bad it's an
interesting trade-off of that could
actually be guaranteed I think what's
good about the survey is is that it is
trying to highlight the fact that people
aren't practicing safe cyber yes so they
should be doing a better job with that
what are some of the things that we can
tell our viewers that they should do to
improve their cyber absolutely welcome I
mean this is partly why dash line put it
put this pull together right they
basically want
folks using password management
companies like dash okay right sure but
you could also like change your password
around race different password more
complicated password more complicated
passwords can all be one two three four
five which is still the number one
password used in though in America
unbelievable also uh one of my favorite
passwords password it's so literal I
know I would like you whatever it's
anyways we talked about that a lot
moving on next next Qualcomm unveiled
its flagship Snapdragon 835 chip
yesterday most likely will make its way
to flagship phones like the samsung
galaxy s 8 uses a 10 nanometer
manufacturing process I mean believable
very exact ben and i are excited about
the it's a fancy way of saying that
they're packing it even more transistors
more processing power into a smaller
chip ultimately leading to a phone that
is smaller thinner faster faster and can
last longer bet ya last longer because
he uses less energy right and there's
the marquee benefit speaking of energy
is quick charge four-point-oh which lets
you get up to five hours of battery life
on a five-minute charge right so I can
understand why people might not get too
excited about this because it's like a
continuation of speeds and feeds or
anybody expects this kind of thing just
found a chip it's just another chip and
but it's always helpful to remember that
these are the types of win-win wins that
you do get with the improvements in
nodes and you know 10 nanometer
technology is going to help you get a
lot of benefits out of your smartphone
unless by the way unless you're not
iphone user because this Qualcomm
processor is not going to be in the
iPhone because Apple makes or designs
its own processor maybe they'll do 10
nanometer how often do they talk about
10 nanometer on silent era bad at all
because that's not fit for actual normal
people right except for except for us
and our beloved beloved 359 audience so
lastly want to talk about Mozilla
releasing a new browser for iphones and
ipads called the firefox focus mm-hmm
you know it's there pushing it as the
privacy browser because it is designed
to block ads from tracking your web
activities right and not only is a
privacy but it is supposed to actually
speed up your web browsing which
I think is really helpful one thing that
you're definitely not going to get with
chrome right because Google makes so
much of its money off of ads it's
obviously it seems very unlikely to me
that they're going to create ad blocking
technology for that now there are other
ad blocking browsers brave and opera off
for the same kind of features they're
not as well known so Firefox Elise is
kind of known quantities so give it a
shot it's out now it's check it out of
the app store just a note will be going
on hiatus next week to really celebrate
thanksgiving and black friday mmm but
we'll be back the following week so for
more about these stories check us out
and Cena I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox
ribbon thanks for listening all right
Michael how'd we do Michaels in the chat
timing us know Oh way long way long but
then we had a disclaimer next ten
seconds off on their ya make it fast
that's pretty good that's lets you know
that early bird in 30 seconds try to see
the intros trying to say that helps trap
yeah here's also a good question for
Michael what if you can choose what's
getting hacked so like some people might
not care if my netflix get tacked right
and then you only have to credit card or
PayPal that would suck oh well and then
you would only have to forego sex for
what six months so we're getting into a
degree and sex for actually yeah I'd
love that I'd love to see from our
readers like how like what is the length
of sex what you get would you give up
for that lifetime of cybersecurity maybe
it's not a year maybe it's less maybe
it's six months maybe it's a week I
don't know what it's a week what is your
what is your threshold I'll remind you
that we were talking about 10 nanometer
earlier today so I don't know how much
any of us are having sex uh-huh Michael
also says he's excited for the Qualcomm
samsung chip hope they don't have any
exploding issues with it that is
definitely true they did have their own
issues before note right um before what
oh no yeah definitely Rosalie that
dragonship before were had the reports
that they overheated that is absolutely
not a year ago those were uh that was
that was back when I was covering chip
so that was yeah year year and a half
ago yeah so I think that was with the
snap jag Dragon II 20 or 80
I know I think it was the 801 820 was
last year's or this year's it was in the
galaxy s7 yeah so that no one before
that there were you can see a lot of
overheating rumors and stories about it
I don't know that we ever actually got
down to finding out whether it was
something negative that was floated
right about Snapdragon or that it was in
fact like serious over here all we know
is last year's samsung mysteriously
dropped samsung or qualcomm from its
lineup in terms of chips powering his
phone and then this year it came back
and yeah and they're working together so
speaking of that michael says it's nice
as he major companies still willing to
work with samsung despite their
struggles yeah well huge platform yeah
and in terms of this i mean they are
they're working with qualcomm is working
on samsung to manufacture the chip and
it's they've had a pretty long-standing
partnership from a chip manufacturing
perspective as well right just not just
using chips in the phone but Bradley
sampling she built those things yeah in
qualcomm really does need samsung
they're a really important partner with
them and samsung buys the whole chip the
whole Snapdragon trip which is both the
processor and the radio as opposed to
Apple which only buys the radio which
isn't as profitable for Qualcomm so
Qualcomm is definitely going to do as
much as it can to maintain that
relationship as we've already seen so
first up four minutes and 22 seconds
today Wow it was pretty bad you can join
that up yeah I stopped talking after you
said fire fox fox focus partly because
it's hard to say that firefox focus yeah
say that three times fast scanning the
chat we got a lot of knows when not give
up sex for anything all right ah there
you go but i'm happy to hear that there
are some people in the chat who would in
fact there are some who are in fact a
sexual and i'm curious then what would
you give up for cybersecurity hi okay
what cream no we don't ice cream nope
hahaha no way haha here come the lactose
intolerant uh um so here is a good
question what what do you think is the
best browser now i'm gonna go ahead and
curtail that towards mobile since we're
talking about the firefox phone what
what do you prefer I
actually I still tend to use safari just
because it links up with a lot of the
other Apple services whether it's you
know clipboard or whatever like it all
kind of ties together a lot better i
mean i switch between that and chrome
yeah i use safari because of defaults
but I don't like safari so I try to use
chrome as often as possible I am trying
to just Firefox focus yeah pretty
interested in it yeah definitely I think
it definitely it's it's I haven't used
firefox and the early as often as I used
to firefox used to be my default browser
on pc for the year it was for a lot of
for a lot of people and then chrome
showed up and chrome stole that market
from them it was way fast but a murders
absolutely murders your resources yeah
yeah so if firefox which i think they
were very smart to do this if they
rightly start focusing on speeding
things up through ads that's an area
that Google is just not gonna fight them
on because yeah just it's there's no way
chrome i think is going to google spring
butter well they do provide the ad block
or extension right so it's not like it's
completely they avoid it entirely but at
the same time if you can just download
the browser and you could just use it
right out of the box obviously people
are probably going to like that a little
bit more right we've got fans of opera
and spanning up from that what do you
think about browsers are for android
since you guys are for referring to your
iphone experiences you know what I for
my like for my samsung fine I tend to
use default browser Chrome maybe we're
just lazy people just 10 feet or chrome
is the default on Android yeah yeah yeah
okay obviously yeah that makes sense I
haven't used opera or brave we should
really get stephen shankland in here
because he is the the true browser
expert probably in the tech torque
hoarding world probably just like in the
world in the world I get reporting right
like he probably knows more about
browsers than folks at Mozilla yeah yeah
yeah so I and and I've seen some of the
studies I think chrome is very much the
default for most people these days and
we'll see because its default on Android
right yeah and we'll see if this really
does help Firefox I think they've been
trying to keep themselves relevant and
this this to me sounds like it could
actually
it kind of struggled on the mobile side
allow them have like opera I know I know
some people use opera because it is a
pretty fast browser on the phone it was
known as sort of like a desktop browser
and now it's like or sort of it was a
mobile browser as well but just not for
like the smartphone age and so these
guys have been kind of slow to embrace
mobile in a real way and so it's that's
why you don't see a lot people using it
yeah I mean a lot of this kind of spans
from loyalty I mean I I live my life on
Google so I like chrome obviously
integration with my calendar same deal
like Safari I feel like they'll
everything integrates wells as far as
one uses slower though I really have I
don't really like Safari that much to
use at all if I can help it my own why
you switch the chrome I do I use I use
chrome almost entirely but like when you
do click through sometimes Safari will
do it'll it'll pop up Safari I like
Safari and opera only because they eat
the least amount of RAM mmm yeah I
wonder Firefox had ever break into their
own hardware for the sake of INEC well
they tried for a while Firefox phone
they did that happened I completely
missed that boat was a face mask on one
not really like they were like maybe one
or two one offs that were built the
whole pitch for Firefox phone was it was
super cheap mm-hmm and it was an
operating system built along the same
kind of web architecture that Firefox is
built on and no one really bought it so
it kind of got scrapped and it's done
gotcha and there yeah just kind of poor
business model home as well do you think
because of battery gate we unalike we've
been set free they're phrase i prefer
Ghazis for my taste battery noisy you
think because of better great we might
see some companies start experimenting
with other material for batteries like
hemp or hydrogen nothing hydrogen's a
step in the right direction if we're
gonna try to avoid explosion oh I'm I'm
how does that work I'm admittedly not a
battery expert however I think almost
all of the research going into battery
technology this these days is focused on
lithium ion yeah so yeah there are it's
not perfect there are resources being
put into sort of next gen bio tech but
we're talking like at MIT like at
research facilities were like most of
the stuff is theoretical
or will be practical for years yes so a
lot of it is that's why right now in
terms of innovation the only innovation
in batteries is making it bigger that's
that's it like bright you want more
better life will give you a bigger
battery that's basically it there's no
real easy fix right now because it's
also the entire industries come built
around within my own batteries to move
to a new battery technology would
require like a kind of wholesale change
from everyone and as you can see with
other tech transitions that's really
difficult and painful and so it's easier
for a lot of people stick with
lithium-ion yeah obviously lithium-ion
got a bad rap not only from the samsung
phone but I think lithium-ion batteries
were the reason those hoverboards we're
exploding so the it's not a perfect
system at all but I think as you said
the entire tech industry is built around
it so I think they're going to try to
continue to improve lithium-ion as
opposed to going with some of those more
experimental concepts that the reader
mentioned and you know if you got things
like quick charge that sort of helps
offset the pain of you know the better
life being as limited as it is right
yeah so i wouldn't mind having that on
iphone otherwise quite charge charge
yeah yeah like that's one of those one
of those features that are on android
phones now that kind of wish Apple
incorporated I could definitely use that
especially after a two-year old iphone
that hardly barely or the charge yeah
the percent by the guy I would argue
that like even on an android phone like
a two-year android phone yeah but like
be is a fun quick charge makes it like
less painful like charger in a day even
though it's you'll see you like little
see like but I can't change for you to
other topics before shut it down for the
day do we know of any other browsers
besides opera that come with integrated
VPN uh I gained shankland yeah I don't
wish Steve Jenks is good just go bug
share it on Twitter much fun very good
question but asked Steven st shank just
ask him or Twitter yeah he'll probably
ask us we'd love to answer yeah yeah and
we talk about privacy and browsing what
about incognito is that actually safe as
they're actually real privacy there yeah
I mean speaking of giving up sex so down
I was wondering when we were gonna be
actually yeah they said it's an abstract
stream and I just brought it full circle
there you go yeah um there are
disclosures when you open incognito that
there are still certain cookies and
there you're there are different lor
subs you are vulnerable to like malware
and it's not a security not blank
security right it's like it'll bite your
history it's not going to track your
history but there are other things that
are being tracked so yeah it's it's not
impervious to being tracked at all nope
nope nope um one last shout out and
thank you too so that he points out that
hemp can provide a better ampere told
and longer-lasting discharged and
lithium ion and the cost of production
is astronomically lower that we know
that we obviously know that's so you
know if you you know that I didn't know
that I didn't know anything about it
okay that I was in calera see theory but
the industry itself is a lot of Miss
potential so Brian knows let's just make
that clear Brian you that we did not
know that a lot of people know that I
sir I i would bet you if you ask ten
people in the street you get maybe seven
people looking at you really what am
used to hemp batteries that hemp yeah
that hemp holds a better amperage and
his would be cheaper to produce as a
better it would be cheaper to produce
ism now I've never really understood the
technology or the the science behind
hemp being used as a energy storage
device but as far as its versatility
that's pretty common knowledge I also
told you why I am learning something
today I didn't know any of this okay no
not going to present to be some kind of
expert in it but it's one of those
things where you browse enough headlines
you see enough stuff about him when you
start to pick up a few things mm-hmm I
mean I know him can be used for a lot of
things I didn't realize a battery would
be one I did not know that either I'm
not a surprise heart was made from hemp
that shirt know was how you got that
shirt for my gap or something close
enough alright we're at it let's wrap it
up there again as uh just a reminder
we're gonna be off next week yeah and
then I'll be back just my saddlebag
Roger Wilkins an Alfred Joan will be
back as well as a various rotating
rotation of special guest but i'll be
out for the next two weeks mm-hmm we
will miss you and
yeah we'll be on hiatus so enjoy
thanksgiving black friday the long
weekend will be better those you
celebrate neither of those things yeah
enjoy the week we'll see you in a while
that'll be back for cyber money to talk
about cyber monday action I didn't sure
i will be alright all the savings if you
like anything you saw or heard here
check us out on cnet our podcast social
