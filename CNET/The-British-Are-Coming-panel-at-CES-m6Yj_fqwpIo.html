UK and welcome to the British are coming
a quick look at what our little island
has to offer the world of tech at CES
now I've got three fascinating guests in
the British tech companies coming up but
before we meet them I made a little film
that explains it all let's take a look
here I MLS Vegas a few days before the
show starts outside a typical British
home now I've been coming here for over
a decade to report on the latest trends
at CES but one country I never see very
much report on it's the UK but why is
that I thought I'd go out in the street
and ask a few people around them what
comes to mind when they think of the UK
dank skies and dismal days drinking wake
up very early in the morning and have a
spot of tea um I have to say rich yeah
you have nice cars Sid Vicious Johnny
Rotten I'll cook all those guys um we're
very very nice and my son just got back
from London and he said it was the best
curry he's ever had in his life he's
Britain a high-tech country ah Britain's
he's pretty low-tech country to me I'm
chime assuming it would be you have a
video camera that's pretty high-tech I
think that pretty neatly answers the
question about why we don't read too
much about British tech at CES but it's
a shame because historically Britain's
been involved in lots and lots of
inventions the hard questions are
British invention beer I'll say ale have
you heard of any British technologies oh
no have you heard of any British
invention oh no to that either British
technologies ah no the fingerprint let
me think here Big Ben um how about the
Louvre so are all of Britain's tech
giants in the distant past have we lost
our tech magic I've gathered together
people from Britain's gadget makers
entrepreneurs and inventors to hear what
their take is and what nawet Lyman has
to offer
world today let's head inside and see
what they have to say shall we well
those are the views of some random
people I found in Vegas let's see what
the people here have to say let's start
by introducing someone representing
Britain's gadget makers I've got Colin
Colin Crawford's open pure and a Buick
wireless music and internet radio system
supplies digital radios across Europe
and Australia and you're launching a
Wi-Fi speaker to rival sauna at CES
don't a little bit about it it's it's a
very affordable multi-room audio system
Jason called the jongo family this is
the sort of baby speaker in the range if
you like so it's a battery-powered main
time battery powered surround sound
bluetooth and Wi-Fi across the range as
well the key thing really is is the
multi room side of things so it's being
able to control and stream your music
from your smartphone or your tablet
which you know so many people want to do
these days so it's getting the
convenience of that and then delivering
it really beautifully so lovely audio
from your speakers perfectly
synchronized in one room or in multiple
rooms around your house um so I guess as
a British company how hard is it to
build a globally recognized brand that
people people we saw on the video might
recognize yes British invention
something like a telephone or you know
or a TV if anyone had mentioned any of
that but that would have been nice but
we didn't mend those not me but someone
over there I did it's pretty hard but
you know it's hard for anyone to build a
global brand that's Britain tends to be
really good at technology we we are
actually real technology boffins with
lots of very very clever people they're
developing clever stuff but what we
haven't been very good at certainly over
the last little while is is actually
coming up with consumer brands which
make it globally I mean I was trying to
think before we came on over of a global
British brand the one that came to mind
was Dyson actually and with our guys you
know what else is the right there some
brands that people might think we're
British something like Philips that's a
Dutch brand there aren't enough Global
British brands and it comes down to yeah
i think is it there's something in us
that really likes to get down to the
nitty
ready light likes to invent stuff but
then we give it away then we give it
away to two other people are we are we
license it to other people there's
plenty of British technology in things
which don't have British brands on them
and you know we'll talk to here in a
moment and you know and ourselves our
parent company actually licenses
technology which is in lots and lots of
devices out there but yeah unfortunately
the vast majority of the the brands that
those are in they aren't British brands
and your parent companies imagination
technologies which shares revenues about
two hundred million dollars a year and
then you better is that you can see you
around with that so why why that idea
what my kind of diversify if you're
doing ok by inventing mix well the
imaginations imagination want pure
effectively to to keep them honest we
say you know to what they really want is
a link a real solid link to the consumer
and you can get a little bit isolated as
a technology as an intellectual property
company being a bit too far away for the
consumer and certainly our CEO very very
much wants to have that hard link to a
company who have to struggle through the
difficulties of making you know kit that
has to be sold through retail and
dealing with all of that it helps us
understand that whole that whole chain
if you like and yeah and keeps us keeps
us very much in tune with what's
happening with consumers okay I think
this partnership bringing in a soil
representing Britain's ideas industry
and that's the injury you're the EVP of
marketing and business development at
arm now arm is probably Britain's
biggest tech success story your
technologies in everything from phones
to washing machines fella earlier but
you don't actually make anything so why
is that how do you actually go about
making money so I'm started 22 years ago
when the pc industry everybody was
making their own cpu chips so we
designed the BBC microcomputer which
most of the people of a certain age in
the UK will remember being their first
programmable machine at that stay screen
yeah at that stage you'll see lots of
CPU companies doing reasonably well but
nobody making any money and the Apple
came along and Newton's apple said we'd
like to license your design for the CPU
and have it made somewhere so we started
a cpu IP com company and we named it
armed acorn risc machines 22 years ago
and Apple being one of our first
partners then all of a sudden this IP
industry took off people wanted low
power and the phone industry when
digital went from analog to digital and
Nokia said we'd like a very low power
device and Nokia phone started growing
and arm was very very important in that
companies like TI and Qualcomm started
in that era and so for us we started in
the phone industry and then branched out
so ninety-five percent of all phones now
have chips in there designed by armed
same for tablets d TVs and set-top boxes
were in seventy plus percent of them so
armed partnership billions and billions
of units a year we're very much into
designing the IP we make no hardware we
sell that IP and we get a royalty back
and I think where Britain really comes
into this is taking that engineering
knowledge and creating new business
models we're not very good at the
branding side and I think the British
culture and technology of being fairly
low-key also doesn't help us there as
well but I think this whole technology
industry is very vibrant in the UK
although a bit more of an undercurrent
rather than at the leading edge do you
want to expand a bit on on the kind of
Cambridge site because you're yes where
your headquarters is and it's a center
of excellence with technology in the UK
key describing all the cultures like
what are the businesses like I there
what's going on that that maybe we
should know about what we don't want
exciting I'm Cambridge or silicon fen as
we like to call it just north of London
really the high tech center of the UK
there's hundreds of companies there that
do IP companies that you may have heard
of like autonomy we've just been bought
by HP very lot
very large there for us that whole
culture of angel investment really comes
into Cambridge ethos there's lots of
technology angels there and lots of
people starting small content companies
or IP companies spin-offs from
universities spin-offs from other other
companies in Cambridge that really
hasn't expanded outside of the outside
of Cambridge very much but there is a
culture there are small companies that
grow into slightly larger companies and
then being bought by American companies
or bought by European companies as we
grow so there's very much a culture of
inward investment via angel funding can
you think of I mean are there any
companies you can think of from the past
that maybe should have been bigger than
they were if they if the story it's been
different maybe then bought out just the
only kind of cusp of becoming great on
their own right or something there's two
its csr great company that I did very
well in the Bluetooth radio space
companies along those axis that could
have gone a lot more into the radio area
and grown there we see other companies
bought out for 20 million dollars that
you think if they were in America they
would have more and more investment and
will become really big silicon companies
of their own so for us I think we're
very good at that small start-up that
tends to get bought up by big
multinational rather than developing our
own multi-billion dollar consumer
electronics company the real company
that grew huge was autonomy but she's
been bought for seven and a half billion
by HP but that's really a unique
situation most most get to at 10 10 to
20 million dollars and then get sold two
big American companies okay let's bring
in my last guess is moment you're
representing the young startup kind of
culture in Britain rich tomato you're
the founder and CEO Blippar and Blippar
provides augmented reality to
advertisers so if you install the app
and point your point your phone at like
a bottle of ketchup or something it does
something really cool on the screen now
you've got around two million users
worldwide you've worked with
companies I naik dominoes Sony and more
but it will start to get big for you at
last year's CES when you want a free
place at the show from the UK government
can you can you tell us what that meant
for your company of course I mean the
body called UK trade investment in
Britain and they try and encourage
businesses inside Britain to glow global
so we entered a best startup competition
in Britain last year and we won the
first prize and the prize was an
explosion and international exposure to
an event like CES where you get to see a
whole large global audience of
businesses and consumers and it's a it's
a brilliant stage to showcase your
technology and the price was a team
coming to us everything paid for which
is brilliant for a start-up because it's
it's pretty unaffordable for for a young
company like us at least you're back and
since then we got tremendous traction in
us i would say CS was the single reason
behind us opening our offices in us this
summer and we've already worked with
brands like L'Oreal and budweiser and
more on a pretty blonde annual scale on
a national scale in in US which is very
cool so I would say that there are
policies and there are opportunities in
Britain which is encouraging towards
young startups like us to at least
showcase our technology and at least
have a global dream about our business
and you you actually went to the US
originally to get funding before
settling on the UK for your headquarters
can you tell us a bit about the the
differences you notice in the business
culture and kind of your thoughts on
that and maybe if you speak up a little
bit am i helping it yeah there are
significant difference of in fact from
our funding point of view and from a
startup culture point of view most
important in the in the VC community
the us-based visas are less risk-averse
and they're willing to actually gamble
on the next big thing they try on an
idea pretty much in its infancy and and
understand it how much can this business
really scale globally is this really a
global opportunity to create the next
big thing and we saw that mindset really
reflected from in US investment culture
which wasn't present in UK in most of
the UK vc's we met year one revenues are
always the first question where you're
trying to set up a business and you're
trying to build attraction of large
consumer base revenues or something
which is not immediate priority for us
or a business like ours so that's one
big difference we saw another difference
is generally able to support I mean
there's a better culture of mentorship
so what we noticed in us that actually
the VCS or other current CEOs of large
businesses or small businesses they
really help younger business is to build
something stable and give a lot of life
feedback and a lot of forums to actually
help each other out and and that culture
lacks in UK definitely we're actually
existing entrepreneurs do not support
young companies as much or there isn't
enough forums where people go and
informally talk to each other and help
each other out to understand problems
because there is a lot of knowledge to
be shared i mean today in a year and a
half you've learned enough through
running a business in US and UK where I
could help out a lot of entrepreneurs in
UK and explain them the challenges and
opportunities to set up a global
business so I mean that's something that
we've all of us have such numbers we're
in the prep city when we move speaking
backstage that some Britain kind of
lacks that is it is it is it an
entrepreneur it was spirit or something
I what's the answer do you wanna say
something Colin I don't think we lack an
entrepreneurial
I think they're there are plenty of yeah
plenty of great ideas in Britain but
it's it's the it's the vision to really
take that and make it global and I do
think we are we are lacking in that in
Britain it's certainly not I don't think
it's something that's particularly
encouraged in Britain it's not something
which is part of our culture I don't
think it's necessarily something that
they may be the you know the government
the whole sort of environment encourages
in Britain but you know it's to build a
brand to build a big global business it
involves more than technologies it's not
just clever guys in a room you know
you've you've really got to have you've
got of money you've got a marketing nice
you've got to have a lot more business
noise and maybe that side of that
entrepreneurial stuff yeah we just don't
have enough at we don't like we aren't
encouraging enough people in that area I
agree with you but I also think the
government could do an awful lot more to
create a culture that really allows big
technology brands to grow I think we do
very well on the engineering and
investment in R&amp;amp;D side but I think that
how do you go promote worldwide brands
in the UK the government tried to do
certain things but I think you either
have to go big and help companies go and
create brands worldwide or create a
culture where it's okay to try and do
this and I think we need the correct
entrepreneurial spirit the really starts
growing this culture of brands in the UK
not just the engineering talent as well
were brilliant engineering I University
push out some brilliant engineers in
this and that's why all three companies
have done very well I think this brand
site needs to be worked on and how you
create that culture of a big achievement
in the yo you want but how do you
actually go about doing it like I think
its investment I think its support I
think when people stand up and go this
is what technology is all about we need
to be able to go and show showcase
everything that we've done very
interesting that video people going
didn't remember the TV was invented in
the UK didn't remember the phone was
invented
but you look at all of that technology
people sit in this table designed a lot
of that technology we can go and create
those companies that really enable big
consumer brands to happen why can't we
do it ourselves I think a lot of it is
to do with us pushing that cultural
differences forward yeah I mean we do
have what we are creating all the
engineers as in says we've got huge
university system and Britain pump site
fantastic engineers one part of our
issue is that we met we were great
exporting them so yeah you'll find lots
of British engineers in this whole
they're working for US companies they're
working for Japanese companies are
working for for non British companies
because there isn't enough there's just
aren't enough those big British
companies actually there for the to take
the engineers for us certainly in our
case we we can't get enough engineers
you know in terms of imagination
technologies r.i.p side of the business
we just can't get enough guys into the
business it's it's it's there's a
there's a dearth of I'm sure it's the
same allotting British engineers back
into the UK that have been to UK
companies been to UK universities
exported around the world we're bringing
them back because that's how good they
are this comp this whole CS is driven a
lot by UK talent we need to make sure
that we grow the brand's around that as
well and it brings down to the whole
issue of funding again the reason we've
lost so many engineers abroad is due to
funding opportunity that many people
have started businesses in Britain and
really scaled in America because an
investor in us believed in the wider
vision of the business and that is
something which is slowly changing I
mean we're already seeing some big-name
Silicon Valley investors opening their
shops in in Britain and and driving the
change in investment culture and today I
mean there are 5,000 plus startups in
London alone and there is a significant
change in terms of entrepreneurs wanting
to do more
and wanting to drive investment and
scale but challenges are a twofold one
is the mindset of investors and other
government policies to some extent
because sometimes the government vision
about the whole tech entrepreneurship
can be quite narrow and trying to define
a geography it's pretty much a tick box
so there are there is something called
the silicon roundabout in London which
is considered Britain's answer to
Silicon Valley but it's it's me it's
like Google and it has all the American
companies out there right so which has
had the effect of pushing rents up for
people like you and so so he's come
hasn't worked wise ever you think it was
it was meant to attract startups like us
and make it easier and have more easy
and lower office rental and good idea
infrastructure in place but it's
actually become a attractive point for
high-value startups and really big
global conglomerates like Google and
Facebook to open their offices there
which is this course driving the rents
up so there are policies in place but
they're not being there not being
exercised in the right way but i would
say few things like the basic paperwork
stuff what things like entrepreneurs
relief and R&amp;amp;D tax relief there are a
few things there which is quite
encouraging for a start-up where you end
up paying less in terms of taxes but
that will not fundamentally change the
vision or the whole future of Britain
and I also think we need heroes Britain
lacks heroes in txt space that the
culture about exits as well you know
people tend to exit very quickly hence
we lack brands we've got a lot of
companies which are amazing components
but we don't own the whole brand okay
that's great I've really enjoyed this
tube I'm afraid we're that that's our
time over so I hope that's given bet
people are watching they're a bit of an
idea of what bridge take the British
takes like thanks very much for all the
people
I panel Bridget carries up next with our
TV experts so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
