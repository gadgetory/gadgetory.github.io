eye-opening I saw what it could do not
just for me but for other people in the
community of spinal cord injuries my
name is Michael Luckett I am a US Army
retired captain and I am the social
media manager for warfighter engaged
I know a lot of the vets that used to
game and didn't game anymore
and they just completely just quit and
wouldn't this controller coming out from
Microsoft an Xbox it's something I could
use to prove them wrong I was in Iraq in
2010 to 2011 and we came back and I was
injured in a motorcycle accident and it
resulted in a c6 spinal cord injury lost
the function in my hands I was already
in a depressed state I couldn't even
function on using the keys or using a
trackpad or any of that but I was
determined to play video games again and
I went online on the YouTube and
actually just typed in disabled gamer
quadriplegic gamer and I started seeing
these gamers finding ways to play video
games whether it be with their face or
just having it on their lap it was like
if they can do it why can't I do it and
then I started the journey it takes a
little bit of setting up at most it
departs 72 hours to get used to it with
us as being adaptive gamers we adapt in
different ways i co-pilot with a
controller and a regular Xbox controller
and it opened a lot of doors once I
found out that I could game
competitively again I was able to just
apply that to everything else like this
past Sunday actually did a Spartan Race
I was physically challenging but I was
already mentally tough
that I was able to do it and just grind
right through it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
