few years now they've cut back the other
way with something that is less and they
hope their for more let's drive the 2012
Mini Cooper coupe and check the tech now
a Mini Cooper coupe is still a Mini
Cooper hardtop from like here on down
it's the stuff above the Beltline where
it gets all different this windshields
kicked back I don't know 10 or 15
degrees more raked the roof is curved
and smaller kind of reminds me and one
of those little souvenir NFL helmets
used to get at the gas station with a
fill-up
here's a power wing that goes up at
highway speeds or if you're bored you
can use that little chrome toggle and do
it yourself a hatch back here that lifts
up two seats not four in many ways this
is kind of like the Audi TT for those
who want more quark for less cash let's
get inside
now when you get in the coop
everything's pretty much familiar if you
know minis at all same dashboard same
goofy bulbous pixar rounded stuff going
on however we have one of the key things
you need if you want to go CNET style
and that is this mini connected package
that gives you a six and a half inch LCD
inside the dinner plate it's not touch
it uses the world's smallest controller
giving you access to Facebook Twitter
web radio Google search so many ways to
die and you also get this dynamic music
thing which changes music based on your
driving speed yeah young males should
have that that'd be great for insurance
rates the GPS navigation I'm showing you
here that's an optional extra 750 on top
of the two grand to get this connected
package and it works through your iphone
in a very nice way notice how when I go
to my phone I get a really nice
interface using ipod out they really
suck up a lot of the Apple interface the
cover art don't just give you some
crunchy looking text readout
now back here where there used to be a
couple of back seats now we've got sort
of this bigger than a breadbox and quite
a bit bigger than a breadbox cargo area
but no seats as you can see you do have
a structural crossmember here that
doesn't appear
in the cooper hardtop that's going to
give this guy extreme rigidity back here
this is a little pass-through deal which
will let you put I don't know maybe you
set our really short kids skis through
to the front but there's not much room
lengthwise on this guy so you're not
going to go buy a billy bookcase at IKEA
but to my mind it's ideal for this
litter box
it's the perfect cat door under the hood
the Cooper coops have the same engine
and powertrain and transmissions as a
Cooper hardtop whether its base S or the
John Cooper Works like we have here now
underway initially a little bit of
psychology happens as I mentioned this
is the same powertrain you'd get in a
hardtop whether it's a junk cooper works
an S or a standard or base car but
because as you walk up to this car and
get this sporty image as you walk in and
enter it and start it your mind plays
tricks on you expect it to be sporty or
lighter on its feet more nimble and it
kind of feels that way though I know I'm
imagining things
the only thing that would make that
possibly true are slightly sporty or
suspension pieces on coupes versus hard
tops just a little difference not
dramatically so and as I mentioned this
big old cross brace back here does
really stiffen up what's already a short
stiff car the blind spots are a bit of
an issue you don't have any significant
windows back here in the quarters to
look out of they do give you these
quarter windows that are unique to the
coupe but your passengers head or the
headrest are right in the way so they
may as well not be there as far as I can
tell luckily this car is so short that a
quick glance out the mirror out the side
window gives you a good view it's not
the most claustrophobic carve ever
driven
here's how I would do a Cooper coupe I
wouldn't get the base model that's like
getting a really good solid practical
Cooper coupe which is an oxymoron
instead I'd at least go for the Cooper s
we have a John Cooper Works here but you
can pass on that get the ass for about
25 3 then add the connected package for
2 grand another 750 if you want the nab
and you're in good shape burn about
