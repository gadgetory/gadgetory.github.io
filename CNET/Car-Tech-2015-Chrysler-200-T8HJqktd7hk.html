the floor the 2014 Detroit Auto Show
taking a look at the new 2015 chrysler
200 now if this car looks a lot like the
Dodge Dart it's because they share a lot
of the same DNA both of them are based
on Italian designs from a4a male now
this new look is a pretty indicated of
Chrysler's new design language they've
got the textured grill that's
integrating the headlamps with the
floating Chrysler badge up front it
looks a little third generation subaru
impreza to me but it's a good-looking
car and it's also very aerodynamically
styled now this 200 F model is the
sporty-er of the two models that were
unveiled today the other one being the
200 see this one's going to have a lot
of black trim sport-tuned suspension and
whatnot there's some interesting things
happening under the hood of these
vehicles the new 200 is available either
as a 2.4 liter tiger shark inline-four
engine that's going to put out 184
horsepower or with the Pentastar v-6
that's going to output 295 horsepower
that's what you're going to want to the
hood of the sport model now both of
those engines is going to be made it to
a single option 9-speed automatic
transmission that's a lot of forward
gears and Chrysler says that's going to
help you get a really good fuel economy
without having to sacrifice a lot of
performance now the way you'll shift
those gears is it with a standard lever
you've got a dial and eat shifter that's
going to be on a floating center console
that Chrysler also tells us it's going
to free up a lot of space in the cabin
for things like storage and moving
around and whatnot it's going to make it
feel more Airy in there and you can also
get either of these vehicles with an
all-wheel drive system that's going to
come with a decoupling rear axle so that
when you're just cruising around you're
not wasting energy driving the wheels
these new Chrysler models are also going
to be available with the full suite of
safety technology including things like
for collision warning adaptive cruise
control blind spot monitoring and you've
also got automatic parking that can
parallel park and perpendicular Park and
we're really looking forward to eating
on road with these things later on this
year I'm antuan goodwin we're at the
2014 detroit auto show and this has been
the two
15 chrysler 200 sedan</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
