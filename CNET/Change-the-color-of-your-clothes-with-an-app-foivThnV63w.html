color of your clothing with a press of a
button it sounds wild but it is real
engineers at the University of Central
Florida are weaving up a new type of
smart fabric where every inch of the
material is wired and it can be
programmed to change color it's just one
of the latest ways technology is fusing
with the fashion industry the technology
is woven inside the fabric itself and
with the help of an app you can just
press a button and change what color you
want it to be or perhaps a pattern let's
say we're going to the beach you could
set the pick stripes and slowly it's
heating up certain areas so wallah you
now have a striped beach bag although it
looks shiny there are no screens no
lights the actual fibers are physically
changing color and it's happening
through an engineering blend of color
changing pigments micro wires and
electricity the fabric is woven together
with a traditional machine but the
threads are special they are conductive
inside a strand is a really thin copper
wire and it's covered by a material
that's made with special pigment that
changes colors when the temperature
changes to understand how this works
think back to your childhood did you
ever play with toys that changed colors
and hot or cold water I had little
racecars that changed in different
temperatures it's the same chemistry at
work with the fabric but instead of
using water to create that temperature
change an electric current is creating
the heat in the thread itself a computer
chip is connected and it's programmed to
send a current through different threads
heating them up to create a pattern all
of it is powered by a rechargeable
lithium-ion battery it is just a little
warm to the touch but I wouldn't call it
hot but you could definitely feel it's
just a little warmer in the areas where
where the pigment changed colors it's
very flexible it's cotton
this guy could bend to it you don't to
worry about about it it's not very stiff
it's kind of like jeans the wiring
inside of that prototype purse is a bit
messy when you look inside but the
researchers say the final product
wouldn't look like that it would only
need one wire and the chip would be
smaller everything could be detached so
it can be washed but moment working with
seven
designers and we're hoping this year to
start working with a larger scale
textile and fabric based product
manufacturers hopefully this year
these first samples are programmed to
show different types of stripes but more
complex patterns and shapes are possible
it can mix it up to four different
colors the next step for the team at UCF
is to make color changing dresses the
engineering challenge is to get the
threads to be even thinner so the fabric
can have more balance and flow we are
still in the awkward early stages of
smart fabrics google has teamed up with
Levi's on a smart jean jacket it can
control music despite tapping an area on
the sleeve Samsung is experimenting with
a few garments it sells a smart suit
with NFC built into a button on the
wrist and there are a few other
companies putting smarts into workout
gear to track activity but the future of
e fabrics may also look something like
this
antennas embroidered right on the
clothes as a patch researchers at Ohio
State University are developing antennas
and power sources that can be stitched
on anything the goal is that the tech
can be completely washable these devices
can be used to transmit data to boost
cell phone reception or even control of
video game looking into the future I see
a lot of sort of smart garments that
people can use to interact with
technology may that be like augmented
reality games or virtual reality so the
ability to interact either gaming or
smart home devices just by wear your
clothes and moving accordingly the
future of fashion promises new function
and also a little bit of fun
yeah sure premium</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
