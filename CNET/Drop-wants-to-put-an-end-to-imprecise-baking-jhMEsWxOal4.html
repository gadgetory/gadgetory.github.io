appliances here with a hands-on first
take of adaptive drop smart kitchen
scale now this hundred dollar kitchen
scale is very similar to perfect bait
kitchen scale that I already reviewed
similar to perfect bake it's ios-only it
lets you scroll through a list of savory
and sweet treats that you can pick from
and it walks you through the cooking
process from start to finish now I've
only just started testing this thing but
I've already successfully made double
chocolate muffins we haven't tried them
yet but they look amazing and even
though both products walk you through
baking from start to finish I have
noticed a couple of differences already
one obvious difference is that perfect
bait comes with a whole bunch of stuff
it has the kitchen scale it also has a
thermometer that you can stick in the
oven it came with three different mixing
bowls of different sizes and that's kind
of a more comprehensive kit but it also
felt a little bit cheap drop on the
other hand is really just the kitchen
scale and the free app on your iPad but
I did notice that the kitchen scale
itself feels a little more substantial
and I like the design of the app better
I'll have a more in-depth review up
shortly but for now this is just a quick
hands-on first take of adapting $100
drop smart kitchen scale thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
