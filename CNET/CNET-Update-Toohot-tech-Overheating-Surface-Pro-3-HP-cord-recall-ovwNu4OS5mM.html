and I really mean hot some are
overheating I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your CNET update hewlett-packard is
recalling more than 6 million of its
power cords because of an overheating
problem creating a potential fire and
burn hazard so if you have an HP or
compact laptop or even an HP accessory
check if the cord has Ellis 15 stamped
on the AC adapter end these cords came
with products that were made in
September of 2010 to June of 2012 but
not all HP and compact notebooks and
mini notebooks sold during that time
used these LS 15 cords HP will give
anyone with this cord a free replacement
this isn't the first time HP had to deal
with overheating chargers the HP
Chromebook 11 was pulled from shelves in
2013 because the charger was prone to
overheating and it's not just HP
Microsoft Surface pro 3 is also
suffering from overheating issues the
tablet just came out a few weeks ago in
early August customers are reporting
that the fan goes into overdrive on the
most simple tasks and it doesn't take
long for it to trigger the computer to
shut down and show a temperature warning
icon it seems the problem is with
surface pro 3 s that have an Intel Core
i7 processor microsoft says a fix is in
the works and here's one gadget I hope
doesn't overheat our coast has created a
high tech hat well it's really just a
beanie with a Bluetooth speaker inside
it's called the music beanie and it'll
cost about $40 our Coast is also making
a musical light bulb costing about 50
dollars we'll be learning more about
these and other new gadgets next week at
the IFA technology trade show in Berlin
it's fun to talk about high-tech
clothing and smart home gadgets not many
people get excited over a tablet's
anymore but Barnes &amp;amp; Noble has cooked up
a plan to get you in his stores to check
out its new Nook Tablet and it involves
Angry Birds if you want to check out the
newest game Angry Birds Stella you can
play a preview exclusively at your local
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble starting Friday the game
is installed on in-store demo units of
the new Galaxy Tab 4
the game launches officially next week
on Thursday and in the world of apps
there's a new option for sending money
to a friend the square cash app has been
updated so you can send money over a
text message you used to need an email
address but now all you need is a mobile
phone number
since the email version launched in
November Square says people have used
the app to transfer hundreds of millions
of dollars it's another example of the
growing demand for an easy way to send
money without fees you can also send
money with the PayPal and venmo apps and
if you really want to cut out the
middleman there is always Bitcoin
that's your tech news update you can
always find more at cnet.com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
