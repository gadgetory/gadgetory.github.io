tracking craze and nintendo wants to
watch you sleep I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your seen that update Microsoft
has revealed its fitness wristband it's
simply called Microsoft band and there
are quite a number of features packed
into this thing first off it pairs with
windows phones as well as Android and
Apple's iPhone the band puts a big focus
on health with continuous heart rate
monitoring it has built-in GPS to map
your distance travelled in a workout and
the screen shows you step-by-step
workout tips and guidance through
several apps where it overnight and it
will track your sleep quality there's
even a UV monitor thrown into the mix to
tell you if you need to apply sunscreen
now apart from health the band is a tool
for glancing at missed messages from
texts and social media as well as
reminder alerts so you can leave your
phone in your pocket and that is the
main marketing angle Microsoft's going
for here you won't miss out on life if
you want to leave your phone in your
pocket although it works with multiple
phones having windows 8.1 gives you the
extra perk of being able to use the
voice command system Cortana you just
speak your commands into your wrist with
the built-in microphone and you can
reply to messages or set reminders with
all these features microsoft says you
can get two days of battery life out of
it but running the gps will drain it
faster it's available now for two
hundred dollars we're seeing more
devices that want to track your quality
of your health and your sleep and even
Nintendo wants to track your sleep the
gaming giant is working on a system that
you would put on your nightstand to
track the quality of your rest based on
how much you're moving at night you
don't wear anything it just sends these
radio frequencies toward your body to
measure breathing and heartbeat and that
photo really doesn't reveal much but uh
who sleeps with their arms like that
Nintendo says the system would give you
feedback each morning and it will likely
sync with your smartphone and also your
game systems like the Wii U and 3ds now
this isn't the first health device from
Nintendo remember it also has the fit
meter to track your steps and calories
burned during a workout and that syncs
up with the week
