your first look at the huawei active a
4g this is a new 4g LTE phone for metro
pcs and it is in fact Huawei's first LTE
phone for the US so what's it going for
it it's got a 3.5 inch hvga screen right
now it's on full brightness so it looks
pretty good pretty colorful but on
automatic brightness it's a little doll
the screen isn't quite as responsive as
I would like and because of the size of
the screen the virtual keyboard is a
little bit cramped the body of the phone
is actually really thick it's a lot
thicker than the thin phones we've been
seeing so it feels a little bit heavy
and bulky in the hand however there is a
really nice 5 megapixel camera on the
back with flash camcorder as well takes
very good pictures overall not
everything was perfect but I think that
most people will be happy with it and I
was especially happy with the physical
camera shutter button on the side of the
phone now the act of a 4g has android
2.3 gingerbread on here and it is the
stock version so you'll see everything
that you're used to including five home
screens there's room for 32 gigabytes of
external storage on this phone it comes
with a 4 gigabyte card that is preloaded
with kung fu panda 2 so you'll have a
little bit of entertainment to get you
going and the cost just a hundred fifty
dollars for an LTE phone for metropcs so
that is a prepaid price that's pretty
good especially for everything you get
unfortunately there's only an 800
megahertz processor in here so it was a
little bit slow going and you'll
especially notice that as you take
photos I'm jessica's all court foreseen
it this is the huawei active a 4g for
metropcs you can catch my full review on
