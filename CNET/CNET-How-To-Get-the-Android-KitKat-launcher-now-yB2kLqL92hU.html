kids on the block right now especially
since it comes with the KitKat version
of Android out of the box but just
because you have an older phone doesn't
mean you can't get the look and feel of
KitKat right now I'm Donald Bell and
today I'm gonna show you how to put a
little KitKat in your Ice Cream Sandwich
now the first thing you'll notice about
KitKat is the clean look of the new
homescreen launcher compared to the look
of Android 4.1 on the samsung galaxy
note 2 it's a huge change and one that I
am ready for thankfully the
xda-developers forum has the apk files
you'll need to install this new launcher
you can find the link to the form on the
original CNET post for this video or in
our interactive player the launcher
comes as a zip archive containing three
apk files my advice is to download these
to your computer for now now while those
download make sure that your phone is
ready to use these files first you'll
need to be running Android 4.1 or later
you can check that by going under
settings and then clicking the about
device option next you'll need to make
sure that your phone is able to install
software from unknown sources back out
into the settings menu select security
and check the box for unknown sources
now let me take a minute right now to
say that you should always back up your
phone whenever you're gonna get to
tinkering like this worst case scenario
if this thing gets bricked I don't want
you emailing me with sob stories of
losing your precious pictures of your
newborn baby back it up my conscience is
clear
alright now going back to your computer
open the zip file you've downloaded and
you should see three separate apk files
my advice is to send each one of these
in a separate email to yourself using an
account that you can check on your phone
once you've done that refresh your email
on your phone and you should see the
three apk files as individual
attachments the first one to install is
pre-built GMs core tap it install it and
hit done next install the velvet apk
then hit done finally install the Google
home apk and then hit open with
luck you should see the introduction to
the new Google launcher now a couple
things to note here first to change the
wallpaper configure home screens or add
widgets now you're going to tap and hold
on the home screen you also see a
settings option here that is specific to
Google now if it's not already activated
this is a good time to do it
once it's on swiping all the way to the
right will reveal your Google now cards
and that's all there is to it head over
to how to cnet.com and you can find even
more tutorials on KitKat including how
to install the new keyboard on your
older phone or even just where to
download the new wallpaper for that
Android 2.3 tablet I told you not to buy
on Donal Bell or seeing that breaking
off a piece of that kid</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
