performance cars you'll find that the
majority of them offer two doors in two
feet most of the time that's just fine
but every now and again you might want
to take some friends along for the ride
or some kids or maybe even some dogs in
that case is certainly far more
comfortable if you have four doors and
four seats to play with the problem is
it's very difficult to find a four-door
car that's worth getting excited about
but don't worry we found one for you
this is the Aston Martin Rapide s seats
for in relative comfort it's got even a
decent sized truck
it all starts up front with this
trademark Aston Martin grille which I
admit is a little bit less distinctive
these days since Ford and jag where I
started putting it on their cars - but
it never looks better than on the front
of an Aston Martin the repeat s is
significantly better looking up front
than the original Rapide which had this
chrome bar going across the front it
almost made it look like it had braces
not very flattering we'll come back and
open up the front door which you can see
has a little bit of an upswept
lift to it not quite as dramatic as a
Lamborghini of course but it gives it
more clearance over the curb or also
over the bodies of your fallen corporate
enemies and then there's the rear hats
which is a little bit difficult to open
here but when you get it open you get a
fairly sizable interior and fold down
the rear seats which gives you even more
storage space a nice flat area not quite
big enough for a sheet of drywall maybe
but a couple of sets of golf clubs
should be no problem at all but of
course it's the rear doors that really
set this car apart and the rear seats
inside they're small but they're
actually quite comfortable and they're
fairly sporty - with a lot of bolstering
not exactly sized for a grown adult like
myself I can get in here and I'm
reasonably comfortable but I would like
a couple more inches of headroom and a
little bit more legroom wouldn't hurt
either it's definitely more suited for
children than for grown adults on the
rear seats here we've got an
infotainment system that you can get
into your kids can plug their videogame
system into the centre console if they
won't stop complaining about your
driving the car even comes with wireless
noise cancelling headphones which may be
will finally shut them up so it all
starts with this weighty aston mark
keye with crystal on the back you slot
it into the center console and then
you're greeted with a very nice sound
indeed that slots into what is it very
nicely laid out a nice looking
infotainment system that is
unfortunately totally bereft of any sort
of modern technology we've got an am/fm
system from banging olsen which sounds
really great it's got these pop-up
tweeters that are very dramatic when
they raise and the sound quality is
indeed very good but ultimately it's
pretty limited in terms of what you can
do you do have AM FM and Sirius of
course the CD player here and you can
connect through the center dashboard
here a USB Drive if you want to or an
iPod which uses a dock connector if
you've got a newer iPod or iPhone you're
out of luck unfortunately there's a 3.5
millimeter line in too but if you want
to do any Bluetooth HTTP streaming or
anything like that you are out of luck
you can connect your phone to the car
but only for actually making phone calls
that is pretty disappointing this day
and age I have to say as we move down
here you can turn on the navigation
system by hitting the nav button you
might think that you control the nav
system by using this nice big dial that
falls right to hand between the seats
but no actually that's just for the seat
here to control the navigation yet to
reach up to this smaller dial on the
dashboard and toggle in things like your
city name the address
the street name and I'll do a character
by character letter-by-letter
there's no voice recognition it takes an
absolute age to enter in anything here
so hopefully you're only going to a few
places that you can add as favorites and
then in the gauge cluster there are two
more small displays on the Left you've
got your gear and your current speed on
the right you can tell go through a
couple of different things from the trip
computer your remaining range your
current average fuel consumption which
is 14 for us orbit painful tire
pressures and that's about it it's
pretty disappointing for a car in 2013
so what does the repeat s offer that the
original repeat from a couple of years
ago did not what we've stepped up about
80 horsepower this time we're up to five
hundred and fifty which is pretty
healthy out of the v12 it's also a very
thirsty car the EPA rates this at 13
miles per gallon city and 19 highway our
testing which included a mixture of both
found us coming in much closer to the
low end of the scale just over 14 miles
per gallon that brings the zero to 60
time down under five seconds which is
really where it needs to be for a car on
this category though it's not really a
hard accelerating car in that way it's
got more of a top-end
push which means you've got a rev it
sounds pretty nice so we're not going to
complain the other nice improvement is a
tunable suspension by pressing this
button here you can go from a comfort
mode all the way up to a track mode
we've driven plenty of cars where the
suspension really doesn't make that much
of a difference but here it's very
noticeable as you go through the
different modes
we're in comfort now and on a bumpy road
it's actually quite comfortable but hold
the button down for four seconds go into
track mode and it's very very tight
indeed we've actually had the
opportunity to take it out on a track it
does surprisingly well a bass Aston
Martin Rapide s will set you back just
under $200,000 but as is the case with
many luxury cars there are plenty of
options to choose from many of which
will quickly drive that price much much
higher
but you have to ask yourself is this a
car that I am buying with my heart or
with my head because if we look at this
analytically cars like the Porsche
Panamera S or even a Tesla Model S offer
greater performance and much much more
intelligent interiors for less money but
if this is a car that you're buying with
your hearts if you're looking for a car
that you can truly fall in love with
this is a pretty difficult siren song to
resist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
