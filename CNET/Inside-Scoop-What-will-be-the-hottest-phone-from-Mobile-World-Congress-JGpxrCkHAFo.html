22 in Barcelona Spain
Jessica doll caught from CNET is gonna
be on the ground now Jessica Bobo what
Congress sets the tone for 2016 in terms
of smartphones are we're expecting the
galaxy s7 and s7 edge for Samsung and
there's another rumor that the s7 edge
plus will launch as well so Samsung is
having an event on February 21st before
the show officially kicks off that's
when we think we're gonna see that and
then LG did something really bizarre it
outed its own phone so it created a case
for the LG g5 a phone that has not yet
been announced so it's pretty safe to
say we're gonna see that phone there
let's dive into some of the room it
features around the galaxy s7 what do we
know
okay well we think that the phone could
be slightly bigger it could get the
micro SD card back for external storage
it could also launch on March 11th and
one rumor is that it will cost less than
the s6 but we are still expecting it to
have the same metal and glass
construction as last year's s6 and what
about anything from say the iPhone 6s
launch we're going to expect Samsung to
play the catch-up will do anything extra
to our spy Caesar's yes some of the
other rumors include the fact that the
phone could have a pressure-sensitive
display and then it could also have a
version of Apple's live photos where the
picture sort of move and 2015 was a big
year for smartwatches
are we gonna see the same trends
continue through mobile or Congress all
the phone makers and gadget makers are
still making watches this is a growing
category and there's a lot of interest
obviously Virtual Reality was another
hot topic from last year and it's only
gonna get bigger this year what are we
expecting in terms of any VR
developments from the show right now I
think we're probably it would be
surprising to see the launch of a brand
new headset player but we are expecting
to see continuing development and a lot
of really fun demos to bring everyone
Jessica thank you and if you want to
keep up to date we

live show before the Samsung unpacked
event on February 21</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
