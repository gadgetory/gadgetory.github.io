Bakalar from the CES show floor how
often am I gonna find the two worlds
that I love the most
hockey and Technology collide like never
so I'm obviously gonna check out the
only sign of hockey at CES 2019 the
technology is called sense arena and
they're a company that wants to brain
train professional hockey players or
people who want to have that look at
being a professional hockey bear by
training them in various exercises using
VR so I'm gonna try this I want to know
how the tech works and I'm just gonna
play it because let's be honest I'm
probably the most qualified person on
earth to test the thing that involves
hockey and Technology who else on earth
is better qualified than me
exactly all right let's go see what's
available when you accept that pass it
is wild it feels good it's a little
bouncier than what a normal what a
normal puck will do but it's pretty cool
wow this is a good goalie so where this
works is it sort of similar to a vibe
setup you need to have sensors around
the room that you're playing and what
they did was they added a specialized
sensor drilled it into the hockey stick
so sticks feel a little heavier than
they should which I guess is a good
thing because maybe you want to improve
your ratchet time of the heavier stick
but regardless those two things that and
the headset work in tandem can make it
feel like you're actually on ice
shooting a puck so it's tough to really
judge the accuracy you have this kind of
thing but when I did accept the pass it
felt real I could I feel like I could do
this forever
there it is that was awesome
man I got my workout this week yeah I
missed my game but not this one this is
what I look like when I take my helmet
off too so I guess that's fair alright
so there you have it I did the sense
arena training hopefully I'm a smarter
faster hockey player I sure as hell
sweated as much as a real hockey player
I have to shower thanks for watching
oh wow it's like a real big arena that's
pretty awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
