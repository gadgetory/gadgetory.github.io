Bill Gates the philanthropist and
software giant we are actually just
leaving the tech not a mean silly cow
and earlier today you talked about this
notion that one of the things that's
really needed for combating disease and
handling a lot of large systems is
better software modeling why is that so
important well if we want to find new
compounds that work trying them all out
can be a very slow process and if we can
model what's going on genetically with
the disease model the shapes of the
proteins so we can try and find small
molecules model bad interactions we can
understand what drugs cause side effects
before we do long multi or
hundred-million-dollar trials modeling
software will improve the efficiency at
the field and we're seeing that
everywhere whether it's designing cars
and planes all this modeling capability
is letting design cycles be better
higher-quality it's really the toolset
that's driving innovation and is the
foundation going to develop this
software no no well there's one
particular area that funding in a
foundation way which is this disease
modeling software but modeling software
broadly there's a for-profit company
called Schrodinger that I put some money
into that does modeling software for
drugs there's you know many different
categories the disease modeling thing
we've just decided it to be free and
available for researchers to connect up
to but a lot of these things whether its
heat modeling or things that we use for
various innovations for the poorest
there we're just using the commercial
packages that are that are great but for
the disease model specific this isn't
that the Foundation's going to do and
then you're gonna make broadly available
for free yeah I actually funded I have a
thing called global good which is how I
fund invention science found a group
Nathan Myhrvold house to do a variety of
things that focus on foundation things
so disease modeling I
did and over two thousand eleven will
will be putting it out for researchers
to work with I know obviously most of
your time to spend on the foundation
stuff are there still specific projects
you're deeply involved in at Microsoft
well I'm a board member and that's a
reasonably serious thing and Steve
brainstorm seen with me when new product
milestones come along like some planning
an office I'll be part of that search is
actually the one where I spend the most
on going time but you know groups will
comment and out that's been the biggest
individual project have you spent much
time thinking I know tablets is a
long-held vision of yours you know
certain tablets been getting a lot of
attention it's not necessarily one that
uses your software is that something
where you still want to kind of put your
two cents in or sure there's certainly a
lot of mail for me to the windows group
talking about how we make sure windows
is the the best choice for the all sorts
of new form factors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
