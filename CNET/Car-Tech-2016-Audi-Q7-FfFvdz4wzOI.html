occupies the same basic slot in the
market but it prints differently looking
it now it doesn't really so much say
crossover or large SUV as it does say
station wagon the change the proportions
around as they've stacked the body
modules the volumes now are lower longer
and more of that wagon look now the
technology underneath and inside the
cabin is also very different look at the
instrument panel you've now got a
12-inch irregularly shaped TFT LCD IP
that's not that rare anymore as of this
Detroit everyone's going LCD - you've
also got the large center console screen
and then look that they've done with
that handwriting or finger recognition
pad he used to be a small pad on top of
a knob now it's flowing a large area in
front of the nmi controller they really
interesting story here's they're doing
with the powertrain as well one of the
options will be a plug-in diesel hybrid
combine that efficiency with the fact
that they've shaved over 700 pounds on
this car through the use of more
advanced materials as well as sculpted
aerodynamically and they're saying a 25%
bump in mpg for what is not a small car
I don't on the back they've also used
those reap rapport shinto body elements
to bring it down for a lower load floor
they've got a gesture controlled
automatic tailgate that's also a big
trend in the world of utility vehicles
some interesting cabin tech works the
option of some tablets in the second row
you might say okay watching movies
that's nothing new but this one has
entertainment and nav on those tablets
that can also tie into the front so
finally your backseat driver can do
something more than just drive you nuts
they can actually help hopefully in a
meaningful way and whatsapp may be
showing up as part of the MMI
application stack for messaging that now
moves in carmakers beyond SMS and
calling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
