in virtual reality right here at oculus
connect hey guys how's it gone hey Mark
it's great to see ya
hey Mark you guys too you know your
avatars look a lot better than the last
time that you showed me yeah we actually
have faces now and bodies and we even
look like ourselves yeah you know even
though your cartoons it's pretty amazing
that our minds can just automatically
understand the facial expression so I
can understand what you're feeling right
now right so we can actually make eye
contact our mouths move when we talk so
we know who's speaking in the room I can
even make expressions I can smile I can
look surprised oh I can look confused
you're making my sound effects right now
that's that's me I can even laugh if you
say something funny
I hear take a look at your own avatar
what why did you make me look like a
young version of Justin Timberlake
that's uh the over-the-top laugh is not
part of the Avatar system all right no
that's all me yeah
all right so it's another we're here you
know the point of being here is to talk
about building a software platform that
puts people first right so if you know
if we were using a phone we would have
to pick what app or what tasks we wanted
to do and go to that but because we're
in virtual reality we're here together
and we have the space we can just do
whatever we want all right said you want
to go somewhere yeah that's in fact how
can I take us to the bottom of the ocean
sounds good all right oh sorry
those are sharks all right
that's a lot of shark all right how
about we go somewhere else how about we
go to another planet say Mars wait a
second Mike didn't you say that was
gonna cost billions and we'd all
probably die mmm not in VR welcome to
Mars well hmm I don't think I'd want to
live here all right guys how about we go
somewhere where there's some more people
you know that's kind of my thing
what about Facebook offices okay all
right okay all right here we are back
back on our image all right so here we
go this is this is my my office in and
then at Facebook so road open all right
so you know the point of this and the
reason why we're here is to talk about
how you know we have a space together in
VR and how we can go do anything that we
want together right so you want to play
a game oh that sounds great
let's try let's try a quick game of
cards huh there we go two for you two
for you all right what do we plan let's
just do a quick game of high card ready
flipping over on three one two three huh
I win out there let's see oh hi man I uh
I barely ever won in demo practice so
you know I'm we didn't play
okay well another game we can play might
be chess now I'll go first
Queen does Center aboard I'm not sure
what to do with that uh force in in in
in virtual reality you can make any move
you want apparently but alright oboe
here you go it completed rid you know um
when I was in school I actually use
defense oh you got another one of these
uh I can do one better check this out I
will just make my own draw this really
great this you're like so I'm gonna go
like that alright I'm good ha ha ha ha
look what I've got guys I think you win
alright we're are we surrender we
surrender
oh another thing we can do together
would be just watch a simple video now
unlike on the phone do not this yeah I
don't like our own private movie theater
it's quite the quite the Falcon you've
got there alright hey so I promised
Priscilla that I would go home to check
on our dog beast you wanna come with me
sure
alright let's go do it that's great
alright here we are we were at my home
and and there's be some of those beasts
Oh horrible he looks so happy that's
great he's got his ball it's all good
hey I'm getting a call in facebook
Messenger dude you could actually answer
that calling VR take a look at your
wrist whoa hey hi how's it going
why do you look like Justin tempura
he's great here take a look he's just
hanging out with his ball he's doing
well but this is crazy you know you're
dialed into virtual reality right now
and beast has no idea what's going on
hey do you mind if I if I just put your
hair for a second
sure my next patient's not here yet so I
haven't met Aiko we'll hang out in
virtual reality in between you treating
real patients all right so um hey while
we're here do you want to UM you want to
take a quick modern family selfie
oh I'm just asking for that there you go
nah of course you have a selfie stick
okay all right let's uh do this no I'm
gonna get the angle right all right okay
let's check out these photos
all right which one which one do you
like you know we get we got to put one
of these on Facebook what do you think
right one do the right side you know I
think this one might even be better now
it's all right all right I'll stick with
this all right
Facebook spam there you go awesome all
right
all right so you know this has been a
great example I think of the type of
experiences you can have when we're here
together and we have the space and we
can do anything we want so nice job
pulling this together guys it's amazing
how much progress we've made
thank you much all right I should
probably get back to the keynote but
