won't just drive themselves they'll find
their own parking spaces and pick you
back up all who commands on your Smart
Watch I can push this button here on the

Internet to the car and the car will
then navigate on its own SmartWatch
controls can also start this 2015
Hyundai Sonata through the blue link app
as well as flash the lights unlock the
doors and find the car for a true
hands-off experience Audi rolled into
CES with a self-driving car that drove
from Silicon Valley to Las Vegas but
Mercedes new concept car does away with
the need for a driver completely I'm
technically sitting in the driver's seat
you can see the steering wheel behind me
but I'm facing the other way that's
because this car can drive itself
besides rotating seats the interior
panels are covered in touch screens and
any navigation is done through eye
movements and hand gestures BMW and
Volkswagen are also looking to add
gesture control so drivers can adjust
the volume or take or dismiss phone
calls through hand motions I can enhance
the volume or put it down I can sure

improve safety Volvo is working to
prevent collisions between cyclists and
cars with a system that sends proximity
alerts to a rider's helmet and a Volvo
driver to avoid a collision and through
this combination of the smartphone the
act the helmet the cloud and the car we
are able to exchange two-way
communication with the BMW 360 degree
collision avoidance system the car will
brake for you even if your flooring the
gas pedal while drivers may not see some
of these features for several years it
looks to be a fun ride in Las Vegas
