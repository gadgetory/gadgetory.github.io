glorious techno mania fest we like to
call CES 2018 we're coming to you live
from our scene at stage in the South
Pole the Las Vegas Convention Center I'm
Bridget Carey and naturally I'm joined
by Roger Chang and Ben Fox Ruben for
another super sized edition of our news
wrap-up podcast the 3:59 but you know we
can't do a show that's three minutes and
59 seconds when we're at CES this is the
biggest tech show in the world we're in
Vegas you got to go big in Vegas this is
like five podcasts into one right and
there's lots of news and trends we've
been covering but first we got to talk
about the Buddy Roger you brought up
he's got a little guest yeah this is by
the way shout out the string joy for
actually bring up this idea on Twitter
but he suggested that I go and get the
LG Chloe and we have Chloe the the home
robot had a bit of a case of stage
fright at the LG press conference didn't
really respond so this is a moment of
redemption Chloe
okay so anyone doesn't know Chloe okay
every you know big tech company seems to
have their own little name for their
assistant and it's like LG's name is
Chloe and that this is just one of the
many forms Chloe can take right yeah
well I mean this in particular is
supposed to be more of a friendly almost
companion type almost an upgraded
version of an echo show right this it
talks it has these friendly eyes it
looks adorable and it's supposed to be
more of come a companion a friendlier
version of access a robot yeah you would
have it like plugged in on a countertop
right yeah and the idea is it swivels
around so we're actually gonna try
giving some commands it yeah a couple of
caveats there are some folks with LG
here kind of helping with it this is a
demo model it may not respond to all the
commands but we're really hoping it does
so I'm gonna this is an early prototype
this is an early prototype so we're
gonna give a shot is he or she I like
the she four can be here sheets whatever
you want okay hi Chloe I'm Roger
name is Chloe I'm a homeless system
robot Chloe what's for dinner
Chloe what's for dinner
clearly nothing because I need to lose
weight and I shouldn't probably be
eating dinner anyway all right Chloe
what's my schedule for today Chloe fell
asleep that's okay that's okay that's
fine
she did say hi she did respond but there
you go this is again sort of an example
there's a power issue but anyways well
look it's it did work for a little bit
and like again it's sort of an example
of a different kind of design for I
guess this is essentially what a smart
speaker does yeah you ask questions but
I think that like this Chloe in action
too at the Prescott and again this is
meant as almost a central hub for your
smart home you know LG envisions that
you buy LG smart refrigerators and
televisions and ovens and the idea is
you can interact with all those other
devices through Chloe so it's like
instead of having Alexa you're just like
asking Chloe things exact way sort of
having a big speech you're asking Chloe
so you know like I said I asked what's
for dinner
Chloe could look in the refrigerator and
kind of know and theoretically through
the cameras in the fridge I mean I have
one of the likes exactly you could ask
for recipes based off of food that you
have in frigerator will be able to spit
out that information like a smart
assistants personality a little bit
further you know like I talked to a lot
of people to talk about how they like
Alexis personality they like talking to
Alexa even though Alexa is not CEO
speakers are not as adorable as great so
it's a but but this I would probably
describe more as like a robot as opposed
to like a smart speaker so know he kind
of moves and swivels a little bit at the
base right well yeah so Chloe can't
actually move around but you can swivel
and so the animations
that makes it seem a little bit more
approachable you know when I talked to
other chief technology officer they
talked about customizing versions of
Chloe for kids or for senior citizens
and really it really is almost a
companion piece I see this trend kind of
starting to pick up I mean we as a
couple other like startup companies are
having that companion for your
countertop you could talk to you with
some cute eyes but it's it's it's just
the early stages I mean nothing to me
beats the cuteness of having a little
robot friend and I know Sony's got their
little like robot friend dog but that's
not at the level of being a smart
assistant yet right but I mean I mean
are we entering the world of having all
these little tiny buddies I mean here's
a video of AIBO Oh
I mean right now it's just barking but I
mean it I mean is there gonna be a day
where like now it's gonna compete with
all the other smart assistants and
there's I mean like this was such a
smart move by Sony by the way there's
been like this huge nostalgia trend
going on in technology right now and to
bring back this like smart robot or
whatever the the little dog I thought
was like a really smart move so although
although all these little assistant
buddies do cost a pretty penny
like I know is like $700 if when ever it
comes to the US because right now it's
like oh yeah I could definitely see my
picture my kid playing but and and and I
would hope that the other sisters aren't
that expensive but I don't know I don't
know I mean to afford these things I
think we need some Kodak coin have you
heard about this Oh Kodak coin yes this
Kodak code so this week this thing
called Kodak coin absolutely exploded
Kodak stock Kodak which emerged from
bankruptcy I think in 2013 decided
yesterday that they were gonna start
getting into a cryptocurrency kind of
like it's good enough for rappers it's
good enough for Kodak yeah so what they
did was they created cryptocurrency
that's supposed to operate in image
rights management system called Kodak
one and it is operated by something
called Kodak coin and there's so much
Bitcoin mania going on these dates are
the point is like you would use Kodak
coins to buy the rights to use images
yes yeah and it's supposed to make it a
lot easier
or photographers or other folks that
actually have images as opposed to
seeing actual money if you're asking me
to explain why people are so crazy and
then there's there's a Bitcoin mining
rig that they're renting out if so it's
separate from the Kodak coin it's like
if you want to actually earn Bitcoin you
can get the Kodak mining rig and rent
that out and say if you can calculate it
you'll make money off of it people are
now discussing that whole yeah and the
thing is is that I don't even think
Kodak one is up and running but just the
concept that they were getting into this
blockchain thing they were doing a
cryptocurrency sent their stock rising
120 percent in one day oh my so I guess
it's a type of situation where it's
buyer beware because this has been
happening with fury on Bitcoin Ripple
like all of these different companies
okay so if your company is like old
school you know and you want to be
relevant again just like in Bitcoin big
ya invent a crypto question should we do
it we should do it on the show we should
do is we should just start one right now
absolutely 3:59 coins and we'll create a
virtual Zoey something weird about CES
and it's only it's only day two and
we're already at cryptocurrency but you
saw some weird stuff yesterday sugar I
think after the big press release day
yeah that's when the weird starts coming
out oh yeah and you were saying that you
saw some really weird stuff at at a
booth yes so I was I was out in Tech
West yesterday coming back from another
meeting and Weber does know what tech
West is Tech West is the basically these
hi oh hey Chloe's bad hey hey
hi clothes for joining us what do you
want try again let's give it another
shot all right Chloe what's my schedule
Oh Chloe's just teasing us now at this
point Chloe needs our morning coffee
well you know we saw a little bit of
Chloe last year and now a little bit of
Chloe this year maybe we'll see a little
bit more hopefully we'll see a bit more
all right let's get back to the back to
the weird yes so I was coming back from
the Venetian Sands Convention Center
where a lot of the startups are you get
a lot of the kind of weirded companies I
stumbled upon what looked like a
military installation within the middle
of the show you were sending us a video
yes and here so I've got a video here up
this would live this is weird just
listen to this
I am here of my own
that sounds so Chris me out basically
this was I am here of my own will as we
are longer we're all here at CES of our
own free will I think she actually
captured what if that like I feel ever
so yeah I look at I have to admire the
stage production at one point one of the
audience members took flash photo
soldiers grabbed and pulled him outside
he came back a few minutes later with
the same kind of you know disoriented
look down that pink liquid and kind of
dead stairs I thought the point was like
maybe this was a broader statement about
where technology's going and the evils
of tech but then when I walked to the
exit like actually we're just a beauty
care company yep they were selling like
facial creamers they were selling a
facial mask yeah yes maybe I can partner
up one of those smart mirrors I would
like to show oh no no it has the facial
mask has its own app oh because it's a
yes everything has to have its own app
whoever whoever's in marketing that
thought of that is brilliant otherwise
we'd never be talking about mean I
basically said that the end of my story
like you know what I have to give it to
them I'm writing about beauty care
products they told one and but I think
one of the most amazing and weird and
probably epic things I've seen at CES
though happened at our CNET party last
night for our 359 fans who know our
usual guest alfred oh man yeah who wants
to wants to explain what happened Cena
has a party it there is no explicit and
and Malcolm or was performing and he has
a dance-off and asked for two people in
the audience to come up on stage and
have a dance-off so we have video why
don't we let the video explain itself
is going oh my gosh I'm screaming like
crazy
I mean Macklemore declared the new
president CNET's yo you know he's my
boss now
oh no III know you were with me there on
the front we were losing our mind it was
like dreams come true yeah it was pretty
cool it was the first time I had ever
seen him breakdance he's like tops first
time any of us have seen him break down
yeah boy he for context he's actually a
competitive breakdancer so I heard about
it we even talked about during his
interview but this was the first time
any of us got to it yeah it was amazing
this was like the best way to see it too
and he was saying that like you know you
know he'll hire him away so maybe
someday
Alfred will go out from from from us
CNET to to Malcolm or dancers we'll see
all right well we got to go to take a
short break but when we come back I
promise
we're still here of her own free will
and will not be so weird with some of
the useful health tech they we have to
talk about so stay tuned
we're back on the scene at live stage
with a 3:59 podcast and a special guest
joining us now is Sheena Oliver from
Otakon to talk about smart hearing aids
so thank you for joining us absolutely
my pleasure so it's not often a topic we
talk about it so yeah smart hearing aids
so yeah tell us about this absolutely
well this is the Otakon open hearing aid
which happened to be a two-time CES
winner last year Award winner and it is
the first world's first
internet-connected hearing aid so what
that means is it has unlimited abilities
to connect to different types of smart
devices so everything from smoke alarms
baby to baby monitors doorbells you know
last summer we actually streamed a live
rock concert directly to open where's
all across the country through their
hearing aids which is pretty insane Wow
Wow all right well so tell me about this
year you've got a new fitness app that
pairs with it
allowing folks with hearing issues to I
guess like get better advice get so what
what was the point of the fitness app
yeah well you know one of the things
that we know is that healthy hearing is
really integral part to who we are as
individuals in our overall health and
what we've seen is that hearing loss is
actually a predictor of future ailments
so there was a study this past July that
indicated that once we get to midlife
and beyond hearing loss is the number
one indicator of dementia so for us this
app was a great opportunity for
consumers who wear hearing aids to have
more autonomy be able to better manage
their overall hearing and help them get
to the words that path of a better
hearing to really mitigate future risk
of dementia in the future so could you
show us the app and how it works
sure well the app again connects to the
hearing aid and what it is doing it by
the way is just tiny I mean I don't know
Bluetooth the whole battery there we go
needs a recharge that's approximately
five to seven days depending on how much
you're using and the type of signal
processing that is happening and I
talked it to you about this yesterday
this is you guys actually create your
own processor for this purely for sound
processing right absolutely
absolutely and you know one of the
things that happens is the hearing aid
is tracking things such as overall
listening environments you know tracking
where the user is using the information
um it's looking at the different types
of environments that they're in and then
that information is then combined with
information that's available from other
rail board devices so things like heart
rate sleep patterns and based on that
that information is then given to
provide insights for the user so how
they can improve their hearing how to
protect their hearing and then just
overall establishing healthier habits
works sure so for example let me just
pull up the screen here do I need to
turn so a great example you know when
people are first new to hearing aids the
goal is to get them to use their hearing
aids throughout the course of the day
for as many hours as possible you know I
have normal hearing I don't get to
choose when and I want to hear when I
want to turn off my hearing so the user
we may set up a goal of you know eight
hours per day for example right now it
says zero but like so right now so this
is a new user so for example they set
their listening goal at eight hours a
day and so what will happen is each day
it's going to track the environments
that they're in how often they're using
their hearing aids and for example they
achieve their hearing goals for a period
of a week it may say you know great job
have you thought about increasing your
usage now to ten hours because we want
them to get exposed to greater listening
and more complex listening environment
and beyond usage like what are you
talked about how it work with your Apple
watch or other fitness trackers
ultimately what is some of the advice
that you'd be able to give given once
you crunch all that data yeah so really
and we're using Microsoft analytics to
crunch that data so a really perfect
example of that is say someone has been
wearing their hearing aids ten hours for
the day they've been in very difficult
listening situations like like where we
are today the app may make a
recommendation to them you know what you
may want to consider going to bed by
9:00 o'clock tonight if you want to get
up at 6 a.m. so that your brain has
enough time to recover from the exertive
you know the amount of energy that you
exerted throughout the course of the day
so that's how it's pulling in data from
other sources in addition to what the
hearing aids are actually tracking
anything different this year being a
product that is focused on health
are you finding more attention or a
different attitude of people coming up
to you because I am
serving a lot more health focused tech
for specific needs focused things not
just like oh I have a SmartWatch that
trucks my running but like people who
have a specific need are you seeing any
any difference this year totally and I
think that's such a great point because
I think what we're seeing with consumers
in general is they want to be able to be
in the driver's seat they want to be
able to control their health and really
be a partner with their healthcare
professionals and so the app is a really
good example of providing users with
data that they can make better decisions
about how they're going to manage their
rural health and hopefully make some
improvements when we look down the road
later a significant premium for having
all these additional features as opposed
to maybe a well there's actually you
know there is a difference when we look
at performance levels of what the device
is able to do we are a hearing aid
manufacturer so we actually don't set
pricing for hearing aids we work with
license qualified hearing care
professionals across the United States
and then they work directly with the
patient to determine what's the best
solution for them because when the
listening needs and challenges that
they're having and I think it's also
important to note that when hearing aids
are typically purchased it's done as a
package meaning you're paying for the
device but you're also paying for all of
the diagnostic testing that's involved
as well as all of the service that's
required afterwards all the fitting
appointments adjustments for a period of
time after the aides have been purchased
we also brought this connect clip what
is what does this do so this is the
intermediary device it pairs with the
open hearing aid and it really serves
three different functions because we're
always looking to improve overall
performance or convenience for the user
so this really affects both of those the
first is it could be used as I'm a
remote microphone so if we're in a you
know in the exhibit hall it's very noisy
I can clip that on to one of you and
then I'm able to hear a much better
signal because of the poor okay
another great example would be for
hands-free phones conversations so
whether it's an Android or an iPhone you
can have your phone in your purse during
your bag in the backseat of the car and
be able to carry on a conversation and
then lastly from a convenience
perspective can also be a remote control
meaning the user can you know increase
the volume or decrease the
change listening programs etc so it's
just another way to add to the overall
convenience of the instrument well thank
you so much for coming by and showing us
a few good useful tech they'll make a
difference in a lot of people's lives
Gary my pleasure all right that's all
for the 3:59 podcast today but don't go
anywhere because our day has just begun
CES 2018 is the place to be all week
long and we have you covered with all
the must-see go-to gadgets for what your
heart desires up next we got Alena
cotton from Samsung and later we're
gonna put case maker citta tests because
we're gonna be dropping iPhone tens from
a scissor lift here on the stage it's
gonna be crazy
stay with us
