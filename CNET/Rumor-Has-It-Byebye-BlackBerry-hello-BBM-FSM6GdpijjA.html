has it the show that rounds up the
week's biggest tech rumors and you can
vote on what you think about the rumors
too in the interactive player if you're
watching on cnet this week is all about
the many shades of tech and by shades I
mean colors so many colors oh and
remember blackberry yeah let's get
started first up Samsung is holding an
event on September fourth to reveal its
next phablet the Galaxy Note 3 according
to Sam mobile the note 3 will initially
launched during the first week of
September in black and white variations
but it will then debut in pink by late
October but here's the catch the pink
version might only be exclusive to South
Korea and Taiwan Samsung has not
revealed any specs for the note 3 but
some reports claim that it'll have a
five point six eight inch Super AMOLED
1920 x 1080 display a 13 megapixel
camera and a choice of 16 gigs 32 gigs
or 64 gigs of internal storage it might
even capture video in 4k resolution but
that seems highly unlikely mostly
because what would you play those videos
back on your $5,000 television that you
don't even have next a Reddit user
posted an image of an xbox one that the
person says can be ordered by Microsoft
employees working on the Xbox team the
image shows a white xbox one with a
white controller the Kinect would still
be black nobody can confirm this image
but when asked about it on reddit
Microsoft's Director of Programming
Major Nelson answered maybe way in the
future what might not be so way in the
future though the black xbox one could
be released november eighth according to
gaming site kotaku that means it be out
a week before the ps4 nice move
Microsoft but the Xbox is still a
hundred dollars more than the ps4 so who
really wins here next we can't finish
this color talk without mentioning the
next iPhone we've talked on this show
before that the iphone 5c could come in
a rainbow of colors and that the 5s
could come in black white and a special
old champagne color but according to
Apple tracker Sonny Dickson the company
is planning to launch a fourth iphone 5s
model he posted images to his blog
featuring what he claims is a new gray
or graphite iphone 5s with a black trim
color me not impressed although I'm
super into the gold iPhone I love the
little bling with my ring get it and
finally poor poor blackberry right on
the heels of it possibly putting a for
sale sign on itself it now might be
looking to spin-off blackberry messenger
into its own company called BBM Inc
according to report in the Wall Street
Journal at blackberry live in May the
company's chief executive said that bbm
would hit other platforms as summer well
it's now the end of August and we
haven't seen much in that department
according to the journal though
blackberry has been moving executives
into its messaging team and it's working
on adding features like video chat what
do you guys think is a spin-off
blackberry messenger going to help the
company do you use BBM would you don't
forget to vote and leave a comment and
ask the cnet council what it thinks the
cnet Council is composed of five editors
who cast their votes anonymously their
opinions are not an endorsement by cnet
or CBS Interactive obviously because
these are rumors folks and the scenic
counsels verdict is yes three out of
five editors think that bbm will split
apart from blackberry one editor says
that shortly after the rest of
blackberry sands bbm will go away
forever rest in peace blackberry that's
