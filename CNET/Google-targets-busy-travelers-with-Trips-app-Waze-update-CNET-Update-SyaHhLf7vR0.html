travel plans with its new app called
Google trips keeping organized during a
trip can't get complicated between
booking hotels cars flight strange
dinner reservations and other events so
Google's new trips app promises to keep
it all together for you the key is that
you would need to use Google's Gmail for
all your travel accounts because it
pulls in your travel reservation
receipts from your email and then
bundles it into the app creating an
itinerary and offering activity
suggestions based on what's nearby and
when you're not busy and it saves
everything to be viewed offline which is
handy when you don't want to use your
data plan abroad and Google also made
changes to its driving app Waze along
with driving directions
Waze now gives parking advice the where
to park feature pops up when you're
approaching your destination it'll ask
you if you want to be directed to the
nearest parking lot and it'll also show
availability of spots in that lot and
pricing but of course that info will
only be available if the parking lot
shares that data but who needs ways when
you're going to be chauffeured around
town by self-driving cars not only has
Ober begun testing a fleet of
self-driving cars on the roads of
Pittsburgh the co-founder of lyft says
most of its ride-sharing service is
gonna be done by self-driving cars in
less than 10 years but I'm more
interested in the five-year research
project announced out of Amsterdam
self-driving boats
