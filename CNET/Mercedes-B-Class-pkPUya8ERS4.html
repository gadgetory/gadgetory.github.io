whole new car but they revised this
thing from the bottom up to really start
to put that Mercedes DNA into a compact
car they say it's the ideal way to get
true mercede using a small vehicle not
sure what that says about the a-class
which they also make but that's another
story entirely now looking inside
there's definitely a upscale interior a
lot of the same Mercedes switchgear
steering wheel nice leather upholstery
and all that look at that display in the
middle they say that's going to have a
portal to your access to free standing
wireless internet in here which I assume
would be a hot spot in the car more
importantly built in 3g and perhaps 4G
soon for this vehicle to be online for
various telematics streaming media
infotainment system they also call out
and standard on this car is a lot of
things that you normally find way
upscale like standard forward collision
prevention a radar-based system it'll
keep you from ramming into someone and
stop and go traffic so you aren't the
one arently rear-ending them while
you're looking at the screen with the
internet stuff on it underhood a choice
of I believe five different power trains
all small ones all direct injection by
the way all have auto start/stop and all
not of interest to you in the US because
this car is not coming there by the way
they'll also be available with a direct
dual-clutch gearbox if you want to go
that way then my experience that's been
hit and miss in small cars if it's done
at a low price sometimes it can be bulky
and glitchy I'm looking at you forward
with that fiesta so overall the message
on the beat class from Mercedes
especially with this revised version is
this a real Mercedes in a compact
package but not not silly compaq not is
that a smart car compact with a lot of
technology while holding the line on
price</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
