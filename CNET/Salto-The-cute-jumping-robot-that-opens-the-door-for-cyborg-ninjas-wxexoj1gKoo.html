tutorial locomotion on terrain obstacles
Salta drill being the Latin word for
jumping and it's a word biologists use
when referring to jumping animals the
special thing about this robot is that
it can jump higher and faster than any
other robot that's out there right now
has 56% more vertical jumping agility
salto can jumps better than it can jump
hacker can jump to 1 meters starting
from a full standstill saltos not just
impressive because it can do this big
jump to a meter high once it does that
jump salto jumps again so we can do this
really high power jumping hyper
continuously and chained together these
manoeuvres and out of large leaps so
jumping off the wall you can actually
gain height that you aren't able to have
what I really enjoy about researching
robotics is being able to look at
animals for new ideas and use those to
create better robots salto is inspired
by a Galago which is a bush baby
the Galago can jump to like 1.7 four
meters or so biologists have found
animals adapted specifically for jumping
have this kind of super crouched posture
the longer they stay in a Crouch the
more energy that can transfer into their
tendons and the more energy they can
return for jumping so we built into
salto the capability for a super Crouch
what that allows is to have the motor be
able to stretch out the spring and keep
the robot crouched for longer now that
salto is jumping this well what we want
to do is try to explore new behaviors
the closest model for what we're trying
to do is human parkour you have these
people that like Excel and running over
buildings bouncing off on all these
crazy obstacles using stuff that would
otherwise be enough to hook like a wall
as a feature to help yourself move which
is one thing I've noticed well with the
motivation of urban search-and-rescue
what we want to do is try to do extended
behavior with chained together series
and jumps to get places you weren't able
to before
in the future we'd like to be able to
take a map of environments and extract
from that places to jump good spots for
jumping and then be able to direct salto
about where to jump how high and how far</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
