smartphone I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your CNET update Mattel and Google have
teamed up to give a high tech upgrade to
the classic view master toy using
Google's virtual reality technology now
the viewmaster is being reimagined as a
child's portal into vr this updated
version requires a smartphone to be
slipped into the front and you download
apps that put you in a 3d world that
wraps around you 360 degrees
maybe you'll pop it on for a dinosaur
adventure a space exploration or perhaps
someday a tour through Barbie's
Dreamhouse you may already have seen
this technology called Google cardboard
it's called cardboard because Google
made a cheap VR phone case out of
cardboard lenses magnets velcro and a
rubber band and that's what we tested it
on during a demo Mattel essentially is
turning that into a kid-friendly plastic
case with lenses to hold the smartphone
and it's selling it for $30 on the
smartphone inside an app splits your
image in two on the screen which creates
that 3d effect
Mattel also put a new twist on the
classic insertable image discs now the
reels are plastic and you don't insert
them into anything you just look at them
with your view master and the app
recognizes which reel you have by the
way it looks and then it loads up that
content so why even have reels
well because Mattel would like to still
sell you physical items that you can
collect a pack of for cost $15 Mattel
didn't share many details because it's
still a work in progress coming out in
the fall but we do know that it's going
to work with multiple types of
smartphones and it can adjust to fit
several sizes we're told that's gonna
even fit an iPhone 6 plus the company
wants to tie this into big toy lines
like Barbie and Hot Wheels and even
repurpose older viewmaster slides they
also see this as a tool for a classroom
learning
Mattel checked with the team of
pediatric ophthalmologist to get
approval that it's safe for young eyes
and it's being marketed for ages 7 and
up this isn't the first time Mattel has
brought parents gadgets into playtime
there was a line of apptivity toys that
incorporated ipads and iphones with
barbie how
even fisher-price Mattel brand executive
Doug Wadleigh told us that this wasn't a
hit with parents parents really didn't
want to let their kids play with their
iPad and physical toys at the same time
this product is completely different
because you have a brand in viewmaster
that's always been about immersing kids
into another world using 3d imaging
everyone wants a piece of virtual
reality action LG just began giving away
its own virtual reality headset to
anyone that buys a g3 smartphone and you
could just use that instead of buying
the Mattel headset we'll have more on
other high tech toys in upcoming reports
as we cover toy fair going on now in New
York City with your tech news update I'm
