inside of your dishwasher I mean you've
got two racks maybe a third one you got
doodads over here that spray and spin
what does it all mean what does it do
well we can tell you because we
thoroughly test each one you don't
actually have to stare intently at your
dishwasher we'll do that for you so we
have this space our dishwasher testing
lab where we control temperature
humidity water pressure water
temperature and because we're
controlling all of those other elements
the only thing that's ever changing is
the dishwasher itself when we test the
dishwasher we use the exact same number
and type of dishes every single time we
also use the exact same amount and type
of food we have a meticulous process
called soiling where we spread a precise
amount of food in a pattern across all
of our dishes the same way every time
then we let the dishes sit for 24 hours
let all the soil adhere to the dish then
we load it up following the
manufacturers recommended loading
pattern as closely as we can then we
load it up with detergent rinse aid we
hit start and we wait we always select
the normal cycle so we can be consistent
from one model to the next we're not
actually trying to get the dishes clean
we really want to stress these things
out so that we can see what the
dishwasher is good at cleaning and what
it isn't and past that info on to you
and the reviews after the cycle is
complete we give it exactly 30 minutes
to rest then we unload and grade the
dishes we hold each dish up under a
specific light against a black cloth and
look for little bits of food that are
still stuck to the plate we assign point
values for each stain we find depending
on the size and give the dishwasher a
score based on both cleanliness and
dryness we also test more subjective
things like design and extra features
and ease of use so yeah we really do
spend a lot of time looking at all the
nooks and crannies of a dishwasher to
find out what's good and what's bad
so the dishwasher might not be the most
glamorous electronic or appliance you
own but the right one can make a big
difference for you so that's why we
examine these machines so closely to
help you make the
right buying choice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
