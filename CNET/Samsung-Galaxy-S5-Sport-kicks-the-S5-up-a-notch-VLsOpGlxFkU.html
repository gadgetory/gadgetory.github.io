Samsung Galaxy s5 sport this is
obviously one of the two sporty-er
versions of the Samsung Galaxy s5
flagship this one comes in two bright
colors blue and red what makes this
sporty well it is the slightly
rubberized and dimpled backing some
physical controls that stick out a
little bit more and are pretty easy to
press and then of course the sport
related and fitness related apps inside
other than that it's pretty much exactly
the same as the galaxy s5 means it's got
the same 5.1 inch screen really
beautiful 1080p HD display 16 megapixel
camera on the back to make a pixel
camera on the front heart rate monitor
and it is waterproof just like the
galaxy s5 so really the only advantage
is the design now this phone is a sprint
exclusive and what the carrier has added
are a lot of partnerships with under
armour and Spotify and then it's also
created this app called sprint fit live
but it's not really a nap because it's
tied to this wallpaper here there's
widget here that amalgamates the samsung
s health app plus MapMyFitness spotify
and a bunch of articles about fitness
you can also get to it by pulling down
because it's tied to the wallpaper if
you want to switch scenes you are going
to lose sprintf it live but if you do
want to keep it you can add your own
photos in the background instead of
under armour's beautiful athletes here I
personally love the way that the sport
looks and it's a very high performer so
I recommend it to any sprint customer
who's thinking about a galaxy s5 phone
whether you intend to use the fitness
apps or not I'm Jessica doll four ce
night you should read my full review of
the samsung galaxy s5 sport at cnet com
