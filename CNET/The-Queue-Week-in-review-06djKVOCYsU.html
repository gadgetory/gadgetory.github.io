hey there I'm rich demuro with cnet TV
and you are in the queue we can review
we're talking the top tech stories for
the last week of may 2007 and a little
bit of june let's get you started with
some eye candy red bull gives you wings
and not just the jittery caffeine and
sugar induced ones the red bull air race
is a flight competition or pilots
maneuver fast and close to the ground
racing against time it speeds up to 250
miles an hour crowds are closed for in
your face action there's a race in
Turkey this weekend to tech titans took
the stage at the fifth annual d all
things digital conference walt mossberg
and kara swisher oh yeah and they also
got to talk to Bill Gates and Steve Jobs
we've kept our marriage secret for over
a decade now the 90 minute discussion
touching on everything from those I'm a
Mac I'm a PC adds to the early days of
Macintosh and Microsoft the joint on
stage appearance the first in over 20
years if you're like me you got your
smartphone so you don't have to lug
around a computer all the time but
handheld pioneer palm is betting big
that road warriors are tired of swinging
at small screens and cramped keyboards
their folio mobile companion links up to
your smartphone and lets you edit emails
documents and surf the web through
bluetooth or Wi-Fi device is not meant
to replace a laptop five-hundred-dollar
folio features a 10-inch screen five
hour battery life and weighs in at two
and a half pounds my biggest problem
with apple TV is the lack of
high-definition programming available
for it after all the device is meant to
connect to your HDTV what Apple is going
even lower res by adding youtube video
to the device beginning in mid-june
you'll be able to wirelessly stream
selected YouTube videos through the
device apple will start with current and
popular videos then continue to add the
full library now since the quality is
pretty choppy on computer screens I can
only imagine how blocky it's going to
look on the big screen but you will be
able to use your Apple TV remote to
browse and play the snack size shorts
definitely not a bad idea but I still
like to see some HD movie content soon
finally the beta mogu google has page
rank and ask used to have Jeeves and now
they have that algorithm
when it's a human touch you want in a
web search say hello to Mahalo the
human-powered search engine uses guides
to handcraft results pages the neat
thing about this site is that you won't
find any spam and its search results and
pages only include the best links to
tell you more about your topic there are
4000 popular searches now live mahalos
goal is to have 10,000 by the end of the
year my favorite is the Mahalo top 7
these are right at the top the 7 best
links for each search term and a good
link for you the CNN TV blog there you
can learn more about what we talked
about right here on the q i'm rich
demuro with seen a TV in new york city
and i love the extra legroom in exit
