6s and 6s plus that everyone's talking
about that Jessica and I are going to
put it to the test compared to regular
touch on an iPhone 6 to see if it's
actually any quicker let's do this thing
test number one we are going to make a
phone call to one of our favorite
contacts you're going to use 3d touch
I'll be using regular touch three two
one boom ah you definitely won that one
yeah I think for me also because I've
got that sliding motion right there
so I can just use my thumb and slide up
to that contact I don't have to open
anything I don't even have to tap next
we're going to take a selfie using the
front-facing camera you're going to do a
3d touch straight from the home screen
with a quick action I'm just going to do
it in a regular way three two one and
there we go yeah you have faster I have
to remember to press the home screen
pretty fast to get 3d touch there so you
got to press it pretty hard not pretty
fast hard we're going to take that
selfie that we just took in the camera
app and post it to Instagram by just to
one new post through there's my picture
next pretty close on that one but I
think that the action of doing that over
time you'll get really really quick in
it right I think there's definitely a
benefit of pressing holding and then
sliding up to new post and being able to
get to it that way
we're getting is the keyboard now to
insert a word in a phrase that is
missing through the Notes app somewhat
fit up and it is foxed we need a fox in
here alright three two one
so you're trying to press down hard on
the truck usually this works a lot
faster this time it didn't and then I
scrub and if I lose my place it's no
good so there's really not much of an
advantage here you have to be quick on
the draw to not lose any time now we're
going to touch on pot in the fun the
peak in pulp action you just couldn't
resist I couldn't in the mail app so
what we're going to do is we're both
going to go into our mail app and open
the same link tap on it but you are
going to peak it whereas I have to open
it hmm oh I think it has to maybe be the
whole link home yeah oh that is so
that's kind of an interesting thing that
you dairy goes yeah it's the pecan pop
is not that intuitive you have to kind
of like fully hold it rather than
highlight you do but it's nice because
once I do that I can interact with that
I can open the link I can press harder
to go into the full pain there we go
just did it whereas I only have the
option to open it fully and then go back
to the mail using the back button in iOS
9 so now we've done some comparison
tests what are your thoughts on 3d touch
overall I really like it I think it's
going to be more useful for certain apps
than for others I do like that the
vibration makes it a little bit more
integrated and immersive and I do think
that in the first few minutes of me
picking it up I wasn't as graceful as I
could be and over time I think I'm gonna
really get the hang of it but overall I
do think it adds a little certain
something that other phones don't have
well for more on 3d touch make sure to
