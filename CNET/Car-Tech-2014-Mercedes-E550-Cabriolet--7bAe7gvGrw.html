obnoxious success of an s-class but not
the poise and the presence of a Mercedes
in general you get an eClass this one in
particular let's try the 2014 revised
550 cab and check the test
now the main thing I like about the e'
is that it's part of the new look of
Mercedes cabins this is a much flatter
sharper a little more cornered off sort
of a dash design I'm making a point of
this because this is a car it's trying
to print younger hence that more
aggressive face now our cars got
navigation that's optional our car's got
a backup camera that's optional we'll go
over the pricing at the end of the piece
but not everything you see here is
included even at the fairly lofty base
price nothing new on the nav rig we've
seen that before it's a good system it's
not my favorite out there but it's
definitely got things going for it then
make it in the top tier if you will
nothing surprising on the audio sources
in fact there's actually more here than
you want you're never gonna use the SD
card or the 10 gigabytes of hard drive
storage who are they kidding but
everything you need is in here not all
of these are based by the way I'm not a
huge fan of the phone system for dialing
simple things like going through the
number and then going over to one end to
pick up the call the other end to hang
up the call it's a small thing but you
deal with it a lot now one of the little
globe icon
you've got mercedes-benz apps the
internet streaming radio and your
serious weather as well as the ability
down here in the corner to go to the web
all this is well and good except it's
dogged slow I actually don't have time
to show you a web page on here because
we don't have enough tape in our camera
now obviously you're gonna browse the
web but you're driving it doesn't work
when you're doing that anyway but this
is an example of how slow this cars
connection and apparently processing are
as well the various apps last time we
use them were just as slow as they seem
now Mercedes is a bad habit of sending
out press cars that don't have the app
thought their eyes so I can't actually
show you those here what does work well
on this car is an amazing rear-view
camera look at the bird's eye view with
trajectory not just for the rear
haunches but also for the outgoing front
fender and then over on the right-hand
side you've got an almost mind-boggling
number of views from low front to God's
view front to side going one way side
going the other way here is the overview
of the rear and here's rear looking out
this is the best entertainment on TV now
the comfort controls in this car are
manifold you've got your three level
seat heater three level seat ventilation
and cooling three level air scarf that's
this nice little heater vent right here
below the
headrest very nice and of course you got
a button here that will summon the
seatbelt to you because it has these
power retractors there's a lot going on
now the drive controls in this vehicle
you got this old mannish column shifter
this tells you right here this car does
not have real sporting pretensions you
do have a sport efficiency and manual
toggle switch here to change into your
three drivetrain modes and over here is
your adaptive suspension sport and
comfort toggle those comprise the bulk
of the drive controls with the exception
of the eco button here which is really a
drive control but that's where you
defeat the auto start/stop will see if
that's needed when we get on the road
momentarily here's the problem with an
eClass at least this convertible is once
I get the seat back in the position
where I would sit I sure can't sit
behind me in fact no human can sit
behind me that's a very tight gap this
is definitely a larger car than a
c-class but it's not a large car it's
not back here now the convertible top on
this II 550 ragtop is quite a thing of
beauty first of all there's a lot to it
you've got all these layers of canvas
and sound deadening other kinds of
padding and structure that make it like
an inch thick the whole thing's goes
from one direction to the other in about
20 seconds kind of industry norm and
notice it doesn't necessarily go into
the trunk but into a well between the
second row in the trunk but that doesn't
mean it doesn't impinge on the trunk now
underneath this lovely clam shell
opening hood I love that about a Benz
we've got a 4.6 liter Biturbo v8 that
means two turbos one on each bank of
four cylinders the result is 402
horsepower 443 foot-pounds of torque
real torquey because it's a turbo zero
to sixty is five seconds which you might
say it's okay that's pretty good pretty
good indeed because this guy weighs
nearly 4,400 pounds
see my earlier comment about real
Mercedes 7-speed automatic syou're only
transmission choice we're talking
rear-wheel drive here and the car gets
17 26 mpg which I suspects a little bit
optimistic so this is not your most
fuel-efficient car but see 4,400 pounds
and see 5.0
I've got the top down now but this cars
top is up I really think it's as quiet
as a sedan it's pretty impressive when
you have the top down like I do you
really feel good about how they've
managed the airflow over the top it's
really calm and this air scarf dealio
behind your neck it's a great thing I
hate to get too excited about something
silly but it's silly and green the power
on this car is four digits not just how
much there is but how it really breeds
well once you tap into it once you get
into that power
whoosh off you go the downside is you've
got turbo lag
you've got computerized throttle lag and
the 7-speed is silky not sharp the blind
spot and lane departure tech are
interesting sometimes it'll catch you
drifting off the side of the road and
y'all brake you hard back into the lane
like that other times though when I'm in
dis trying to cruise control and I want
to just take me down the lane it's so
subtle it almost lets me drift out of
the lane ok lights turning green lift
off the throttle and get right on let's
see how it does that was a quick restart
it took just that long as you could see
in my paws and it also didn't rattle the
whole car but that said I'm still not a
big fan of auto start-stop not yeah this
is as good as it gets but they still
haven't got it smooth enough for me so I
disabled what I'm also dusting in this
car as I've driven over the last few
days is I've got some cowl shake you can
always tell because the mirror the
rear-view mirror here kind of does this
it kind of goes back and forth sideways
on a chunky Road I'm surprised to see
that in a car this day and age
engineered in 2014 by the way when you
come to a stop in this car you've got
the option to use the automatic parking
where you have to use the brake and
pedals but it steers that's nothing new
but they also have automatic parking
spot exit technology where the car will
get out of the space I didn't know that
was hard I'm not sure it is but I think
Mercedes looked at and said hey all we
got to do is reverse the software and
call it a feature so it's in there let's
price this guy sit down a 2014 550 cabs
a little over 68 bass then we start
dialing it up CNET style
package is almost 3,300 bucks that's how
you get a hard drive that fantastic rear
camera and the air scarf behind your
neck 2,800 bucks gets you driver
assistance which is adaptive cruise
cross traffic and that active blind spot
and lane keeping tech for 1500 you can
get LED headlights and smart high beams
almost 1300 for parking assist which
includes getting in the spot but also
getting help getting out of it then come
services embraces 280 a year for a
telematics app another 20 bucks a month
gets you concierge speed alerts and
location-based traffic and 14 bucks more
per month if you want the apps to work
while you're at it get the drive kit for
your iPhone six hundred bucks gives you
a unique iPhone specific interface and
if you have absolutely no self-esteem
another 500 more will get you an
illuminated star on the grill all in
word just over seventy eight grand for a
car that really only holds two people
and barely enough of their luggage to go
away for the weekend so this is really
one of the nicest second cars that the
well-heeled can afford think of it as
sort of a tender to go with your s-class
yacht but I am unmitigated ly in love
with it because it has real Mercedes DNA
in a package that is livable and
definitely memorable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
