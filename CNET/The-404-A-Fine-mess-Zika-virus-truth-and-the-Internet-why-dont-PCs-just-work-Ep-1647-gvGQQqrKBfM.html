for tuning in to the 404 show thank you
for waiting the weekend to get back into
404 mode what happens if you were at a
carnival yeah I uh I spent too much time
on the carousel knew it and after that I
went on to the spinning teacups yes tilt
the world man she loved that thing yeah
it's it's dynamite like even at
not-doing this bid anymore i love the
tilt awhirl you I can something about
the tilt awhirl I can like make that
ride better than its supposed the one
where you get pressed up against the
wall with the gyroscopic force yeah it's
like the eggshells what the the little
cart you're in looks like half an egg
shell oh I'm thinking something else
what's the one it's a big circle and
usually rest up against the wall yeah
that's like the tripped of like a deer
fan no not that it's uh what the hell is
it called it's centrifugal for ya and
which is like that's in the carnival no
we don't want that it also seems weird
cuz you can't I guess you the top is
open so you can see out the top to see
like how weird it is that like the floor
is not moving but you're moving I never
doesn't seem safe the only time I was on
one of those was by accident where I
thought I was getting on a different
ride where I got on that ride now this
is happening there's like all this isn't
gonna stop you have to endure these four
minutes or whatever it is yeah nope I
like that it's called the tilt awhirl
it's uh it's this sort of like rotating
thing where you sit in these half
eggshell carts and there's like a very
thin bar that comes down how is it with
their riding in San lot and then when
they pee you know that's like the
scrambler okay you're just naming every
carnival ride besides is it the ship
that nope that's what hardship that's
exactly what it is uh anyway people know
what the tilt the washer and you can
lean like that it's so each each have
like intro suffer right its whipping
around and your constant going in a
circle and then there's another circle
within your yes yes and if you are with
the right people and you want to play
the game you can lean and one side or
the other two
to sort of play in with the force of
where the mind is going you can really
have yourself a great time yeah anyway
that is not why I was not on the fat for
uh if you're just joining us it's Monday
februari first yeah weather is 54
degrees outside outside this real
febuary weather right now no I really
appreciate everyone coming and joining
us today so I wit I I my family and I
went through a viral ordeal a harrowing
and it wasn't not like on a YouTube or a
vine situation I wish it were the
original viral I would use that word
with great pleasure yeah but no
unfortunately myself my wife little man
Dylan oh we all succumbed to what I'm
just gonna label as the norovirus yeah
which is that 24 to 36-hour stomach
explosion that you have no choice but to
just endure you are not going out that
day you're not going out for a little
bit yeah it's amazing how quickly it
comes and goes i'll give it that or
that's the only thing i'll tip my hat to
everything else whoa yeah whoa I
couldn't keep down water yeah I could
not totally it's just you have no choice
yeah and what's amazing to me is like
how like I you know I'm not a doctor
clearly I'll claim to be Wonder and I'm
trying to try to research this on
Wikipedia afterwards because I'm just
like well that was terrible yeah let's
get to the bottom of this science &amp;amp;
Oates let's let's look at this under a
microscope no doesn't work like that
it's all it's just weird and it's in
your body and it does what it needs to
do and then your body's like I'll wait a
minute hold on I things were going ok
and now you're here and we're just
evacuated yeah the Titanic this we need
to get back to the basics right so so to
be clear did you might have found this
out in your research do you stop being
sick when you've essentially literally
pooped or puked out whatever it was that
was making you sick I don't know if I
don't know if like in the
go mass exodus gets presumably that's
why you're doing it it's like that's why
you throw up when you drink too much
food poison bite poison buyers in the
polls getting rid of the poison so is
that essentially know like the virus is
like riding the wave I don't know others
this amazing wave I don't know what it
is all i know is that i got to the point
and i was telling you about this before
and i don't wanna get gross because it
might be too late but it's more now it's
more fun to be like oh this poor bastard
yeah like there was one point where I
done what I needed to do and I good it's
like we all had it sure Stacy and I were
like two hours apart and like she
started getting it in a nice are again
luckily he was already kind of done with
it okay but we still had to take care of
a baby here because we couldn't bring it
back to daycare yeah so we're like
trading off taking care of a baby and
doing this and at one point I it hit me
way harder it don't I'm not taking
anything away from my wife forgot to
mention wimmer just stronger and better
they are they two genders but she's such
a better person and you know I was just
like I could not physically get out of
that I could not like if the if the
apartment was on fire yeah i was
probably burning along with you but you
had to get out of bed to know but like
after one point I just like I your empty
is empty I done and that's it yeah cuz
you had no energy I go I there was a one
point I'd never been this close to
passing out I think where I felt the
sweat come permeate through my face
instantly touch my face and was like
like I just taken a shower I looked at
myself in the mirror saw the color green
yeah like not even like tinted like oh
he's gone green yeah I'm in the matrix
yeah and just collapse to the floor to
the to the tile hard bathroom floor you
didn't pass out I did but I collapsed I
but it was a like a safety collapse like
you put your hands down yeah like I
didn't like but then you're right now
I'm here and Stacy threw me a pillow and
I and I laid there for 30 minutes yeah
until I could like crawl back into bed
it was it's a very harrowing it's
amazing that this is what happens to our
bodies yeah I hadn't been the sicán
almost a decade
yeah it's terrifying I Alex my fiance
passed out this was like a year ago but
was that sick like was walking through
the apartment I'm like looking like a
little woozy and I'm like should I like
Jeanne a hand and she's like and then
legit that's Mary and I like half Carter
but half didn't and like she knocked her
head and then I'm just looking at her in
the eyes and her eyes are like glassy
like I'm like oh she's dead by so what
what happened I mean she had this
that it was so dehydrated brat she
couldn't do anything so essentially i
like carefully laid her on the ground
pillow blanket like whatever and you
like slept there in the middle of the
living room all night Wow and then was
better but like it's it's not a fun
thing that's like it's almost like no we
we shouldn't have that so is there
anything you could have done when you
brought down home but could you have
taken like know he had this right he we
had to bring him home from day care
because he just had like a bunch of
diarrhea like gays get outta here right
he's pooping way more regular than he's
supposed to that and it's not know what
you want right get him so got him but
then we caught it is that all you doing
print like in prison if you have a ton
of diarrhea what's the what's the play
there you just I guess you have the
toilet in the in your cell ya know oh no
that's not something I want our
listeners to have to think about right
now there's got to be a process any
videos listening yeah that's what
happens any wardens in the house shooter
some shoot us a call we'll yeah yeah so
I missed obviously 44 and miss b's
kissed i missed plans and things I had
to do it was I was done bad I didn't
even get out of bed for real to like
Friday night Saturday morning yeah and I
had we have we somehow made it out of it
we got out of the lift the wood fire so
I'm back I'm feeling great we're back
I'm glad it's februari let's turn the
page on life on health and we're back in
it and feeling good finally
so let's talk about a few things that
have been developing on the internet
most uh thing we're gonna grab most
recently kind of developed over the
weekend yeah I'm calling this a fine
mess ah that's funny so are you aware of
who the fine brothers I am indeed aware
i would say that i was half aware of
them before because i've seen their
videos they're known i'm sure a lot of
people listening know but they're known
for the like 90 or whatever kids react
to 80s video games and it's a youtube
video of like a bunch of kids playing
like super mario brothers and being like
I can't believe they played this stupid
right is cool or like make a bunch 11
year olds play contra knowledge came so
hard exactly what the hell so there's
like and those videos do astronomically
well I think I don't I don't have the
numbers in front of me I do know at one
point they had 13 million YouTube
subscribers that has since dipped yeah
because I'm not dramatic not
dramatically but sure noticeably yeah um
about the skin that we're about to
present so this is this is weird this is
a weird sort of situation um I don't
know these guys personally or I don't
know what the deal is with like why they
did this I have some speculation but
let's lay it out first and then pull
alright so basically the sort of videos
they do which Russ just described
briefly is they do these things called
react videos right so they like we said
they have different demographics react
to certain generational my video games
writer all people talk about how racist
they are etc exactly so they kind of had
this announcement over the weekend where
they said hey we're like enterprising
this brand yeah and they're saying Oh
react the react series that we've done
and created well we're sort of like
enterprising that and we're making that
a trademark right and we're copywriting
that and we're letting people the house
couch was not a copyright even though
they do say that it is essentially
couched like we're giving you the tools
to make your own react videos you and
like will promote them and probably
whatever they were basically saying
like wheel we're dunkin donuts and we've
just wouldn't you like what you like the
franchise out our donuts and coffee yeah
you know kind right yeah it's sort of
like that and I think a lot of the
fallout from this situation is is base
is kind of based around confusion
because people don't really understand
the legalities of arts happening so so
right so they said hey we're gonna we're
gonna license out our react brand or
mattia format and they copyrighted the
term react with regards to youtube
videos right so arguably their copyright
would cover any reaction video of any
YouTube video is those the take away is
the takeaway that's the you know whether
that was their intention or not it might
have been it might not have been that is
the potential end result of this
copyright so someone some lawyers at
some point got a hold of these guys cuz
I'm not gonna go ahead and say that they
came up with this idea themselves right
somebody put it in their heads suggested
it incepted it whatever you want to try
because this just doesn't sound like the
mantra the mo of a YouTube celebrity
well this is my guess yes okay this is
speculative speculation but my
speculation for how this happened was
okay so they have the successful brand
and they do these franchises videos kill
and they do it may amazingly well tens
of millions of views etc right now all
they have in terms of a long-term asset
is their subscriber count this is a
valuable asset they've got 14 million
subscribers it's very valuable but
that's all they have their fear my guess
is that they fear basically anyone
whether it's a tiny youtuber or whether
it's CBS or whoever it is coming out and
essentially doing the exact same thing
they're doing and eating their lunch
without any repercussions that would be
my guess for why this was instigated in
the first place okay so let's let's
let's let's sort of pause on that and
simmer with that a little bit so you're
implying that their videos that they
they do have a very certain specific
look to them share certain feel to them
yes and they've been able to cultivate
an audience
specifically surrounding that format
yeah you your I know are you sort of
like unpacking it as I'm describing like
well maybe well no no so the important
thing to remember is like despite what
they might say their audience is not
because they love the fine brothers know
or they love the graphics or they love
the title car whatever it is it's just
like a good hook it's like a good idea
for a very broadly appealing vide and
they've been able to get enough of these
people have seen these videos to click
that subscribe button because they want
this sort of reliable right uh you know
episodic if you will content delivered
where it's like oh these videos aren't
the worst I'll watch them when they come
out exactly so the so the difference is
what what they're concerned about is
essentially that format being I mean I
guess Kyle essentially copied by other
people without the logical next step of
of course this format existed long
before they came around of course it
moves us long after so it's this very
broad copyright that covers any react
videos on YouTube that people are taking
issue with and kind of freaking out
about rightfully so and it didn't help
that the video that they released
initially was like them too who are very
uncharismatic guys that just like are
like hey so we're doing this and we
think it's gonna be great was very
infomercial it was very infomercial II
and stiff and they just weren't it make
it makes me curious why they would even
promote it in the first place if their
end result was just to cover their butts
right that might be a copyright thing
where they have to like promote disclose
it or disclose it yep I don't know if
anything and we're in the kotaku article
that were sort of siphoning off talking
about the story says well why didn't
they just keep quiet about this thing it
could have gone uncontested for right
however you know 30 days they would and
you would have seen people get takedown
noses but it's like one or two people at
you know spread out and maybe people
would draw it back to oh wow let's look
into this copyright that they got they
just weave themselves they just wanted
to make it a thing they wanted to make
it an event like how do we paint this
relatively negative as awesome as this
great thing that's going to
help everyone else and people saw
through the and it totally
backfired are they look they have 30
million subscribers they took a little
bit of a hit they didn't really because
the majority of people watching these
videos i don't care editors or whatever
well they might be but it's mostly
Facebook people oh grannie sees this
video of like kids looking at cute cats
right who's there that's their audience
sure and as of this recording um they
they've come out with an update video
where they're just like the two saddest
looking down update video thumbnail it
they look like droopy dog yak or your
it's just like they it's like guess why
are they were in the same outfits did
they change I don't know but it just
looks like they're about to tell you
your puppy down right like it's the
saddest terminal you got six months yeah
it's just like the saddest two dudes
ever and they basically go on about the
they could never have foreseen the
negative backfiring that took place
after we announced the react thing and
people just like and now it there's
almost like these guys are the worst
thing on YouTube young people they look
they still have their millions of
subscribers they're going to be fine
yeah but they're they're sort of PR
right now they're buzz that it's it's
bad yeah it's bad they're in a bad place
right if I was them i would go quiet and
dark for like a month and then just
return to normal exactly what you were
doing before cuz no one's gonna remember
or care yeah like they got to stop
taking whoever the advice giver is who
has been like ya franchise out this
reactant right make this apology video
yeah do all that well and part of this
and i don't know where their funding is
or whether they have VCS or whatever but
part of this might come down to like if
they're going to a funding round and
trying to raise money venture capitals
are like hey so what's your long-term
plan here we are going to turn this from
I mean the cliche is 1 X 2 10 X 2 100 x
of what you're making now so that might
be the reason I mean it's it's a it's a
money-making idea and I mean the really
funny stuff is like they got their
audience to like go against Ellen did
you see that yeah so Ellen essentially
made I kids reacting to
I forget what it was toys or something
well I'll toy were the circumstances of
that Ellen did a video that was like
kids reacting her old whatever old toys
from the 80s yeah and she was just
sitting around with these kids and
showing them whatever old stuff and they
posted on their Facebook like you know
if you love the fine brothers you need
to come out against Ellen and people
like Ellen who are taking our ideas of
reaction videos to showing people things
like it's crap and even on the surface
if you sort of slice out the legalities
for a second and try and take it for its
face value where you say hey we're gonna
copyright this idea that just I mean
anybody can understand how that's
ridiculous sure but it's tough I mean it
is tough there's a design and like right
you know we look at like like video
games for example what is a clone versus
what's the riddle original idea and
George do you need to change right for
it's a clone same with music and music
and and really all forms of media and so
it's not I cut and dry they're evil but
they definitely overreached and got
caught they got caught with their hands
in the cookie jar and now they're you
know they've cookie all for their hands
oh I have cookie cookie all over their
hands um all right well that's that's
that yeah I think we could put that one
to bed curious if you got an opinion on
it let us know hook it up all rights is
from my virus to the Zika virus yeah I
don't I mean I'm not again a dot you're
not a lawyer I'm not a doctor right how
do you what is you so therefore were
expert I'm a little bit I don't know I
guess I should just gonna talk about how
we don't know any we don't understand
that's really the game world health
organization today declared it a
worldwide so it's it's it's not good
news and I believe this is only one of
five in of recent while yeah so it's
joining the ranks of h1n1 uh bola you
just get nosy and obviously there's been
a lot and says instances were like stuff
like Ebola obviously did not go
worldwide you know there were a few
cases in the US but it didn't become
this pandemic and we've seen a few of
them what
the bird paw was it bird flu swine flu
wine flu h1n1 yeah as you said and my
fear is and maybe this variable from the
tonight okay class in undergrad about
how diseases spread and why would you do
that Adam why would you do that it
seemed like I was that a course it
seemed like I mean I was a called it was
like airborne sickness 10 whining about
pandemics or whatever it seemed
interesting yeah they just show you
outbreak well no well the yes that was
like two days look quite as clearly the
professor playing that one out but they
also showed us winged migration do you
know what that is like birds well it's a
movie it's a documentary winged migrant
wing it migration whatever its cause is
just like okay what is it and it's
essentially showing birds and how far
they travel and stuff like that with the
idea of being hell did how bad it would
be if one of these things took off among
like the bird population cuz birds just
go everywhere and long way of saying I
got it like one of these things is gonna
take we're kind of do like there were
some pretty deadly flus that hit in the
early 1900s and we have not had one of
those in like a hundred we're due for
one of these like shake off and I'm I
don't know if as easy kaoru sica isn't
deadly right I mean it's really bad like
you the effect on children is like
devastating alright but like if you got
it tomorrow what would happen to you I
don't know I did I even looked at em if
you got sad if you got it then got
pregnant right so that's the problem is
like well but that's a problem yes
especially its lying cuz you can get it
right no you haven't then get pregnant
right but you'd rather have Zika than
Ebola yeah probably I'm not trying to
say we're not trying to pick your poison
this could be the thing that they were
talking about in children of men this
could be the may be the cause maybe
that's all I can have babies anymore um
so I think you're a little paranoid with
the whole migration thing and what's
like saying we're do and it's spread
through mosquito bites course it is
they're everywhere that's the rice and
it spread through Kleenex you know it's
like oh my
like water well it spread through it
spread through raindrops oh okay
that's a problem gee talk about like a
bubonic plague we'll get there was no
modern medicine yeah like I'm not saying
we're gonna have this taken care of in
seven months but our understanding of
like how viruses spread yeah is way
better than it was during these plagues
let's also not forget that like
influenza kills like 80,000 surely here
sure and that's a thing and that's bad
yeah like people die from that the thing
I had kills people every year so it's
that that is mostly old people mostly
old people and really young people but
like there is there like nature is sort
of balancing itself out with that stuff
yeah um but we talked about like I bet I
should mention like if you do get it
like they're saying this is from the CDC
symptoms are mild it's like
conjunctivitis red eyes joint pain rash
fever like generic like you have the flu
essentially but it's very rare that
anyone needs to be hospitalized but as
you said like the effects on children
are pretty devastating with like they
have like smaller heads oh it's pretty
that's pretty awful pretty awful oh I'm
not trying to sugarcoat this yeah
terrible thing and you know we obviously
the world World Health Organization
declaring it an emergency in the way it
did yeah it's a big freaking deal sure
ah but you make you freaked me out when
you talk about your like weird do I know
I mean we are but yeah this it's a super
storm I so i right I have a doctor my my
primary care doctor sure it's very good
man very smart man he has this attitude
that you have but towards bacteria like
super like I where there are 0 and and
that is there an en tant about staff
yeah we're like and it's all our fault
yeah yeah because we were too aggressive
no he claims it has to do with people
not finishing prescription yeah he says
the fact that
we like you you don't take all 30 pills
I take 19 and you feel better and I'll
need this anymore feel better right
so care training dude is he getting
stronger right yeah and he says that my
friend yeah he said something I don't
want to sound like a it's I'm gonna
sound stupid here he said something that
really got me scared and I deliberately
repressed it so I didn't have to think
about it anymore but now i'm going to
try and react and resurface that thought
bear with me for a second is painful um
he said something like MRSA is is only
responsive to like a third of the
antibiotic it used to be yeah the
originally was right which is like
really scary yeah because they're just
gonna sign out him home then what did
Stacy had that oh yeah she had that for
a little bit it's crazy yeah it's crazy
that's why when you go to the hospital
they want you in and out exactly as
quick as poss as long as you're there
the more likely it is that you're gonna
get sick from being in the hospital and
if you had surgery or any kind of open
wound situation you are begging for it
that's why I think home birth is the way
to go maybe I don't know all right we're
not gonna be there you know we're not
gonna scare you anymore instead we're
gonna scare you with a break no this is
uh we're gonna take a quick little break
when we come back more 404 on this
Monday februari first what do you think
groundhog it's gonna see a shadow oh
thanks poxa tony r us dude the canadian
ground on yeah he died what do you mean
the canadian grand there's a there's a
groundhog and can like Punxsutawney Phil
yeah yeah but punxsutawney phil died
they've had like six mil no but the guy
they had lined up for this year just
died like three days ago so they need
like a backup yeah alternate alternate
is in Halifax right I'm off he's gonna
get to the main Canadian groundhog
testing location big time they got throw
that groundhog in a FedEx box oh no
Royal Air Canadian man there you go
that'll do it ship them on over yeah
over 40 for right after this hey Russ
hey Jeff how are you I'm lovely it's
tough to read all the things you want to
read right I never have enough time a
lot of articles on the internet just
never have enough time I just feel like
I'm always constantly grasping at straws
I'm sure I'm spinning all these plates
and I'm trying how many now just gonna
jump in here I'm gonna let's see what
else I got nothing else comes to mind
but the point is it's tough to read all
the junk you want to read sure right
definitely true but you know what I got
a lot of time what doing commuting and
listening and listen your ears are
totally free up ears are free my eyes
not so much but my ears are free that's
why I'm checking out colony FM this is
very cool as a new sponsor for 404
colony dot FM that's the website is a
service that uses carefully trained
voice actors I'm adding in that
carefully trained part okay just because
I think it sounds good sure but using
voice actors to narrate great articles
and blog posts so what's really cool
about Kali it's not just it's not just
like some text it's not weary yeah it's
not serious not some computerized thing
dictating right the thing back to you
it's real people it's a real person

colonie dot f m / Cena welcome back to
the 404 show oh man oh man it's a sunny
day so of course he would see a shadow
right isn't that good that he sees a
show no no the shadow is completely
dictated by the Farmers Almanac what oh
what I don't even know what that means
do you mean I know what the Farmers
Almanac is but like yeah they don't they
don't like literally see if there's a
shadow I don't think they do he seek he
comes out of his hole he sees the shadow
he doesn't see the shadow you have a
more weeks of winter so you talking are
you talking about literally the Bill
Murray movie I mean that's because
that's what happened that's amazing I
understand but that's based on the
mythos of the groundhog I believe yeah
the little ceremony they had they they
they say he does he sees it or he
doesn't see it right based on the
extended forecast for like what they
believe the rest of the so they launder
to play out they lie yet because the
groundhog he doesn't understand what a
shadow is at all I know I'm aware of
that yeah so he's not reporting back to
like write the users but you could watch
a groundhog and be like oh there's a
shadow their course right surely
everything has a shadow Russ so is the
idea that maybe the shadows behind him
and he doesn't see it or they doesn't
have a shot you're implying that like
it's contextual no specific location
they have the ground exactly where's
like oh there's no way he's gonna
see that shadow and what happens if he's
like in in shade or a heavy like a heavy
tree fall yeah no you're totally right
you bring up valid point exactly what a
whole lot of like issue it's such a
weird thing yes what a weird day it's
weird like what are we going to cancel
these are these gonna be around forever
yes you think Columbus Day needs to be
around anymore but that's very different
it is Thursday but it's equally as
irrelevant like yes I think no no I take
it back
columbus day actually represents
something that is so awful yes that
agreed yeah so where is that right girl
really represented no one knows what
flag day is right now knows that is
right do you know what it is now I
thought was like a patriotic is it like
an armistice day thing was that ARMA
stay was when they signed the peace
treaty I think at the end of World War
two and why is their presidents day for
like two guys oh cuz they used to have
said I'm did you know that they used to
have separate national holidays for I
guess it's Lincoln and Washington right
and they turn them into one holiday
that's ridiculous yeah I mean that's why
so like we just honor those two guys
think the issue was they wanted to make
sure that they gave people a day off but
didn't want people go crazy over because
they're like one week apart from one
another don't you think it's absurd that
like on every calendar you've ever owned
like februari second it just says
groundhog day and you're like what the
Flies is that in here in fact what is
that about yeah people like it people I
think it's a charming was it serve row
back because I think it's a charming
throwback with good imagery and there's
a cute groundhog and it's like something
to talk about around the water cooler oh
the groundhog saw his shadow six more
weeks away only thing that it is like
sort of given us is the movie which is
fantastic it is a great so I guess in
the end grand hog day officially worth
it I I think so i think there's just no
downside Groundhog Day existing it's the
thing alright fair enough well we're at
an impasse on that one okay so we get
into the get into the studio here this
afternoon and Russ's Ross's head is in
his hands and I'm just like bro what
what's wrong dude and you said verbatim
I go let's roleplay a little bit clearer
i go back here I don't yeah put your hit
put your head I don't remember what I
said verbatim now put your head in your
hand okay right uh what's Russ what's
wrong I don't remember what I said we're
inside you go he's like rubbing his
brows
he's like I don't understand what my
computer is doing right I don't
understand what it does I don't good I
mean I I don't like it is massively
depressing and frustrating I know what
how computers work for the most part I
like know how to install drivers update
stuff get things working I know how to
do these things like I want you to
channel that frustration that you must
experience at home ah it's like it's
really such a gut punch when like I
gotta i'll give you the timeline of how
this all played out because so we're
talking about pccc german windows 10
right windows 10 and for the record i
love i use in love Windows 10 that's
great I'm go ahead yeah and I have no
problem with windows 10 when it works
it's fine I have no problems with it I
mean all I'm doing is gaming on it like
I'm not doing anything else understand
why it's deserving you like okay so
here's what happened to murder came out
on pc like always it beautiful and
beautiful works great awesome i haven't
actually played it my fiancé alex is a
huge tomb raider fan she loves tomb
raider the second it came out she liked
it was like 930 at night i'm like oh by
the way to murder came out on pc she's
like what and made me instantly install
it like install it within five seconds
of that right so she's very excited she
gets her headphones on like darkens the
lights in the office and like sits
cross-legged in my desk chair playing
tomb raider like she's just like she
have like a perch it just sits
cross-legged in a chair which is odd for
me but like some people assume they call
it the perch okay I had a roommate in
college and said I gotta get in the
perch and that's what that is and like
his head is like ass on the thing and
like both of his knees right up to his
chin oh no he doesn't she doesn't do
that oh she likes its cross and he would
play counter frankly but I can't fit in
my chair like that yeah cuz you're a
normal human right she's much more yeah
so so she's very excited she's loving it
days are going by two days ago I hear
from the other room Russ
can you come in here please and I'm
thinking something really bad has
happened like I come in some and she's
like it's not working so i double-click
whatever I open steam and I try to
launch tomb raider and nothing happens
it like goes whoop my god what loading
yeah not even a loading screen but like
steam is like loading it up and then
there's like a bleep and then nothing
zero and I'm like there's no error
message there's no nothing okay nothing
changed over the course of those 12
hours I didn't install anything she
didn't sell anything she was playing the
game and you did you reboot I mean there
was a reboot sure okay the argument I
know so is the computer guy in music
okay but yet yes so we rebooted multiple
times she actually rebooted before I got
the room so sir okay she knows their
stuff so it's not booting at all i'm
like i got fixed this so I'm like
searching online Tomb Raider not booting
all it's bringing me too by the way I'm
searching using whatever is installed on
that Windows PC I haven't installed
anything else so it's like I should have
installed chrome but I didn't so I'm
using edge just bring me to the Bing
search engine which is don't want
heinous is like like what the top search
results on bing are exclusively spyware
sites exclusively like it's not like on
Google word sometime it's like an ad
safon surd like the very top link is
like fix your pc now dot info how do you
think Bing is stay in business maybe
that must be it so I'm using that and
whatever I'm like searching tomb raider
won't boot but nothing's coming up i
dive into the steam files i double-click
on the icon in like where tomb raider is
living and it's like you are missing
msvc 11 10 DOL I'm like things just
don't change would date you literally
nothing will change the game we turned
it off we turned it on suddenly not okay
what the next step you got to check the
file and so I see I did that I checked I
actually did that before I searched that
so I searched the file integrity of Tomb
Raider is great fine so I'm like okay so
I have a file name that I know I'm
missing so I'm gonna start searching I
apparently has something to do with c++
windows visual something or other Sabet
you went down a bad path but this is the
path to defending them because this is
the file that it needs so people are
sent okay I found a few posts from
previous where like people are saying oh
yeah that issue to download this driver
and there's a link to a microsoft
support page where it's like drivers
here great i click on the one with a
microsoft support page it's a 404 like
it's a dead link oh my god God annoying
i go back i click on the same link the
link works i click on that sounds about
right i click on a download driver link
for for go back work click on the same
thing 404 go back click on the same
thing it works now yet does what is I
can't even fathom what's going on with
that site that's called a spotty
internet it's just it's not spotty
internet that's their site must be
broken it is this weird because it's
like half of the time that says are
these files don't exist but everyone
listening has experienced something like
that that is so bizarre to me so anyway
I I find the file I mean he's going down
long visual files from like the last 10
years to make sure I am every library
poppin sick don't know what these a soon
no idea what rise will c plus pleasure
oh no he knows what is that the tomb
raider is saying i need these files i'm
gonna get the end and not only does it
need it it all of a sudden white it it
didn't eat at 12 hours ago when the game
was running before yeah we didn't need
it now that you've made it this far in
the game I need that I have no idea what
so finally I get all these things
installed it doesn't or it does boot oh
wow but it's thinks that I'm playing it
in stereoscopic 3d oh wait a minute I
had that problem okay we're like it was
double yes double right I don't know I
fixed it somehow I fixed it how did or
another hour I went into nvidia settings
and for some reason in a video had it
was like oh you're Jason 3d even though
I never checked and like what happened
in those 12 hours where it was checked
that's weird there's something weird
with that I read about that that the the
game was entering 3d mode by itself
what so I'm with you man I finally got
our end my god and now give me the spiel
right you're gonna be like oh well this
never happens on max well first of all
max don't play games really so true John
to deal with that right I mean the games
that i put here's what i must say the
games that I play on Mac I do not run on
the accessories granted they're not 3d
graphic crazy game they're running on my
macbook air so it's like FTL and binding
of isaac and very basic games but they
run fine you know whatever a chrome
always boots fine i never get these
pop-up messages I never get forced um
updates like when i turn my Mac off and
turn it back on again I'll know if it's
gonna take a half hour to reinstall
these files right because it asked me
yeah it doesn't just do it and that's
what drives me so insane so but it's
gotten better it's not sure I agree with
a matter of degrees I agree with you it
there's still some inexplicably
frustrating wonkiness and it's so ironic
because it's like design it should be
designed for the mass market given that
they have that mass pike there so why is
that what I mean someone smarter than us
should be able to answer this where it's
like why is this still a thing right
windows why is there this legacy like
patchwork you know MacGyver sort of
band-aid DIY thing that happens with
Windows we're like we're at Windows 10
you ask Pete it's arguably the best
windows they've ever made yeah and you
still have to face these wonky
ridiculous nonsensical trials of
 right like why is that still a
thing and nothing changed my guy again
like well presumably something's
changing my guess is that over when I
turned it off and turn it on again
something installed that I didn't know
was installing and that's what screwed
up because obviously something changed
between those three think it's like a
transparency issue I think it's a
transparent oh yeah I do I think they're
making updates and not telling you oh
they so Windows now is totally not
interested in asking you about updates
right it's like no you need this right
we dis could be pie
did this could be vulnerable we could be
sued you're you agree to this when you
installed me I'm not taking no for an
answer you shut up you sit down and like
a sandwich and i'm updating i guess it's
like a litigious thing where they're
just covering their asses if that's what
it is but you know that and that's the
thing is like you see so on my iPhone
when new updates come out I don't
install them were like instantly of
course cuz you gotta way for them to get
fixed right so you wait right and that's
fine like I get it people making
software are not perfect human being
course not bugs exist they're big
diamond yep so you wait and you see what
people say the early adopters say it's
broken or they say it's great and that
you go off of that but having that
choice to wait versus being forced to
install stuff is a big big difference
I'm with you man and it drives me I'm
with you man it's tough what are we
gonna do man this the world we live in
it's already 2016 you think Windows 10
would freaking just work by now yeah it
doesn't it just for gaming purposes like
this for gaming it's rough there's got
to be a way to have I mean that's the
problem because the hardware so
different but I just like unify it where
it's like it always runs on ps4 every
once in a while this crashes if a game
is poorly made but it boots it does but
that's because every single that's like
every single person in the world owning
my exact same computer it's running the
same way motion do that doesn't work
like that it can never work like why
because it's not a it's a it's a it's a
dynamic platform I know it bums me you
believe me now that you've been playing
pc games for like a year right yeah
don't you feel like oh man there are way
better experiences graphically and
performance wise on PC I knew that
before i got a new that but it's like
but but the question is you regret it
don't know i don't regret it but the
question is is it balanced out by the
convenience i have of like if i have an
hour to play a game do I want to spend
half an hour installing updates and it's
not a half hour work this took two hours
this is an anomaly though I'm compact
compared to like the normal you know
gameplay experience you have I just wish
it would tell me I'm with you man I I
share the frustration I've been there it
is your personal
puter norovirus yeah it is yeah right
yep and it could happen tomorrow like
today I booted it up and just hung on
the like boot screen for like a half
hour and I had to start it it's a weird
thing man it's a computer why would it
make a difference if you restart it and
started again why because it just clears
out cash and clears out all that junk
it's weird as like bunch of like as much
as computers are zeros and ones and all
that stuff they still kind of operate on
the same philosophies like a car right
where it's like you know what maybe you
let that car seat for me yeah where it's
like okay yeah or like it more like the
human body where it's like maybe you
don't drink coffee the next day yeah and
if it for whatever reason they share the
same sort of uh traits is like organic
organisms yeah I don't want to get off
on a rant here no but let's pivot into a
rant okay so while I was down and out
over the weekend I watched an episode of
Bill Maher okay regardless though weekly
yeah mostly every Friday here I taped
them yeah and I don't watch them unless
I like the panel them a TV are they
saying that saying you know just use
like HBO go though no okay I just
because I just haven't use it that's
fine I've got the files box that lets me
record like 12 channels at once yeah i
don't know why i have it i just do yeah
so they're you know they're sure and you
know what well I don't HBO GO there's no
commercials writing like that but like
if if you like we love the Goldbergs
okay we watch the Goldbergs occasionally
then we refer and uh if we ever for some
reason forget to DVR it or it doesn't
DVR yeah i know it's set to something it
doesn't or like it there's a football
game that screws it up uh we have to go
watch it on demand through files is on
brain but then it enters you in this
like awful world where yeah you can't
that's forward right the chair you know
it's the mercy of a nice article or
social i pay for cable and the fact that
i have to use torrent sites have a
better experience is depressing yeah
like yeah that's shitty I pay for these
shows that I'm yeah stealing from the
internet yeah because
time warner or whatever it is is
delivering them to me in a really bad
way you know Russ I never steal anything
but I know um I almost I was thinking
about stealing the x-files right because
the same thing with the x-files yeah
because the x-files got preempted by the
end of the AFC Champions off the clock
it was off the clock I was smart and
downloaded two shows after or whatever
DVR two shows after it because I renew
his football yeah quote unquote smart
yeah no that's no is so I don't know
it's just spin it's bad we're in a very
weird time don't worry they're losing
customers hand over fist they are uh so
so he was Bill Maher was talking about
basically and I'm definitely you know
sort of paraphrasing here but his if
closing monologue was basically about
the internet okay and it's sort of
social ramifications on the human race
here when it comes to rhetoric and
pretty much when it comes to the truth
okay and what's not the truth and he was
making the argument that the unit it's
kind of like the greatest thing ever but
it's also the worst thing that's ever
happened to us sure and because there's
an Internet people can lie yes and it
doesn't matter what the truth is because
the Internet has convinced an entire
generation of people that was that
whatever is on it is somehow official
and it could not be more perfectly
exemplified than the way it is on sites
like Facebook and Twitter wear anything
that your stupid asshole friend from
high school posts online you know it's
just become doctrine sure where it's
like oh the Josh put that up on Facebook
right facebook has its Facebook needs to
really kind of take responsibility for
this I think a little bit um I know
that's like pointing the finger at
Napster yeah right but it's like no
here's my here's my thing okay and let's
use Facebook as a specific example sure
so you put a story on facebook yeah and
it's from some dickhead website with no
credibility whatsoever okay
this plays into the whole argument we're
like we've just lost the concept of
credibility we've like nobody they got
so I you know we were journalists right
like we have a lot of background like
back check again like checking your
sources in double and triple and
quadruple check again making sure
whatever it is that you're that's fit to
print is freaking right answer yes right
yeah and there's like not that that
methodology that mentality is not even a
concept to anybody sure to a lot of
people you're right where it's like no
it's not if this gets published like I
didn't think we'd have to take that many
steps back and explain the whole thing
over yet to people again oh I understand
I know I'm I i I've got finished with
one kind of diarrhea and now I have
verbal diet right I'm just trying to get
out so many points at once but you're
understand I understand there's no
vetting process for what people post
online and the fact that you can link to
a story from the from National
Geographic right and then Bob's dick
farm knockout or and those two links on
facebook look look exactly the same yes
Facebook actually does for what it's
worth according to them they do wait
certain sites differently so in there
trending stuff well not only in trending
in whether it appears in your feet and
how high it appears ok I didn't know
that because you're not seeing every
single thing in your feet no but you're
seeing are ya you're not but I'm you're
saying and I are seeing a lot of
yeah you see a lot of so but what
they do is an its relatively recent but
they essentially for sites that like our
page journey like click Beatty sites
according to them they down rank those
sites you know who's got a curb that oh
freakin Twitter yeah Twitter's told they
don't do anything I mean they Twitter
you see yourself the rails well Twitter
you see everything like there's no
filter on Twitter's off the rails dude
it I think the larger problem and this
is all legitimate an issue but it's not
a new issue like for that whatever
hundreds of years the concern that like
some Yahoo
who doesn't only talking about is
spouting some idiotic whatever on the
street corner this is just a bigger
street corner right right it's the pits
the idea that the crazy lunatic right
who would have just you know yelled at
his fireplace yeah for all of eternity
yeah now has the same sort of pole as
any reputable well I would say I don't
think that's true oh yes and I'm
definitely exaggerating that but but but
my point is like well net but but
there's a voice there like he has that
voice now and I think the larger problem
with that is not so much that he has a
voice but the voices that you're hearing
on a day to day basis are almost
exclusively similar to your voices so
the people that you follow for the most
part the people that you follow or the
people that are whatever on facebook
what have you tend to have the same
vaguely similar ideas as you do because
they're your friends or their people you
know or whatever so there's increasing
divided between ID idea a and idea be
best exemplified by politics but really
applying to everything which is to say
you're not seeing multiple sides of the
story you're pretty much only say once I
the story sure and that's only like one
angle of it and that's what yeah and
there's many angles another angle is
like people you're talking about Rep you
Billy whatever it is people look to
Wikipedia to a certain extent as like
somewhat of a source for information but
there's this disaster scenario that
plays out I'm sure very regularly which
is someone whatever joking around or
someone writes an article um okay and on
an element on a Wikipedia article has
been changed so let's say someone uh in
a Wikipedia as a joke says Hillary
Clinton is 80 years old for argument
haha hilarious someone writes an article
but doesn't source wikipedia just writes
the article saying Hillary Clinton is 80
years old Baba and someone goes back to
that Wikipedia article and you because
they used it and the person writing the
Oracle use that Wikipedia article too
inform themselves but didn't cite it
okay someone goes back to the original
wikipedia article and puts a footnote on
the Hillary Clinton is 80 years old
directing to the article as proof that
this is in fact true so there's this
weird secure a circular cyclical
cyclical Ouroboros thing happening snake
eating its own tail where people are
citing things and those citing things
are citing those people and constantly
going on so it's like this self yeah uh
you know sort of feeding disaster yeah
yeah I mean this is all to say like yes
it's all concerned all I can say in and
to answer that is you sort of just need
to know for yourself what a reputable
sources and that might change from day
to day you might think one day NBC News
is a reputable source and the next day
you know that it might turn that the
anchor was just like not on the
helicopter that was blown up two feet
away from him yeah so like you just need
to know the people that you trust and go
with those people but constantly be
aware that these people might be up to
something and that it's so tough it's
it's hard I don't think it really tell
no I don't think it's an end I don't
think it's a new problem but it's hard a
more pervasive yes it's definitely
harder today at you know I'm not gonna
like glorify the old days because I'm
believe I'm happier now yeah I'm not
gonna like you know romanticize when I
was eight yeah you know because for the
most part I've lived with the internet
my entire life I mean I wasn't online
until I was maybe 11 or 12 but I feel
like that's when you probably should be
let loose on the Internet yeah I think
it's just much easier to get a fuller
picture because you and it's your
responsibility to do that like if you
feel like you're not getting the whole
story on whatever it is it's your
responsibility to not only go to one
source but to go to three or four like I
go to websites that I politically
despise so do I and be like what what is
going right exactly and I find it
interesting but it's also important that
you know the full picture because then
you can sound like a smart person at
dinner parties it's just hate
give them those pages though whatever
your one page view is worth about know
but there's people like us who do that
in the number of people that are doing
that is very small I don't think it's
keeping them yeah it's really tough arm
I I I struggle with it I do I you know
it's tough to be optimistic about things
when you when you really you know I
don't say we're like in it deep because
the stuff we cover isn't really changing
the world from a sense but truth matters
liners details matter right um it's
important you know is oculus rift 500
hours or is it 200 hours right and what
is your source for that absolutely in
that kind of stuff and it's it's just
good practice I'd but it but it does
drive me absolutely up the wall yeah and
it's mostly you know the reason why I've
slowly but surely kind of weeded
Facebook out of my daily browser I
really a teen I go to Facebook but not
like I don't really look at the feed
yeah you've really got to learn to just
sort of like put blinders on and even
with Twitter which I do frequent
multiple times a day is something you
gotta yeah you really got a better can
be a minefield can be um alright well
let's play it safe and call it quits
right here be for the best isn't that
for the Bears a heavy heavy episode I
loved it though man with her key style
episodes it man groundhog day making it
happen alright you gotta listen to this
