generation of building a tablet that can
replace your laptop and man we are there
this product is thinner it is the
thinnest most powerful core PC ever
shipped by far nothing even close
start with the screen we went from 12
inches to 12 point 3 inches in the
diagonal nope we didn't change the
footprint at all of the device at all we
did it by reducing the bezels we put the
LCD gates into the panel itself no one's
ever done that before
it's very important we wanted to give
you more real estate for Windows 10 for
office for the power that you use it for
but the screen oh my god it'll knock you
out
267 PPI 267 that's over 5 million pixels
just right there
5 million pixels on the screen but I
want to talk to you about a new
technology in this product because it's
so much more than just the pixels
anymore
we're introducing something that puts
touch pen softness on the eyes perfect
contrast the pixels screen altogether
and we're calling it pixel Sense
technology I'm going to walk you through
pixel sense so you get a feel for the
technology in this product first off the
cover glass it's 400 microns thick
that's point four millimeters that is
the thinnest cover glass with Gorilla
Glass 4 on it ever shipped on the tablet
we have a 1.1 millimetre backlight in
the product we have a photo align oxide
display as you would expect it's the
best technology on the planet on a
screen right now but it is the thinnest
optical stack up anyone can ship we also
have our own custom chipset that brings
it all together I'm introducing to you
today a chipset in this product called
the g5 chipset brought to you by
Microsoft let me explain to you what it
does in short it takes that optical
stack and then it brings the best pen
and touch experience you've ever
witnessed or felt on any product and on
this product right here we're putting a
terabyte of storage in the product you
go pick it you want it 16 gig
yep we did it's in there go pick it as a
girl check it out it's their terabyte 16
gigs 50% passes faster than our
competitor 30% faster than service is
what you expected right
we went from 9.1 millimeters to 8.4
millimeters the only reason we stopped
there was to make sure you had the full
power of the USB 3 old port that's it
there's 60% more pixels on this screen
we grew the screen we give you 30% more
power we grew the storage we grew the
memory it's a thinner and lighter
package that's all true I want to talk
about the key set we've put in a pro key
set on this product what you'll see is
what we went from this tight key set
design where we have now filled out the
entire key set for your hands the key
set is beautiful the key switch has a
1.3 millimeter travel it's it really is
it's 19 millimeters right now between
key sets it's what we call the pitch it
feels so soft on your hands when you
type best part we then took the trackpad
we made it 40 percent larger that was a
big deal
40 percent it feels beautiful it uses
the full power of Windows 10 and really
comes to life so the new surface pro set
keyboard comes with a fingerprint reader
just for those customers very cool the
product starts at $8.99 you can
pre-order pretty much right now it's
available October 26th it's a great
great set of products out there and with
a great array check it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
