we are at HCC's launch event in New York
and they also had an event in London
launching the HTC One smartphone as you
can tell this is a very nicely styled
device it has a large 4.7 inch screen
also has this whole blink feed feature
which is basically like a tile style
interface that allows you to snack on
news and other content really quickly
kind of like Flipboard so if you're
familiar with those kind of news
aggregator services you'll really won't
be totally surprised by this interface
but it definitely is a new enhancement
as you can tell though we still have the
iconic or similar clock not the flip
clock that comes with some of the
agencies previous devices which also get
the weather and that type of thing we
also have a 2 megapixel camera right up
top as well as dual speakers you have
speaker up here and a speaker down here
that's part of the whole boom sound
technology that enables really powerful
stereo audio performance also you can
tell this is a very thin device it is
all aluminum has what agency calls a
zero gap aluminum design so there's
basically no gaps anywhere it's all
metal all around and you can see also
here is the main camera they don't want
to tell us exactly what the megapixel is
we believe it's probably for megapixel
but they call it the ultra pixel camera
which enables extremely high light
sensitivity so you can use it in
low-light environments much better than
other phones they say three hundred
percent better performance in low-light
conditions also you'll see that it has
an android jelly bean interface a little
bit pared down but you can see you have
the typical android apps so another
interesting feature about the camera
that HTC is talking about on the HTC One
is the new Zoe file which is
visit a three second film clip that you
can quickly take a ticket capture really
quickly and then share that with friends
and loved ones it also the gallery will
also combine all your photos and the
videos and all the things that you take
with the phone and automatically create
these highlight reels which is something
that a lot of people will probably find
useful on the top here is an IR blaster
which communicates with home theater
products like a television stereo that
kind of thing so you can basically use
it with something that agency calls the
HTC TV sense which enables you to change
your channel view the programs that you
want know when they're on see guides for
local programming and that's something
that's really interesting so definitely
want to check that out once we get one
in for review so there you have it folks
this is a first look at the HTC One
smartphone i'm brian bennett at the cnet
