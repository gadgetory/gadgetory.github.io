a brand new robot that terrifies us
apparently some sheep are going to get
Wi-Fi I'll tell you more in a second and
your future hearing aids might actually
be worn in your mouth it's not how ears
work no it's not
tomorrow daily
creating systems to the Internet welcome
to tomorrow daily the best geek talk
show in the known universe it'll think
you're massaging an invisible person I'm
your host Ashley sceva join me as always
kill anonymous what's wrong just release
your emotion here oh you're all tense in
the back I mean you got to work the
thumbs it's always the thumbs that you
got to work on the on the back on the
I'll be yeah that'll be on tomorrow
daily massage edition so looking forward
to that we're gonna that's gonna be a
separate video on demand release you
know that Mod Squad we're gonna have a
massage squad massage squad there
there's an actual show to this right
like we're I think there is a real show
so let's hit the headlines okay so in
late 2013 googlebot blossom dynamics
which is that robotics company that's
had like PETMAN and big dog and all
those really terrifying robots that they
show that can run really fast okay so
they just introduced their newest robot
google has introduced this new robot
it's called spot so this is this is spot
these are all of the wrote these are a
lot of the robots they're working on the
four-legged ones they're spot right
there it's gonna start moving and
walking about inside Boston Dynamics
office building so here's the thing
that's interesting about that is that in
fact it is working inside an office
building so all of the other bigger
robots are gas power so what two things
two prongs of that it's electric way
that guys kicking a dog ice kicking a
robot dog is that okay to kick a robot
dog I don't think it is but a lot of
people do it all the time but look at it
recover that's really scary right so um
and I also like that they travel in
packs like they have a couple of them
that walk around together in a second so
it's it's electric powered now instead
of gas-powered meaning one everyone who
works with these things doesn't need to
have hearing protection because the
gas-powered one sound like a thousand
chainsaws being blown around by a
thousand leaf blowers like it's so loud
and then the other thing is that it can
go indoors because it's not releasing
fumes it's electric so it can actually
go inside oh my god it's so cute
usually I'm scared by this stuff but
like this one it's smaller it's cuter
yeah it's not running really fast like
the other ones it's about to go faster
can go a little faster than what's what
it is in the video but not much faster
and the other see it's a control oh look
at it so it's about the size of a large
dog so you can see the guy running next
to it you got four skated like this is
what I want are they are they're jogging
yeah the robot horse dog okay dog you
want a robot horse a pony dog that's
fantastic okay so great okay so have
they what is busting dynamics like what
are they aiming to do with these robot
dog things I mean like it seems like you
could do a lot of things but what are
they so likely projected they rescue
funny that you mentioned horses because
one of the reasons they're developing
these things like big dog one of the
things they're developing is allowing
like either soldiers or people to put
heavy equipment or packs or things like
that like supplies on the backs of these
yeah and then have them if you need to
walk somewhere if you need to go
somewhere without taxing yourself you
can actually put them on on these dogs
these Robo dogs yeah Wow all right so
really cool the money is paying off
oh well so before it's this is actually
just an interesting little side note
about that video so before whenever
Boston Dynamics would show video they
would put funded by the US government
because they used to be funded by DARPA
and so now they're not they're owned by
Google and this is the first time we've
seen a video that hasn't annotated where
the funding for that robot came from so
it's very possible this might be an
entirely Google funded robot so it's
really interesting to see kind of how
that companies sort of morphed in the
last year they're progressing so fast
these crazy
why do them like like big dog how long
ago was that that was like a few years
ago yeah I feel like the really scary
one that like popped back and forth was
pretty they keep updating them so you're
like yeah like cheetah bot is the one
that runs really really fast and then
pet man is like the one that looks like
a person and it can like squad and like
to pivot and something that for you all
that makes me I don't like that but spot
looks pretty cool and I feel like I
might I might like that in my house
someday maybe like a little helpful
robot yeah running around robot carrying
your other dogs carrying all the other
speaking of animals you I want to talk
about a Wi-Fi sheep okay good I'm sorry
no minutes hours for that terrible joke
I I want to talk about Wi-Fi sheep okay
okay so it's really hard to get internet
and
areas yeah there was Project loon that
Google put on but Gordon Blair is a
professor from Lancaster in Lancaster
Lancaster University who is using a
sensor equipped sheep to create hot
spots Wow okay also this is stuff like
this has been done before last summer a
UK cell service company EE put these
sensors in like cow statues okay I had a
music festival alright so give people
like hot spots at the festival yeah so
apparently it's really easy to put these
sensors on say a caller so they're gonna
want to put colors on these sheep and
you know provide a little bit of Wi-Fi
hotspot for b-roll by the way can I just
say really quick our b-roll for this has
absolutely nothing to do with the story
it was just sheep just relax of sheep
because that was all I could
those are Wi-Fi see if those are normal
sheep those are disconnected and cushy
they're disconnected okay please
continue now I just want to want now
even so up okay so a lot of people are
doing a lot it okay first of all this
technology can do a lot of things
unravel that okay and then I'm gonna
quickly tell you how this is being used
with other animals - okay Fran's anemia
is using reindeers
they're potentially gonna use reindeers
with this technology that's amazing so
some of the things that this tech can do
if you put it on your shape if you're at
home and you want to put this on your
sheep it can I can help you figure out a
gregorio also note if there's flooding
pollution where your flock is yeah good
GPS you're located where the flock are
they and then air quality and and lots
of other stuff
Austria may use the ear tags as hotspots
for Wi-Fi like identify the sheep they
would also be able to put sort of a
little sensor in there and actually find
out if they're under attack like I'm
telling you there's a lot of stuff if
this isn't just Wi-Fi sheep but that's
the cool interesting yeah it sounds like
when you're saying whether I could track
pollution and stuff that they would be
able to also put those sensors in like
stationary places or around their farm
so like if you had like a tree or
whatever you can actually put yeah our
scarecrow or whatever you could place
these sensors around to help track your
farm and all of the things happening
around and in it yeah I mean so
apparently we're a few years away from
it but I mean
it totally makes sense I love that good
job farmers yeah use your animal it's
just some like you but like is there a
sheep around here I'm not getting a wife
Isis IDF kill and I going out in the
middle of nowhere and like New Zealand
it looks like we just can't find any
Wi-Fi queers near slaughter sheep it's I
think that's I think that's I think it's
a really cool tech on especially the
whole like it senses the air I mean this
this is farmers need this information so
that's terrible don't tell don't tell
the sheep that you they don't know no
they can make you clothes but I really
like this because if you have a farm and
you're like Scandinavia has this tribe
that lives up in the northern like
northern Scandinavia and they literally
like travel with their reindeer flocks
this is like permanently like that's how
they live and so for them to be able to
have connectivity is something that
really they've never had you know access
to you before so that's pretty cool that
they're you know working all this type
of stuff so crazy that your reindeer can
give you on Facebook yeah your reindeer
will be able to log into Wikipedia so
that you can look up new names for your
reindeer you can find cool new names
your and your name of cool stuff on
Wikipedia that brings us to our hashtag
of the day which is hashtag TD sheep
what else could we do with animals in
technology if we combine them I mean
we've seen the robot dog we've seen
Wi-Fi sheep I mean what are other things
that you guys can come up with that we
could do with technology and animals you
know 5050 when I went it's my turn to do
the TV it's either like ridiculous or I
gave a little bit of thought and it's
still ridiculous and stupid but do you
remember twitch twitch plays Pokemon and
then they did fish plays Pokemon yeah I
want to see more games where we're
having animals play video games play
video games for like just like GTA sheep
oh yeah she plays GTA would be remote
mouse plays plays Grim Fandango
something I like that we're so like
running around in a maze or something
how can you call of duty be by a cow so
the cow of Duty Oh cow of duty I'm sure
there's a lot of other puns
if you hashtag TD if you have a pun
please yeah please please just send well
what about you
I think for me with animals I
I really like the idea of I really like
the idea of navigation so like
seeing-eye dogs I like the idea of
having like sensors in the collar that
would help a blind person get around
even better oh my god that's brilliant
yeah like I'd like I think that would be
really cool so how would it feed back
into the human well I think you could do
it via smartphone via like either you
could do Morse code or you could do some
kind of notification with the with the
vibration or like a earpiece or an
earpiece or something like that where it
was like you know like for example a dog
could technically go across the street
but then maybe the sensors can sense if
there are you know like obviously these
dogs are really well trained but I would
say just an added enhanced layer of like
extra things that it could sense in the
environment that the dog necessarily
couldn't or wouldn't be able to do as
well as like an actual technological
sensor right I think it would be really
cool it also helped to know where your
dog is if he's in your house and he's
walking around or your dog jumping off a
gate and running running away in your
front yard like like what happened this
morning was my dog I'm gonna freak out I
actually I actually think I'm just gonna
be a hard one to beat your TD so we can
see you're really gonna have to beat
hers or beat my pun yeah meet a good pun
um okay so I have to tell you about this
hearing aid because I saw this video and
I thought it was the craziest thing I've
ever seen okay uh so obviously when we
think of hearing aids we think of those
little bits they put in your ear and
then you know you can turn it up or down
based on a little pack and stuff like
there's kind of a you know that's kind
of the basis of it that's the only thing
you really think of well not anymore
because this engineer named John
Williams not that John Williams is
saying it's totally possible to hear
through your tongue okay so okay I don't
even know where to begin with this but I
will try so he's building this device
that sends sound impulses it sends
impulses into your tongue like
electrical impulses in your tongue and
he is hoping to teach the brain how to
translate those impulses and decode them
into something you'd be able to quote
unquote hear so um this works a lot like
Braille so this is the this is what I
have like the understanding I have of it
is it works a little bit like Braille so
when somebody goes blind yeah and they
need to use Braille they have what
called sensory what is it called sense
substitution sense substitution right
and so they get better at things like
feeling things and understanding Braille
you're hearing better your senses
heighten right right exactly like
daredevil like daredevil so we went
blind and now you can hear it right I
understand look at that so it's a sense
substitution so it works similarly to
that so this object would basically
allow you would have to train your
tongue and your brain to decode those
impulses into into actually hearing but
it would you would basically train your
your mouth to hear like as opposed to
your ears doing it and how long does it
take to train your tongue so they're not
sure yet so here's the thing is it's
they're using like what they're saying
the hearing aid would be like a retainer
that you would just pop in just like a
retainer just all day I'd like you you'd
wear it during the day like you would a
normal retainer and and then you would
like press your tongue up against it if
you wanted to hear like like you press
your tongue up against it for those
impulses so you wouldn't be getting hit
all the time with like just crowd noise
and stuff like that there's only things
you choose to sort of listen to but the
one thing they have to do is they have
to map out all the nerves in people's
tongues because they're not sure if they
can make one device that is sort of a
one-size-fits-all type thing because
everyone's nerves are sort of mapped the
same yeah or if everyone's nerves are
mapped just a little bit differently
causing it to be like a custom build
situation for every single patient I
don't know that well that's what they're
working on right now so there so they
built the prototype like for one person
and now he's like okay now that we've
built this prototype like now we can
move on and see if this works the same
with every person and so then we'd only
have to build one thing or would this be
more like a prosthetic where it would
have to be custom-made for each
individual person all right totally
crazy that's yeah never would have
thought about hearing for my tongue and
apparently this potentially could be way
cheaper than a cochlear implant which is
like they can run up to like a hundred
thousand dollars once you have like
testing and implanting it and all that
other stuff so and it's also a lot less
dangerous because you're just popping a
retainer in your mouth instead of you
know having surgery inside your ear to
implant something so pretty cool that's
crazy
yeah I I saw this I saw the headline
today and I was like no no that's wrong
like
that can't be right guys that's not to
wrap my brain around that one that's
still so brain wrapping these okay great
let's take a quick break and try to wrap
our heads around that and we'll be right
back with our experience at the marvel
explosion yeah we've been talking about
this we talked about last week we
finally have a video for you we're
excited to show it to you and then we
also have your user feedback and our
photogra for the day so don't look away
it's tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show
Oh kale still trying to figure it out
okay so here we go we finally get to
talk about the Marvel experience we do
I'm really excited so it's been a big
question mark that's been in the air so
anybody that's like a nerd knows that
there is this this traveling show that
Marvel is putting on it's like a
traveling circus but not quite yeah it's
it's got and the reason we're covering
it because not only we have covered nerd
centric stuff but it also has a lot of
cool technology but it's his traveling
show that's been going around people
have been like well okay so the deal
what's in there what is it like is it
cool like I want to see a little bit of
it so producer Logan here you go thank
you for this okay so stage one we're
going to the recruitment staging area we
just put our information and to get our
shield badges so heroic yeah this is
this is stage one so we're gonna go in
there and check that out so let's let's
do it
wants to push every button over here
so as you already know it's all
contained in a dome but there's there's
a whole lot of effects going on whether
it be sound light so it's pretty cool
it's not just you know like a room with
stuff including interactive video
experience where you stand infront of
the Kinect and then you can summon your
favorite Avenger by just doing
I brought an Ironman series alright so
we're here with Rick CEO of hero
ventures the the creator of this entire
thing right this is your baby this is my
baby and no one's more excited to be
here than me how did you go about
choosing what you were gonna put in each
dome you know there's so many different
types of media there's so many different
ways to to present the content we wanted
to keep ratcheting it up a level with
each new dome so you start with a screen
you go to a dome projection you get to
this main dome with a dozen unique
interactive elements and then there's a
360 degree holographic dome coming up
that you haven't seen yet Cale there's a
motion ride there's a there's a Hulk
moment that I'm not gonna spoil for you
and a bunch of other things that are a
lot of firsts here at the Marvel
experience
alright guys and that is it for us from
the Marvel experience it is touring its
going to a town near you hopefully you
can check it out online Kayla's gonna go
buy all of these action figures and we
are going to we're going to continue
shopping so I
we don't we don't have the budget for
that
so that was our that was our marble
experience two hours by the way okay so
we'll break down the Ruby way some facts
do it like shotguns so it's not like we
don't draw it out so yeah shot it's it's
around 35 bucks like depending on peak
hours and holidays and stuff it's
anywhere between 29.95 and 39.95 if it's
like you know that's the price range for
adults over 12 so you have to be 13 plus
it's between 29 and 39 dollars to go
it's to our experience you can go to the
Marvel experienced or calm to check out
more about it if you want to learn more
there were seven domes plus a gift shop
technically three domes definitely three
big domes and then like fuse other like
sort of staging areas where they had
some cool interactive stuff like a
Spider Man safety video that made us all
very entertained and we laughed but it
was cool like I thought it was
interesting that they went with sort of
more of the comic book characters it's
not cinematic universe like you're not
gonna see don't go expecting cinematic
universe you're not gonna see anybody
from any of the movies you see any clips
from the movies you're not you're not
even hear the voice of anybody from her
it's completely separated imagine it's
just a Mart like Marvel property comic
books
GAC all they like imagine an animated
Marvel you know special but like but
they but an interactive experience so
and then one of the big domes is like a
training area where there's all kinds of
AR and like the stuff that you saw and
then there's a full 360
excuse me 360 degree video which was
really cool cool and then there was also
the last thing was a theater that you
sat down and had the chairs that moved
and everything and it was sort of a Star
Tours esque Sauron so every single dome
has something completely different and
honestly the way I feel about it is if
you super love Marvel or you just like
are a child at heart you have to go as a
child at heart then you'll enjoy it you
have to go to child at heart don't go as
your grumpy internet self yeah don't go
don't go so grumpy internet Gus go as a
child and enjoy it for what it is
because and don't expect it to be like
the whole of Disney's Tomorrowland
turned into the stark Expo because
that's not what it is this is a
traveling tour so obviously they got to
keep it easy to travel with I mean
you keep all of your expectations in
check I think it's really fun and I
think you would have a good that's the
thing is occasionally I slipped into
grumpy internet mode like hmm maybe
better this isn't the movies I would've
done this somebody I don't like
okay be the childlike kale that you
usually are and I had a good time and I
think that we both agree that if they
had done we would have liked to have
seen if we could offer improvement we
would like to have seen a little more
set dressing outside although I heard
it's a lot cooler at night yeah they
they project stuff onto the dome I would
have liked to see it in costume
characters so I could have like taking a
selfie with like Captain America
spider-man or something or even you know
what about your old representation
whether it be someone in a suit like
these I'm only suggesting things that
seems a little immersive yeah a little
more immersion what I think alike
wouldn't it coin gently your baby yeah I
am like nothing like that just like easy
just hire a couple of couple of actors
but overall we had a good time yeah we
had a good time I got a cool she-hulk
shirt out of it I wore it on Monday
I got although there was only Thor
Stanley bought Thor statues I wanted to
buy each other yeah no I picked up I
bought one in the gift shop I was like
oh they got some good stuff here so that
was the Marvel experience you guys can
check that out online it is it is pretty
cool if it comes your hometown and
traveling all over the place I think the
next stop is San Francisco so if you're
up in the Bay Area you might want to
take a look but it was really cool that
we got to break out of the studio though
we did we is awesome yeah we got our
footage we're gonna have like a much
longer experience we even ran into a fan
hey Brian yeah hey bro and so it's gonna
be extended you'll show the entire unit
of what it's like you'll see an extended
you'll get to get a bigger feel of
what's going on if you're still trying
to decide whether to buds even though we
had a great time though producer Logan
maybe not so much
where's that's his picture through the
show he did get to have as much fun as
we did cuz he was really really busy
working the camera that's how easily
Haley looks right now while he's doing
this it probably is alright guys it's
time for your user feedback
all right it is time for user feedback
on spider-man we asked you guys use the
hashtag TV Spidey to tell us who you
wanted to see where are the tights next
get the web slinging power many people
said Donald Glover
nobody really Paul wrote to us and said
how about some diversity in the Marvel
hero set make spider-man Asian Peter
Park instead of Peter Parker hahahaha
I'd like to even add the man I know what
about Mexicans spider-man Peter Park
Cole Paco Parker done you're welcome
Paco Parker I'm in find me a burger I
like it Fabio wrote in to us and said
Logan Lerman from Percy Jackson seems
good I like that choice all right yeah I
thought that was very good choice ally
wrote in and said the kid from boyhood
Ellar Coltrane he's about the right age
she he is he's like isn't he like 17 and
18 so I think they're looking for about
that age early age his agents probably
you know chomping oh man I'd be lobbying
so hard if I was his agent Rick wrote in
and said how about Patrick Jay Adams aka
Mike Ross from suits as spider-man how
old is this guy I was gonna say he might
be a little bit on the old end of the
Spider Man's dad spider-man's older
brother and then Joey wrote in and of
course told the answer that we all think
which is actually you're just giving up
kale secret identity as spider-man they
notice I do this all the time and he
shoot webs out like hey um you guys had
some really good news man I really
enjoyed it but of course it's time for a
very last piece of user feedback which
is always our phone talker for the day
so Dave wrote in to us and said I took
this pic with my now out-of-date iPhone
4s it finally rained here a couple of
days ago and this is the little creek
that runs through a yard of a nearby
house which means you're trespassing and
then comes out about a block away in a
local park the little bridge really
makes this photo you'd almost think it
was the idyllic British countryside but
it's a couple of blocks from where we
live in seabass two-pole California
Sebastopol a little town about 50 miles
north of San Francisco Charles Scholes
used to live in Sebastopol and I hear
that Norman Greenbaum's spirit in the
sky Fame lives up the road in Santa Rosa
tech connection o'reilly the patek book
publisher is in town love the show
grumpy old man Dave of the data yes he's
right it does look like a charming look
it does it looks like a little a little
countryside that bridge is delightful
yeah yeah I totally dug this I thought
it was really really well composed very
beautifully taken yeah well listen you
grump at least you live close to
something like that yeah exactly maybe
that'll cheer you up you grumpy old man
that's all I'm saying
maybe I'll just bring you a little cheer
or make him even more grumpy don't make
you bring a little cheer I hope we I
hope hopefully we also do the same thing
we bring you make it cheer you up a
little bit after a long day of being
grumpy watch our show or make you more
grumpy maybe maybe I want to leave an
impression of some sort some sort yes
um but I I duggan i thought was gonna
picture um if you guys want to submit
your picture to be featured for photogra
for the day you can email us tomorrow at
cnet.com feel free to send over user
