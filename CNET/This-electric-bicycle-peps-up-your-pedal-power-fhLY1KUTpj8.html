cnet.com and today we're taking a look
at an electric bicycle this is the A to
B Alva plus and it is a dual mode
electric assist electrically motivated
bicycle now what are we talking about
here there are two different kinds of
electric bike they're just electric
bikes that have a throttle control where
you twist the throttle and it takes off
kind of like an electric scooter this
does that but it also has an electric
assist mode so when you turn the cranks
with your feet it'll actually kick in a
little bit of electric system to help
you go just a little bit faster it makes
you feel a little bit stronger than you
really are and helps you to get around
using your own energy getting a little
bit of fitness but without getting to
work when you're sweating
so what we're working with here is a 500
watt electric hub motor on the rear axle
that's going to be providing the
motivation when you're under pure
electric power are also helping you
along when you're pedaling you've also
got a seven speed Shimano derailleur
back here with seven forward gears dual
control with a little twist
gear shifter now the power that's going
to be supplied to that electric motor is
going to come from this big old box
right here this is your thirteen point
two amp hour electric battery and that's
going to basically be where your juice
is charged and you're gonna plug this up
every night it's gonna take about three
to four hours to charge and that's gonna
get you about forty miles of range as it
is equipped this is a hefty bike with a
lot of the weight centered over the rear
end there website states that the elavil
plus is a sixty six pound battery I
waited on my bathroom scale it's about
72 according to that but maybe they're
not the most accurate we've also got
integrated bike lights on the front and
on the rear that are gonna automatically
come on when you turn the bike on and
get ready to go so you don't have to
worry about when you're driving at night
and the battery also makes a really nice
parcel shelf on the back so if you want
to hang your laptop bag off of that or
strap your groceries to it's a good
place to put it keep it off of your back
it actually comes with this neat little
NFC tag that goes on your keychain and
when you want to turn it on you just tap
the trip computer right here and the
whole thing kind of fires up and
calibrates itself when you do that those
lights that I told you
are gonna come on and then you'll be
able to take advantage of the electric
assist or the electric drive and when
you lock your bike up you can also lock
the battery on to the back with an
included key so that nobody grabs it and
runs off with it now the Alva plus is
going to roll on 24-inch wheels it's a
little bit smaller than your standard
road bike but that's going to give you a
little bit of maneuverability and it's
also got these really big meaty like 2.3
5 inch wide tires that's gonna give you
a lot of traction and it's going to
allow you to roll really smoothly over
cracked-up sidewalks or sewer grates or
anything like that without worrying
about your tire getting stuck and if you
need to go off-road every now and then
they've got you covered now once you get
going you're gonna need to bring it to a
stop and the elbow Plus is equipped with
hydraulic disc brakes on the front and
on the rear and top speed on this thing
is gonna be stated about 24 miles per
hour that's the legal limit of what an
electric bike can do now if you've got
really strong legs you can keep on
pedaling past that and push past that
electronic speed limiter but HSB states
that the actual top speed and the actual
range of the Ovilus is gonna be very
limited to what your personal weighted
seaway let's go get more range if you
weigh more than you'll probably get less
okay so the A to B elbow Plus is a
little heavy and I wouldn't want to
carry it up a flight of stairs but if
you're on the road and you're on top of
it it's more than carrying its own
weight and if you've got about a 20 or
10 mile commute you can get to work and
back on this thing without breaking a
sweat and without having to fit through
traffic but how much is this gonna cost
you
now this elbow plus is gonna run you
three thousand two hundred ninety nine
dollars that's the MSRP and that's a lot
of money that you could spend on a
bicycle if you're a casual rider but if
you're in a bike friendly City where you
conceivably ride this thing to work
everyday it'll definitely pay for itself
in less than a couple of years but the
thing that I like the most about the
Apple Plus is that it's a flexible
electric bike that lets you write it
however you want to write it if you want
a little bit of a sister a lot you can
dial that in if you don't want anything
at all you turn it off and if you're
feeling lazy you can just turn the crank
and let the bike do it for you I've been
in chuan Goodwin and we've been taking a
look at the A to B alpha plus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
