while nobody's looking activate launch
control press the break and quickly
apply full throttle and release the
brake to line
oh man
now the dust challenge has always been
big on power and big on Retro list but
historically it's not been very big on
tech so I didn't have very high
expectations when there's 2015 scat pack
edition showed up behind the wheel and
check
now part of what makes the scat pack
special is right here under the engine
bay now what we're working with is a six
point four liter version of dodges Hemi
v8 now that's the biggest naturally
aspirated version of this engine that
we've seen so far
now what you're gonna get out of this is
about 485 horsepower and 475 pound-feet
of torque that is nothing to snub your
nose at and if you look down really
close in the engine bay you'll see that
the block has been painted orange just
so that everybody knows that you've got
a very special engine now this engine is
made it with an 8-speed automatic
transmission now you can get it with a
six-speed manual but there's something
about a muscle car that makes me alright
with a good automatic and this is a
really good automatic and it's gonna put
power out at the rear wheels exactly
like a good sports car should fuel
economy is gonna be estimated at 14 in
the city 23 on the highway and about 17
combined but let's be honest if you're
looking at something with this much
power you don't really care some of the
other changes for the scat pack outside
of the engine bay are gonna be right
down here in the wheel wheels we've got
20 inch wheels and inside of that we've
got brembo 4-piston brakes at all four
corners and just behind that we've also
got a Bilstein suspension with a unique
geometry for the scat pack that's gonna
help stick a little bit better in the
turn and then of course we've also got
the scat pet graphic then supervee
badging here in the challengers cabin
we've got these really nice sport seats
that are heated and cooled
we've got adaptive cruise control we've
got ford collision warnings right and I
thought this was a big dumb muscle car
we're getting a lot of features here in
the dashboard that you're gonna see in a
really nice GT car that's gonna make
this a very comfortable vehicle for long
range road trips as well as being a very
safe vehicle for when you drive around
town now here in the center of the desk
where we've got Chrysler's 8 and 1/2
inch you connect system now what that's
gonna do is gonna give you access to a
very good navigation system that's very
easy to use with good voice control it's
powered by a Garmin even though you
won't see a Garmin logo anywhere on
there we've also got over here you
connect apps they're gonna allow you to
do things like stream pin to a radio to
the dashboard or if you've got
passengers you can transform the
dashboard into a Wi-Fi hotspot so they
can browse their tab
and whatnot on the web you've also got a
lot of media sources including Bluetooth
audio streaming an SD card slot USB port
it's a very modern dashboard now down
here at the base of the desk where we've
got a button that says super Track Pack
and what that's going to do is bring us
to a special part of the infotainment
interface that's gonna allow us to
customize the vehicles performance for
starters we've got launch control right
here so if we wanted to do a very quick
run we're gonna let the computer help us
out with that
I've got a sportin mode and we can
customize whether we want the steering
to feel sporty whether we want the
engine and transmission to be in its
Porteous setting whether the paddle
shifters work or not you can basically
customize with the normal mode and how
the sport and mode are different from
each other so you can actually set this
vehicle up the way that you like and
over here in the center of the dash
sport we've got a bunch of features in
the instrument cluster that are going to
allow you to monitor the vehicles
performance and your performance that
the driver we've also got meters that
allow you to monitor the 0 to 60 the 0
to 100 times the quarter and eighth of a
mile time and braking distance and you
can even start a timer so you can check
your reaction time on the run so hit OK
you get a 5 4 3 2 1 and then go now
you're gonna want to be careful in the
Challenger scat pack lest you get
yourself into a lot of trouble as far as
because this thing it's bright F green
and very loud but it's also because the
accelerator pedal is kind of a
hair-trigger one of the first things
you're gonna want to get used to is
having a very light right foot otherwise
you're gonna burn out every time you
want to pull away from a stop sign or a
traffic light Wow
I'll admit that is a whole lot of fun
and it's definitely a good way to
attract a lot of attention from the
police that you don't necessarily want
now that I said once you get going in
this vehicle it is very powerful that's
kind of the whole key to success here at
the point now the scat pack upgrades are
gonna give you a little bit better
handling but this car never really loses
it sort of GT car feel you see as the
Mustang a Camaro become more and more
sports cars with their
subsequent generation the Challenger
seems like the last muscle car standing
okay let's price this 2015 Dodge
Challenger scat tech in sub lime green
has tested we're at about forty seven
eight eighty but we've got a lot of
options including the you connect access
pack a power sunroof appearance packages
and more now if you're not a big fan of
a lot of tech you're just personally
like the big powerful muscle car you can
skip a lot of that you can act tech and
whatnot and get the thing for as low as
about $37,000</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
