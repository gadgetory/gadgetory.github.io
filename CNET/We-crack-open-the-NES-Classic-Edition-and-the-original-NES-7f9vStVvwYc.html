with my colleague bill Detweiler back
again to crack open some of your
favorite tack we not only do the latest
tech sometimes we do a little bit of
retro tech and this time we're doing new
tech and that's right where does you
know when we get a two-for-one here
right so what we've got is we have an
original into no inner tainment system
and NES right here from the 80s if you
grew up in the 80s like Jason and I did
you probably remember this you help link
say Princess Zelda you help defeat King
Bowser double dribble that's right
double dribble all those fond memories
and Nintendo in 2070 2017 came out with
a way for all of us folks that remember
the original NES who weren't using
emulators to relive their glory days
with the new original NES classic here
yes we're gonna take this apart and
we're gonna take the original NES apart
and we're gonna compare the two
excellent so this is a crazy crazy
popular device it has yes far more than
Nintendo expected they found that when
they put this device out they could not
keep them in shelves and it was almost
impossible to get a hold of one right
bill oh it was definitely so we
originally the one that we originally
cracked open D sold for $59.99 yeah it
was the retail price great price with 30
30 games that's right yeah built into
the little emulator here now you could
get lucky sometimes and you can still
find these I think for about 60 bucks
around depending on who has stock left
of stock level from the original run but
we were talking even before we started
this segment with some of our producers
and we had people that waited in line
for hours in the night people who could
not get a hold of wine yeah um somehow
miraculously one of the producers got
ahold of this one we don't even know how
we don't want to know it was such a hit
because if you have such fond memories
of this device it was one of the first
really great devices that you could play
games for everybody yeah very easy to
use you probably remember the classic
controller this is the classic
controller it has a newer
connecter it's the same kind of
connector that you now see on the
Nintendo Wii like the nunchuck you would
you'd use this and this is the device
it's much smaller than the original
connector you can see there and I know
this also has an HDMI port on it so that
you can connect it to a team of modern
TV without them come on old converters
don't have to use the old you know RCA
connectors right yeah to connect it um
and so this really is now a modern it is
Fox 30 games you can play your classics
and your favorites lots of fun or if you
watch our Apple home pod episode of
cracking open and that was a real chore
of take through I think that you know we
ended up with an hour of footage on this
doesn't screw yeah yeah dozens of screws
on this you have four little Phillips
screws right in the bottom underneath
these rubber feet you pop those out with
like a Phillips double zero or triple
zero screwdriver here and the thing just
separates so nicely just like this it
comes right apart AFOL and we get right
into the guts
please don't go like they don't go like
this at all so that's one of the things
that makes this cracking opened so much
fun we will see if the original is that
easy to do now but what we find inside
the the NES classic here we found one
single large circuit board here you find
connectors for the controller ports here
yep you find the power button contacts
or other way around you find the power
button the reset button contacts over
here the makino there's there's there
yeah I was pointing while holding it
down and not being able to see and
that's kind of it that's all there is in
here so if you great take these little
cables yeah we disconnect them from the
circuit board we do that and then we
take our handy Phillips screwdriver
also what's that this all the screws are
the same you know three or four
different screwdrivers to take this
thing apart you don't see that in an
iPhone you don't see that in an iPhone
you don't see that in many devices these
days you'll need three or four different
screwdrivers specialized tools here all
we need to do is one sort of really
small phillips screwdriver we're gonna
take the screws out from the inside
very standard yeah yeah and we're gonna
remove the circuit board what's really
interesting when we start to look at the
hardware here we're gonna we'll compare
the original hardware to what is inside
the new NES classic and there's such a
you know it's so interesting to see how
technology oh my gosh yes in 20 years 30
years years yeah yeah is this honest
this is a late and you know mid to late
1980s device right so so it is thirty
years ago this device 2017 was such a
hot find and we have heard that Nintendo
is now gonna make another run of this
and so you will be able to find it
hopefully much easier than last time
you'll be able to find this device again
on the shelves for for 60 bucks very
funny
device and they sold about they sold
over 2 million of the first run wow I
mean it was I think great exceeded
Nintendo's expectations in popularity
and since then they have the release the
Super NES classic version yeah and that
one has also sold really well so it's
like the vinyl records of video games
that's right
so we removed the single board here from
NES classic unless see if I can remove
the metal railing that's on top of this
yeah now when I pried it off a little
bit what you do is you have a little bit
of thermal sort of a thermal pan here
that helps dissipate the heat from the
processor on this we'll set this down
right here kind of like a giant heat
sink and one yes it is it provides a
little bit of EMI interference shielding
on this RF shielding and it also helps
dissipate heat off of them the processor
as well there yeah what's really
interesting what we found is really cool
about the new NES classic beyond it's
just small size right is it this is
basically a single board computer that
runs a Linux operating system yeah you
didn't necessarily expect to find that
inside of the device but that was really
interesting it has a quad core ARM based
it's a cortex a7 processor it has five
hundred and
twelve Meg's of storage on this it has
256 Meg's of RAM and you can see some of
the chips here you can see the storage
tips the memory chip the RAM chips you
see the video processor up here and then
you can also see the arm a7 processor
there no build there's also a micro USB
port on here what's that is that for
power
what is that for can you look can you
hack that and load okay so because it is
a Linux based operating system that yes
you can actually interface with the
device using the USB port and people
have figured out ways to load say up to
200 or so games on more than just a 30
this is just the 30 now another thing
that's really interesting as we start to
take the controller apart to remember is
there's 30 games on here now yeah
there's a lot more games that were
recently released for the NES for those
people that we were talking about that
put to 200 games on there you know
they're actually you know they've been
around for years as roms on a PC or in
other types of you know if you wanted to
play the games that way you could
download you can download them and use
them and then you know there's some gray
area depending on your jurisdiction
that's like I view it but yes owned the
game some people with what I would argue
whether Nintendo or the Adler sure or
the vel you know the developer would
agree with you is that's what a great
ear yeah that's where you'll hear is
like I owned double dribble and so you
know maybe I would download the ROM yeah
maybe I would feel within my rights to
download the ROM and use if I did pay
for with you is another matter
but what it's a legal gray area has not
been decided by the court yeah um so
what one of the interesting things is
that we read on the internet when we
were originally doing our cracking over
I'm trying to remove just a little
circuit board here for the the contact
for the reset and the power button up
front we can see that was that some
people have claimed as they look at the
roms that are on the games that didn't
but Nintendo actually did is they
actually went out to the Internet and
they download this little circuit board
you don't say ported Li and reportedly
that they actually use the hacked roms
that were available on the internet for
the games that are on the single portal
in his computer and now that is not
illegal for Nintendo to do that right
even if they are the hack Ross because
Nintendo has a licensing deal and owns
you know has the rights it's do this
very little property yeah and you're
like legit right yeah so where's you and
I we don't have that same kind of deal
we certainly couldn't download them and
sell them yes we all didn't use that
same deal if we owned the copy of the
original that's the great that's a great
so that's it that's all there is to
taking the NES we throw in pieces all
over the place that's all there is to
taking the NES classic apart
it really is just a plastic housing some
ports and a single board Linux computer
Super Mario Brothers and Zelda of course
one of the most popular games for this
console like it's some of my favorites
double dribble technical baseball
weren't on there Tecmo Bowl though the
football game was on there and we are in
America after all
so soccer so this this device though now
you're digging into the original what do
you find in our still standard screws oh
yeah so what we thought it would be
really cool to do like we were talking
about is doing old and new here yeah and
so luckily even on the original NES here
they do have a Phillips head screws here
so we're gonna use I'm taking these
apart I mean they're a little larger a
lot larger you can kind of see I don't
know the difference in size right this
is really kind of small but you can kind
of see the difference in size of the
screws for the old NES and then the
screws for the new one which is pretty
typical since you get since you think
that this is about a tenth of the volume
and the mass the the new one of the
originals right it's a it is much much
smaller
it shows the miniaturization of the
technology in that how far it's come in
30 years
also this didn't have any games if I
remember I built into the console story
you had to use a cartridge that was
where the actual storage was so
it is kind of fun well anything a lot of
them I mean the games were stored on the
cartridge yeah and there was no you know
until really like math or like Zelda
came out right there was no actual way
to save a game right you know
Zelda those cartridges had a battery in
the audience today Howard powered the
the the storage the memory inside the
cartridge this device was um was quite a
breakthrough at the time this was
multiple hundred dollar device at the
time right so it is also and these games
were you know twenty bucks
typically fifteen twenty bucks at least
so you're also talking about you know
the the economies of scale of this you
know since then so not only is the
device but you're talking probably you
know hundreds of dollars maybe even a
thousand dollars worth of you know games
and console that from this to that there
goes all this there goes all the screws
so just like the you know just like the
original one this one the are just like
the classic the NES classic the original
NES comes apart you know its clamshell a
few pieces there I took it apart upside
down because of the screws will set this
cartridge right most of it is the room
for the cartridge yeah these old 72 pin
cartridges here you know took up a lot
of space because like you know again
it's 1980s technology or even earlier
you know there were several iterations
of of the original NES it was released
in different configurations in the u.s.
in Japan sure and so you know it was
kind of a an evolution there were even
you know if anyone who had one of these
remembers the old uh blowing on the
cartridge technique oh yeah the pins
would get the contacts would get warm
would get dirty or they get warm out or
you take a cotton swab and alcohol or
something to try to clean them off
forgot about that you put the card
shopping in real hard and you get a
bunch of like the motor loves yeah you
pushing it down to make it go so they do
pull it out so then pop it back so as
people started to actually you know sort
of as they became more popular in retro
gaming there were actually modification
kits that you can buy for these to fix
those how many to pin you know cartridge
yeah problems right really yeah
yeah yeah usually you could hack this
device yeah they came out with this
there were repairs okay say you know
ways to fix the problems with the
original design you offer these massive
capacitors these caps that are over here
yeah we around the power suppliers
around the the video outputs don't see
any of that in the new devices right a
lot of single board computer in the new
one yep there's a lot of wires in here
wire
one of our producers actually brought
this in and let us graciously take it
apart we're gonna put it back together
in working order for it you must have an
immaculately clean house because there's
this very little puzzle nest in there so
he said this device still works unlike
his Nintendo Wii for example that it
doesn't um is it fully functional so it
is interesting to see how some of the
old tech you know was built with a
little bit more sense of sort of
ruggedness and meant to last we see that
over and over again you know very much
the technology today and of the last few
years there's more so far far more
disposable the Wii U that is is now
malfunctioning we just heard not the Wii
so even newer technology so this 30 year
old device though still working so
pretty impressive you know what I want
to do is we're gonna try and take the
cartridge the cartridge holder here off
of the connector here off of the
motherboard so we can see the main
circuit board underneath and we can see
the size of some of the chips underneath
that's really what we want to do and
then hold that up and compare that to
the single board computer that runs the
new NES classic this one will try to get
back together so Stephen Beecham
actually has a working Nintendo at the
end of this Thank You Stephen for
letting us crack this thing open
sometimes these devices have technology
in them that isn't enabled yet but it
tells you something about future
features that might be in the devices as
well as you know maybe future iterative
iterations of the device that might have
new features so we learn a lot of
interesting things we've been doing
these bill for over a dozen years as a
matter of fact 2006 you cracked open the
Xbox 360 mm-hmm
and so we found a lot of interesting
things from that and far more people
were interested than we expected and so
because of that we also cracked open an
iPod and then since then we've done you
know almost all the biggest technologies
if you want to look back at some of that
tech that's been cracked open in the
past you can go to tech republic calm
and you can see the galleries you can go
to see Netcom where we have a lot of the
videos all right so we got the circuit
board out of the original Nintendo
Entertainment System here you know we
have the all the the video output and
the power input and everything over here
and then you can see the size of the
silicon on the board right compared to
yeah this amazing I mean it's amazing
that you don't even have a single game
on here right it just runs the operating
system the video video epic oh that's it
everything all the game code is on there
now compared to this so from what we've
been able you know the getting details
on this is a little circumspect but what
we found is it has a 1.7 megahertz
processor what you would call a
processor on it and then it has I think
16 kilobits or 2 kilobytes of video
memory on this Wow and the same in what
we would call Ram like yeah 16 kilobytes
of RAM and or 2 kilo or 16 kilobytes 2
kilobytes of RAM on this thing compared
to this right that has 512 megabytes
amazing of storage and a quad core
processor and I think 256 Meg's of RAM
so it's a lot more power in a much
smaller package because yeah that's what
you get 30 years of tests are you and so
you think about this basically like a 1
to 2 megahertz processor yeah that's it
at one point seven miles long now at the
time old 8-bit video games so at the
time this is a pretty breakthrough
device that they can sell this this
cheaply and have what was really great
graphics at the time to we look back and
laugh at it now it's 8-bit and its
well you look in but people still enjoy
it today was it was a little bit better
than my old Commodore 64 or Tiger 8600
you know still this was fantastic you
know tons of fond memories so there you
have it the old and the new um this
device will be coming back again for 60
bucks 30 games and a lot of retro
memories that's 30 cheap for retro man
that really is it really is lots of
great stuff there so you can go to
TechRepublic comm for more cracking
opens more photos of cracking opens you
can go to see net for more video of all
the cracking opens that we've done in
the past and what would you like to see
us crack open next leave us a note in
the comments and we'll take a look
because we're always looking for the
best old and new stuff to crack open so
thanks for watching we'll see you next
time
