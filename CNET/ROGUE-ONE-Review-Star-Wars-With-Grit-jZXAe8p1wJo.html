there was a movie called Star Wars
what we didn't know until now is that
around the back of Star Wars just out of
sight another movie was playing out that
movie was road one rebels on you
Road one the first Star Wars spin-off
takes us through a host of new worlds
and introduces us to a bunch of new
faces but it's intertwined with the saga
we know as these previously unknown
minor characters and bit part players do
their bit against the evil empire
stealing the plans to the dreaded Death
Star and we all know how that turned out
the ragtag band of new characters led by
plucky Felicity Jones includes the
hilarious alan tudyk as straight-talking
droid k2s oh and affecting donnie yen as
a warrior monk with a touch of the jedi
about him together they take on Ben
Mendelssohn's ambitious Imperial
bureaucrat in a gritty dust Street tale
that largely takes place at street level
somewhere around the corner from the
original movies as Rho 1 rubs up against
their new hope we do meet a few old
faces some of which work better than
others but it's pretty liberating to
watch a blockbuster in which you know
there's no sequels franchises or civil
wars to come and so you genuinely don't
know which characters are going to make
it but I despite knowing roughly how
it's all going to turn out there are a
lot of thrills to be had director Gareth
Edwards dives into the classic Star Wars
toy box for I puffing pulse pounding
action that dials the classic series up
to 11 the climax is electrifying proving
you don't need Skywalker's to tell a
spectacular Star Wars story basing the
dark side at street level road one is a
force to be reckoned with
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
