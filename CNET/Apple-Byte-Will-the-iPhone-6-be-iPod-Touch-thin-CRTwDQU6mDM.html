welcome to the apple buy for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
in we're just a month away from WWDC
2014 and iphone rumors are hot like a
fire right now well the Apple faithful
felt that special tingly feeling this
week okay after a physical mock-up of
the alleged iphone 6 made it to the
interwebs based on design drawings that
were posted by japanese magazine mac fan
last month now there's a debate if this
is the 4.7 inch or larger 5.5 inch
design because there were no
measurements included with the pictures
and really we don't know the size of
that person's hand now the mock-up shows
substantially thinner sides with the
elongated pill-shaped volume buttons it
also has the protruding camera lens
similar to the current ipod touch and
yes this is just a mock-up and they've
used these as references for making
iphone cases in the past but let's just
pretend it the iphone looks remotely
close to this i might have to put my
lawn chair outside of an apple store
right now alright digging deeper into
the potential design unboxtherapy also
suggests the next iphone kabhi as thin
as the ipod touch after putting a 5th
gen touch inside an alleged 4.7 inch
iphone case from china that was a
perfect fit for depth and a perfect fit
for the volume buttons now the rumoured
iphone 6 cases even thinner than the
current iphone 5 and i know the first
thing i thought when they released the
new ipod touch was when are they going
to make this iphone as thin as this
touch well it could be coming soon now
Apple sapphire crystal partner GT
advanced as started production and has
even shipped small quantities of the
material to an apple partner in China
responsible for making sapphire covers
according to UPS research the report
says GT advanced still isn't at full
capacity and is on schedule to install
another 400 to 500 furnaces for the
first quarter of two thousand fourteen
and nine hundred to a thousand more for
the second quarter of the year earlier
reports have indicated that GT advanced
will have the ability to produce an
estimated 100 to 200 million sapphire
displays per year that's a whole bunch
of iPhones
and oh yeah I watches and since we're
talking about watches Apple suppliers
have already started producing the
iWatch in small quantities according to
sources for the China times they also
report that the eyewash will use a
system in package design that allows a
multitude of chips to be placed on a
single module allowing Apple to fit
multiple sensors for the rumored watch
inside its compact design now Apple's
iWatch is still expected to come in two
different sizes according to reports and
could appear in September but it's all
speculation as usual apple also did
release a new product this week with
updated MacBook Airs featuring faster
1.4 2 gigahertz dual-core Intel Haswell
processors everything else pretty much
remains the same spec wise which will
get better battery life with the 11 inch
increasing from eight hours to 9 hours
and the 13-inch bumps up from 10 hours
to 12 geekbench benchmarks show that the
new airs show a slight performance boost
from the previous models with a single
core 32-bit score and the multi-core
score as well the best part about all
this a price point one hundred dollars
cheaper than the previous model and that
means you can get an entry-level
notebook for 899 from Apple and can it
get even better than that we'll check
this out refurbished 2012 11 inch models
are now starting as low as 5 99 now
they're sold out right now and I doubt
there will be any stock left over but
when new models are released you can
always get a great deal on refurbs that
are still under the same apple warranty
see that's a quick tip for you and on to
the quick bytes hulu recently announced
that this summer people without paid
hulu access will be able to view full
episodes of TV shows via the hulu mobile
app and that applies to iPhone and iPad
versions of the app now the content will
still be ad supported and a version of a
two-lap will be launching this summer
that's revamped as well we don't know
what content will be available but I've
got to imagine this is a way to close
the gap between their 6 million
subscribers compared to Netflix is 44
million alright productivity fans will
be happy to hear this google brings a
pair of dedicated apps for iOS with the
release of Google Docs and Google sheets
for the iphone and ipad that are free
your previously only able to access your
documents in the Google Drive app or
through the brows
but I'm loving this and they are
planning on bringing their presentation
app Google slides soon and Microsoft
Office for iPad apps including Word
Excel and PowerPoint are finally getting
printing capabilities with over-the-air
printing but editing and creating
documents well that will still require
an office 365 subscription all right
that's going to do for this to me show
keep sending me your emails to the apple
byte at cnet com or tweet me at brian
Tong and we know about the video and
audio issues that have been plaguing
some of you Apple biters for about the
past month so I've been told they should
be resolved in the next week or so and
