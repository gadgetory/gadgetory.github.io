out the FCC voted three to two in favor
of repealing rules designed to make
internet providers treat online traffic
and services equally but it wasn't
without some drama before the vote the
room was briefly evacuated because of
the security alert and during the
hearing
fiery statements were made against the
repeal by Commissioner mignon Clyburn I
dissent some may ask why are we
witnessing such unprecedented
groundswell of public support for
keeping the 2015 net neutrality
protections in place because the public
can plainly see that assumed to be
toothless FCC is handing the keys to the
Internet
the Internet one of the most remarkable
empowering enabling inventions of our
lifetime over to a handful of
multibillion-dollar corporations in
response chairman eject I had this quip
Thank You Commissioner Clyburn I mean to
mark you down as a no Commissioner
Michael O'Reilly followed up with his
statements supporting getting rid of the
rules the legend of a cable company
trying to break the internet may make a
scary bedtime story for children of
telecom geeks but it isn't reality so
for those of you out there that are
fearful what tomorrow may bring please
take a deep breath this decision will
not break the internet now the vote has
been taken the repeal has to be entered
into the Federal Register and that's
expected to happen early next year so
will the internet look any different
tomorrow
CNET's Maggie Reardon explains the
changes that a lot of people fear are
gonna happen slowly and it's gonna
happen when broadband providers and
wireless companies start to change their
business models so you're not going to
notice anything probably for quite some
time the vote happened just one day
after New York Attorney General Eric
Schneiderman reported that two million
comets submitted to the FCC about net
neutrality were made under misused
identities earlier in December Snyderman
along with 28 senators called on the FCC
to delay the vote until the fake
comments could be investigated the FCC
rejected these requests to delay the
votes but Commissioner Jessica
rosenworcel addressed concerns in her
statements saying half a million
comments were submitted using Russian
email addresses she said quote I think
that's a problem end quote
for a deeper dive into the world of net
neutrality and what it means for you
right now we've brewed up a handy
explanation with beer on cnet.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
