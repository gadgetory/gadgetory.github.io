out there but you have one that's gold
it's pretty hard to find well I mean
this the 12-inch gold MacBook and maybe
one or two others but it's still fairly
rare this is an updated version of the
Dell XPS 13 we liked so much last year
like that model and the 15-inch
version of the XPS it's got a very very
very thin screen bezel the display goes
right up to the very edge
they call it an infinity display and
once you see it it's really a striking
look and it lets you make the footprint
of the laptop smaller and and really
puts the screen front and center this is
very comparable to 13 inch class laptops
from Lenovo or from Microsoft very much
like a MacBook Air because the footprint
is a little bit smaller on the DAO it
actually feels heavier because they all
weigh the same a little bit under three
pounds you can do some basic gaming on
this guy because one of the updates is
to intel's iris level graphics that's
their slightly better integrated
graphics chip it's not as good as having
its own dedicated graphics card but it's
good for very casual gaming
now the XPS 13 line starts at $9.99 but
you're not gonna get this model for that
that's something without a touchscreen a
lower-risk green lower end processor
this model here has pretty much all the
bells and whistles it's got the 3200 by
1800 touch screen it's got a Core i7
processor a big solid-state drive and of
course that very cool gold color and
it's going to be about $1,600 a hefty
investment but a very cool laptop that's
the Dell XPS 13 Gold Edition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
