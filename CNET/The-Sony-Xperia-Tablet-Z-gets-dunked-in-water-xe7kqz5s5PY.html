I'm taking a first look at the Sony
Xperia tablet Z this is a follow up to
Sony's Xperia Tablet S from last year
and they've changed a few things let's
take a look at those first gone is the
wedge design from the Xperia Tablet S
now in favor of more traditional kind of
normal design I say normal but it's
actually according to Sony the thinnest
and lightest 10-inch tablet yet and with
a 7 millimeter thickness and 1.1 pound
weight it's kind of hard to argue let's
go through some of the ports as you can
see here there's a power button and a
volume rocker and then there's a cover
for the headphone jack let me see if I
can open that right here I'll explain
why that's cover it later there's also a
cover for the image L connector which
doubles as a microUSB port which you can
charge and transfer files as well
there's a cover for the micro SD card
slot as well the tablet runs a Qualcomm
s4 1.5 gigahertz processor has a 1920 by
1200 resolution screen and runs Android
4.1.2 jelly bean has a 8 megapixel back
camera and a 2 megapixel front camera
the camera software now features
something called superior auto which
makes it easier to take pictures in
low-light situations and when an object
is moving as I mentioned before all the
ports on the Xperia tablet Z are covered
there's a reason for that
it's actually fully waterproof while the
experience Hamlet s was only splash
proof this one is Dunkel look for the
experience haplit Z in May starting at
$499 for 16 gigabytes and 599 dollars
for 32 gigabytes once again America
Franklin and this has been a first look
at the sony xperia tablet z
