hi i'm molly wood and welcome to the
buzz report the show about the tech news
that everybody's talking about this week
it's star trek windows 7 and the new
kindle speaking of which let's get to
the gadget of the week the gadget of the
week is the amazon kindle DX of course
it's the new much larger version of the
kindle two and it's aimed at college
students and newspaper readers it's not
much different from the standard kindle
aside from the colossal size it has a
little more storage capacity there's PDF
viewing mm the ability to switch from
landscape to portrait mode by rotating
it oh and did I forget the headline it
costs four hundred and eighty-nine
dollars yeah I guess they figured that
once you drop in the word textbook you
can charge whatever you want but so okay
now there are two Kindles and ones for
newspapers and text books and one is
just for regular books so like I've got
my old kindle two for books but
apparently that's no good for textbooks
or newspaper subscriptions so I'm going
to need the new giant kindle but then
neither of those can really surf the web
or anything so like I need a netbook to
so that I can surf and do email but then
this can't make phone calls so I also
need my iphone which can surf and do
email and read books but the screens not
really big enough to do all of those
things all the time I guess and then
anyway I can't watch DVDs on any of
those or use Photoshop or play games and
they don't have enough storage so i need
this bigger laptop right here and
actually maybe I mean if I really need
horsepower now I'm gonna need a big old
pc like those are here and then now I
need a way bigger house and a back brace
too far amazon too far and now for the
news the windows 7 release candidate hit
the tubes on tuesday with pretty cool
new support for streaming media between
two windows 7 enabled computers and some
other nifty features but like most
windows news it came with a pretty big
buzz kill the XP Mode that's supposed to
make it easier to use older software
with windows 7 won't work on a whole lot
of intel laptops I mean it's probably
not a huge deal for most people because
there aren't that many XP specific apps
but
you know like come on Microsoft just
have a good day will ya killing me okay
in geek pop news of the week there's a
certain movie opening that's got
everyone a buzz and it sent me on a
pretty nifty little field trip now I'm
here in the hallway at Industrial Light
&amp;amp; Magic or as i like to call it nerdvana
where we got a sneak peek at the new
movie star trek
what kind of comment Randy huh fancy
Ridgell beyond I think the
characterizations and the emotional
connection between the characters you
will see something else that I think
you've never seen before in the Star
Trek stories are took movie brought you
know platform film which is visual
effects at a quality that it deserves
gentlemen we're approaching the drop
zone get one shot to land on that wet
they have defenses employer shoots late
as possible three two one remember the
enterprise won't be able to beam you
back so you turn off that drill good
luck we had these wind machines I I mean
it's sometimes I could barely stand in
it and our suits were though gorgeous
we're difficult to move in there to
being so it took some effort to just do
to get a cup of coffee to your mouth oh
okay I don't want to do a big star trek
ad I mean whatever I want to see it but
dudes you should see Industrial Light &amp;amp;
Magic check it out
also I wonder if those ILM people feel
like star traders you know they're owned
by Lucasfilm right awkward and finally I
want to say a huge thank you to everyone
who helped seen at TV when a people's
voice award in this year's webbie's I
know we nagged you a lot to vote but you
did you are awesome it means a lot to me
personally and everyone else here at
cnet TV so thank you and I just hope
they let me go to the party and that's
the buzz report for this week everyone
I'm Mollywood and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
