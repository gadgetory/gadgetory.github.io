GE Profile series 2.2 cubic foot
countertop microwave oven this is a very
big microwave it's got a 16 inch
turntable inside of it and a lot of
space to it so you're gonna need a lot
of room in your counter but it's a very
good microwave it's got power to it it's
got some smart settings and we were
pretty impressed with how it cooked I'm
not sure that it's enough of an upgrade
over the standard microwave you probably
have already to justify the cost though
this thing is three hundred and fifty
nine dollars and if you want a little
bit less you can get it for 309 without
the stainless steel finish in terms of
its cooking power it does a pretty
decent job it behaves like most other
microwaves it'll make popcorn it'll make
frozen dinners it'll make hot pockets
but it doesn't do it a whole lot better
than the average microwave and that was
a bit disappointing one thing that we
were impressed with though was the fact
that it's got moisture sensors and these
can detect how much steam is escaping
your food and then automatically cook it
for the right amount of time so you just
put the thing in hit one button and
it'll do the rest with reheating this
did especially well so if you have
leftovers that you want to cook this is
a great microwave we tried out Little
Caesars Pizza that was neither hot nor
ready and it did a great job it made
really good gooey melty pizza that we
enjoyed eating and it also did well with
bigger sized entrees that took advantage
of the high capacity we had a big tray
of enchiladas we had Salisbury steak we
had cheddar potato casserole and it was
able to figure out how long to cook all
of them and that was very impressive to
us however you have to remember this is
a three hundred and $59 microwave and
that's a lot more than other upgraded
microwaves were looking at it doesn't
have convection or inverter tech it's
just a basic microwave that has these
moisture sensors and has a lot of
capacity to it so if that's enough for
you if you want to cook a lot of food
for a lot of people and do it pretty
easily with those sensors it's not a bad
microwave but we've seen microwaves from
other brands like a manna that also have
moisture sensors and can automatically
detect your foods cooking time and they
cost a lot less so I'm not sure that I
can recommend this microwave but still I
was impressed with it I liked using it
so give it a look and see if it's right
for you Christina I'm rec wrist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
