station extreme and FC purple drive now
this one's quite large about twice the
size of this typical drive from Seagate
right here but before you go all heading
on it well it is large for a reason
first it comes with layer protection it
has a rug the chasis and multiple
bubbles on inside that redirect the
shock away from the internal drive on
the inside and that means this drive
here can survive a drop from some 1.2
meter high or for food is also dust and
water resistant and that's more it come
with this built-in USB cable very
conveniently for you to use without
having to carry a separate one around
now if that does not impress you yet
well there is this label right here is
to indicate that you can use an NFC or
near field communication device to open
the drive but why opening well the drive
feature to 256 ae has formed this
encryption to protect the data on inside
from unauthorized access now in case you
lose it by default the drive works in
the open mode but you can easy chain to
the secure mode using this mode changes
software now note that changing from one
mode to another will require
reformatting so you want to do this
before putting any data on the drive now
in the secure mode you can pick a
password it can also register an NFC
device as the key at the dryer included
smart card right here to use with it but
it can also use a mobile device such as
a smartphone and speaking of smartphone
you might wonder if the iPhone 6 will
work with it well let's try no it
doesn't and that's because with the
iPhone 6 and 6 plus the NFC function is
you strictly only for Apple pay for now
but an Android phone however will work
so there you go the buffer here is large
for good reasons
now comes the performance well in my
testing was quite fast with a sustained
real-world copy speed of more than 110
megabyte per second for writing and
close to her a 20 megabyte per second
reading via SP through playing out the
drive also works with a speed Topanga
note though in my testing the mode
changes software didn't work with all of
the older windows computer so maybe you
stick with just the newer USB 3.0 enable
computers only okay the price the
buffalo here is available in two
capacity one terabyte and two terabyte
that cost hundred thirty dollars and two
hundred dollars respectively
now that expensive compared with other
poor bowdry of the same capacity but the
drive here does come with feature that
others don't if I'm or the drive here
check out my full review as cnet.com
basically if you intend to carry along
information that you don't want others
to see well this one is the drive for
you and that's mean it's not for me and
not because I have nothing to hide but
because I just don't care for example
the video you're watching right now feel
free to show it to as many people as you
want I will not take it personal and
that's because I'm dumb going this has
been the first look at the buffalo mini
station extreme and ab c-- turbo drive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
