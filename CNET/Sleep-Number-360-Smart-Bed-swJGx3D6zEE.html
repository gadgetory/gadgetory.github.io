similar to its previous offerings it has
built-in sleep IQ smart so that means it
has dual size so you and a partner can
customize your firmness settings so you
can be more comfortable it also has
built-in sensors that know if you're
tossing and turning no when you get out
of bed and for how long and in the
morning it'll give you a reading on your
sleep IQ score basically how well you've
done so you can improve it over time so
you can check your weekly and monthly
averages and see trends in your sleep
but this model has something even
smarter it has a few cool new features
that I'm just dying to show off so the
first thing is snore detection so
basically the bed can tell if you're
snoring and it will raise your side of
the bed to try to help mitigate that
snoring it also knows if you're moving
from your back to your side mid sleep
and it will adjust your firmness setting
because apparently there's an ideal
position for you to be in and an ideal
firmness for that side or back sleep in
addition this one has basically an
integrated heat element at the foot of
the bed so you and a partner can opt in
or out so on my side of the bed I would
definitely turn on that heating element
so that my feet are warmed as I'm
falling asleep and my husband would turn
it off because he has warm feet so I
think this is just a really cool new bed
new offering it'll be available in the
first half of 2017 and pricing hasn't
been set yet but it should retail for
around $2,500</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
