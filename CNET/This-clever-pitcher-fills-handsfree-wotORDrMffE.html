again at the first build facility in
Louisville Kentucky with the smart
pitcher basically it takes a regular
picture add some smart sensing
technology and makes it a lot easier for
you to fill up your picture so this
picture is outfitted with two magnets
and the dispenser kit inside is
outfitted with two reed switches the
first reed switch comes in contact with
a magnet and lets you know that the
pitcher is there the second reed switch
is built on a float so as the water
fills up it comes into contact with the
reed switch and tells it to stop the
water and there you have an autofill
pitcher that's built into your
refrigerator first build will be selling
these pitcher kits on their website but
you can fit to your refrigerator but
it's only going to be available right
now on one frigerator model you will
also have the option of buying the
refrigerator with the kit already built
in this is definitely something that's
geared around the maker movement
something for someone who really likes
DIY you have to drill a hole into the
back of the fridge but that's the extent
of the installation process so it's
pretty simple and if you're interested
in kind of an entry-level DIY that has a
pretty practical application I think
this might be an interesting way to
start</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
