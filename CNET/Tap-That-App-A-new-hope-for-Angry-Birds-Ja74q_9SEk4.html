I'm Jason Parker and this is the show
where we check out the hottest apps in
the mobile space Angry Birds Star Wars
is finally here and it's got all the
slingshot bird destruction you already
love paired with the Star Wars
characters and weapons you remember from
the movies while the gameplay is similar
to earlier Angry Birds games new weapons
and jedi-like abilities add enough new
elements to the action to make the game
worth your money just like the other
Angry Birds games you're presented with
a level where you'll need to destroy all
the pigs but these Imperial pig troopers
have new tricks up their sleeves
including blasters you'll need to avoid
as you progress through the levels
you'll unlock new star wars birds like
the obi-wan Kenobi bird that uses a
force push to knock down objects and
take out pig troopers your Birds level
up as you play - so the original loop
bird you get in the beginning later earn
a lightsaber that you can use to take
out objects in your way of course if you
fail to finish the level you'll get a
glimpse of the pig Darth Vader taunting
you to try again there are more than 80
levels to explore including hidden
levels you can unlock by getting a
specific number of stars an early bonus
level I played let me use c-3po and r2d2
birds to take out pig troopers in space
using the droids own special abilities
if you get thirty stars you'll also
unlock the mighty Falcon which you can
use on particularly hard levels to blow
away all the pigs at once
you only get a small number of Falcons
to use so you'll need to pick your
battles wisely in keeping with the Star
Wars theme you'll not only play with
birds made to look like Luke obi-wan and
Chewbacca
you'll also explore themed world
starting with Luke's home planet of
tatooine and then the appear you'll pig
star there is a placeholder for ha theme
levels as well but those are still to
come in free updates down the road but
you can spend an additional $1.99 to
open up an extra path of the Jedi level
set now where you'll be under the
tutelage of a bird-like Jedi Master Yoda
Angry Birds Star Wars is available now
at the App Store with an iPhone version
that cost 99 cents and an HD iPad
version for $1.99 if you like Angry
Birds or Star Wars I heartily recommend
you tap this app immediately that's it
for today's show but if you have any
suggestions for tap that app hit me up
on twitter at jay parker CNET
