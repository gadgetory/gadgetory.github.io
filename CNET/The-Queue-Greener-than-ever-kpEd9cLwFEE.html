demuro with Cena TV in New York City
where spring-like temperatures have
finally arrived this is the Q tech news
for the Twitter generation let's get you
started with some eye candy funny church
signs a staple of smart marketing now
Google getting a lot of clicks Claude
presbyterian church tells us there are
some questions that can't be answered by
Google while the north's or assembly of
god Ponder's the similar Google can't
satisfy every search I'd like to propose
a third courtesy of church sign
generator calm only Google and God know
your search history and feel free to use
that one in a great example of a mixed
marketing message a new campaign urging
kids to turn down the volume is in the
form of a song loud music can be
dangerous the american
speech-language-hearing association or
asha behind the rap song push they're
concerned the youngins could lose their
hearing early because of today's
always-on cranked up mp3 player society
a message for adults to some pretty
funny public service announcements where
a guy gets the wrong tattoo because his
music is too loud if we can't get young
people to watch the news at least let
them play with it MSNBC making news fun
again with the news breaker game styled
after Atari smash hit break out no pun
intended newsbreaker lets you break
bricks and select headlines for points
of course if you see something you like
you can click for the full story and
your game is paused running out of ink
toner or paper are all annoying printing
problems second only to those lingering
pages at the end of a print job with
only a line or two on them now a company
called green print wants to help they
have two solutions first a font called
evergreen to minimize paper use the
characters are designed so you can fit
more words on each page without being
tougher to read the company says
evergreen uses fifteen to twenty percent
less paper than Arial or Times New Roman
then there's a green print software it
automatically strips out those wasteful
final print pages that don't have any
useful content on
and I don't just talk about this stuff I
now use the font and every T is a little
tree it's kind of like planning a little
sapling every time you print finally the
beta when you've sat next to your fair
share of smelly sweaty or simply
Annoying seat mates on a flight it's
time for an air traduction the website
started by a frequent flier sick of
wasting time sitting next to no bodies
air traductions calm lets you build a
profile and enter in flight info for a
mile-high hookup no not that kind but
you never know the site designed to pair
you up with someone who's fun to talk to
or a potential business matchups all I'm
saying is that they didn't have air
traductions a few years back when i sat
next to a playmate on my flight from LA
to dallas that was interesting all right
my friends go redeem the miles you've
earned because you are all cued up I'm
