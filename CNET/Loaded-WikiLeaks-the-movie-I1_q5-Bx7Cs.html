Morris and it's time to get loaded
blackberry maker research in motion is
plenty to change up the software on its
phones to somehow parse out your
personal from your professional life the
software is called blackberry balance it
will give corporate administrators
control of your business only life on
your blackberry and give you control of
your personal life such as your facebook
or your gmail accounts this is expected
out in two months McDonald's is
launching a tap and go payment system in
the UK you do need a card the cashier
will scan that card and if your payment
is over 15 pounds you don't have to
enter a pin you just tap and go and I
would imagine these cards will hit
smartphones sooner than later making
this truly fast food and you can't use
duke nukem forever as the butt of your
jokes any longer the long awaited and i
do mean long-awaited sequel to the
popular game now has a release date of
May third for those of you that don't
know the history this game has been in
production for over a decade it was due
out in 1998 better late than never I
guess it launches overseas on may six
historian and author mark schulman has
published a biography optimized for the
iPad JFK history maker a 50 year
retrospective uses the medium to tell
the story of the life of John F Kennedy
he does this through photos videos audio
clips texts of speeches calendars and
more it's a very clever way to think of
the New Age novel and if you like the
facebook movie you might really love the
WikiLeaks movie coming soon to a theater
near you The Guardian reports that movie
studio executives have a screenplay for
the WikiLeaks story in the works from
the Julian Assange biography the most
dangerous man in the world you gotta
admit it would seem like this movie
would have a more dynamic and possibly
eccentric protagonist and finally this
story is unfortunate applehead plan to
give a ten-thousand-dollar gift card to
the person who downloaded their 10
billions app too bad for that person she
hung up on them mistaking the call for a
telemarketer thankfully Apple called her
back to give her a second chance at the
prize that's your news of the day if you
want more about any of the stories we
discussed today visit Cena
calm / floated I will see you tomorrow
