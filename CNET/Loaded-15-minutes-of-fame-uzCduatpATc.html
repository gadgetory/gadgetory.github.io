Morris coming to you from San Francisco
this week it's time to get loaded the
fastest-rising term in Google this year
was chat roulette meaning that the video
chatting site that leaned towards the
perverted was very popular this year
tisk tisk google released its 2010
zeitgeist with the fastest growing and
most popular terms of the year and it's
no surprise that justin bieber and katy
perry are both on that list and you are
no longer limited to 15 minutes of fame
at least not on youtube the video
sharing site has started to allow
uploads that are longer than 15 minutes
which used to be the max not everyone
can do this yet only a select set of
users with good standing with YouTube
yahoo has revamped its local pages these
are its yellow page type listings the
new pages include local news articles
pertaining to a given location plus
deals and events the new pages are only
available in 30 markets to start and you
may feel like everyone and their mother
is on Twitter but that's actually not
true a new pew research study shows that
only eight percent of online Americans
are on Twitter people aged 18 to 29 are
more likely to be on Twitter and
minorities are also twice as likely as
White's to be users it's also
interesting what is being posted
seventy-two percent of users post about
their personal lives sixty-two percent
post about their job fifty-five percent
post links to news stories and
fifty-three percent like to retweet and
finally the king of all media Howard
Stern announced on Thursday that he will
resign with sirius satellite radio for
another five years not only that he will
now be included in serious mobile apps
where he had previously been absent
stern's first contract expired this
month and he had hinted about going to a
new medium but in the end he will not he
will stay put in satellite radio those
are your headlines for today and that
wraps up your week of getting loaded I
will see you back in New York
monday have a great weekend I'm Natali
Morris for cnet.com and you've just been
