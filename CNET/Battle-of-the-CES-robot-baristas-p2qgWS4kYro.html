robot baristas this year at CES a
handful of boost featured large robotic
arms that made hot caffeinated beverages
after having three different barista
robots make me coffee tea and a
cappuccino which one did it the best the
competitors weighing in at several
hundred pounds having only one arm and
able to make a latte cappuccino or
americano
it's the Boche next up traveling all the
way from China sporting an orange paint
job and able to make a cup of fresh tea
it's the Abu and our last robot barista
clad in Chrome
having not one but two robotic arms and
able to make a pour-over cup of coffee
it's the Denso first test customer
service the Bosch robot won this test
easily it asks for my name gave me a
choice of beverages and wished me well
when it gave me my cappuccino the robot
did not talk but rather protected words
onto a countertop I could even tap on
options and presented me and it would
understand my responses both the Abu and
the Denso robots gave me no such
interaction next test making drinks
whereas the Bosch cappuccino robot was
all about customer service
the Abu T robot heated a kettle of water
scooped a spoonful of tea leaves poured
hot water over the tea leaves and poured
the tea into a cup the Bosch robots prep
was kind of lackluster it only puts a
couple of buttons on an automated
machine the Machine did the rest
boring but the winner for making drinks
was the Denso coffee robot with its two
robotic arms that worked in sync the
robot put grounds into the filter with
one arm while the second arm poured hot
water over those grounds when the Denso
robot removed the filter and grounds one
arm picked up the spent filter while the
other moved the glass pot underneath to
catch any dripping delicious into
the final test the taste test the
cappuccino the Busch robot named tasted
as good as a cappuccino from Starbucks
the cup even had my name on it spelled
correctly the cup of tea the Abu robot
made was delicious but the cup of pour
over coffee from the Denso robot was the
best hands down so this year's winner of
the unofficial Battle of the CES robot
baristas is the Denso despite its quiet
engagement the dinger robot made the
best beverage and put on the best show
see you next year for another unofficial
battle of the CES robot barista</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
