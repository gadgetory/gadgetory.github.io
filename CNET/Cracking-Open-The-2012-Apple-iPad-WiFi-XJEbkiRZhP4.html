iPad may look a lot like its predecessor
but it's what's on the inside that
counts I'm bill detwiler head technology
editor at cnet sister site techrepublic
and i'm going to crack open the Wi-Fi
only version of the 2012 ipad the 2012
ipad is nearly identical to the ipad 2
in design and construction now this is
nice as it means many ipad 2 accessories
such as the Smart Cover will fit this
year's model but it also means the new
tablet is a real pain to crack open and
work on now to begin cracking open the
third-generation ipad I used a hair
dryer to loosen the adhesive which holds
the front panel to the aluminum case I
then used a series of plastic and metal
tools to gently pry off the panel even
having done this before on the iPad 2
and the new 4g this process took at
least 30 minutes so be patient and don't
rush it now with the front panel open I
removed the retina display and
disconnected the front panel from the
motherboard I then detach the visible
connectors from the motherboard and
remove the motherboard itself now unlike
the 4G version the Wi-Fi only ipad lacks
the separate cellular board and cellular
antennas at this point i decided against
removing any of the other components
from the case most are either held in
place with very strong adhesive or their
connector cables are forcing them loose
could damage them and I want to put this
iPad back together so the only thing
left to do is remove the EMI RFI shields
from the motherboard and with that my
teardown was complete so what did I
learn from cracking open the Wi-Fi only
version of the 2012 iPad well Apple kept
the overall hardware layout the same but
upgraded many of the internal components
the new 9.7 inch Retina Display has a
resolution of 2048 x 1536 at 264 pixels
per inch and that offers four times the
total number of pixels as the ipad tues
screen now to run this display apple
gave the ipad more
GPU and more RAM from what I can tell
the 2012 iPads a 5x system on a chip has
a dual core cpu like the ipad 2 but a
quad-core GPU now the 2012 ipad also has
one gig of ram compared to the ipad 2 s
512 megabytes along with the upgraded
graphics the new ipad also has an
improved isight camera and support for
AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon 4G LTE networks on the
4g model now as this is a Wi-Fi only
ipad it doesn't have the separate
cellular card or antennas found on the
4g version now one of the more
surprising features of the new ipad is
the battery although it's roughly the
same physical size as the ipad tues
battery it provides a lot more power the
new battery is rated at 43 watt hours
compared to just 25 watt hours for the
ipad 2 but given the new tablets
souped-up hardware battery life remains
about the same on the downside ample
didn't increase the ipad storage
capacity the 2012 model comes in 16 32
and 64 gig versions also the tablet has
a single speaker whereas most other
10-inch tablets have to lastly like the
ipad to the new ipad is very difficult
to work on Apple definitely didn't
design this tablet to be user
serviceable as far as pricing Wi-Fi only
iPads start at 499 and go up to 6 99
Wi-Fi + 4g models and one hundred and
thirty dollars to the base price now as
I noted in my review of the 4g iPad
there's nothing revolutionary about the
2012 model but it is a solid incremental
update and a seam or iPad teardown
