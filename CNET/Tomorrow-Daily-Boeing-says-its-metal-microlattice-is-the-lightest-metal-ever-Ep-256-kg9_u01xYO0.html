to tomorrow daily the best ski talk show
in the known universe these are our many
episodes designed to satiate your need
for tomorrow daily until our new set is
built up enough of that it's at the
headlines researchers working for Boeing
have developed a material that is 100
times lighter than styrofoam and they're
finally showing off that process in a
new video home by the way that material
it's actually made of metal hrl
Laboratories developed this material
it's a micro lattice that they compared
to your bone structure so rigid on the
outside but generally hollow on the
inside meaning it would be lightweight
but also really hard to crush the
material itself is 99.99% air and the
wall thickness of the hollow tubes that
make up the micro lattice are a thousand
times thinner than a human hair which is
pretty futuristic stuff possible
applications for this metal micro
lattice include Boeing's own airplanes
or maybe even cars because hrl
laboratories works with general motors
now going from earthbound travel to up
in space robots may someday help
astronauts aboard the ISS this robot is
the best man
Eila it's a collaboration between the
German Research Center for artificial
intelligence and the University of
Bremen Eila has articulated fingers on
both arms
cameras in its head a short-range laser
scanner in its chest and a bunch of
other various features and connection
abilities the idea here is to train the
robot to complete menial tasks onboard
the ISS freeing up astronauts to
complete tasks that either require human
intuition or may be a task that requires
two human operators they're still
working really hard on ila and they're
not quite ready yet to tackle things
like microgravity and how eyelid would
get around but we may see a
demonstration via a simulation of the
International Space Station sometime in
the near future
going from robots helping astronauts in
outer space to people who maybe saw a
bug's life way too many times and said
we should drink water like ants I have
to of course tell you about ooh ho this
is oh ho an edible water bottle that
looks and
like a palm-sized water balloon it was
created by london-based startup skipping
rock slab who says this delivery method
for water is easy and cheap to make
hygienic and most importantly
biodegradable skipping rocks reminds us
that single-use water bottles are wildly
unsustainable and terrible for the
environment but blue hose casing is made
of brown algae and calcium chloride so
once you're done sucking all the water
out of that beautiful little orb you can
throw it out with the knowledge that
you're helping save the environment or
you can eat oh no oh no no no no I'm not
eating that let's talk about back into
Hackett today's back into Hackett it's
the perfect product for anybody who
wants to grow a micro rainforest in
their home this is called the BioPod
this is pretty cool we're super
intrigued by the BioPod this is a
self-titled world's first smart micro
habitat the BioPod uses an app to
actually regulate light temperature
humidity ventilation and even rainfall
inside the unit they're a bunch of
different presets in the app that you
can choose from once you get your bio
pod and you're ready to start up ranging
from growing some Tomatoes all the way
to cultivating a little tiny rainforest
complete with tree frogs the app walks
you through the setup planting of your
plants and then lets you walk away from
it as it regulates the small environment
to its needs there are three models of
BioPod there's the one which is the most
basic model there's the Terra which is
meant to be sort of a terrain and then
of course the Aqua so you can actually
make it a fish tank if you want if you
buy that higher-end one the BioPod one
starts at two hundred and five US
dollars without plants so you got to
populate it yourself with plants if you
want the BioPod to come with a plant
starter pack there are backer levels for
that as well they have 22 days left and
they've already surpassed their goal of
30,000 Canadian dollars by quite a bit
so if you want to back it the BioPod
looks like it's definitely gonna happen
alright guys we've talked about
crowdfunding we've talked about the
headlines let's take a look at your
beautiful photos
today's phone talk for the day is Reese
and he took this with his Galaxy s6 edge
and he writes to us and he says hey
Ashley love the show I love the passion
you bring to the stories really gets
people excited about tech love it these
are a couple of photos taken on my s6
edge of Melbourne Australia this is the
beautiful crown casino flames along
South Bank as well as the view of the
Eureka Tower during sunrise from my home
of course you have permission to use
these photos if I'm lucky enough to make
it on the show well it's your lucky day
and if they have a lottery in Australia
you should buy a ticket you probably
only win like two dollars but you know
maybe if you're lucky enough to make it
on tomorrow daily you can win threes of
dollars from the lottery if you guys
want to submit your phone tog Rafi you
can of course send it over to tomorrow
at cnet.com send us your picture give us
permission to use it tell us a little
story about it - also you can find us
online where tomorrow daily calm if you
want to share the show with your friends
we're all over social media and of
course if you want to find me or
producer Logan personally on Twitter you
can find me at Ashley's gether and
produce the Logan at Logan LOI well
that's it for the show guys we'll be
back tomorrow with a bunch of science
fact meeting science fiction but until
then vegan humans we'll see you guys
next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
