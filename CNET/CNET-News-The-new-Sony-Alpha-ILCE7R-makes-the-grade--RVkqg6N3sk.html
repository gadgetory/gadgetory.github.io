sony alpha
ILC e7r more informally referred to as
the a7r there's tons to like about this
camera it's got a 36 megapixel
full-frame anti-aliasing filter free
sensor which delivers sharp images that
have a nicely broad dynamic range JPEGs
are quite usable up through ISO 1600 and
if you shoot RAW you can push it as high
as ISO 6400 really some of the best
image quality I've seen in this class I
mean the video looks pretty good without
the artifacts I've come to expect from
sensors like this it's also very well
designed with a sturdy magnesium alloy
body a relatively large bright contrast
to EVF and a bright tilting LCD the
controls are reasonably customizable
with all the frequently needed settings
at or near the surface
I do wish some of the buttons were more
pronounced and I dislike the feel and
location of the movie record button but
they're more than made up for by
controls like the auto manual focus
override toggle placement of the SD card
slot on the side rather than the battery
compartment USB charging and an exposure
compensation dial plus a grip
sufficiently large for shooting with
heavy a mount lenses and other amenities
I've got few complaints about the
feature set to while I wish it had a
built-in flash that's frequently
excluded from full-frame models in
addition to the electronic viewfinder
and tilting LCD it supports Wi-Fi with
NFC along with apps from Sony's
proprietary app store the remote
shooting app is still pretty basic
though so what's not to like the
performance because it uses Sony's
rather sad contrast autofocus system
it's kind of sluggish and frequently has
trouble obtaining a focus lock like most
of Sony's ilcs
it takes a relatively long time to power
up and because of the high resolution
images there's some lag before you can
make changes after shooting and the
battery life is pretty poor for a camera
in its price class I really like the
camera despite its poor performance but
it does make for some profanity filled
intervals if you want terrific photo
quality
and a great shooting experience in a
compact model and you're willing to
carry a spare battery and you don't mind
the occasional sluggishness the a7r
makes the grade I'm Laurie brunnen from
CNET and this is the sony alpha il Cee
