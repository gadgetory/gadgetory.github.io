here with John Rose John runs North
American operations the R&amp;amp;D operations
for a while way which is a giant telecom
company that I think allowed Americans
don't know much about tell me how while
we can make more inroads with US
carriers well I think the the biggest
way for us to make more inroads with US
carriers is to actually engage more with
the overall US market so you know in the
last year we've launched an enterprise
business that includes the United States
our consumer business is growing so
we're now touching more of the ecosystem
and so carriers while they care about
their core infrastructure they also care
about serving their enterprises and so
if we're selling to enterprises there's
a reason for carriers to work with us if
we're selling great consumer
technologies tablets MiFi smart phones
that give them an economic and
technology advantage again there's a
reason for them to work with us and
ultimately having a more comprehensive
view of the total ecosystem of ICT makes
us more relevant to all of the parts of
it so I think that's really the overall
strategy and do you think that there's a
lot of mistrust in Congress in
particular about Huawei do you think
just simply addressing or expanding into
those markets will actually address
those concerns and not by itself
obviously being a good corporate citizen
and selling more gear in less
controversial areas that are relevant to
more people is a good start but the most
important thing we have to do is engage
we have to basically be very very
focused on telling our story explaining
that this is a massive company that's
almost a hundred percent focused on
development of great technology and when
people understand that much of the
innovation of the industry much of the
new standards of the industry is coming
out of Huawei on a global scale when
people in the United States understand
that whether they're politicians or just
consumers it changes the tone around the
company so yeah it's great to sell more
stuff but at the same time we actually
have to tell the story and engage at all
levels which is part of the dialogue
that we're having now yeah is telling
the story of challenge for a while I see
a Chinese company it has humble roots in
many ways it is that hard to get the
company to actually express itself well
yeah I think I think you're absolutely
correct the company is very humble well
you know it's always been very customer
focused wanted to stay below the radar
didn't really focus on telling its story
loudly because when you sell the
carrier's you're
only customer that really matters is the
carrier if they know your story you're
good but as you expand in other markets
and other technology areas it is
important to kind of get out of your
shell now one of the ways we always done
that is not necessarily asking the
existing people in wall way that were
very comfortable kind of being behind
the reader to do this but by encouraging
us to expand our footprints in terms of
the talent pool people like myself or
the organization's we're building and
overseas organizations like the United
States actually tremendously helps us
have a better talent pool that speaks
the local language that understands the
local culture can engage and communicate
much more effectively and with that as a
part of this whole global company we
have a much more effective execution a
capability of being able to tell that
story as well we've been ineffective in
the past have they made mistakes
absolutely everybody makes mistakes I
think you know by by focusing inwardly
we we missed an opportunity to tell the
story over the last ten years which is a
fantastic story and especially in places
like the United States and so now we're
playing a bit of catch-up and I think
you know you're seeing us much more
visible now than you have over the last
year or two years and a lot of that is
because we were a little too quiet in
the past and now we're having to
accelerate this process so in a perfect
world if we could replay time yeah we
would have started this process a lot
earlier and we would have told the
gradual evolution of huawei story over a
much longer time fan at frame so people
were not surprised that we just showed
up as a thirty two billion dollar
company and surprised them right you
know and the reality is we are thirty
two billion dollar company and we got
there one deal and one product and one
person at a time but most people didn't
see that in the Western world and by the
time they realized we were here suddenly
we were a very large entity and there
was a bit of mystery around it and then
we had to basically begin the education
process maybe a little later than we
would have liked to John thanks again I
really appreciate it my pleasure I'm Jay
green foreseen it thanks so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
