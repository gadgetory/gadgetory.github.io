a Molly rant in one minute this week
verizon announced an end to its
grandfathered unlimited data plans also
this week it turned out Comcast's might
be prioritizing its Xfinity streaming
app over competitors like Netflix on the
open Internet while also imposing crazy
low bandwidth caps on its customers that
comes when thousands of customers paid
too much for slow internet access had
their data throttled for using too much
of it or just generally found that
internet access was a slowly
disappearing resource the days of
unlimited bandwidth are sadly over it's
a bummer but I'm a realist I understand
that bandwidth is not an unlimited
resource much like electricity or water
so I'll make a deal with the companies
that provide that bandwidth I'll pay for
bandwidth like electricity or water but
in exchange no price gouging from you no
blatant violations of net neutrality no
data caps that are so low that I ration
my app usage like it's sugar during
World War two and absolutely no turning
off my internet access if I use too much
if you play by rules that are fair to
both businesses and customers then we
will pay per use the information economy
will thrive and everyone will win if not
expect giant screaming internet hissy
fits and government regulation for years
to come read the rest of this rant over
at news.com slash Molly rants and thanks
