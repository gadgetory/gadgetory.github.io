had opted for Android maybe it would
still be on top of the smartphone world
today adventures in tech imagines the
early Nokia Android phone that never was
and asks could it have changed
everything
for 14 years from 1998 Nokia was the
biggest phone maker in the world
but it misjudged the smartphone
revolution sticking with the Symbian OS
until 2011 while rivals built up a huge
lead
Nokia sided with Windows Phone but its
market share didn't recover and in 2014
it was bought by Microsoft ending its
bid for independent smartphone supremacy
Nokia acted too late and we'll never
know what kind of wonderful devices
could have been created had it embraced
Android earlier unless we change history
by building a time machine this is
experiment 1 I'm going back to find out
what would have happened to Nokia mark
I'm you from the nightmare Android
future you're about to create don't go
back just make this episode using your
imagination instead oh ok yeah
in imagining the lost Nokia Android
phone the first thing we have to nail
down is the look
luckily industrial design was absolutely
one of Nokia's strong suits in 2011
before the launch of Windows Phone Nokia
released one of the best-looking
smartphones ever in the n9 which ran the
ill-fated Mikko OS v n9 had a gorgeous
curved screen and a range of colours
that made it stand out and as Nokia kept
the look for its earliest Windows Phone
devices it's likely that if Nokia had
embraced Android this is the look it
would have chosen and apart from design
there's another bit of expertise that
Nokia could have brought to our
hypothetical Android and masterpiece
even before 2012 41 megapixel 808
PureView nokia was making some of the
best mobile camera tech around including
a real gem in 2010 Symbian powered Nokia
n8 the n8 had a 12 megapixel sensor
which was huge for the time and coupled
with carl zeiss optics produced images
that were way ahead of the competition
it was a superior snapper that would
happily stuff inside our dream Android
phone finally the all-important Android
software by the time Nokia did dabble
with Android with the Nokia X it was
already deeply committed to Windows
Phone so it's hard to know what Nokia's
take on Android would have looked like
back in the day we do know that the
Finnish firm has always been keen on
using respect weeks and apps to give it
an edge Nokia's long-standing Maps
service and later Nokia music would have
made an appearance as would that famous
nokia ringtone which incidentally comes
from a 1902 composition for solo guitar
so horrible when you put these elements
together you realize what Nokia had
going for it not just design or tech but
goodwill too maybe it was nostalgia for
those beloved old phones but no key was
a company we wanted to succeed and that
made us decline harder to bear it's
tempting to think that Android could
have saved Nokia but I'm not sure
Google's green robots can be a cruel
companion when similar software is
available everywhere phone makers are
forced to build cheaper mobiles in order
to woo shoppers and today even giants
like Sony or Samsung are increasingly
struggling to make money
nokia was gambling that by offering
something different
it could dodge those problems the bet
didn't pay off but the decision to make
it was a logical one what would you have
done differently if you were in charge
and what are your memories of Nokia let
me know and check back next time for
another adventure in tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
