Chang I'm Ben
Fox ribbon I'm Johnny salesman is suck
sorry enough Facebook CEO Mark
Zuckerberg went on an apology tour
starting last night breaking his silence
over the Cambridge analytical data
scandal after five days of just nothing
so he acknowledged that the mistakes led
to a breach of trust with his users and
vowed to do better this sounds very
similar
John you actually had a chance to watch
the CNN interview like what did you
think when you when you watched it like
was he contrite enough well one thing
that he one word that he said in that
interview and some other interviews that
he that he did after his own post his
own post about it was he actually said
the word apology so he said that he was
sorry which goes further than what he
did when he was in full control of what
he was talking about right edited
he didn't go that far in his original
statement and when you know watching the
CNN interview in particular where you
got to see video of him he got emotional
at the end of it when when he was asked
about you know what what having children
means for how he's stewarding Facebook
which is affecting except for the fact
that he's the most powerful person in
the world right on a billionaire who's
enriched himself partly because of these
sort of advertising tools that he's
given to no Singh apology saying I'm
sorry like did I think the question
everyone's asking today's is he sorry
for what has happened or is he sorry
that he got stock tanked or stock tech
mean right what what exactly was he
apologetic for he apologized for the
fact that it happened okay
but I think that that's a really good I
think the fact that it happened two
years ago and they didn't do anything
about it is yeah the reason why a lot of
people are saying are you sorry that it
happened are you sorry that you got
caught yeah yeah yeah
so play more there's plenty more to come
rich Nia has a nice breakdown of all
this drama and and Zuck presenting this
you know this his pitch of the world for
a better Facebook
next up want to talk about a CNN
exclusive what was we were the first
report that Huawei the world's third
largest smartphone maker lose Best Buy
as a retailer and that's a big deal
because none of the US carriers sell its
phones and Best Buy was won a few places
that you could actually physically see a
huawei product okay
so how much how popular was this at Best
Buy - you know that's unclear though I
mean the big flagship phone they just
launched the the may 10 Pro I mean
literally just launched weeks ago in the
US through through these retailers Best
Buy and Amazon like throw the two big
ones I think B and H and nu a core the
other retailers but obviously Best Buy
was the big physical channel that you
didn't go and see these phones so I
don't think they were doing that well I
mean they they wha we told me sort of
their pre-orders were looking pretty
good but just the fact that they these
phones won't be in any physical stores
is a big loss for the company did you
get any impression as to why Best Buy
was doing this or was this something
that may have been coming from Huawei
it's unclear it's definitely so for my
sources said that that was Best Buy's
decision to end the relationship no
reasons were given but obviously there's
this backdrop of all this political
concerns the the heads of the FBI NSA
CIA have all said that they they feel
that you know Huawei phones present a
risk so there's that backdrop and then
we vote we've had the reports that
Verizon an 18 t we're gonna sell these
phones but ended up backing out because
of political pressure yeah all right so
lastly at CCO Josh Silverman had an
exclusive interview with Ben Fox Ruben
and Ben so lay out what exactly is going
on with that to you
so Etsy had a really tough year last
year they went through two rounds of
layoffs but Silverman seems to be doing
a pretty good job writing the ship
revenues up people seem to be going to
the site more often and they're gonna be
doing a big sale a week long sale prime
date basically their own version of
prime day to remind people to go back to
Etsy and you know they're trying to
inject that idea of like specialty
retail and special retail more into your
life more often
all right four more of these stories
check cuz I've seen it I'm not your
chain I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Johnny
salesman thanks for listening
who's gonna participate in special day
is a cult special day
now what's it called it's you wrote the
story it's just it's it's like called
via Etsy world
no yeah it's the world of Etsy sales
event world of Etsy sales event its
strongest prime day but they still need
to work on their their marketing yeah I
mean but you know it's it's the way that
he described it to me was that people
regularly go to Etsy maybe once a year
like the regular customers will come
once a year this is a good way to remind
people that you can inject special more
often into your life that's that's like
almost a direct quote from the CEO and
pretty having something like I'm sure we
bought like a little baby yeah there's
and and they're hoping that with a lot
of the Amazons and Walmarts of the world
really taking over a lot more of the
commodity goods yeah then they can
actually become much more relevant
because they sell like 50 million items
you know artsy items and handmade stuff
that you wouldn't be able to normally
find anywhere else one other interesting
element that he told me about was
handmade at Amazon yeah which Amazon
launched two years ago he said has not
had an impact on the business and this
was really being pitched as a potential
quote-unquote Etsy killer and after two
years it really hasn't had as much of an
impact I guess is some people may have
expected yeah I'll be honest like when I
read through the story and I was like
the first time I remembered and made
since the announcement yeah it's it's
Amazon gets into a lot of different
businesses and there's an immediate
reaction to that whether it's healthcare
or banking or what-have-you and
sometimes that reaction is an over
reaction especially in the stock market
and Etsy still exists they have not been
killed by Amazon by any stretch so yeah
alright so well I think that we should
have a little bit of a conversation here
to kind of drum up a little more
interest in the the Zuckerberg situation
yeah how
much do we feel is really on his
shoulders as an individual versus the
company do we think he's taking the
right action now or is it too little too
late and that's coming from me I think
ultimately this just appeared to be very
lacks interest in protecting user data
damage control
so it's just they were not whether it's
from Zuckerberg or anybody
beneath Zuckerberg everybody on down I
think is somewhat culpable or liable in
the situation that you take 50 million
user data from 50 million different
users and it just ends up in a place
that I'm sure a lot of those users
weren't really happy with so they should
do a lot more and they said that they
were gonna do a lot more to try to do a
better job protecting user data I mean I
would say if you're gonna point the
finger to someone it is definitely
Zuckerberg I mean he owns whatever he's
a super majority control over the
company he is the face of the company
it's still I think it's so bothers a lot
of people that it took five days for him
to finally come out in public and say
something he just sort of kind of
deferred any kind of response to to his
lieutenants right and even like when
asked about testifying before Congress
he kind of deferred on that too and the
sense that he said like I'd be happy to
do it if I'm the best person for it it's
like oh that's some hedging that's some
hedging especially considering well
you're the CEO of this company you found
it how are you not the best person to
address these things and if you're not
the best person why isn't this your
business like why isn't it your interest
to know these things right and you know
yes and the calls Corner both in the US
in the UK just there are tons of calls
for Zuckerberg to appear before
government hearings he hasn't but he's
never done it he's usually sent a
General Counsel or he sent other
lieutenants so it's I think a lot will
do want to hear him speak before
Congress before and actually testified
on some of the some of what's been going
on at Facebook right and what's
interesting is is that this is not at
all the first scandal that a Facebook
has faced over the past two years that's
been pretty well documented and for
whatever reason I mean John maybe you
have a better idea on this
whatever reason this one's blown up much
more considerably in in the you know the
general public and people are paying a
lot more attention to this one as
opposed to some of the other issues that
have come up I mean personally to be
frank I think that it's because of the I
think it's because of breakfast brexit
and the election of trunk trump that
people aren't are interested are pissed
off about it you know like I've even the
Cambridge analytical itself like that
vice wrote about that more than a year
ago before the election you know like
yes this topic has been written about
and the fact that developers have these
acts that have this level of access and
then that level of access was shut down
that was written about years ago I think
it's that people partly because Facebook
has been exploited the way it has to so
divisions among people we're all in a
state of hyper like sensitivity about
these things and feeling threatened I
think a lot of people are feeling under
threat and that's why they're lashing
out Morgan's Facebook for things when
they've had these problems in the past
and Facebook is now being viewed much
more as you know being presented as like
a weapon or a political tool as opposed
to like just a fun place to share a
community as a community their baby pics
you know cat pics whatever this this is
completely separate in many ways from
the Russian propaganda that was being
done during the election right and then
the other thing is it's it's it's also
just looking at how they handle the data
they just sort of the idea that they
kind of trusted these third parties with
our data to do the right thing and
responsibly delete all that stuff was I
mean come naive or stupid worst case
stupid best case naive relax
yeah just doesn't I mean that's that's
the problem with Facebook and how it how
it treats data because it as much as
they they give lip service to protecting
our privacy and making sure our data is
safe like clearly by their actions
they're showing that that's not really
the priority right let's jump into the
chat we got some good conversation going
Oscar he says the apology is useless if
Snowden's info didn't make the masses
budge why should this continuing on I
want to express sir enjoys strong words
sucks
20:18 resolution to work at Facebook
isn't going well the motive
directors should fire this use they can
yeah yeah he control the majority shares
like he obviously I just thought that
the the strong language was no I'm sorry
sure that's mean as long as he wants me
to see you yeah it's more likely than
Zuckerberg will be like you know what
I'm just pulling the plug Facebook is
dead and for him to not be the CEO
Facebook and it continued it just like
right oh my god that would be so
wonderful it's really fun to think about
and talk about cuz it's like this
alternate universe bizarro world because
it's such a part of our lives but
because it's such a part of our lives
and also it's an economic force beyond
just itself like how many people's
livelihoods depend on it would have a
lot of repercussions I mean I talked
about this on an interview like this
whole delete Facebook hashtag I mean
it's easy to get outraged and share
delete Facebook but it's a lot harder to
actually do it cuz you do I mean I rely
on Facebook for a lot for keeping tabs
on my friends and family like that's I'm
so kind of hooked into it and it would
be tough to give it up it's the only
channel that I'm in touch with certain
folks you know partly from overseas so
it wouldn't make any sense for me to
delete facebook because it would
basically be like cutting off my nose at
that's point so that's that's you me and
a lot of people though Ben it's it's
become a very helpful communication
device it's also become a poisonous
billboard well I think also it's
interesting is how there has been this
mental shift I think in everyone's minds
in Facebook and outside Facebook people
that use it whereas you know people I
mean how many times have we seen over
the years these studies being like using
social media like Facebook makes you
feel bad about yourself and we're all
like hahaha
I'm doing stuff that makes me feel bad
about myself my health is degrading
right now and I'm gonna do it it's so
funny but now that we're realizing the
repercussions not only to ourselves but
also to democracies and geopolitics and
security people are like wait a second
this isn't so hilarious honey
well you know what I mean do you think
this marks the turning point for for
folks to actually take a more sober look
at Facebook them I don't know that's I
think it's really good being addictive
right they're really good at it I don't
know we'll see yeah yeah and it fits
very much into the broader conversation
that we've been having about you know
are these tech giants do they have too
much power are they causing more
problems than good this this filter is
very directly into that whole
conversation - let's jump back into the
chat coming in from Abdul has anyone
looked into the traffic to Facebook
recently I think this recent news must
have affected it I think I saw something
yesterday where they lost like twice the
amount of Tesla in the last couple of
days there's something like that like
the stock price actual foot traffic but
their net worth is certainly taking a
hit yeah I mean stocks definitely hit
but I mean it's I don't know it's such a
I feel like folks like Zuckerberg that's
true but do we have any numbers as far
as user and actual fall off not since
the Cambridge analytical scandal because
that's only happened in the last yeah we
do know that in the last quarterly
report Zuckerberg and this is following
on so at the end of last year's
eckleburg said hey we're gonna focus on
making our platform better and we're
gonna spend millions of dollars on it
and it means we might not be making as
much money in the short term to focus on
what they call time well-spent like
having less of this like no value
engagement that keeps you on Facebook
for a long time but doesn't mean that
you're happy while you're doing it so
with this focus on time well-spent in
the last quarter the most recent period
Zuckerberg said that people aren't
spending as much time on Facebook
because of that initiative I'd imagine
that all this discussion and noise about
how people are disappointed in Facebook
and how they don't get value out of it I
imagine that's only exacerbating yeah
trend yeah that is a trend sound right
or people are going on it yeah because
it sometimes that does happen where
come so top-of-mind that people just end
up going on Facebook more often yeah
where they go on Facebook or the only
way that you can see Zuckerberg responds
after five days a log into Facebook too
yeah well luckily they report their
monthly active users and daily active
users on a quarterly basis so we will be
able to continue to track that that's
not something that's like hidden or
anything like that so we'll get an
impression but I think you guys would
agree that you know the delete Facebook
movement if it is a movement is probably
only going to have a short-term impact
that's at least yeah I mean I think why
delete substitute drivers are pretty
much the same there isn't an alternative
Facebook right to the say that exactly
Joan but to at some effect there are
lots of alternative and we did talk
about there are a lot of them yesterday
and that's the thing it's hard to to
take it seriously when it's like but I
need Facebook but it really has
innovated the way a lot of us do
communicate long distance with group and
for that I still sing its praises but it
has been infiltrated so it is may be
time to start looking into some of the
alternatives one of the popular terms
let's take a few more in the chat we got
a little bit of time left coming in from
Matthew dacher yes it's the power that
these companies have have companies
always had this kind of power over our
lives or has this only happened in the
past decade I'm thinking that might be a
bit of a sarcastic statement I don't
think that it's only a new concept in
the past decade how has mass
communication innovations been impacted
by it it's gone from so the internet has
caused this Titanic shift between like a
gatekeeper model where there are only
three broadcast stations there were like
two newspapers in every city and there
wasn't this like free flow of
communication information that we have
now with the internet but because we
have such concentration in very few
companies like Google and Facebook being
you know representing the
last majority of advertising money on
the internet we have a concentration of
power without the same sort of
regulation that those gatekeepers had in
the past the gatekeepers in the past
they had the FTC over seeing them with
much more scrutiny than the FTC would
oversee a reddit or Facebook or and it
is because of that ad model like
Facebook and Google these companies are
designed to extract as much data from
you as possible so in that respect I
don't think any company no company knows
as much about you as a Google or
Facebook companies in the past surely
didn't have that kind of control over
you they didn't they didn't know your
preferences they didn't know the fact
that you had you liked I don't know
Thomas Trang cartoons or something
because you tell them yeah Facebook has
developed this program where you are in
indicted to want to volunteer more
information because you get somewhat
rewarded for it you get more relevant
things passed towards you and then you
find common ground with new people right
or you take part in like fun little
quizzes yeah exactly that end up being
used to target you for political ads so
yeah geez what a world we've built we
got a little bit of time for a few more
Ryan Williams is pointing out the
obvious one is just signing up for
things terms and agreements being more
cognizant of what you were engaged yeah
wouldn't that be a beautiful world that
any would all live in not to say you're
not 110 percent right with that but
let's get real how many people actually
do that yeah we got to think about other
we don't have to think people really
should just be more responsible more
accountable oh really how many people
read those terms they're also long long
before we leave and that's yeah exactly
it's not like companies make it easy for
you to know what you're giving up and
they also don't make it easy for you to
control that if you have the ambition to
do you know what I mean like there's no
easy way to find even on Facebook like
it's not an easy way to turn these
things off you have to know that's to be
a scandal for there to be stories to
tell you where to look
yeah and for the company like oh maybe
we should make it easy
looking for I mean I finally went and
turned off a budget see I didn't realize
I mean it's not a super hard process to
do it but like it definitely takes extra
steps you have to know what to look for
and like yet so we're for a scandal like
this we were just sort of like right
unwittingly just kept going with these
apps that have hooks into all of our
data mm-hmm
- points out that hang on no I got miss
I misspoke for a second let's take
another one from Ryan Williams if you
delete Facebook does that mean deleting
your Google account Twitter etc I don't
know if that's necessarily the case but
what happens when Facebook goes away who
becomes the next crowned most popular
most traffic area that's going to
inevitably be infiltrated and and
poisoned and damaged as well I don't how
do we future this no no the total
hypothetical hype set but if it wasn't
to go away tomorrow would Twitter rise
up
how would Twitter get broken how do we
avoid this going forward no I took good
question well I think in order for
Facebook to go through this hyper
hypothetical word it goes away like
something else would have to take its
place something new like I don't think
Instagram necessarily replaces what
Facebook is neither just Twitter they
all are social networks but they all do
things a little bit differently so offer
different kinds of experiences so I feel
like there needs to be like a better
mousetrap that beats out Facebook just
like Facebook be it out MySpace and
Friendster
and I'm missing one of those stir and
yeah like they all there was that the
cycle were these social knows and then
they they fell aim to an extent Facebook
brought in the direct peer-to-peer
messaging I think that kind of because
aim certain joy points out aim really
was the first big step like beyond like
the networking people together yeah yeah
or I seek you or I see Cuba aim become a
household name
yeah that's true in a larger scale than
gneissic you did yeah when name finally
ended people were kind of sad yeah that
was a new program that we'd never seen
anything like yeah a direct messenger
system but - did point out that Facebook
is popular because it's a
of least resistance yeah it became the
path of least resistance for hackers for
spammers for this then the other thing
said yeah and they did that very much in
good and bad people yeah absolutely I
mean like there's a good reason why 2
billion people have Facebook accounts
another expansion on the thought is as
far as information spills go Facebook is
small change compared to the likes of
Yahoo and Equifax do we really think
that's true well I think that in terms
of the scale that we know of like right
now we know of 50 million people but you
know uh Coburg said they're going to be
looking into thousands of apps that had
the same opportunities that Cambridge
analytical and that Cambridge researcher
yeah they're I'm sure there are other
apps out there just sort of sitting in
your account that have hooks that
connect to a difference and granted
Facebook did shut off some of this
access but there's still a lot of data
flowing around from those older apps
from what two or three years ago mm-hmm
we only have a couple minutes left so
let's ghost go uh quick through a couple
of these syringe I had another good
concept as he always does how about
completely changed the way facebook
makes money I'm thinking low key crypto
minor on the website not the ones that
screw up the CPU will that be fairer
than targeted ads and if Facebook dares
to make crypto mining step it might
legitimize that form of currency he's
got very good points here yeah I ever
had blocks crypto currency ads yet it
won't block political propaganda well
it's working on the political stuff and
it makes a lot of money on political ads
so I think the intention is to improve
the political ads as opposed to just
barring them completely Facebook is part
of the duopoly with Google we're like
that's how they make their money they
dominate digital advertising so I don't
see that changing at all that's how the
entire business model is set up it's not
on selling oculus headset I think it's a
nice yeah it's a nice thought about
using cryptocurrency but yeah that's and
Zuckerberg said yesterday if there would
be he addressed the idea of like would
there be a subscription Facebook because
the
advertising is the fuel that gives bad
actors a reason to be there like if you
can make well except for Russian
interference because then your writer
and game isn't making money it's
disrupting geopolitical order but most
of the badass roles of the highest order
are there just to make money and so
that's the fuel that drives all this
stuff and so the question is if you take
away that fuel that will suffocate some
of the bad actors but he made the point
that it's important for Facebook to be
not necessarily in first world countries
but in places where internet access
isn't as easy to get then not having
that that barrier to entry that it being
a model that is extreme extremely cheap
or free for people as important that
like would the better mousetrap be
though like the anti Facebook or the
next thing after Facebook could it be a
subscription-based model obviously it
would hit a different demographic as you
suggested but that could be something
interesting that somebody else might
want to look like the dilemma with that
is you know these sites all these these
companies all have one goal early on is
for like massive ramp up of the users
exactly it's all about scale and when
you when you put in a subscription model
in there you automatically just hurting
yourself in terms of potential growth
there right like you can't get to that
scale for that height and for that and
that's for those startup money when
you've got the subscription model so I
mean yeah it's theoretically Facebook
could do it now that they have the scale
but I don't know how many people would
stick around if they had to pay whatever
final would that look like you know
would that be in completely separate
Facebook or were you getting Facebook
pro yeah
Facebook awesome Facebook Plus yeah okay
we're coming down to the end here let's
switch gears real quick and talk about
Huawei Lohengrin I think that's how I
pronounce that name apologies if I screw
that up my question should the USA at
large ban Huawei phones I mean didn't
they already with the routers they so
they do have a ban on telecommunications
equipment companies are basically
forbidden from
from working with huawei in terms of
their their back-end equipment the
phones I mean they have almost
essentially have done it in you know
with their comments they haven't there's
no official ban but if you know the NSA
CIA and FBI all say like you probably
shouldn't be behind these phones that's
a real issue right so yes I think that
while we already struggled with their
presence in the US and losing Best Buy
is you know it's bad but I mean they
were already kind of in a bad situation
in a difficult position yeah for anybody
out there that's watching this that has
a huawei phone should they be concerned
like should they feel like they have
spyware on their phones or something
like that I mean that's always been the
conspiracy theory out there I don't know
I can't I can't say with a hundred
percent certainty that they're
completely safe I know they're well
reviewed I know our our our colleagues
on the reviews team
I have generally given these phones
pretty good reviews and they're known
brand yes you know around the world but
there's always that lingering we don't
know and that's that's cognition for the
u.s. that's big enough to have stopped
them from coming in here in in a
meaningful way I think that is a fine
place to end for a week we spend a lot
of time talking about Facebook and I
think we're gonna spend a whole lot more
time look but that is it for us
Thursday's are Friday and we'll have to
wrap it up here and we'll see you again
next week Roger you want to take us out
yeah if you like anything you saw or
heard here check us out on CNET our
podcast is also available on iTunes
