robot vacuums navigator room we haven't
talked a lot about how to create custom
cleaning spaces for your robot vacuum
I'm Meghan Willerton frissina and this
is a how-to so I'm here with the neato
bought back 85 the iRobot Roomba 880 and
the LG home bot square and each of these
robot vacuum brands have different names
for the same thing Rito uses these
magnetic strips they call boundary
markers this is probably the most simple
and straightforward method so basically
you just put it down and it won't pass
that threshold when it comes in contact
with that magnetic barrier it'll turn
around and go back the other way so the
advantage of the boundary marker is that
it's really simple there's no batteries
no setup you just plop it down and it
does its thing the disadvantage is that
it's kind of an eyesore
iRobot uses these virtual walls it's a
bit more advanced than nito's boundary
marker it requires two C batteries but
it works pretty much the same way set
the distance and it works as an
invisible wall that the robot vacuum
won't cross I like that you can set the
distance on this but I don't like that
it requires two C batteries LG's
solution is a bit more quirky it doesn't
have a physical boundary marker or a
virtual wall barrier but it does have a
feature called MySpace's
on the remote control the way that my
space works is you can drive the robot
vacuum around using these arrow keys and
create a perimeter of your own within
any room the advantage is that you can
use this via remote and you don't have
any extra accessory the disadvantage is
that it's kind of a novelty it might
wear off pretty quickly so while these
technologies are all different each one
offers a solution for sectioning off
your house thanks for watching I'm Megan
