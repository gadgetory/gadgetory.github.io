I'm Brian Punk and this is the price
fight between the two Korean kings of
Android phones it's a prize fight
watch out between the LG g3 and the
Samsung Galaxy s5 our judges for this
fight are senior editor Jessica the
people's doll court associate editor
Lynn ooh la la la and you know who
really a ding dong will take all three
judges scores and average them out to
nearest tenth each round the final prize
fight score will be an average of all
rounds using the same system let's get
it started
round 1 is design the LG g3 may not be
metal but this is as minimalist as
you're going to get with a brushed
aluminum look it's 5.5 inch quad HD
screen is begging you to make out with
it's insane 538 pixels per inch and the
smartest thing about this phone no power
buttons on the side or the face of the
phone your index finger naturally falls
into place here on the backside for the
power volume and camera shutter control
now I normally complain about big screen
phones but this is a well-thought-out
one and one of the most unique designs
we've seen for phone this size now the
galaxy s5 looks pretty similar to the s4
sporting a 5.1 inch screen with a 432
pixel per inch density you won't really
be able to tell on their own but
side-by-side LG's g3 screen has a
slightly sharper look now the s5 still
has a plastic feel with its dimpled
backside and it's lighter in weight but
Samsung played it safe instead of
pushing for a fresher look the g3
impressed us with a 5 and the galaxy s5
gets a 4 next round is user interface
both phones run Android 4.4 and bring
their own unique feel to it
LG brings their user interface with a
snappy flat design approach that's
arguably the cleanest third-party
Android skin out right now you'll have
to jump into the settings to see all of
your options and brings the same Android
customization for apps widgets and home
screens that you've come to expect and
this really cool adjustable keyboard now
Samsung's TouchWiz interface has made an
effort to clean things up a whole lot
but a phone that can almost do
everything still has trouble keeping
things simple UI is super customizable
jumping into a settings list about twice
as long as not necessarily a bad thing
there's just so much to do that most
people will only scratch the surface
this one typically comes down to
personal preference but our judges give
the LG g3 a 4.7 and Samsung gets a 4 so
after averaging two rounds LG leads big
4.9 2 for next round his features both
bones offer 16 to 32 gigs of storage
removable batteries and a micro SD card
slot that supports up to 128 gigs of
additional space LG brings a quad-core
2.5 gigahertz Snapdragon processor and
really one of the best screens on the
market today that can't be understated
double tapping to turn your screen on
and off is one of the best features on
the phone that adds up over time it also
brings LG health for tracking your steps
taken and calories burned we talked
about its killer rear controls and we'll
get into it's laser guided camera yes
lasers
now Samsung's Galaxy s5 also brings a
quad-core 2.5 gigahertz processor but
stands alone as the most feature packed
phone on planet earth the s5 can track
your steps but it also brings
non-essential features like the heart
rate monitor it's the first ever on a
phone but it works really well and it's
s health app is legit there's a
fingerprint scanner for security that
still needs some more multi window mode
is a Samsung classic and they were the
first to bring motion gestures long
before LG added their own plus the s5
has a super fast charging mode if you
use their charger cable and do we
mention that it's
water-resistant a quick drop in the sink
is no longer deadly now this one's no
contest the s5 gets a perfect 5 and the
g3 gets a 4.7 next round is web browsing
and multimedia web browsing on both of
these displays is a treat with our large
screens on both screens handle gaming
Google Play apps and HD quality movies
just fine but let's be honest
bigger is better when you're watching
media LG brings our 13 megapixel camera
that shoots 4k video with optical image
stabilization and a laser-guided
autofocus that allows it to lock onto
subjects and take a picture quickly
using lasers is trimmed down his picture
modes but you can click on areas of a
picture to bring them into focus after
the pictures have been taken now their
selfie cam allows you to control it by
opening your hand and then closing it to
start an automatic countdown now the s5
brings a 16 megapixel camera that also
shoots 4k video and brings plenty of
filters and features galore that don't
necessarily make it the simplest
interface but when you compare these two
cameras side-by-side the g3 takes good
low-light shots and has a better flash
while the s5 takes pictures that have an
extra level of vibrancy and richer
looking overall images bolder screen or
better pictures you might disagree but
we're giving the edge to Samsung based
on its camera performance since our
phones have really become our primary
cameras the s5 takes this round with the
5 and the g3 gets a 4.7 so after
averaging 4 rounds the s5 has closed the
gap and the final round that decides it
all
both phones are snappy performers but in
the 3dmark unlimited test that tests
graphics performance the galaxy s5 came
out on top
quite definitively now when it came down
to seeing its battery video drain test
the LG g3 lasted 11 hours and 24 minutes
compared to the galaxy s5 that squeezed
out 15 hours and 18 minutes of juice and
that's a huge difference the s5 gets a
perfect 5 one more time and the LG g3
gets a 4.3 so let's average out all 5
rounds and LG took a strong lead early
then Samsung clawed its way back in the
final three rounds but it just wasn't
enough and the LG g3 takes this
slobberknocker
four point seven to four point six and
is your prize prize with these phones
are without a doubt to the best Android
has to offer and the battle for
prizefight supremacy rages on i'm brian
tongues thanks for watching I will catch
you guys next time for another prize
fight well
