there are at least six different reports
of the iPhone 8 plus splitting along it
seems because batteries are swelling in
size apple says it is looking into
reports which are coming from at least
five countries in the past two weeks
since the phones first went on sale
September 22nd social media postings
show what appear to be separate
incidents of customers with expanding
batteries in Japan and Taiwan and The
Guardian reported on additional
incidents in Greece Canada and China
this could be a serious issue all
batteries do expand and contract a tiny
bit with normal use but a phone is
supposed to be built to account for that
now these photos make it appear that the
batteries are expanding too much and
when a lithium-ion battery swells to
this degree
it could be unstable and it should not
be used or recharged in fact it could
potentially cause a fire although there
have been no reports of fire yet it is
too early to tell
if this is going to be a widespread
problem to the level we saw with
Samsung's note 7 battery problems with
that recalled phone more than a hundred
incidents were eventually reported Apple
has not released sales numbers for the
iPhone 8 and 8 plus so it's unknown how
many these phones are out there I'm
