at sony's new york event concurrent with
Aoife and i'm standing with phil
molyneux who's the president and CEO of
sony electronics how you doing today
though I'm doing very well thank you
wonderful so Phil you guys introduced a
bunch of new products today can you give
me a quick rundown of the most exciting
product that you really introduced today
so we'll start with the 4k TVs we've
introduced two new 4k Ultra
high-definition TVs from Sony the hx850
a a 55 inch version a 65 inch version
and a 55 inch version we're starting
that pricing at 3,500 US dollars so
we're really excited about that and for
those of you that don't know about 4k
ultra high-definition it's four times
the resolution of Full HD now you guys
are really aggressive with the 4k price
cuts it looks like you're the first to
reach that thirty five hundred dollar
price point among the mainstream TV
manufacturers out there can give me an
idea of why you're being so aggressive
with those price points while you're
pushing for K so quickly to such
relatively low prices and we want more
consumers to enjoy the experience of
Sony 4k Ultra High Definition we have
unique technology in there in terms of
how we upscale any input in addition to
that we've just announced today are four
que native feature film download service
along with TV episodes etc I mean it is
great the Sony is the kind of the only
guys doing the 4k content thing with
this video distribution service the TV
hovers is relatively expensive how do
you sell 4k to a consumer Hussein
himself you know what I'm really happy
with my 1080p TV it's about you know a
thousand dollars or $1,500 for the same
size how do you convince the average
consumer that 4k is worth to step up
especially when there's very little
content despite your new service yep so
very little content may be on the native
4k content side but we've got 70 movie
titled feature films etc will have a
hundred feature films and TV episodes by
the end of the year so that's a native
site on the other side the upscaling
capability of our TVs and the color
reproduction it's just quite
unbelievable now with 4k it does require
are you know a relatively close seeding
distance to really see the benefits at
least that's what I understand I I mean
the TVs are really large again you can
really see this benefit for 4k how do
you address that issue the fact that
again 1080p looks really good on most
people's TVs and to see the difference
in the benefit of 4k don't you have to
sit relatively close or experience
content that is you know again a lot
better than you would on a normal 1080p
TV so let me put it a different way just
so that we can frame this correctly and
if we went back ten years ago you may
have had for instance a 24 inch TV in
your room and you sat maybe about six to
eight feet away and then you decided to
upgrade and then you brought a let's say
there's a 40 inch flat panel and you put
that on the war but you didn't move your
Sethi you stay is stayed where it is
because you wanted to enjoy that more
immersive experience right so now you
can buy a 4k Ultra High Definition in 65
inch of 55 inch and put it on the wall
and not new no need to move your your
city or your sofa HSA in America because
now your field of view is full of that
picture and if you go to the theater
today to see a movie in the theater have
a look the screen now is your complete
field of vision and even the back seat
you've filled your vision so that's the
best experience that you can get that's
an interesting take because you're
talking about recreating the theater
experience in the home I've heard
something called the Laffer distance
which refers the fact that most people
still even with today's HD TVs sit
around nine feet away from their
television at that distance is that
something you can appreciate with 4k or
do you actually at Sony have some some
information where you've actually seen
that distance and decrease at in the
home because I think that'd be
interesting um we have we have a
measured people in their home to that
extent we know that you know if you fill
your field of vision when you're
watching 4k content on the sony TV
that's the best experience you can get
however regardless whether you've moved
your your sofa back another two foot
you've still got eight million pixels on
that screen as opposed to two million
pixels I have another question about
your video distribution service the
little device that comes with it it's
it's a little video player
load player people can actually download
these movies and watch them and pay you
know specific prices for each movie my
question is does that work with devices
other than sony products right now no
it's Sony only at this stage is there a
reason for that fell well you know
they're there are many reasons but one
of the key reasons is you know the drm
related issues and the importance of
making sure that content is safe is that
something in the future that you'd want
to do at Sony is to maybe expand this to
work with other manufacturers I know
you're talking about expanding 4k
letting everybody watch it if you're the
owner and the only people distributing
this video service wouldn't it be the
kind of thing that you would want to
distribute and make you know that device
applicable to a lot of other TVs out
there the same is with HD content you
know we have Sony Pictures is part of
our company of course they want to
expand distribution and of course we
should expand distribution in due course
but the industry needs to tackle a few
other points first of all but we'll get
there we'll get that that's good to hear
talking about the industry one of the
surprises for me today at least was the
the announcement of the curved led-based
e via the one behind us right here can
you tell me a little bit about that
product and aesthetically why Sony went
with a curved LCD LED as opposed to the
curved OLED that we've seen some other
manufacturers we think this is perhaps
not mainstream consumer but if you want
this theatrical type effect and this
curved it kind of wraps around you and
takes you deeper into the picture we
thought this is a good style starting
point OLED technology we've been
shipping OLED technology in terms of
screens on the professional side of our
business for two years so we know how to
do it yeah but it takes time to get it
to a point where it's commercially
viable to bring it to consumers I mean
you one of the most exciting products at
this year's CES was the 4k OLED product
that you showed which I understand is a
joint development are we going to be
seeing that product next year yeah in
due course you'll be seeing it yeah
we're working on that I love it well
thank you very much Phil my pleasure
thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
