in front of the Samsung KN 55s 9 this is
the company's first use OLED technology
that allows the TV to achieve superior
picture quality compared to current
plasma and LED TVs unlike those standard
TVs this one has a curve and that's one
thing you can only get with oled the
curve is supposed to enable a little bit
more immersive viewing experience but we
really don't know how much it really ill
effect I think it's kind of just there
to look cool the really cool thing is
the contrast ratio with this TV that
means that it produces darker blacks and
brighter brights a combination that can
really make the image pop the TV also
has Samsung's multi-view technology
which is a iteration of 3d you put on
these glasses that are a lot like 3d
glasses instead of a 3d image you can
see two separate to damages a little
switch on the glass lets you switch back
and forth between the two samsung is
calling it a marriage saver technology
of course all those bells and whistles
are secondary the fact that this TV is
OLED it's the first Samsung's produced
there's also an LG OLED that's coming
out around the same time it's 15,000
also that we could expect those prices
to fall in the foreseeable future
another aspect of the TV you can see
behind me is that it's got this sort of
frame around it the frame is actually a
little bit more curved in the television
itself so it accentuates that curb you
can take the frame off but you cannot
mount this television on the wall
otherwise the km 55 s nice is a standard
high-end Samsung TV that includes it's
smart TV suite with a built-in camera
and all the other bells and whistles of
course for nine thousand dollars the
main thing you're paying for is the OLED
technology and the bragging rights of
being among the first to own it that's a
quick look at Samsung's km 55s 9c I'm
