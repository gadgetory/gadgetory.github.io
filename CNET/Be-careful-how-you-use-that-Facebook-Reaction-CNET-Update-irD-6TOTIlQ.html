Wow to your friends I'm Bridget Carey
this is your scene that update hey folks
before we begin just want to thank my
colleagues Aya's and Jeff for covering
for me while I was out sick for a few
days which I'm sure you can tell by my
new and improved raspy voice but talking
in words aren't necessary anymore right
we have emoji to communicate all of our
feelings well the day has finally come
for all of us the facebook like button
is now joined by five additional
reaction choices we do not have a thumbs
down disliked option but Facebook has
now rolled out a heart to love a post
along with other emoji heads named haha
Wow
sad and angry the new reactions are
available to everyone around the world
on the app just long press on the like
and you'll see the other choices pop up
on your desktop hover your mouse over
the like to choose your reaction but
before you go a motion crazy please be
thoughtful and how you use these guys if
you're too quick you may accidentally
send a haha - a sad post and please
don't wow Oh Skeeter
in fact just write a comment to properly
express your feelings like a human being
because being human is more important
than ever right now why the machines are
getting better at walking Boston
Dynamics now run by alphabet has created
a new generation of the Atlas robot and
a video released on YouTube shows the
humanoid robot walking out of an office
then taking a stroll in the snowy woods
notice how it won't fall down even when
the snow is slippery or uneven it also
picks up ten pound boxes and puts them
on shelves but here's the most
bothersome part the researcher uses a
hockey stick to mess with Atlas to show
how it will fall when pushed and then
the guy starts knocking the boxes around
why you got to be such a human bully
don't you know this gives them reason to
hate us and begin the uprising the
researcher even pushes that was from
behind and the robot which weighs 180
pounds and is five foot nine inches tall
is able to push itself back upright play
folks don't agitate your robots or they
can just walk out on you and then roam
the forest seeking vengeance so while
the company that owns Google continues
to play God they also hired the voice of
God to give GPS directions actor Morgan
Freeman is now available to give you GPS
turn by turn voice directions on
Google's free traffic app Waze it's part
of a promotion for Freeman's new movie
London has fallen an elite team has been
assembled to guide your mission let's
get started you've heard him narrate
films and documentaries and commercials
and now he can narrate your epic journey
to find the nearest gas station that's
it for this tech news update and there's
always more at cnet.com from our studios
