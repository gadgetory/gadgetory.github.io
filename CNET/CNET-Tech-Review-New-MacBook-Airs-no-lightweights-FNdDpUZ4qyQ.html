lion arrives while Apple eats its young
with the new MacBook Airs will also show
you how to upgrade the RAM on your imac
Spotify helps you find the music your
friends are listening to oh joy and
possibly the best real world five dot
one system we've ever tested can make it
all sound great that's all coming up
right now
hello folks I'm Brian Cooley and welcome
to the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech as well as offer our own
special wisdom in the form of the bottom
line let's start off with the good new
this week on the laptop front was a pair
of updates to apple's macbook air line
up these ultra lights already had pretty
darn impressive specs but as our dan
ackerman shows us there's always room
for a little improvement i'm dan
ackerman and we are here taking a very
first look at the latest version of
apple's 13-inch macbook air now
physically from the outside you open up
the box this looks a heck of a lot like
the previous macbook air and in fact
physically it's pretty much the same box
except this guy has a backlit keyboard
something that was in the original air
mission from the second generation now
back here again and the other big
changes i'm going to show you right here
on the side this display port jack right
here in the back is now a thunderbolt
compatible jack so that you can hook up
a display to it but you can also hook up
thunderbolt peripherals if you happen to
run across any there were a couple of
hard drives and Apple is going to have a
really nice-looking big laptop oriented
monitor later on in the summer that you
can actually connect this directly to
and that's going to have an ethernet
port and a firewire and some other
Jack's that through that single
Thunderbolt connection you can all
access from your laptop under the hood
the biggest change with this latest
generation of macbook air systems is the
move from Intel's Core 2 Duo CPUs to the
latest second generation core i series
that's a two-generation leap for the
processor you've got core i5 in the 11
inch and the 13 inch macbooks and in
both of those you can actually upgrade
to the faster core i7 processors these
are all the low voltage versions and
you've got to start with the more
expensive upgraded base models for both
of those in order to get that core i7
processor
it is just start out with a 128 gig
solid-state drive in the 13 inch version
and 4 gigs of ram you can upgrade that
to a 256 gig solid-state drive which
should be big enough for just about
everybody once you start doing that your
macbook air can get a little bit
expensive we've still got the same 16 x
10 display they haven't moved to 16 by 9
yet on the 13 inch models the big
gigantic multitrack touchpad is the same
they have however added for the OS 10
lion operating system upgrade that comes
with this a bunch of new gestures that
took us a little while to get used to
but a bunch of them are actually pretty
useful and you're going to have to train
yourself to use those instead of some of
the previous versions of these
multi-touch gestures so following the
traditional Apple upgrade cycle what
they've done is they've kept the price
of the same 12 99 and 1599 for the two
different base models of the 13-inch
macbook air while upgrading the
components inside most notably of course
that core i5 processor and the
Thunderbolt port i'm dan ackerman and
that is Apple's new 13-inch MacBook Air
now with the introduction of the new
MacBook Airs the basic 13-inch MacBook
the one that cost 999 quietly vanished
so these new heirs are now Apple's
entry-level portable computers if you're
not convinced check out Scott's teens
further impressions of the 11 inch model
right now at cnet TV com perhaps more
important than the new hardware is the
fact that OS 10 lion was released into
the wild on Wednesday and our jason
parker didn't waste any time before
going after it
hello everyone Apple is finally unleash
the lion that's Mac os10 line and it's
available today at the mac app store but
is it worth the upgrade for everyone i'm
jason parker from cnet and this is a
first look at Apple's newest operating
system Mac OS 10 line we had the chance
to sit down and check out many of the
new features and we're impressed with
what we've seen so far to get started
multi-touch gestures figure prominently
in Mac OS 10 lion letting you swipe
pinch and tap your way through many of
the operating systems newest features
for example a three-finger swipe upwards
brings up the new mission control where
you can see everything that's currently
running along with associated windows
that have the running apps icon at the
bottom simply click on any window to
bring it to the front as another example
in Safari you'll now be able to go back
or forward through your history on a
browser tab with a two-finger swipe all
the multi-touch gestures feel very
natural and apple says it's because
they've added new more responsive
animations notice how you can swipe the
Safari page exactly as much or as little
as you want Mac os10 lion now offers
full screen apps a feature many windows
users have seen as a major
disappointment in the mac OS over the
years now you can click on the diagonal
arrows icon in the upper right corner of
a window to quickly switch to full
screen once in full screen you're three
finger horizontal swipe switches between
full screen apps and desktops speaking
of desktops the spaces feature has been
elegantly worked into Mission Control as
well if you want to create a second
desktop just click and drag a window or
set of windows to the icon at the upper
right now with a three finger horizontal
swipe you'll be able to switch between
open apps and newly created desktops oh
and also new to lion one further
three-finger swipe to the right now gets
you to the widget dashboard it's no
secret that iOS devices have been a huge
success for Apple and along with touch
screen features some iOS interface
elements snuck into line as well
launchpad gives you another option for
quickly showing all your apps and it
looks just like the way apps are laid
out in the iOS bring up launchpad by
hitting the icon in the dock or by doing
a three finger and thumb pinch motion
just like the iphone you can click and
hold a nap too
to jiggle mode then either move apps
around or create folders by dropping a
nap on another apps icon you still have
the option to search for apps in the
finder and still can create an
application folder in the dock but if
you like that iOS look launch pad is the
way to go one of the biggest upgrades
for Lion is one of the most important
apps of all mail Apple's email app now
the layout closely resembles the email
experience on the iPad with your message
list on the left and message content on
the right the new mail app now has a
favorites bar for one click access to
your most used folders you can still do
it the old way if you want however by
hitting the show button in the upper
left to bring up the standard folder
structure also just like iOS devices
you'll now be able to view message
threads as conversations a number next
to the message shows how many messages
have been sent in a conversation once
clicked each conversation shows separate
boxes for each reply that's both
nice-looking and makes it less confusing
to quickly read through searching email
got a huge upgrade as well now when you
type in a name for example mail offers
suggestions based on what's in your
inbox but even better they created
search tokens when you click a
suggestion it creates a token this way
you can refine your search by first
creating a token of the name then out a
month say then a subject and get only
the mail that came from that person in
that month and with that subject this
will make searching for that mystery
email much easier than before apple also
made it easier to share files with those
nearby where once you need it to email
or send a file by a chat client you'll
now be able to use airdrop simply choose
airdrop from the finder and you'll be
able to see nearby users where you can
drag and drop a file to their avatar we
have one word for this finally even
though the mac app store was introduced
as an update and Snow Leopard it's
important to talk about here because
it's the only place you can buy and
download line for 2999 unfortunately
this means that if you skipped over snow
leopard you'll still have to buy it for
twenty nine dollars in order to get the
Mac App Store to download lion we can
see why Apple did it this way but
frankly it doesn't seem fair to those
who chose not to x snow leopard overall
Mac os10 lion is a solid upgrade that
comes with more
the 250 new features we can't list them
all here but be sure to check out our
full review at download com this is
jason parker for cnet thanks for
watching our first look at mac OS see
you next time so if you're all set to
take on the upgrade make sure to check
out our how to section at cnet com to
find out how to prep your current mac
for a lion install you'll notice that
Apple's suggest at least 2 gigabytes of
RAM but as we all know the more the
better in that category if you're
sitting there staring at your imac
though wondering where does the RAM even
go David Garneau has you covered I'm
David carling from cnet I'm going to
show you how to upgrade the RAM on your
iMac which will definitely speed up your
machine it's really pretty simple and we
recommend upgrading your RAM yourself
because you can save a good bit of money
by not ordering extra ram from Apple
when you initially purchase your imac
the first thing to do is figure out just
what I Mac you have and check on apples
website to figure out which model you
have and what kind of ram it takes and
how much memory you can put into your
machine the last couple of years the
base configuration of the imac has come
with four gigabytes of ram in 22
gigabyte memory modules which takes up
two of the four memory slots in the imac
to get to the memory compartment you lay
your imac on a soft surface with the
screen facing down then all you have to
do is take a phillips screwdriver and
unscrew the three screws for the plate
that covers the compartment on the
bottom of the imac and you'll be able to
find where your memory is hiding as you
can see here we have two slots open for
additional memory this imac which is a
2011 model accepts up to 16 gigabytes of
ram add to the 2010 models what a lot of
people do is keep the existing two
gigabyte modules in place then add an
additional 24 gigabyte models bringing
the total to 12 gigabytes alas the
modules only go up to 4 gigabytes so if
you want to get to the full 16 gigabytes
you have to replace your current 2
gigabyte modules with 4 gigabyte modules
that's probably not worth it for a lot
of people but
we said you do save a lot of money by
installing it yourself for instance to
add an additional 8 gigabytes of RAM
Apple would charge you 200 bucks well 2
4 gigabyte modules of this Kingston
memory Kingston provided for this demo
we're running around seventy dollars
ridiculously apple charges six hundred
dollars for a full 16 gigabyte upgrade
when you can do the same install
yourself for less than a third of the
cost to get the modules installed you
just slide them into the respective
compartments wait until you feel a
little click that tells you it's snapped
in place to get an existing module out
you gently pull up on the ribbon and
slide the new module in it's really all
there is to it once you've got your
memory installed and put the plate back
on and should be good to go with the
machine that feels noticeably zippier
I'm David Connelly and thanks for
watching the scene at how to video huh
from the looks of things the RAM modules
appear to be just about the only user
serviceable part on a whole iMac but
anyhow to that requires only a
screwdriver and basic sobriety works for
me okay before this turns into one long
version of Apple bite let's turn to our
promised first look at the new Spotify
music service Donald bill has a look at
about the most awaited arrival from that
side of the Atlantic since the Beatles
hey I'm Donald Bell and today we're
taking a long-awaited first look at
spotify a free streaming music
application for mac and pc here's what
all the fuss is about after installing
the software spotify pops up and shows
you a hybrid of your computer's music
collection and an online database full
of songs and albums that you can stream
at no cost it's an all-you-can-eat
buffet of unlimited music streams both
the majors and the Indies living right
alongside your personal music collection
so whether it's the rolling stones or
some horrible new kesha song you can
just type it in and you're immediately
listening to full songs and albums you
can keep a record of your favorite
tracks by giving them a star you can
also create playlists of your favorite
tracks even if they're a mix of mp3s and
songs from Spotify now what makes
Spotify so viral is that it pulls in any
friends from Facebook who are also using
Spotify
from here you can check out what they're
listening to as well as their favorite
tracks and playlists on your end you can
manage what songs and playlists can be
seen by others now if you find some
great tracking you want to shout it out
to the world you can also hit the share
button and blast it out to all of your
friends on Facebook Twitter or messenger
that link will take them to the full
song stream if they already have Spotify
or it will prompt them to download the
software you get enough people sharing
and you can see how spotify gets popular
very quickly so what's the catch well
ultimately spotify wants to get you on a
paid account free users are granted six
months of unlimited access to the entire
spotify catalog but after that spotify
will lay down some restrictions on how
much you can stream free users will also
have to put up some audio ads between
tracks fortunately spotify isn't asking
much from its paid subscribers for five
dollars a month you're back to unlimited
playback on any computer ad free for ten
dollars a month you also get the ability
to cash your favorite tunes and
playlists offline plus you can use their
mobile app which can also catch your
favorites for offline listening all in
all it's a great service and the free
option is so compelling it's hard not to
recommend it's addictive though so if
you don't have an afternoon to kill
listening to great music you should save
it for another day for CNN com I'm
Donald ah sure Spotify is only free for
six months but don't worry by then
they'll surely be a brand new must-have
sharing service to take its place now
while I go beg Donald for a spotify
invite let's take a quick break but
don't go too far we've still got a lot
more tech review right after this
you
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on now with the good the
folks from clips are probably still
devising ways to put sugar in Matt
Mackowiak see a stank after we put their
HD theater 500 speaker system in the bad
section last week well Matt's back this
week with the energy take classic 5.1
speaker system to which he has a
completely different reaction hey I'm
Matthew miskovic at cnet com and this is
the energy take classic 5.1 this is a
5.1 speaker system and it can be found
online for four hundred dollars the tape
classic is one of the best home audio
values you're going to find the system
is made up of four compact satellite
speakers a center channel and a 200 watt
subwoofer the speakers have an elegant
piano black finish and overall the
system looks like it costs a lot more
than it actually does behind the speaker
grill you'll find a point 75 inch
tweeter and a 3 inch mid-range driver
around back the speakers have
high-quality binding posts so you'll be
able to use banana plugs with your
speaker wire the subwoofer has an 8 inch
driver on the bottom and standard
connectivity options on the back panel
what makes the take plastic system stand
out from other compact speakers is its
outstanding sound quality the speakers
are small but it sounds like a big
system which means you can crank it up
loud on movies and the energy delivers a
powerful sound without getting distorted
the blend between the subwoofer and the
satellite speakers is superb and this is
really one of the best compact subs
you're going to find which is a big
reason why the system sounds so good the
take classic also sounds excellent with
2 channel music which is rare with a
budget system like this we used to take
classic as our reference speakers when
we were reviewing several other budget
speaker packages and the energies always
came out on top with the sole exception
of pioneers SP PK 21
be a speaker package the Pioneer does
sound a little better at high volumes
but those speakers are much larger and
that won't be a good choice for many
living rooms when you consider its
excellent compact design outstanding
sound quality and the incredible price
it's really tough to recommend anything
other than energy system that's why the
energy take classic 5.1 is our editors
choice for budget speaker systems and at
four hundred dollars it's an incredible
value I'm Matthew miskovic and this is
the energy take classic 5.1 so there you
go great design great sound great value
one problem energy take wow that's a
stupid name okay let's see who we're
gonna knock down a peg this week as we
move to the bad when it comes to buying
a smartphone you don't have to spend a
lot of money but while there is such a
thing as an entry-level phone there's
also such a thing as a do not enter
model as we're about to find out hi I'm
Jessica adult court for cnet what I've
got here today is the huawei m835 for
metropcs it's also known as the t-mobile
comment and the huawei i do so if it
looks a little familiar to you that's
why this is quite an entry-level phone
it runs android 2.2 froyo but it does
not have hotspot support that's pretty
normal for this type of phone and also
for phones that run on prepaid carriers
I really like that it's running stock
Android because the screen is really
small so the less clutter you've got on
here the better it's got a 2.8 inch qvga
screen this is again as I said really
small and that's where swipe comes in
handy because hunting and pecking on
this really just won't work the phone
itself is also very compact it's got a
black face on the front the shiny and
glossy and a soft touch material on the
back it seems a little bit thick and
instinctively I keep thinking that
there's going to be a slide-out QWERTY
keyboard but there's not there's a 3.2
megapixel camera on the back I thought
that the pictures it took were washed
out and kind of unfocused same for video
so that's unfortunate there's a microSD
card slot that takes up to 32 gigabytes
of external storage but you do have to
remove the battery to get at it and
that's downside on top of all of these
drawbacks the processor is also really
slow and it only has 2.5 g data so it
feels really pokey overall call quality
also not so hot so things aren't looking
too good for this phone and pricing
maybe it's only saving grace right now
it's eighty dollars with a fifty-dollar
instant savings and there's no contract
with metropcs so that makes it one of
the most affordable Android phones for
the carrier but for about twenty dollars
more you can also pick up the LG optimus
m which i think is a better phone
overall so again this is the huawei m835
and you can check out my full review all
the pros and cons at cnet com you see
there's a reason that Apple spends
billions on R&amp;amp;D Huawei apparently spent
about a weekend let's finish things up
with this week's bottom line Thursday
marked the official opening of comic-con
2011 in San Diego now since Molly is on
vacation this week she won't be there
costumed as Wonder Woman neither will
