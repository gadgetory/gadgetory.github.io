look what not why not why not so okay
just real quickly tell us a little bit
about yourselves and how long you been
watching the apple byte or how you got
all connected with this whole with the
whole cnet family per se go I'll go
first I'm Terence as he said before been
watching apple byte about 2006 Wow Vic
from pretty much like from the start
yeah give a shout out to Steven flat
he's the one who put me on oh no jealous
right now that I'm are actually on the
show yeah he's crying he's crying in a
corner right now yeah it's it's it's
doable that's cool and then Jesse how'd
you get wrung into this earth there's
introduced me to it it's been about
maybe a year now nice so are there any
moments that you liked and moments you
dislike because we do some like
sometimes some weird stuff on the show
just saying we like to hear honest rah
feedback yeah overall I think this is
pretty good is pretty entertaining I
guess but sometimes it's a little weird
but we deal with it like like like
anything specific that you can point to
oh yeah one of the ones where you lick
the iphone it was too much weight to
Jesse I think this is great yeah what
about it we sometimes get a mixed
reviews what about the skits yay or nay
mmm sometimes their own point they
something like okay these guys are
really going for when they're straight
just a stretch right now like hey i love
it because they are being wrong on us
which is that what i appreciate but
they're like in the same room so
like little I don't just tell them how
it is I appreciate fellas thanks for
coming in so let's just jump in the show
people that are watching and wondering
what is going on here this the
Applewhite extra crunchy it's an
extension really of the apple byte where
we have time to free flow and really
talk about things that happen in a more
you know a prolonged way we got to just
really dig into it a little bit and
obviously September ninth apple's
keynote they dropped everything on as
possible i mean i don't think we've seen
a keynote that had this one stuff before
right yeah i was jam-packed they were
rolling through so for you guys what
what it what stuck out to you the most
if you had to name one product that you
each like the most well start off with
jesse what was the one that kind of
stuck out with you it would have to be
the apple TV I'll opportunity at the
most because a that that's a update that
people have been waiting for for a long
time and i would say introduced the most
features is that something that you were
hoping to see because you wanted to buy
one even yes yes yes good i'll get
closer that might we want to hear you
loud and clear that's good what about
you Terrance uh it would be saying for
me Apple TV because I have the original
one and I've been waiting a very long
time for an update some of the things
that they are now sort of disappointed
me but at the end of the day I'm still
gonna get it so here's the thing like i
I'm I'm with you but I'm also opposite
of you guys because I felt like the
Apple TV was a what they showed off it
has the potential to be the best product
out of the three we saw but it's not
just not there yet but if you think of
down the road what it can do absolutely
right but then when I think of like they
here and now I was whether or not people
agree with me or not I was even though
we knew pretty much ninety percent of
what was coming on the iphone i was
still impressed with the iphone like I
liked I think that the 3d touch is going
to be is actually going to make it
easier for us to use our phones absolute
and it looked it looked nice how it is
executed I know it looks exactly like
the iPhone 6 I think now these days
though we're at a point where our phones
pretty much do what we want them to do
right but I still really I like the
iphone success and then I'm in the
minority because I've always wanted this
big ipad screen I travel a lot I read a
whole bunch of comics and watch movies
when I'm traveling so I
digging the ipad pro i like it a lot
these guys like guys if you could see
their fate you know you need to cut away
to their faces when I'm talking cuz I'm
like do this clown like the iPad pro
like out of all the things we saw the
ipad pro know is is that like brett pro
is cool a lot of the features were great
but at the end of the day I'm like man
it's too big I use my iPad in bed i
gotta be home with the TV in the valey
that's cooking with that what's wrong
with that what do you guys think let's
talk about the pencil can we call the
pencil i wanted i wish they call it the
pen the pencil sounds ridiculous are
they were apple pen they were gonna go
with pain because Samsung get this thing
I spend I guess see there you go and
they weren't gonna call it a brush yeah
but it can be a brush pencil weird it's
just like but for the record guys it's a
capital P therefore not a pencil it's a
cab pencil with a capital P is different
they're thinking different everybody
officially thinking different i I've
seen the there been some videos of
people actually using it it actually
does look pretty sweet how I works I
mean I've played with wakem tablets I
haven't really been on a the cintiq ones
but it looks everyone's saying it's
pretty responsive but again i'm not a
graphic artist type person so there's no
need for me to do that right I mean you
guys the are our guests here both from
Lockheed we can say that right and if
even if we couldn't I just did but uh
you know even even over Lockheed I mean
there's only certain certain people that
would be using this pen type tool right
right correct right so whether like
designers are some of the engineer types
ID they might yeah people not like me
but then also I look at that thing and I
don't know if I don't know if artists
are gonna get on board with that I mean
an artist you can touch up things but
isn't there don't you still want
actually work on the actual medium
that's where you gonna get trained
anyways yeah and I think like with
artists I think the physical aspect of
being able to smudge or to do like very
various designs and
not you won't be able to do that with a
Apple pencil yeah is either it's what
you draw or you have to hold the pencil
at a particular angle in order to get
the strokes that you would like yeah I
think that this is going to be for a
small like this functionality although
great looks cool I think it's gonna be I
don't even know what percentage of
people are actually gonna buy it
specifically for the pen and the screen
because like you guys just said and
alluded to not many people are just
gonna want an ipad just purely because
the bigger screen we're gonna have to do
something different which that does but
then again how many people are actually
going to buy that combo I don't think
it's gonna really bump their sales that
much beach I'm like what do you think
about this whole thing I think it's kind
of ridiculous and the biggest complaint
I've heard from people is like where do
you store it where do you keep it you
know like it just kind of floats out
nowhere oh I don't really keep it we're
gonna keep it I can't wait for the first
late you know for someone be like is
that an apple pencil in your pocket oh
why yes it is it's longer than you
thought it is not it's a it's a long
pencil it is it looks pretty big yeah oh
thanks Steven I done well I wasn't
asking I'm gonna be the most expensive
pencil you've ever it is nine bucks man
doesn't even write on paper um Apple TV
with for you guys that's the product
that you said stood out the most what do
you what did you what do you want to see
or how do you envision the apple TV
being used in your lives it would
definitely have to be like the sea
research that they show you like you
like talking your TV do because just the
other day I was telling him about a
commercial I was aldi commercials like
hey remember that commercial they're
talking about competition and they would
take a shot siggno not really about like
see hey the apple TV I could have found
it you would ask you just like that
right right maybe add some more details
yeah yeah that's cool what about you
yeah I like the search feature but I
want to be a cable cord cutter because
I'm tired of paying 100 so books just
forget cable kit to get cable channels
so I want to cut the core and that's
what I was really looking forward to but
they didn't they didn't announce the
service but hopefully that's in the
works yeah and also the one of the
things that sort of was my pet peeves
that they introduced it in a hat the
older processor I'm like hey if you're
gonna give me a new product give me the
latest and greatest within it because as
the as the set-top evolves and has the
services involved then I'm going to have
to be forced to upgrade to a newer
set-top box the handle some of the
potential that the Apple TV could
provide for example in like two years
quite honestly right they all the all
the projections are that 4k TVs are
going to finally be really affordable in
the next two to three years well guess
what the a8 processor that's in that
Apple TV right now doesn't support 4k
video at least from what all indications
point to as well as what Apple is
telling us so now we have a phone that
can shoot 4k video awesome I'm down with
that but we don't have a product that
can even show it like it would be so
logical and it's going to happen but we
have a phone that can do that I want to
be able to toss that 4k video and
instantly see it on my TV because my
apple TV can show 4k video so there I
mean in a weird way I don't know if I
want to get this Apple TV right now I
mean I'm going to let's be real job it's
it is part of my job but then just to
know that an a 9 will probably be coming
out and let's say two years they're
probably gonna stick with this one for a
while let the developers develop apps
but then that 4k video option will come
in two years and they're gonna be like
this is what should have happened a long
time ago even if it jacked up the price
I think Apple users would still be
willing to buy it if it had an 89
processor in it right now if it jacked
up the price by like 50 bucks I think
people would still be open to it cuz you
know how you know how they price these
things if you're an apple customer you
can just buy the stuff cuz right about
you you just buy this stuff you pay to
play yep you pay to play for sure um
just some quick things what did you guys
think about the live photos from the
iphone was that it was that thing where
you take a still picture and then later
on you can see it kind of like a three
second video as your wallpaper my
initial reaction was a live life of a
photo isn't that video it in but it
seems pretty cool I don't know how often
i will use it it'll be cool as a desktop
I mean is my background on my phone but
other than that
okay how about this let's go around a
circle if you could if you could choose
something to be your live photo for your
wallpaper what would it be right now
Twyla cuz you obviously have something
cute in the works no no not keyed not
cute i'm just saying like you can put
your mind in the gutter or you can keep
it up top I probably just have my kids
I'm glad yeah that's what I all my all
my wallpaper on my phone is my kids
pretty much yeah yeah for sure for sure
Jen Jess I hope I have to say my niece
making their silly faces okay oh yeah
everyone's have been going to chew it I
think teryn's gonna get dirty young
weirdo so i think i would go with like
something that looks cuban when you
touch it something scary pops out that
way get you keep from looking at my
phone okay okay okay um I know what I
would really want it to be but I can't
say that so I would probably have like
some balloons floating away he's so
disappointed I'm gonna put you into
lands CC so he's so disappointed right
now um also this is just a side note
because we want to at least bring some
more information the table for people
that are watching the iphone 6s in the
new iOS 9 which I got to check out it
does have now there you're going to be
able to do hey Siri while it's unplugged
that could be bad no no no it's cool but
I think it's bad yeah disagree I want to
screw like ultimate prank to annoy the
hell out of your coworkers just start
saying hey Siri right next their phone
when it's unplugged then people won't
like that I'm telling you it's gonna
it's the new thing so what they have is
like a voice recognition tool I'm
guessing that's why they've put it in
here is because they're gonna try and
make it at least cater to your voice to
your personal voice a little more so
that someone like me can't be a jerk
like that that's what I'm guessing it's
like a five step process where you keep
on saying hey Siri and people that have
their phones plugged in right now this
always happens they always complain to
us whenever we say hey Siri because
their stuff go there their devices
where's Ellen you don't want it we won't
say hey Siri in the show more than we
have to ok I think that's crazy people
leave that on I turn mine off well I saw
don't so and don't get into i turn it
off so people don't say hey Siri some
dudes about to punch throw his phone out
the window right now um here's like a
thing that I'm not so happy about Apple
raised the price of applecare I don't
know if you heard about this but with
the new phones with the 6s series
applecare before was ninety nine dollars
if you get a 6s phone 6s plus they're
bumping it up to one hundred and twenty
nine dollars which is which seems to me
I know that they could say and claim
that it's because of the new display but
I feel like they're milking us a little
bit totally like I get it it's an
insurance coverage for your phone in
addition to that if there's accidental
damage before it was a seventy nine
dollar fee to bump that up to 99 bucks
hmm so I'm just saying it's bad apple
it's bad apple stuff but I'm not I'm not
down with that I think that Apple not
only its I'm not complaining that they
make a lot of money but they do make a
lot of money I just don't see the real
the true reason if they can explain to
me why I should give them 30 more bucks
for this insurance plan that sounds like
the replacement cost of a new pair of
headphones if you break your headphones
it's 2999 so they're just building that
in because i know i went back and got
like five pairs of headphones that broke
so you're so you're the reason yeah I'm
the rise like jackets they're like we've
got a lot of people returning their
headphones we keep on giving them new
headphones so we're gonna build this
into the cost of apple juice or add
another price 2999 because it dudes like
you yeah sorry guys sorry my bad that's
sad um ipad pro stuff nothing major
nothing big the big thing at least that
adobe because you know these companies
are always talking each other adobe
officially put on their site oh you know
some of our new apps are going to work
with the ipad pro that has four gigs of
ram except Apple never officially says
how much RAM is in their products and so
everyone's like it's four gigs of ram
and then adobe is like group and then
they're erased it from that
their site it was there and it's like
it's gone now it pretty much probably
has four gigs of ram also with the ipad
pro they talked about one of the reasons
why it's so fast and can compete with a
lot of these more desktop laptops not
desktop laptops but you know what I'm
saying mobile PCs and laptops is because
the controller for this actual device is
sped up the process of interpreting and
taking in data and pushing it out giving
it desktop class performance the thing
about this is that apple claims oh it's
eighty percent as fast as eighty percent
of the laptops out there but again
there's a lot of laptops out there that
are not that friend that are not that
fast so I really once we get our hands
on it I really want to see where it
really falls in there's no way it's
going to be able to hang with like a
high-end macbook pro or anything like
that but I'll be curious to see where it
hangs out in in that way um here's some
just other side news that's at this
actually the news that I like the most
and i want to show you this to you guys
because um we're gonna jump around
Beecham but Apple announced that they

advantage of this stuff I don't know I
haven't read this but uh but go go check
it out on cray-cray vena com oh man okay
hope emoji let's go hit the calls
because we got to get out of here huh
yeah we're running out of time okay
let's get hit the calls all right number
one call comes to us from hey Brian
Beecham you guys are the best this is
Simon from a me and my question has to
do with what about all of us that are
excited to get this new success we have
the hardships of you know having two
year contracts and not on these next
plans that we can upgrade the mobile
companies did making it harder for us to
upgrade to the newest devices unless
you're on
payment plan thank you guys take care
man I feel like he read my mind because
I don't know if you guys have heard of
this whole Apple is offering their own
iphone upgrade plan and everyone's
trying to figure out it's actually
pretty complicated because it comes down
to a few things now when this color
first and I like how I called you
Beecham he's all right like he's our
starting the coming on my name yeah
right which is good yo beat him they're
on board with that it's like his name
Steven but I like you know we call
Beecham here so just like this might the
thing is that we can't really explain
explain because there's so many numbers
to throw around that it becomes very
confusing but at the end of the day if
you look at apple's iphone upgrade plan
the bit the best thing about it is that
if you are someone who likes to buy
applecare on your phone which i am and
you want to be able to switch your phone
out every year it is the best plan the
reason being is there's no interest on
it basically the price of the phone that
you would buy unlocked is that price and
it spread over that time but again
you're not paying more and you're not
locked into a specific carrier which is
which is what makes it interesting you
can actually bounced around from those
carriers the disadvantage the only
disadvantage is that you do have to
return your phone or give it back to
apple in order for you to get that new
phone but when you look at all these
other companies and other carriers they
have different ways of doing it t-mobile
has a really cheap deal to start a lot
cheaper deal to start going in but
that's what the expectation that you
stay with them beyond that first year
that you stay with them long term you
have other things like Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T
and Sprint their plans again although
they might be comparable maybe a little
bit more the main disadvantages that you
can't necessarily not only switch your
phone out every year but also when you
add applecare into the mix the cost
typically go up so it's just if you're
someone who does not want applecare
you're probably gonna be better off with
the carriers but if you're someone who
wants applecare and wants to switch it
out every year then you're better going
with apples plan it just about you guys
got applecare on your phones or not that
warm purchased yeah most people don't
honestly I had it on my iphone 6 plus
being a stolen
so what happens when it gets stolen what
happens I have to go back to my old
phone luckily I can't be and I have to
use my by this oh so that's why you had
a 5s exactly so I was kind of honest I
was judging you when I first say gotta
fo wise oh honey I was like wait wait
wait NC watch the Apple white but you
gotta 5s I'm just kidding I am so
messing with you because it's even even
if you had so you actually had a 5s but
then you because you like the six
because it was new form factor you got
the six right absolutely you you jumped
up you kind of stopped your contract or
actually was your contract up already
well how i do this i have 22 accounts on
my line welcome and there's me oh he
uses mom's account no she doesn't care I
use hers he's like he's like hey mama um
I'm gonna get you this real nice iphone
4s I got the six today you'll love the
features of the 4s I got a six yeah
mention of you why is your phone so big
where's my so little I want that one oh
no mom that's not how it works you know
she just brought to you to this world
helped to raise you to become the man
you are today and you just hold the
volume mean that the funny thing is
obviously that happens more its more
common than not right or maybe yeah I'm
pretty sure because Amy even if you go
to 18 teens website it says hey you can
upgrade someone else's account and get
user upgrade the whole staggered kinda
like family accounting is pretty good
for that so um yeah so anyways the for
me see most people don't do applecare
but what I do with applecare is but
something obviously ends up going wrong
with my phone or something happens to it
like on my six there's like the
lamination of the screen is like peeling
off on the bottom so all I do is I just
swap it out right before and then I sell
it and so I get a lot you can get a good
amount of money back you typically get
around I don't know for a six probably
around 200 300 bucks back which is good
right so then that two been
psychologically you're like well that
covers the cost of me upgrading or kind
of at least cutting some of those costs
of just getting the next phone so that's
why I've always done it but now that
Apple has this iphone upgrade plan
for me it might it might make sense I
don't know if I'm gonna do it yet though
so they're calling it an upgrade plan
but it feels like you're leasing a phone
from Apple so you are exactly exactly
that is exactly what you're doing so and
it's also to pretty much compete to what
the other carriers are doing in essence
but I think apples may employee is that
oh if you get applecare if you're
someone who does that's when it makes
sense because yeah the cost is pretty
much exactly the same there's no
interest there's nothing but there's a
lot of people most people don't get
applecare on their phones that's just
the fact so that's why most people will
stick with their carriers the whole 18
next thing is all over the place for me
I don't I don't get that one because
they have different tiers like 12 month
18 money for month and then one can you
really upgrade depending on hot that
one's kind of a zoo I think 18t like
tries on purpose to confuse everybody
cuz even going on their website it's
confusing I can't figure it out like I'm
just all I do is I tell the person do
not f with my unlimited data yeah just
please that's where I am that's why you
have to buy this because you want to
state yours you're sticking on your plan
right yeah that's otherwise is your
contract up in ya my great trek visit
are you gonna get a success no no yes
that's the plan so i'll probably just
pay full price for ya yeah cuz i don't i
don't want to have to lease and iphones
like this yeah see that's for you that's
a smart thing to do for sure so um yeah
we you know we live in the great first
world problems where we talk about
phones and some of us use our mom's
plans to get new phones okay hey gonna

nice a taco emoji to your mom for us so
