can't see
traditional headlights show you what's
in your path now adaptive headlights
show you what's in your path next the
concept goes back all the way to the
Tucker it had a third eye headlight that
mechanically followed the steering rack
rather crudely today two major
technologies get this done better some
cars have special lights that aim off
into the corners and only turn on as you
turn the wheel to navigate a corner more
common are cars that have motorized
headlamp assemblies
than actually swivel left or right based
on your steering angle and your vehicle
speed one of the newer technologies
though has been shown by Audi these are
called LED matrix headlights outies
developed these if you look inside there
you're going to see five led assemblies
there they are there and each of those
is made up of five LED emitters so 25
pieces here 25 more on the other side
they tell me that you can do a billion
combinations of light based on direction
based on the shape of the thing and even
based on where it's pointing and they do
the pointing not by moving things on
swivels like most cars do but by
actually changing what light elements
are on and the intensity of each one
this is interesting because they can use
GPS instead of the steering column to
pre-aim the lights where you're going it
knows where the curve is coming before
you steer into it so the light is there
even before you are where as current
cars wait for your steering input in
theory putting the lights reaction a
little bit behind where you need to be
looking this text not for sale in the US
yet not because it isn't ready
but because the Department of
Transportation and other regulators just
haven't caught up with it yet and don't
quite know how to classify it other
countries do have it for sale
now this is laser light coming in the
future this is really cutting-edge stuff
but Audi's done here is envision the
laser high beams specific lighting
system with incredible range we're
talking 500 meters that's 1,500 feet
trust me your current high beams don't
see out that far and of course with
incredible intensity and purity of light
that laser is known for and the similar
low energy consumption that LED is known
for what's happening inside here is
actually a bit of a misnomer you may
think this is like some Pink Floyd
concert where they're shooting lasers
all over the road not the case this is
the module it's in the guts of this
thing the actual laser is behind this
piece of circuit board and it's only
going as far as this barrel it's
pointing this way to that piece of
phosphor there which gets excited by the
laser light and then it emits the light
then through a lens and then with it's
incredible brightness so if you think
about this as being lasers fired all
over the road that's not how it works
but it harnesses laser technology
nonetheless as you can see a benefit of
this design is its extreme compactness
freeing up more of the car's front
acreage for designers to do things other
than just fitting in big lamp assemblies
the IIHS rates adaptive lighting among
the best of the new crop of
driver-assistance tech recent surveys
show that models of cars equipped with
current adaptive headlights have as much
as a 10% reduction in collision claims
and the IIHS estimates that full
adoption of this technology one day
could eliminate as many as a hundred and
forty thousand accidents a year some
2,500 of those fatal when you're in the
market for a new car new or late-model
used to pay is to double check if it's
got adaptive headlight tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
