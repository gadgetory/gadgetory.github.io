Facebook is causing an uproar among its
users the Facebook feeds of nearly
700,000 users were filtered to feature
more positive or negative content based
on certain keywords like excited they're
getting to make them more positive or
more negative and what they found is
that the way that people talk on
Facebook tends to impact the way that
users feel the study which was published
recently took place over the course of a
week in January 2012 it was conducted by
two universities and Facebook's data
sciences team they need to make sure
that they understand their user base so
that they can serve us more appropriate
ads which is the way that they make
money and keep running participants were
never notified and that's angered many
Facebook is about me and my friends it's
not supposed to be manipulated in some
way but every user essentially grants
the social network permission to conduct
these kinds of experiments when they
create their accounts there really isn't
much recourse other than going to
Facebook and deleting your account in a
statement Facebook told CNET that it
does research to quote make the content
people see on facebook as relevant and
engaging as possible a big part of this
is understanding how people respond to
different types of content whether it's
positive or negative in tone facebook
also says it has a strong internal
review process but that may do little to
ease users concerns over future testing
