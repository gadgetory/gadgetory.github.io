update the samsung galaxy s4 smartphone
is about to be unveiled on Thursday but
the rumors and leaks are building in the
11th hour here's the latest someone
posted a video of what is claimed to be
the galaxy s4 and it looks quite a bit
like a typical Samsung product but it's
too hard to be sure if this is a final
product or some prototype but we do know
the shape of it Samsung's Twitter
accounts sent out this photo of the
phone in the shadows and it looks just
like the last galaxy phone so there's no
big surprise when it comes to the shape
expect the focus to be about the
features inside the camera could be a 3d
camera Samsung filed for a trademark on
the phrase 2d 3d movie and still come
back to cnet to watch the news live on
thursday at 4pm Pacific 7 p.m. Eastern

its sister app Skitch and it'll show

vimeo the competitor to youtube has
launched an on-demand service that gives

the next time you click like on facebook
you could be telling more information
about yourself than you realize
researchers at the University of
Cambridge studied 58,000 Facebook Likes
and just by looking at the likes they
could determine a user's IQ gender
sexual orientation political and
religious beliefs and that was more than
eighty percent accurate I'm sure
political and religious beliefs could be
easy to guess but the most accurate was
ethnicity they got that right
ninety-five percent of the time just by
looking at what you like it's this kind
of detail that makes advertisers so
interested in connecting with you on
