on a special look back at some of the
toughest and most indestructible gadgets
we've ever tested we're counting down to
the toughest gadget of them all
always on is on cuz I don't have enough
chocolate in May I need that beer too
you
you
welcome to always-on I am Hollywood and
I'm Jeff Kannada and this is the show
where we take a look at the tech that's
part of your life and your future now
season 5 is almost upon us but before we
get into new shows we thought we'd take
a little walk back through memory lane
yes we're gonna look at the entire
history of always-on even before I
joined the crew and showed you guys
really how to torture gadgets we did
okay on our own but even once Jeff came
there were some gadgets that absolutely
stunned us their ability to survive just
about anything yeah and we're gonna do
this top five style so we're gonna count
down starting with number five which is
a rugged camera that I really had a lot
of fun torturing I'm gonna try to
get some some photos in the water as I'm
surfing
I got beat up out there humbled by those
ways but it's you know it's doing fine
it was beating me all
torso and it's held up so water test
basically a pass just hanging out just
having my beer
oh no and it says it's still recording
look at you iron man here we go oh
there's a big crack there's a big crack
the Optio @wg - it takes a lickin and it
keeps on clicking that's also when we
found out that Jeff has a gift for this
kind of day well I wouldn't say that the
camera was in good condition when I was
done with it I would need it a little
taping it's still survived it took
pictures okay we also discovered a
little later on that our producers have
a gift for coming up with creative
torture test ideas like when the
waterproof Sony Xperia Z came out who
needs water No
okay so first up I'm gonna put it in our
container here then I'm gonna cover it
with tempered chocolate and then it's
gonna go into the freezer to set up into
a nice yummy chocolate bar here we go oh
wow that's a lot of
but not a nice thing to do to a thumb
right come with me over here I want to
make sure my phone is well and truly
coated
the chocolate bar by putting it in the
freezer
beautiful
oh yeah that is looking delicious I
think there's really only one way to
break this chocolate up and we're just
gonna have to do like a mini drop test
still really a lot of chocolate on here
so I think it's gonna need like a little
bit of a back supposed to be waterproof
this is like the leaves are the things
that could happen through a hot water
peel this chocolate back here oh yeah
we're getting some melted I see our
screen is going a little crazy so I'm in
too much trouble with the water here
excuse me just the chocolate in its
joints
it is pretty remarkable to give a phone
like a complete sink back and have it
just not have a problem but all in all I
think our Sony Xperia Z has passed the
chocolate test with Hawaiian colors it
was actually amazing because that one
test pretty much incorporated the heat
the cold the drop the water yeah hot
chocolate cold chocolate chocolate it's
a lot of Chuck really any chocolate it's
pretty hardcore phone very impressive
we're gonna take a quick break when we
come back we'll have our top three
toughest gadgets including the one we
call the zombie
you
welcome back everybody we're counting
down our top five toughest gadgets that
we've ever tested here on always-on
that's right we're gonna keep it rockin
and what did I say Rock I think you did
I think a giant rock is a great way to
torture a gadget I think so too
we went looking for a location with a
lot of different options and we landed
here at American soil in stone where
we're going to scratch drop and dunk our
poor little MacBook let's get to it
within there
that was awesome so I'm betting that
it's a little bit scratched up turns out
a little bit tougher than I thought at
least in the scratch Department well so
now the thing about our MacBook Pro is
that it's really dirty so I think it's
time for it to get a little shower while
it's open oh that's terrible
that's just awful three two one
okay we have some scratching a couple
more dense nothing too serious three two
one oh the hinge feels a little tight
but the screen is okay
well now that can't be good Oh Oh the
hens doesn't want to open at all
oh we have cracked the retina display
but I gotta say nowhere near the
shattering that I might expect if this
thing still comes on after drying out
I'm gonna call that usable I'm sorry to
say I think our MacBook Pro is dead huh
wait just when we thought it was dead it
came back on this guy is unquestionably
construction grade I was the doubter but
I can't even believe what that laptop
went through it's very impressive that
is amazing that it even came on at all
yeah I mean survive is a little strong
but still
yeah it's certifiably tough super tough
all right speaking of which here's
number two on our list this is the
gadget that went through the whole
regular torture test gamut and then it
was still so strong that we just threw
it in the wash
as one does there were complaints that I
went a little easy on the galaxy s3
compared to the iPhone which had to go
through the washer so as promised the s3
is now getting the same treatment in the
washing machine in goes the phone and
I'm gonna wash it on cold away we go
it's so dramatic - let it go around
Oh like it just got an email I can't
believe it still on the Wi-Fi I'm right
here
our wash cycle is done let's rescue our
galaxy s3 and I'm assuming dry it out
for a while okay here is our go oh my
goodness the notification light is still
going look at that you see that so the
screen doesn't come on but that is um
one really tough LED right there so here
is the samsung galaxy s3 that went
through the washer and i'm not even
bothering with the bag of rice because
check it out it's totally fine we dried
it out for 24 hours took it out to see
if it was alright and it came on like no
problem this thing is amazing
who hasn't put their phone in the
washing machine or at least come very
close apparently everyone we had a ton
of requests for that particular test and
it's only fair to point out that we did
the same thing with the iPhone 4s and it
came out of brick so good just is why
it's on the list that's right guys s3
speaking of the list we have now come to
number one but first some honorable
mentions
all right here we are it's time to find
out who is number one the toughest
gadget we've ever tested that's right
what is it it is the first one actually
that we ever tested and I admit we were
still learning but even when we upped
the ante a lot we could not kill this
thing check it out
I'm sorry you guys there's one device
that we're taking out of the giveaway
pool and that is our so far
indestructible iPad because everything
we've done to it it's been okay
okay now it has water in it yeah and
nitrogen it has no case and that's going
in last I think it's gonna survive
and it goes and then it actually sounds
like it's frying I know it sounds
exactly like a fryer and it looks like
it do the bubbles I just wanted to
screen the screen the screens on no you
guys see that yeah that screen is on all
right well now that it's well and truly
frozen it wouldn't be a liquid nitrogen
test if we didn't go a little bit
Terminator on it okay we're gonna go
ahead and drop this one okay here we go
guys ready three two one dropping is
that screen it's not okay I I actually
think it was so strong it dented the
cement it dented the subnet okay here we
go guys let's pick up the pieces here
what you go
okay as far as I'm concerned that is a
pass this thing is still kicking that's
unbelievable there has been a lot of
carnage on this episode but liquid
nitrogen that was in sane when it came
on and then came on again I mean the
crowd was going crazy we were actually a
little nervous I was having Terminator
flashbacks exactly not gonna lie it's
very impressive that iPad built very
well yeah give that one to your kids
yeah don't even worry about it and
please tell us your craziest torture
test stories because they might show up
on the show sometime I love getting
those recommendations people are always
tweeting me like oh you should do this
