gadgets and winamp turns 10 it really
whips the llama's s it can only be in
the queue
hey there what's going on i'm rich the
mural with Cena TV in New York City you
are officially in the queue and thanks
to everyone that Facebook me now join
the queue group I feel very special
let's get you started by slowing you
down on star announcing new technology
that can help retrieve stolen cars and
stop police chases the stolen vehicle
slowdown sends a signal to a stolen car
slowing down and then stopping the car's
engine the technology available in GM's
2009 model year vehicles remember when
mp3s were all the rage and the only
player to have was winamp the simple app
is still kickin and now there's a 10th
anniversary edition version 5.5 features
a fully redesigned interface that now
includes album art there's an automatic
playlist maker with a more like this
button I love those things a media
monitor which refreshes your collection
with whatever you've added to your
computer and better remote access to
your media there's also a browser
toolbar so you're never far from your
tunes the holidays are just around the
corner and seventy-five percent of us
want at least one gadget which brings us
to the cube quick quiz what digital
lifestyle product tops the holiday wish
list is it a new laptop a new digital
camera a gps nav system or an HDTV take
a second if you set HDTV that's right
thirty-five percent of us want one under
the Christmas tree according to a survey
from solutions research group other
items also making the top ten list new
cell phone video camera wii and ps3 you
know it's pretty sad that i want all
those things moving through the cube
where do you buy your gadgets more
electronics consumers are making
Beilein's to those big club stores but
poor service makes us actually want to
buy somewhere else all this according to
the NPD group apparently consumers love
browsing at discount and warehouse clubs
but often purchase somewhere else the
problem a lack of service and
knowledgeable sales people that's why
you stopped at seen at first so you know
what you're getting before you buy the
fav product at the club cheap digital
cameras catching up on episodes of
america's next top model on a tiny
screen is pretty good but it's not great
thankfully my views $200 wearable
display gets you a larger virtual screen
and now it's not just for ipods anymore
the my view goggles sit in front of your
head
won't take up your whole field of view
so you can actually see what's happening
around you the goggles now plug into a
standard AV jack so they work with many
portable media players and other video
devices like DVD players and camcorders
the device comes with remote control and
noise cancelling headphones and the
bundle battery should last you about 4
hours per charge oh and I know I
shouldn't have to say this but try to
resist the urge to catch up on your
favorite TV shows while driving even
though they do kind of look like
sunglasses I'm rich Demuro would see an
SUV see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
