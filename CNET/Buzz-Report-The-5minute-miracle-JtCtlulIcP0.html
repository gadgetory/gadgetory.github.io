with the buzz reports first the gadget
of the week it's voodoo a new box and
service that will soon deliver movies on
demand over your broadband connection
without any wait to start playing now
they pull that little trick off by first
storing the beginning of every movie in
their catalog locally on your voodoo box
that's what you watch when you first hit
play meanwhile in the background the
rest of its getting delivered on a
peer-to-peer network of other voodoo
boxes what's clever here is that no pc
is required and they have five of the
six major film studios lined up to
contribute movies sony of course is the
odd man out but i'll be watching voodoo
and anything else that can get us past
the age of using the postal service or
our five-ton suvs to ferry these damn
things all over town now the news maybe
this is why Sony isn't on that voodoo
bandwagon Sony television just
announcing they're going to re-release
some of their classic TV series as what
they call minisodes five minute versions
of what we're originally 30 or 60 minute
TV shows the idea is to create snackable
versions of TV much like the snack sizes
of chips and cookies that fooled us into
becoming a nation of deluded fat asses
this too could go horribly wrong like
the snacks will think all the crap has
been removed but in fact cutting down an
episode of TJ Hooker to a mere five
minutes doesn't even come close to doing
that well the next thing we may see on
justin.tv maybe the inside of an
appliance box justin kahn for whom it's
named has to find the new place to live
he and his crew that produced that 24 7
life cast about him have been evicted
from their San Francisco apartment
headquarters now the reported reasons
vary some say there were complaints from
neighbors who didn't like being webcast
live to the world every time they are
ran into justin in the hallway you think
and of course not every landlord would
be delighted about having for
20-something guys and all their friends
and all their gear turn a two bedroom
unit into their office Clubhouse ground
zero but there is no way that Justin is
actually gonna go out and find their new
apartment or if he does I want to meet
the landlord who rents to a guy who has
a camera on his head and refuses to put
his backpack down YouTube is added a
feature that I beg you never to use it's
called active sharing but I've rebranded
it it's called over sharing in my book
it lets you tube archive a list of all
the videos you watch display who else is
watching a given video when you are and
see the last five videos they watched
and of course like everything else on
the net these days you get to chat about
it all I think the idea here is to
create a real-time shared experience so
you won't think you're alone at your
computer desk watching a really dumb
video in your shorts drinking a bud no
now you'll see there are a few other
people doing the exact same thing that's
depressing I'm Brian Cooley this has
been the buzz report thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
