sound of sleigh bells in the air which
can only mean one thing
christmas is finally here but no festive
period would be complete without the
obligatory spending spree coming up then
you'll find my picks of the most
outrageously ostentatious gifts
welcome to attack it in Christmas a new
iPhone is likely to be on many people's
Christmas wish lists but Apple standard
stainless steel affair doesn't really
cut it for this show instead let's take
a look over a brick who for a mere
$95,000 will sell you an iPhone excess
max wraps in 313 grams of 22 karat gold
it makes the phone look just like an
actual gold ingots that you've just
heisted from an underground bank vault
that price will of course skyrocket if
you decide to adorn it further with a
load of diamonds and other precious gems
which of course you will does why not
perhaps you've got your heart set on
something a little more futuristic in
which case take a look at the jet suit
by gravity industries this contraption
essentially straps multiple jet turbines
to your arms and a fuel tank to your
back letting you fly around the air as
though you're a visitor from the tech
future we've all dreamed up Selfridges
will sell you the jet suit for a cool
340 thousand pounds also includes
training and a lunch with a gravity
industry's founder you will however have
to sign a waiver in case of your death
but what if you'd rather explore the
Seas than the skies while even that can
be done with a hearty splash of luxury
thanks to a collaboration between
submarine makers triton and luxury
supercar makers Aston Martin
project Neptune combines Triton's
deep-sea know-how with some slick aston
martin design making sure you are
exploring the Mariana Trench with style
and because it's fully enclosed you
could probably wear a luxury dinner suit
while you're doing it there's no pricing
for this sub just yet but given that
Triton's regular deep-sea
cost around the five million dollar mark
you can bet this strictly limited
edition vehicle won't come cheap back on
dry land now how about a new TV but this
is decadent so we're not talking about
any run-of-the-mill OLED panel here no
Samsung's the wall is a very different
beast its massive for one thing a
whopping 146 inches and it's made up of
modular panels so you can make it even
bigger if you wanted or even a different
shape altogether to fit your oddly
specific viewing needs our own TV expert
David Katz Maya has been eyes on with
this monster and confirms that it's at
least as good as a regular OLED panel so
don't think they'll be reducing viewing
quality to get that huge size it's a Kay
of course and while there's no official
pricing yet cast Maya would hazard a
guess at a price tag somewhere in the
region of a hundred grams that's a lot
of passion for a telly but a luxury TV
demands luxury audio to go with it and
that's where the anodic supply
Riverstone speaker comes in this thing
cost in the region of 4 million pounds
why I hear you ask
well it's solid gold of course like
actual solid gold a lot of it oh and
there's a bunch of diamonds on it too
because why the hell not apparently
solid gold reproduces your favorite
artists with pristine clarity although
at that price it approaches be cheaper
to bind your favorite artists and have
them perform in your living room
whenever you want it so what do you
think of our tackling Christmas wish
list is spending over 14 million dollars
on all of this stuff a little bit much
or is that pretty much what you're
already spending on Sharri and
chocolates do there's no your thoughts
