we meet a guy who hitchhiked from Texas
to California to get a job at a floppy
disk company later he rose to become the
CEO of seagate reinvention being the
essence of Silicon Valley his ouster
from that job has put bill watkins back
in the startup mode on a mission to
light up your life with LEDs twenty
percent of the american grid of energies
for lighting alone so you look at that
market how do i how do i make people
save money and energy and how can i do
that with intelligent light from control
functions lower energy light etc we open
up all these possibilities and that's
what bridgelux is the bottom first it's
all about LED lighting but made a
different way what happens see this is a
reactor room so therefore you have a
nuclear and oh yeah this is where we
grow our epitaxial films on our way firs
near either silicon on sapphire how can
you drive down the cost of LED because
right now LED fixtures for both
institutional and consumers are high
today we manufacture LEDs on sapphire
base substrate this is our 2 inch
sapphire wafer so sapphire waiver these
are basically sapphire disks you're a
thin very thin but this is pretty small
but it's small it's fairly expensive
than we thought well what can we do
different boom now this is classic
semiconductor business this is this is
pure adis Felix whispers yes your dear
and we basically use gases of materials
and we and we build us a series of
layers what we have solved is the
ability to do that 8-inch and that those
temperatures and those gases without any
cracking or breaking or lattice new
trends this is where you come in and you
go to factories that have moved on to a
12-inch right which is the new huggy
right they used to make DRAM for our USB
drives or whatever is or suffocate off
right and you say you guys aren't doing
much with those lines we want we can
make lights on make lights on that
flight
making LED lights in a way that echoes
making silicon chips doesn't just drive
down costs it also paves the way to
embedding intelligence and new functions
into that module that lives in a light
socket we don't look at that as a socket
we think of as a note when you start
putting a light into chips and making
them intelligent light now you have an
ability to applications here why not
turn your lights off from your iPhone
it's going to be a light that eventually
will react to your environment your
motion eventually we can see lights that
can look at the room that will measure
which one on the room and are just a
light to optimal reading conditions are
optimal tv-watching conditions Watkins
departed seagate after the dramatic
falling out with their board one that
led to a new beginning that seems to
suit him after seagate I thought you
know what I want to go back to real work
I'm tired of lawyers and bankers I want
to go back and this opportunity came up
to look at this company and I came down
here and looked at it and as hokies this
may sound I came in I met these young
engineers you know and there's no 28
years old I probably all think they're
young like I felt loved them been a long
time since I've been around a bunch of
people who would think they're changing
the world and so I said you know what I
don't need the entourage or the jets and
stuff like that um this is what I want
to do and that's what I'm doing not now
I want to go back to record right now so
imma get this as big as I can so I give
myself a dad they said yes it's right as
is the idea that bridgelux engineers
could turn the lighting business on its
head
the brand names that we've known for
such a long time are going to change and
I think every light eventually in 10 or
15 years of LED vision the opportunities
are phenomenal not only the technology
but in the product and in the whole
business mom I mean that's what makes
such an exciting energy it's going to
change dramatically now you may have
noticed that a thread of cost-saving
wines through all that bridgelux is
attempting and that approach is going to
be essential as most of their customers
large or small are used to thinking of
lighting as just a cost to be managed
rather than an opportunity to do more
with all that infrastructure that lies
over our heads</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
