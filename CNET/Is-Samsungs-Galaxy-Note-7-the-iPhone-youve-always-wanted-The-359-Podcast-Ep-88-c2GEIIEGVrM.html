brian it's seen at studios in New York
and today we are doing a very late
edition of the 359 podcast with Roger
ting Ben Fox Rubin and Jessica dual-core
good morning good afternoon morning
morning afternoon yeah morning somewhere
hey it's called it 359 cuz we're gonna
wrap up at 359 oh yes it actually could
work except that would drag on way too
long for us well what time is a 330 331
well it's been welcome YouTube to
another episode 359 where we're here
with special guest Jessica dual-core I'm
trying from San Francisco and our
resident expert on all things Samsung
will be devoting the entire show to
talking about the new Galaxy Note 7
that's the big flagship phone that's
launched a couple hours exception just
had a big event here in New York City at
the hammerstein ballroom hammerstine
Hammerstein Christine and so we'll be
talking about that if you have any
questions as always leave them in the
comments section Brian will will pick
out the best ones will try our best to
answer them and you guys were at the
event yes and I was watching like a
schlemiel yeah on the live stream so
yeah must have been nice actually yeah
part of it was pretty cool so when they
announced the galaxy s7 in Spain they
had this like boxing ring type setup
where it was a cube and everybody SAT
around it yeah which was kind of fun
right it was like theater square yeah
and then today they couldn't do that
because it was just a traditional
everyone sits forward bitter but they
used this the floor space yeah so they
used like the back screen and then it
seemed like there was a second screen on
the ground okay yeah they they took out
a lot of the front row seating so they
kept it all kind of flat they put in I
think like led small LED plates or
whatever that allowed it to kind of
broadcast digital like LED images from
the floor well so that it all kind of
work together like when there was like a
picture in the note on the big screen of
the city you get the full cityscape on
the floor where you were sitting no no
we're like basically the floor space of
the state the stage yeah yeah we cool I
saw like this is a balcony yeah we
actually had the whole wheel yeah we
were told to send the balcony were like
why that's not the front where we wanna
be the front row get close to the
products and it's because they want us
to get the full perspective of the stage
what school which was really cool was
that yeah as a stage it took me a little
while to figure out they were like LED
lights it's like linearly and actually
like broadcasting it are they like the
spotlight Wow but it was actually it was
done very well hey I thought more
pressing on ya know they announced
afterwards that that actually was a
phone that doesn't don't ain't actually
you just you just have a truck to take
it with you at all times or maybe it was
a bunch of new 73 bottom and when you
walk alone like we often like crunch
them broke the screen it's like the true
test of Gorilla Glass 5 it's true body
weight Matt how's Kiki joke um should we
shall get started with actual podcast
yeah let's do it before we get carried
away yeah we'll get carried away
afterwards specially if you have any
questions about robot arm yes we're
gonna talk about robot arms as well
there's contacts it was at the Samsung
of that sure and Jess had a really good
time with it that's time too bad okay
nevermind let's let's get started all
right I can't see that from here so I
don't know is some sort of indication
like one of these when we're gonna wrap
up okay for this just whatever robot arm
him yeah robot arm I'll just do this
fine um just remember is set to five
minutes into those informant podcast I
still want the alarm to ring up on meds
I think it'd be funny if it did sure
dd-did all right Brian whenever you're
ready all right we got audio Roland take
away in three two welcome to the 359
when we talk about the top tech news of
the day and all you have the crap we
want to throw in I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben
Fox Rubin and with us is special guest
Jessica dual core hey guys don't kullu
she comes all the way from SF to talk
about galaxy note 7 yeah big big
announcement from Samsung just a few
hours ago it's why we're taping a little
bit late we were at the event um see but
you guys were sorry there yeah yeah
the cool kids were there so that's all
that matters hahaha well let's so let's
talk about the galaxy note 7 it's it's
Samsung's latest flagship phone Ches why
should people care about okay well
that's a great question basically this
is the most powerful phone of the year
that Samsung makes it's been like this
for a while you've got the s7 series and
that comes out in the spring and then
Samson caps it all off just in time for
holiday and in time to battle Apple yep
with the you know all of the most
impressive specs that it can get on this
phone that has something that no other
phone does which is stylist okay there
are a couple other phones that have it
but right it's no good this one is
actually pretty good and it's it's like
a beautiful device there's this coral
blue color which is like they're exactly
you know at the end of the day you're
not probably not gonna buy a phone for
the color right where I I wouldn't I you
put on a nice to buy a phone for a color
yeah it's got a case that has its own
state although it is waterproof so maybe
I don't need a case for and so is the
pen right so so as an update from last
year's note 5 it gets all of the things
that the Galaxy S series already has so
it gets a better camera with low light
photography faster processor etc so let
me jump in there cuz been had a confused
look last year's was the note 5 issues
is the note said no that wasn't a
mistake it wasn't mistake they skipped a
number to keep things in line but they
also they explained that it was based
off of the s7 platform so okay but if
you actually come on everybody forgets
about the note edge this is actually the
7th note phone you know about you oh
yeah yeah people do forget that Thun
because it's a terrible phone okay which
so you gave extremely high marks to the
s7 edge right that was an editor's
choice it came together that was a
five-star 72 yeah yeah you're excitingly
note 72 like also do just as well is
this one yes yes yes yes I sex it mmm
when it comes to like performance and
battery life and all that good stuff and
failing or passing our pool test like
yes I expect for that phone to do just
as well but then you're adding in the
extra pen elements so that has to
you know get its whole other you know
testing right does it do everything it
says you know or is there a problem
because it's very complicated and
there's all this extra software for it
right so the bigger question for me is I
mean you brought this up they're
bringing this thrown up in time for the
next iPhone is this going to be enough
to you know we take the crown because
last year in the fourth quarter Apple
actually took the phablet crown this is
the this is an area that Samsung has
dominated but Apple that last quarter
with the plus line was able to surpass
them so is this enough to get them back
on top not for true iphone fans it's
absolutely not and because I think if
you're gonna get the note you need to
like that pen right so it's not the
iphone that we want it um no because the
iphone is the iphone right so you always
have people who are going to fall into
that camp for whatever reason and and
you know it's it's a android as a
different universe right i think in some
ways it's a lot better i love the google
services sure but in other words in
other ways when it comes to that
absolute like craftsmanship of a device
yeah i believe as that nail and
partially because they control the
software and the hardware i would say as
an iphone 6s plus user thing features i
really want wireless charging waterproof
this is a phone with a larger screen but
a smaller body a significantly smaller
but looks really flick it's a nice phone
there's some nice being an apple guy
there there are some nice add-ons these
days to really make you consider
switching over right now so y know more
about these stories check us out and
seen it I'm rocker chain I'm Ben Fox
ribbon and I'm Jessica doll court thanks
for listening and we are clear on the
recording i'll start skimming the
comments sir I did it wow we're only
like 10 seconds sorry Jessica you got so
much you cram so much information I mean
you guys talk about our scanning I know
her the robot arm youtube about robotic
well yeah like did you want to look at
robot opening and then not mention it
like that would have been bad I don't
know you don't think we did no we did we
did we show so let's talk about the
robot arms Brian still flicked a robot
arm yes absolutely you've got was got
some robot arm footage this was outside
well this was in the Samsung event
side of the main stage this robot arm is
drawing or sketching images of people's
faces so what they did is they took a
picture of me um that's not that one
there's the second video those are all
just different replication different is
like losing okay okay not a Claire's
Jessica right there that is a disturbing
picture so they took a picture of me and
I thought that I would do something fun
so I went ah like smile here and like
little vaudeville right and I thought it
would just be different from like a
whole wall of smiling faces and that's
what I got I got like a black eye and
then just all these squiggles cuz it's
like the flowers in my dress and my hair
and it's like two curly what's going on
is gonna be your twitter profile so
obviously so basically I I broke the
robot machine super robot arm robot arm
is still probably pretty young right it
just felt so happy he did a really good
job I'm here thinking you're gonna have
to punch me in the face for me to look
like that though oh no I gonna be doing
out of the show's sliding is just a
sliding scale 40 I'm just I'm just
trying to be a nice Dada we first got in
it was drying like on a canvas yeah we
were this holding area before we got
into the the ballroom the audience the
actual reception room and that was the
only thing that was keeping our
attention because book of us jammed in
before the drinks in between yeah this
was a day with mixing cocktails it was
using the s pen right this was yes yeah
I'm stylish drying place on the galaxy
note 7 so a couple galaxies ago samsung
shut it off shut off the note with some
caricature artists who would sit there
and draw you and it took a really long
time this one takes about six minutes
you know it's using this sort of like
kind of rudimentary program and we're
going to do it they've got it now but I
thought I was kind of a cool way to show
off the capability yeah because that's
sort of like the deal with the note no
we tried the I tried a spin and I
thought it was actually pretty
responsive far more responsive than well
not far but us more responsive than the
last one they call better and better
yeah it felt almost like an actual pen
or pencil all right what about compared
to the pencil the Apple pencil who
tried the pencil absolutely have you
know it doesn't come bundled with the
device yeah oh boy Scott were like we'll
bring him in oh my god it's not yeah and
it isn't reversible hang on and Samsung
didn't I mean they didn't miss the
opportunity to take a jab at Apple
noting that this stylus comes with the
phone and right is free oh it's me
charging that it's gonna have a headset
oh yes audio jack yeah so that's not
interested that's where we've come today
in this smartphone my samsung was
definitely extra punchy I thought
through a little bit the show was
thankfully pretty fast yes it never got
to poori well there they're probably
feeling a bit of an upswing right like
their finances are moving up that's what
best quarter profits in two years so
thanks thinking about the mouth that's a
huge turn around last year there are a
lot of questions they had like seven
straight quarters of loss right so yeah
so we'll see if the node ends up doing
well for them yeah so Brian any
questions a lot of people are just
comparing it to the s7 calling it the
big brother of the s7 how do you how do
you take that yes silly like the Big
Brother with like 20 more muscles and
skills great oh I don't know if it's
that much better it does other stuff
this is maybe i would i would describe
yeah you know I'm kind of like your big
brother in that way yeah muscle and more
scale oh you talking about Roger you're
really talking about me I hold it I
don't think you want to bring stop into
this uh well you've already broached the
subject of getting face punched yeah
probably be like Seth will get you to
your point yes it's got a stylist it's a
virus scanner yeah okay so the things
that are different like oh there are
gestures in the camera it's got an iris
scanner that you're not really ever
gonna use is your main unlock screen oh
it's blah blah blah like the thing is
it's gonna be more expensive I haven't
fully reviewed this yet but my feeling
is if you don't want it the pen and if
you're not going to use it then don't
bother getting a note get that
yeah if you want the curved screens
because this one how you want let's
let's talk about the price actually
because carriers have come out the
pricing is 850 a tmobile 880 at eighteen
t Verizon Sprint have them had prices
out yet but you imagine it around the
same price that's that's pretty
expensive that's a starting price right
i mean this grant is only one model but
that's a lot for a phone right it's a
lot for phone and then you look at the
one plus three which is four hundred
bucks and you're like I invite to all
right goodbye when the serum lets just
hear ya uh we got a question related uh
what's the trade in situation gonna be
like oh let's go question for for what
for like so specifically somebody's
asking if they can trade in their note 5
and get a discount on no setup sure yeah
you're drinking yeah I mean that's not
same thing you even have an article on
Cena called how to recycle your phone
for cash there you go you mean the best
bets to sell it yourself really chardy
gonna do a carrier he's not really gonna
get the best value no but it's been like
how much effort you want to put it true
you're gonna be the preseason standing
at the craigslist corner waiting for
somebody to like turn it on and decide
if they want i think wow they can't be
do not mean you're held on ebay yeah you
could do it on anything what about best
buy uh saving same jail yes train you're
not gonna get the huge value it's more
convenient though it took me in thanking
beautif card yeah and you can use that
to another phone the same thing with
your career i mean if you're gonna go in
there to pick up the phone anyway and
you want like one and done or you've got
limited time like it's better than
nothing's better than having an advice
Mulder around being said you're probably
gonna get it somewhere close to half the
price if you sell it directly to
somebody else you're always going to get
more money yeah and especially with the
types of these phones even if it's two
years old it could be the difference of
like more than a hundred dollars yeah so
you it could benefit you and I'd
actually put in a little bit more work
when selling a phone i sold a phone
recently in an iphone 5c on ebay and
they sell really really quickly so yeah
I feel like I don't fight though because
the note series is kind of specialized
and selective I feel like I wouldn't be
surprised if the s7 sold more and better
because it's more of a mass-market
device that when people would want so
the know
is more expensive right in terms of
being able to find a buyer I would
imagine it's much easier to sell an SS
in general I think it's easier sell
iphones like I think I don't know I
don't know what but you're absolutely
easiest yeah what there's always gonna
be someone who wants to buy the iphone
yes not sure retain their values better
than any other Samsung is number two
yeah well I know too much about this
Xavier wants to know why is the battery
smaller than the s7 edge Oh barely it's
barely smaller um that's a great
question i think it's honestly that oh
no others gonna hate this form factor
it's the icing on their story no just
just so scared don't say you just say
Jerry say it and Rogers dead my partner
Jessica all right you know she makes a
really fair point they were able to
squeeze in the same size screen in a
smaller body larger than edge as larger
than edge the screens large India your
resources to power right so yes there
had to be some trade-offs I frankly that
because the battery the battery
difference isn't that huge getting into
a body that's that small that feels
better in your hand then well my iphone
6s plus is it's it's pretty interesting
it's an impressive accomplishment yeah I
mean to be honest like all of these
phones no matter how long the battery
life is you're still gonna charge it
every day yeah they've actually got a
cool accessory a wireless charging some
backing plate that it hooks into it it's
charges wirelessly so you don't they'll
plug it in nice yeah yeah there I have a
standard actually at my office and you
just kind of like lean it up against it
and it's so easy but you have to pay for
it if you want it okay market it doesn't
come and old I think bundled would be
great because I think it would kind of
convert people more people to wireless
charging I'm like really excited about
where I'll is charging George wants to
know what you think about the OS
appearance what the overall look yeah I
like the tweets of TouchWiz write what
they know they have an accident call
TouchWiz by the way cuz like I feel like
TouchWiz yeah so the the code name was
grace and during my briefing I heard an
exact call it grace for a second before
he corrected himself is like a hawk
confirmed
but yeah what you think of it it's gonna
be tweaked it around or the colors are a
little bit softer yeah I think like the
like the settings menu is just kind of
like less crowded so they used to throw
every single option setting everywhere
and then you're like ah because it's
like look how powerful we are Samsung we
have everything but now it's just like
buried buried buried buried which is
that's nice it's nice unless they want
you to discover it I think it's more
there for the people who already know
about it and use it or pretty who love
to dive into the settings and like kind
of discover for themselves but I would
say it's a nice change like TouchWiz
could not change fast enough yeah I
review a lot of Samsung phones and this
is not Samson's fault but I am so tired
of looking at the door no ass like I
needed to change yeah so it happens when
you look at the same anything no I agree
i mean i have an essex edge and I'm kind
of sick of staring you that phone yeah i
mean like we could change the wallpapers
in the launchers and yeah maybe I call
the less though it just yeah but one
thing that I do like so a lot of people
are diehard you know like pure Android
experience I'm Nexus and things like
that but honestly there are certain
things that you can get with the skin
that you can't get with pure Android and
then Google takes that and incorporates
it never he's like oh this is this great
feature right but they hated it when it
was bloatware somewhere else I you know
there's a limit but sometimes it's nice
sometimes they are nice like click the
access toggles that you can get to in a
drop-down I knew that Google doesn't
have really it sounds like they're
getting closer to that happy medium
right because it really did sound like
it was blow we're a couple of years ago
yeah and now the i am doing a much
better job with their tweet I mean they
had just remember like the previous
iterations they have their own
translator program SEF Google's like
that Google's on top of it as well as
their own why did they need that no one
really does they can do it right there a
tech ops voice yeah yes like yes
everything oh yeah yeah yes Zachary has
all of it sorry Brian Zachary wants to
know about the speed he just asked which
is faster and Zachary you can correct me
or specify if you want but I'm assuming
he's referring between the seven and the
edge which one performs faster or maybe
the seven and the current iphone I don't
know if you could give a compare
contrast about
and while you're at he's also curious
about the durability so maybe you could
go over the water resistant I've flag
shed what Gorilla Glass 500 yes well Wow
break the phone tell you because I just
managed to break like every other phone
or robot arm like um in terms of the
performance speed I mean all the s7
phones have the exact same this note
said it'll be just as fast as the s7 the
s7 quad-core Snapdragon 820 and it was
good you know but the question is also
like how responsive is it when you add
the pen features in because that real
world stuff is different yeah right you
know and that could cause lag eNOS um if
it wasn't perfected right but they keep
building so generally it should be good
against the iphone I mean we're gonna
wait yeah that's hard to say yeah it's
unfair thing to measure it against last
year's iPhone will probably wait for
this year's and also I mean clock speed
wise i mean iphone doesn't really Ranma
clock speed matter or less to the iPhone
because it's right stitch together
software hardware yeah and we can run
video like drain Testament but still if
one phone is more optimized for video
than the other but the other one like
that is an optimized last see longer
like where does that get you but well
yeah we'll definitely run those tests
once the new iPhone comes out well we'll
let you know and once we actually get a
new seven yes we still actually don't
have a no 17 house we've had some time
with it um you know so far I came away
pretty impressed so did user ability
yeah I was actually gonna mention that
because I've been getting into the pool
with a lot of phones lately yes sir only
the pools push to the pools yes it's
it's funnier the more you watch me
getting Christian to a pool it's great I
agree I yeah so Samsung has these phones
rated ip68 that supposed to last up to
30 minutes in five feet of water and
there was this issue with the s7 active
that Consumer Reports found and they're
like actually didn't work and so we're
like well let's rerun it you know we did
it like a like a bucket in a vase but
let's do it in a pool in deeper water
right
so we did and then it killed two of the
phones and Samsung's like oh no what
happened and they said that they found
this flaw unlike this first run batch
like it was a manufacturing error and
they fixed that which I think means like
a couple people caught fire Mamie I
don't know don't quote me I'm also
speculate probably early early adopters
of the active might want to check about
their phones yeah there's a warranty but
it'd be nice if Sampson kind of like
recalled all those and you just gave you
new and so you never had to worry but we
did the test again and we did it with
the s7 and s7 edge and all three phones
past one pool dunking so hopefully this
is the same and hopefully there aren't
problems because it's got like a more
similar body than the active which was
plastic right so I feel like they're
probably used to it and then now they're
on extra high alert because of the ass
of an active flaw how much time have you
had with Gorilla Glass 5 you went to
that event right um actually I did not
go to that it meant but Vanessa good the
nesa hand went and shot a cute video I'm
sure they're quite durable and shiny I
mean here's the thing you've got edges
on a phone those are flaws those are
automatic weak points yeah so if you're
gonna get this phone get a case try to
get a screen protector I don't know if
they're doing molded screen protectors
that go around the sides but at least
you can get one for the flat right and
then if your case kind of like hugs the
shoulders then you know that's better
than nothing to say and that's the case
the cases they have don't really hug the
sides there's a side protection really
known that Samsung's but there are a
bunch of brands that make pretty good
cases like sketch um spec okay so there
you go even though they promised some
durability I would prob Jessica
recommends getting in case if you're
gonna pay almost a thousand dollars for
to me yeah I wouldn't shoot a case
that's true what's a little more did you
spend any time with audio could you
critique anything about sound and
headphones um I actually don't have
anything I can say about that I enough I
imagine it's exactly the same as the
SMSF yeah edge so somebody is interested
in pre ordering my best advice is to go
to a store and try it see see for
yourself because Samsung's really not
going to change any of that and they
didn't talk about changing any of it so
it's going to be this in what about the
security and the iris scanner how are
they yeah well it's chair
you mean that's the big thing it's the
the big new addition I mean I try the
iris scanner works pretty quickly it's
not something I don't think you'd use it
every day as your normal unlock method
like constantly stand at your phone just
seems kinda stupid it's not as natural
as putting your finger on the phone but
I can't see it as you know an extra
layer of protection if you have a secure
folder as they as they tell secure
folder in your phone where you've got
personal documents driver's license
whatever that was their usage that's our
you see that something so you've already
unlocked it with your thumb print and
this is it's a second layer sound the
idea is like of security over if you
hand over your phone your friends they'd
be able to look at photos you'd be able
to browse the web but they couldn't
access that secure folder right cuz I
have new pictures of myself on my phone
or your being statement we didn't really
need to know that bank statements make a
lot more sense oh I'm you said passport
yeah we have you would have for my
iphone i have to do touch ID a second
time to get into my banking app so yeah
same here yeah yeah i think it would be
nice and i haven't tested this but i
think it would be nice if you could just
have like a bunch of different security
measures sort of and like the one that
you picked is the one that works like if
you held the phone up to your eyes
that's not very secure but it would be
more challenging it is i mean i've
looked at talked to a couple of scary
experts and iris scanning is more secure
than a fingerprint scan no except we
talked about the sweat glands right was
that you know II so lives it was it was
Qualcomm like a year plus ago okay um
they were using they were testing out
some sort of like sonic mm-hmm WC last
year yeah I thought beforehand and they
said that it detected like it read not
just your print but actually like mapped
your sweat pores underneath so if
somebody were to cut off your finger
though and try to like use your finger
apparently when that happens um your
sweat glands will kind of constrict so
they wouldn't be able to do it so it's
this like biometric mapping that goes
deeper into your actual tissue without
of course harming you but that means
that somebody wouldn't be able to just
take like a gummy bear print either
right manufacturer plastic ones right
have to know your unique physiology
basically every mission emboss
they would never have had but that said
that was a Qualcomm that was a Qualcomm
tech that wasn't the tech that's being
used right now correct so yeah those are
a lot easier to fool unfortunately so
anyways we're running out of time it got
a rep things up any last questions Brian
how about customization how would how do
you feel about the customization options
as far as the operating system and the
phone goes I don't think it's changed
much from the last version right there
will be wallpapers there will be a few
themes I think people who are more like
die hard about it will want to kind of
ROM their own right and which is a
little riskier you should only do that
if you know what you're doing right and
but they haven't added anything new this
is not like Motorola where you can
attach different mods and covers it's
going to be like everything else if you
want to splash out with a new cover then
you just have to find somebody who's
going to make one yeah alright let's
wrap things up but if you liked anything
