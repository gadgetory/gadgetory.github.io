welcome to the Apple buy for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
and before we start you know we just
wanted to send out our thoughts and love
to Las Vegas in Puerto Rico and the
recovery in Houston and Florida like
come on we are lucky we got to talk
about tech and have fun with it but
we're also aware of what's going on
around us and we wanted to emphasize the
importance of having some perspective
here so let's get to it onto the show
everyone is trying to take a slice of
the apple pie this week Sonos debuted
their new Sonos one smart speaker with
alexa integration and google just
dropped their all new lineup of products
now apples home pod is coming by the end
of the year but they should honestly be
worried about the Google home max like
did you see this thing it's bigger and
badder it automatically Tunes to the
room like the home pod it has the
smarter Google assistant and that thing
can be placed on its side or stood up
vertically and supports dual speakers as
well now the only advantage Apple has is
on price the Google max home is $50 more
but the home max literally just did an
emoji poopoo on the home pod before it
even comes out and you don't have to be
an Apple fanboy to admit this it's just
better now there's still a lot of follow
up to the latest Apple releases and no
it does not include any software updates
to my iPhone or your iPhone after iOS 11
continues to absolutely destroy our
batteries now Mixpanel says iOS 11 is at
a 39 percent adoption rate now but it's
embarrassing come on with the bugs
crashes and alignment issues people are
still seen like I can confidently say
it's the buggiest
iOS release to date and they still
haven't done anything to address the
battery issues so forget a bad apple now
it is plain rotten
gross now iOS 11 point 0.25 ohm
crackling issue we talked about that
last week but a small but increasing
number of iPhone 8 plus users are
dealing with this a bursting iPhone due
to a potential lithium-ion battery
failure that's causing the iPhones
casing to expand and burst open now
Apple is aware and investigating the
issue but it's nothing widespread here
so it won't be getting a name like
battery gate that should actually be
reserved for iOS 11 and you know what
how many of you are so mad you're ready
to switch phones right now any of you
know okay yes that's me - all right one
fix that is welcome especially for me
watch OS 4.0 point one is out for the
Apple watch series three and promises to
fix the LTE handoff issues that have
plagued the LTE versions when they're
near recognized public Wi-Fi networks
that won't work with the Apple watch so
thank you for getting this out quickly
and that deserves a good Apple ya see
I'm a nice guy - now we talked about
this issue specifically in our Apple
watch review and you should see some of
the suggestions I offered to make it
better but it's also where I received
some great feedback like this
Brian Tong the only male tech reviewer
who doesn't look hella awkward running
in these latest Apple watch reviews I'll
take that now rest cereal asks why do
you keep it so loose and Kev vocab says
sometimes you are annoying Bryant but
this time you are not thanks I guess
alright Apple has received approval from
the FCC for the iPhone 10 ahead of its
October 27th pre-order passing all the
requisite tests and is cleared for sale
where many of us will not be getting it
in the first few weeks because of the
crazy demand so who wants to wait in
line with me actually I meant for me
also a report by kpi's Ming Chi quo says
the functionality and user experience of
the true depth camera in the iPhone 10
will take its Android competitors up to
two and a half years to replicate that's
a long time and that's also if
Android phones want to replicate it
because last time I checked a
fingerprint is still faster but it also
means it will take about two and a half
years for Android to come out with an
emojis something really we're taunting
Android users about exclusively
available on the iPhone 10 now DxO mark
has become one of the go-to sources for
camera rankings for our phones because
our phones are cameras on its release
state the iPhone 8 plus took the top
spot in TXO marks rankings for the best
camera in a smartphone with a 94 overall
now that score is now shared with the
Galaxy Note 8 S dual lens camera as well
but both of them were just toppled by
the new Google pixel 2 that received an
overall DxO mark score of 98 like 98
that leaves the iPhone 10 to either tie
or earn the highest score ever when it
comes out on November the 3rd all right
Mac rumours was able to confirm that
Apple corporate employees are testing
apples person a person Apple pay feature
internally it's in the iOS 11.1 update
with a special device certificate that's
being distributed only to employees now
these screenshots confirm a little bit
about how the feature will look like
within the messages app to allow for
quick money transfers it's still unclear
when we'll see the public lunch
all right let's announce our winners
from last week's Belkin charge Rockstar
adapter giveaway contest we asked you to
tell us what character was on my t-shirt

correct answer was Marvel's mad Titan
