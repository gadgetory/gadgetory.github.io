Harmony lead
it's the latest high-end quicker to use
Logitech's best-in-class control system
and its main extra feature is a
touchscreen the big roomy touchscreen is
a cool looking extra in practice its
main benefit is the ability to show
individual channels you select as
favorites so you can jump there directly
instead of having to remember the
channel number and punch it in the
screen also allows you to show more
activities devices and functions than
the hard buttons on the standard Harmony
remote new for this year the screen
gives a little jolt of force feedback
when you select items another advantage
over lower end harmony remotes is full
backlighting behind every key the elite
comes with a charging stand and Logitech
claims a 20% increase in battery life
but that's not a huge deal in most
living rooms that will spend most of its
time in the included charging cradle
another benefit of the cradle that it
provides a convenient home for the
remote instead of getting lost in the
couch cushions I complain about the
button layout of the older touchscreen
Harmony's but this one is better with
the main play pause rewind keys where
they should be grouped with the others
their motives on the large size but
convenient to hold with a very nice feel
and my thumb easily reached every key
without too much of a stretch otherwise
the elite is very similar to the Harmony
home control the screen 'less version
that cost significantly less both use
the ingenious hub to control your
devices via infrared Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
and the system is set up by the
convenient harmony app of course the app
can also be used to control your devices
for times when you misplace the remote
or you just want to use a phone or
tablet instead and just like the home
control the elite can also command many
smart home devices including lights
thermostats and blinds in addition to
your a V equipment overall the less
expensive home controls a better choice
for most people but if you really want
the screen or you just want the best
harmony available go with the elite I'm
