traditional home security system maybe
have a nice big place filled with all
the cool gadgets that Cena has convinced
you to buy over the years but for the
rest of us paying to have a security
system installed isn't worth the money
for renters is pretty much impossible
Donal Bell and in this top five I'm
counting down the best of the new breed
of do-it-yourself home security systems
handpicked by CNET associate editor
Reich wrists starting things off at
number five opt length security triple
shield $350 gets you a deluxe package of
two night-vision cameras and a
smattering of motion sensors and contact
sensors and panic sirens there's also
$199 version that tosses out the cameras
but without the creepy thrill of night
vision what's the point
the real downside here is a monthly fee
$19.99 a month for someone who has a
hard time parting with eight dollars a
month for Netflix $20 is a hard pill to
swallow at number four viper home sounds
like an animal planet reality TV show
but it's actually a more affordable
alternative to a plink the system starts
at $229 and requires no monthly fees
however if you actually want to stream
your home security camera to your
smartphone that's going to cost you
$9.99 a month still a better price and
uplink and if that name sounds familiar
this is the same Viper famous for their
car alarms so not only will you get an
app to monitor your home but also keep
track of your car coming in at number 3
I smart alarm $199 for the basic package
of sensors and alarms or $350 for a
system with a video camera it's not
cheap but there are no monthly fees with
the system that's huge you press that
out over years and you're saving
hundreds of dollars now we weren't
thrilled with a video camera the extra
$150 that it will cost you expect to
spend untold amounts of your patience as
well getting it to run smoothly overall
though the system is a great value with
a range of features that rival even the
subscription options at number two
simply safe as much as I hate the idea
of a monthly fee this one might be worth
it
or
nine months to get this thing up and
running but that fee pays for a security
firm to monitor your home 24/7 so if the
alarm goes off a human being will
actually give you a call and if
necessary call the police now you won't
find that feature on any of these other
systems now for the upfront hardware
cost there are a range of packages
ranging from $229 for the starter kit
all the way up to a five hundred $19
deluxe system but for all the simply
safe packages none of them offer a
security camera then again I'm not sure
if I want a security firm to have a
night vision view of what goes on in my
house so that brings us to our number
one choice for DIY home security Piper
this one is a $239 all-in-one system
with a built in camera and no fees it
monitors temperature and humidity motion
light and sound it has a built in 105
decibel siren that is painfully loud and
my favorite feature two-way audio
communication if someone breaks into my
place to steal my things I want to be
able to have a conversation with them or
at least have the pleasure of insulting
them in real time so there you go five
DIY home security systems that are
affordable enough to give anyone's an
extra peace of mind for more information
