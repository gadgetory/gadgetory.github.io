bringing you guys the LG rumor reflex
from Sprint now this is a feature phone
that has a slide-out QWERTY keyboard and
a three inch display at 240 by 400
pixels it isn't the most vibrant or
sharpest of displays but the screen
itself is pretty responsive I was able
to scroll through menu items and click
on links really easily even texting
without the use of the physical keyboard
is fine but it can get a little
difficult because the screen is small if
you want to text or write a lot the
slide-out keyboard is definitely the way
to go the buttons pop out a little so
they're easy to feel and there's little
resistance when you press them my one
concern is that the keys are small I
already have petite hands but I still
felt that everything was a little
cramped other things I liked about the
device was that it's pretty light and
compact for a slide-out phone the
handset can be slow at times the
processor is only 480 megahertz which is
fine when you want to do basic stuff
like make calls or send texts but if you
want to surf the web or start using a
camera it can get it a little laggy
speaking of the camera it's only 2
megapixels but there's a shortcut button
on the side that will open the feature
up if you're interested the rumor reflex
on Sprint will cost you $30 after you
sign a two-year contract and send in a
$50 mail-in rebate if you don't want to
commit yourself for that long the device
is also available on Boost Mobile for
$79.99 again I'm Lin from Cena bringing
you guys the LG rumor refunds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
