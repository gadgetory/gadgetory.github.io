should face Brock Lesnar before he
leaves runes are floating around that
current WWE Universal champion Brock
Lesnar could be headed back to the UFC
to fight John Jones now Lesnar has a
history of leaving wrestling so here are
a bunch of wrestlers who could benefit
the most from facing Lesnar before he
bolts again at number five Big E do I
need to explain why II and Lesnar would
work Big E is a powerhouse and he is
great on the mic the exchanges of the
new day could have with Lesnar's
mouthpiece Paul Heyman would be quite
amusing to say the least this could also
be a good way for Big E to show a more
serious side as he attempts to take on a
beast of a human being at number four
Baron Corbin I'm not saying I want to
see this match but I think it could do
wonders for Baron Corbin the Corbin
character cares about nothing but
himself
The Legend of characters just there for
a paycheck for this to make Corbin a
star Corbin would have to do some
serious damage to Lesnar during a match
a win could put Corbin in an elite
company and number three is schinsky
Nakamura Nakamura and Lesnar have faced
off in New Japan Pro Wrestling however
that was before Nakamura found his
current rock star like persona
Nakamura's hard-hitting style is a great
match for a monster like Brock Lesnar
the two could beat the hell out of each
other and we'd all win for seeing such a
match and number two AJ Styles Styles is
possibly the best wrestler on the planet
and can pull great matches out of anyone
this is a match I'd love to see on
whatever stage styles could probably be
the only wrestler on this list who could
easily absorb a loss without taking too
much of a hit in popularity or
credibility before we get to number one
let's talk about two independent
wrestlers who could have great matches
with Lesnar there's Jeff KUB if you
don't know his name you might have seen
him on lucha underground playing matanza
cobb is also a former Olympic wrestler
and as we've seen in the past
Olympians work well with Lesnar then
there's Matt riddle he's a former UFC
fighter and an excellent pro wrestler
with a realistic style hmm so is Lesnar
that could probably work on to number
one and the number one wrestler who
should face Brock Lesnar is Finn Balor
this match has to happen for Fowler to
become a true star
Balor has a built-in storyline as well
he never lost the universal championship
and Lesnar happens to have it Balor is
definitely on the smaller side of
athletes on this list however Lesnar
could make his offense look credible
finn b√°lor looked like he was being
positioned to be the top star on Monday
nights but then he got injured Balor
needs this match and out of everyone
else I mentioned he needs the win the
most a wrestler can make a career out of
saying I'd beat Brock Lesnar if there's
anyone else you think should be on this
list let me know
I'm a daya's on Twitter and I'll see you
online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
