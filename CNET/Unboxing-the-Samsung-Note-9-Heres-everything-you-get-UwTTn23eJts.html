Samsung Galaxy Note 9 or more
specifically we are going to on baguette
I have just gotten back to the CNN
office from the Samsung Note line the
launch event I don't even know what's in
this bag so we're gonna do this together
alright first thing we have is a rugged
protective cover with kickstand for the
samsung galaxy note 9 it is drop tested
to military standard this is not gonna
come in the box for everyone this is
just sort of a special gift bag for
reviewers but still kind of cool to see
this if you get this phone you know this
is a case you might want to buy next we
have ooh the wireless charger do okay
I'm gonna put the phone there is the
phone in here I don't even know which
color I got but let's take a look at
this wireless charger duo first so this
was something that Samsung announced on
stage and is a brand new wireless
charger because of course the note 9
does support wireless charging but
Samsung also announced a galaxy watch so
this is going to basically give you the
capability to charge two devices at the
same time it could be two phones it
could also be the phone and a SmartWatch
like the Galaxy watch so we're gonna
just open this here so I don't know that
much about the charger I didn't see it I
know it sells in black and white and
that it's got a 15 watt charging output
I also know that there's a stand okay
here we go
he's got it in white clearly so this is
the platform I was mentioning before it
says fast charge on here wireless
charger duo I don't really know what's
in here its Quick Start Guide hey this
is the charging cable so this is
adaptive fast charging this is basically
what comes in the box and to charge this
guy app because you don't charge the
charger that's what you plug into the
wall so you would plug this portion into
the wireless charger
and then you plug in the wall charger
and that's what gives us power is there
anything else in here nope and we don't
need this we need this we don't need
this okay so there is a plastic film on
the top and all around it and all right
so what we're looking at ultimately
there's a little plastic on the sides
here - I don't like that stuff let's get
rid of it all right so what we're
looking here again this is compatible
with any device that is a Qi enabled so
that's pretty much all of them these
days okay I've gone ahead and I've
charged this up just so you can see what
it's supposed to look like
again this is an aftermarket wireless
charger that you would have to buy
yourself it doesn't come when you buy
the no-date so I've got the galaxy s 9
plus and we set it down and voila it
charges and if we put it down on this
fast charging space there we go
works perfectly I think it's time to
unbox the note 9 now don't you so let's
see is there anything else in this bag
no just a great little tote bag okay so
I don't oh I dunno what color I have
because we've got the yellow pence this
means this is the ocean blue color with
the contrasting yellow pen there are
three other note 9 colors as well when
it's just basic black we've got sort of
like this metallic copper color and then
we have lavender purple I did see that
one and it was really pretty too but
this is the one that's definitely gonna
stand out so we've got the shiny yellow
S Pen on the front I've got the 128
gigabyte version there's also one with
512 gigabytes of storage which was
absolutely huge and it costs a lot more
and then we've got this sort of blue
color on the outside so a samsung boxing
has been pretty staid lately so it's
nice to see that they're doing something
a little bit more interesting and unique
that speaks to the phone design let's
see here we go there's a little arrow
that shows you this is the way to unbox
it just opens up I just want to do that
again that's just nice so we've got that
blue accent colour as well inside of the
box really makes you feel like there's a
cohesive unit to this phone we've got
the very typical SIM card ejector
tool eject pin and some information
about the phone very little I think it's
actually oh yeah there's a little bit
more information about the phone in here
just kind of tells you how to set it up
all right now time to tip out the note 9
here it is I'm gonna come back to this I
want to see what else is in the Box
first so far pretty typical of the
Samsung boxes we've got adaptive fast
charging we've got a USB connector tool
ooh
open up this little compartment there
are a bunch of goodies in here we've got
our charging cable USB C AKG headphones
these look actually a little bit shinier
than what I got in the box with the s9
plus of course the note 9 has a
headphone jack so you'll be able to plug
that right in and it looks like there
are volume controls on these headphones
to put the earbuds off to the side this
is usually as Samsung says it's $100
value and what else I've got some little
mini Clippy things and some different
earbud
ear tip sizes and
that is that is it that is literally
everything okay so here we have the note
nine and everybody's favorite part
pulling off this plastic which comes in
two different parts so already when I'm
holding the note nine I see the color
this ocean blue color seeping around the
edges around this black screen and it
looks really cool and got lots of like
rich deep color on taking the sticker
off the back I don't like those either
Oh a lot of stickers here let's get all
these guys off so we can appreciate but
the actual phone looks like these
stickers of course are to protect the
finish while the phone is being shipped
okay so this is pretty much what your
note 9 will look like completely out of
the box and there is that contrasting
bright yellow S Pen and when you write
on the screen in this specific mode your
ink your digital ink will turn up yellow
the same color is this S pen's here okay
so here is the Galaxy Note 9 next to the
samsung galaxy s 9 + same cameras set up
but the note 9 is a slightly bigger
phone we've got many more Galaxy Note 9
videos coming down the line including a
full review so stay tuned and thanks for
