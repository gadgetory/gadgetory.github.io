the young scholar and not with something
dorky like dinner at that surf and turf
place you like now get him some tech and
a gift card in a food truck I can't help
with the ladder but i do have five great
pieces of gear that won't kill your
budget nor have them turning and rolling
their eyes after they thank you here we
go number Five's like falling off a log
the roku LT streaming media box this
little guy streams full screen video
over broadband to any TV full screen TV
shows and movies only cost like fifty
bucks we've love this product since the
day it came out it's got netflix and
hulu amazon HBO Go Pandora and other
music stations all of that but no itunes
support bear that in mind and it's best
for streaming services like those not
the best for streaming your kids
collection of pirated media it is Wi-Fi
only at this price point but that better
not be a problem or the grad needs to go
back and repeat tech 101 number four is
the samsung galaxy note you may have
heard of this one it's the device that
blurs the line between smartphone and
tablet a 5.3 inch HD screen that's
killer for media looks a little foolish
as a phone but remember they're not
gonna make any calls anyway just text
its 4g for great wireless data speed and
has a great 8 megapixel camera now the
size isn't for everyone and about the
cheapest we can find it right now is
around 560 unlocked number 3 the 11 inch
apple macbook air this is really the
only laptop anybody's gushing about
these days starting at around a grand
it's super thin instant-on has
tremendous battery life and it's now
much faster than last year's model and
by the way laptops are still a mainstay
even in the face of trendy or
smartphones and tablets okay check it
out number 2 i'm going to give this to
the klipsch image s4 earphones why do
these ranked so high because you can't
go wrong giving them I just solved a lot
of issues for you everyone needs good
earphones they work with whatever the
grad already owns these have the highest
score of anything on today's list
nine point oh and they're only 70 bucks
street including the prestigious klipsch
name this is great gift giving my number
one pick is at I don't get them a neck
tie this tie the newest apple ipad or an
amazon kindle fire yep i put them in the
same spot because not everybody can come
up with 500 to 800 30 bucks for an ipad
that's where the two-hundred-dollar
Kindle comes in so strong and no
apologies needed by the way the ipad is
the best tablet out there but the Kindle
Fire is different not categorically
worse and a lot of students still don't
have a tablet at all but I can assure
you they want one check out our entire
cnet guide to grads gift-giving at brads
