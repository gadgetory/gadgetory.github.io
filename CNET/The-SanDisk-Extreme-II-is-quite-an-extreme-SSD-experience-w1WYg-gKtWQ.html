something real extreme to show you and
by that I don't mean this extreme SSD
from Sandy's this one is oh so it's not
so extreme anymore instead I have at
this the extreme too so the state drive
that's right as the number goes this one
is about at least to have the extremity
of the other so let's see how extreme it
is now first take a look at the box this
is the box of the extreme two and this
is the box of the extreme obviously the
Box are extreme to is quite much larger
than that of the other in fact is
suspiciously large alright so let's see
what's on the inside oh here we go
there's not one not two but all three
capacity of the drive 120 gig to and 40
gig and port 80 gig and there's more
what is this here chocolate now this is
crazily extreme because how is that
Sandy's wrap my mind knew that I one
chocolate all the time now it's quite
clear that in order to receive this
large box with the extra on the inside
you have to be don't know which is too
late for most of you but even without
the box the extra drive are the
chocolate you can still enjoy the new
extreme to some state drive and that's
because in my testing the new dry was
very fast it was faster than the Oh
extreme drive as well as some other
high-end some state drive it's not the
fastest however but it also definitely
not the most expensive in fact it was
one of the most affordable high-end SSD
on the market and when it comes to SSD
the pricing is very important because
generally SSDs so much faster than
regular hard drive to the point that is
very hard to detect the different
between of themselves in table
performance and speaking of difference
take a look at this the new dr actually
thinner than the 01 is now only seven
millimeter thick and that means you can
use it in more application from desktop
to laptop to some ultrabook more value
for your money other than that this new
drive here is a standard internal drive
that support SATA 3 sick gigabit per
second but it also with all revision of
the
say to a standard for more information
on the drive check out the full review
said calm and to find out what I do with
chocolate well follow me on twitter
facebook or google+ you know what let me
tell you right away I light chocolate
because that's the best way to get to
the ladies most of the time it works
every time hey James you need this oh
you can thank me later and that's
because I'm don't know and this has been
the first look on how sweet being
extreme can be with the extreme to SSD
from sandisk pretty good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
