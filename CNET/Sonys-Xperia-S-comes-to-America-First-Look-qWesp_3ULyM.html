and today we're taking a first look at
the Sony Xperia S now some of you out
there may know that Sony announced this
phone back at CES in January 2012 at the
time I thought the Xperia S would never
officially make it to us Shores
remaining an untouchable global phone
available for purchase everywhere on the
planet except for the states well now
that has changed with Sony offering the
Xperia S for sale in America directly
through its online store with a sticker
price of 559 however the unlock phone
doesn't come cheap so what exactly does
this handset bring to the table first
off the Sony Xperia S looks striking it
comes in hues of white like the one I
have here and a more conservative black
it's design is also very futuristic with
a rectangular chassis chiseled in sharp
angles plus an illuminated clear bar
running along the phone's base in front
is a large 4.3 inch LCD screen with a
720p HD resolution above the display is
a 1.3 megapixel front facing camera and
notification light the left side holds a
micro USB port covered by a flap on top
is a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and
power button placed on back as the
phone's 12 megapixel camera with LED
flash sitting on the right side is an
HDMI port also under a flap along with a
trim volume rocker hair too is a
dedicated camera button which shutter
bugs will appreciate holding down the
button fires up the Xperia S has camera
even when the phone is asleep using the
button to wake the camera also
immediately snaps a picture for fast
capture you can disable this function
though if you just want to rely on the
button to jump to the camera the phone's
camera is snappy to capturing pictures
in under a second and there are lots of
scene and shooting modes to choose from
other worthy features include a
dual-core 1.5 gigahertz processor
driving the Xperia S is Android 40 Ice
Cream Sandwich operating system sony
also has loaded apps for its music
unlimited and video unlimited digital
storefronts they let you rent and buy
movies and TV shows plus
download and stream audio tracks right
from the device there are some things
that don't throw me about the Xperia S
its screen is not very impressive with
lower contrast and washed out colors
compared to other smartphones
performance feel sluggish too and the
screen doesn't respond as quickly or as
smoothly as I would like I'm Brian
