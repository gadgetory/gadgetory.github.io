Tommy and we're here with another
Challenger looking to take down the
iPhone 3GS in this prize fight ring
it's a heavyweight prize fight between
the number one contender of Google's
Nexus One and the reigning champion
Apple's iPhone 3GS and we put the Nexus
One through our real-world test so we're
bringing in our judges for this fight
senior editor 10 tournament associate
editor Nicole E and myself will do the
honors and we'll take all three judges
scores and average them out to the
nearest tenth each round the final
prizefight score will be an average of
all rounds using the same decimal system
so let's get this thing started
which phone says do me baby round one is
sexier the Nexus One is the sexiest
phone I've seen next to the iPhone it's
slightly slimmer with a solid feel and
it's Oh le D display is crisp and clear
the iPhone created a whole new level of
design that the Nexus One takes cues
from minimalist and clean with metal
accents after all this time it's still
been able to keep its sex appeal both
phones are beauties and we're calling
this round a tie at four point seven
control and user interface makes or
breaks the device next round of
navigation the Nexus one's touchscreen
interface was responsive for all of us
the trackball is nice even if you don't
really use it that much multi-touch is
here across multiple apps but the touch
controls below the screen weren't always
that responsive the iPhone 3GS has
perfected ease of use on a mobile device
I know it sounds corny but it just makes
sense navigating through the OS with
multi-touch present across apps like
maps web browsing and viewing your
pictures the iPhone 3GS takes this round
with a 4.7 and the Nexus One gets up for
after Avenue T round
the icon leads by just three tenths of a
point but there's plenty of fight left
next round is features both phones are
bringing 3G GPS Wi-Fi and Bluetooth but
if you're looking for a round for the
Nexus to shine this one is it there's
its unrivaled voice search sushi Google
Apps integration for mail contacts and
calendars multitasking and more
customization in the OS with widgets
plus a superior Maps app with
turn-by-turn directions it's also an
unlocked phone with an SD card slot and
a removable battery is that enough for
you
now the iPhone 3GS is no chump its App
Store is unmatched and has made it more
than just a phone it's cut copy and
paste is well executed but it still has
no multitasking capabilities and waiting
for flash support and its notification
system pops up and gets in the way the
judges all agree here
the Nexus lands a perfect 5 and the
iPhone 3GS gets a 4 next round is web
browsing and multimedia
the Nexus one has a quality mobile
browser we like it's multiple windows
icon view but it's still a step below
apples you'll have access to the Amazon
mp3 store its media player is still
pretty basic and I was really hoping for
more from Android 2.1 but it's 5
megapixel camera with flash out does the
iPhones now the iPhone Safari web
browser is still the best web experience
on a phone even without flash it also
has the best media player for music and
videos and its integration with iTunes
gives you access to tons of podcast TV
shows and movie content if 3 megapixel
camera is satisfactory but its video
capture how shines the Nexus one's the
iPhone 3G takes this round with a 4.7
and the Nexus One gets a 4 so after
averaging four rounds assholes lean has
been trimmed down to just one tenth of a
point does the Nexus One have any gas
left in the tank the final round that
decides it all is all quality we were
all impressed with the Nexus ones call
quality it sounded very clear and pretty
natural and the person on the other side
of the line said the same the iPhones
call quality is more than acceptable but
it's a step below the Nexus one with a
little more static and interferes and
yes we experienced the drop call in our
tests the Nexus 1 throws its last punch
and takes the final round 4.7 to 3.7 but
is it enough let's average out all 5
rounds and in a throwdown where the 3GS
jumped out early
the Nexus 1 kept Cline and scratching
and you could call it the comeback kit
because Google's Nexus 1 takes this
battle four point five to four point
four and is your prize fight winner both
of these phones are at the top of their
game but it was the Nexus ones features
and call quality over the iPhone 3GS is
navigation and multimedia experience
that put it over the top but really the
phone that ends up in your pocket is up
to you i'm brian tom thanks for watching
catch you guys next time on another
prize fight
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
