home that doesn't involve a cable or
phone company I'm Bridget Carey this is
your C net update right now to get
internet at home most people sign up for
some sort of wired broadband service to
be installed like something from your
cable or phone provider or you could
connect to a cellular network to get
online but there's a company that's
launching a whole new concept that cuts
out the cable and phone companies
it's called stary internet it uses
millimeter waves to send broadband to
your home at superfast speeds up to 1
gigabit which is 10 times the average
home broadband speed so what are
millimeter waves
it's what those Airport body scanning
machines use it's an extremely high
frequency so how much is this service
well no one knows the company is insane
but it is first being tested in Boston
this summer and you don't need the
service to try out a new friendly Wi-Fi
hub called starry station that cost
three hundred and fifty dollars and it
works with any internet service it has a
touchscreen with some real handy
controls you can see the health of the
connection speed which devices are
online even set parental controls the
promotional video for story plays on our
need for something simple because we are
always online even your toddler's on the
toilet with an iPad how can you control
them without this and don't you hate
cords what a mess internet life is
horrible
well the hubs start shipping in March if
you want to try it the company behind
this also has some interesting history
it's from the team that created Aereo
which faced legal drama when it
delivered local free over-the-air
broadcast television to homes through
the internet as a streaming video
subscription but Aereo is no more let's
see how starry shakes things up with
Internet service providers but your
internet world is going to change more
drastically in the near future
with Facebook the social network is
almost ready to kill the like button as
we know it and it's gonna launch
reactions which lets you respond to a
post with different emotions beyond just
a thumbs up it's been in testing for a
while now but a story published on
bloomberg has facebook saying that it
could launch in the next few weeks and
Microsoft wants to be part
the changing way you get your news
online Microsoft released a new app for
iPhones and iPads called news Pro it's
sort of like Apple news and Flipboard
you pick what news topics interest you
and you have to log in with Facebook or
LinkedIn accounts to get started because
it's trying to look at your profile to
see what topics you may want to read
about based on your job or what things
you post it's not perfect so like all
these newsreaders it takes some tweaking
that's it for this tech news update but
you can catch up on the latest at
cnet.com from our studios in New York
