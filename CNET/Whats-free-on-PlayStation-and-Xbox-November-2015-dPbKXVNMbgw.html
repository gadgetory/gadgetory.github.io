games to play of course if you're a
member of xbox live gold and/or
PlayStation Plus here's what's free in
November 2015 on xbox one Numa breath of
life is free all month long it's really
a clever first-person puzzle game baked
inside of a gorgeously crafted world
then starting on November 16 night squad
will be free until December 15-9 squad
plays like a classic gauntlet game with
up to 8 players at a time players can
get different weapons and power-ups in
the campaign or versus mode for xbox 360
dirt 3 arrives for the first half of the
month the rally car racer was highly
praised when it came out back in May of
2011 for the second half of November
xbox 360 owners can also play dungeon
siege 3 another game from 2011 but this
action RPG didn't get the same kind of a
claim but if you're into that medieval
fantasy genre should check it out ok
let's move across to Sony's free games
for the month of November up first is
the walking dead season 2 on ps4 to
choose your own adventure from Telltale
Games is probably this month's best
title so be sure to catch it before it
goes away also on ps4 is Magic a tu an
action adventure fantasy game that's
best played in co-op mode
on ps3 the classic space action RPG mass
effect 2 is available to can't believe
was released nearly six years ago also
on ps3 is beyond good and evil which is
actually a remake of a ps2 game that
first debuted in 2003 either way if
you've never had the pleasure of BG&amp;amp;E
well now is the time to do it a
brand-new roguelike action RPG is
releasing November third and it's also
available across all PlayStation
platforms it's called Dragon fin soup
which of course sounds gross but it's
really just a game where players must
start the entire game over once they die
and finally that PSP augmented reality
game invizimals remember that one no no
yeah well that's also free on Vita and
that I'll take care of all of November's
free games as always a caveat you do of
course need to be a member of
PlayStation Plus and xbox live gold to
access these free games and they cost a
little bit of money usually it's worth
it maybe not so much for this month but
i'll be back in december for a new list
of free games hopefully it's better than
this one we'll see you then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
