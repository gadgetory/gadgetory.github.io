went nuts over the idea of having five
gigabytes of portable storage it costs
$400 today you can fit a terabyte in
your pocket for a fraction of the cost
the hell with the cloud hard drives are
better cheaper faster and more portable
than ever and this top five were
counting down the best values and
portable drives ranked by CNET senior
editor dome no starting off at number
five the silicon power armor AAT not
only does this drive meet the spec for
military drop testing but it can also be
submerged in water for up to 30 minutes
500 gigabyte drive is about $80 but a
full terabyte can be had for just a
little extra at number four the Seagate
Go flex slim it's the only ultra slim
portable hard drive on the market at
0.35 inches thick it's basically the
size of an iPhone 4s the capacity maxes
out of 500 gigabytes for just under $100
so you're not getting an insane amount
of storage but Dan is that thing small
but number three goes even smaller if
the Lexar jumpdrive triton it's probably
been a while since you've been excited
about a thumb drive but this one's
pretty special it's the first one we've
seen that uses the USB 3.0 spec 70
dollars gets you 32 gigs and twice that
gets you 64 if you ever wanted to turn
your entire music library into something
small enough to be a choking hazard this
one's the way to go at number two the
Seagate backup plus this one's a great
all-around value in a one-stop solution
if the goal is to backup your computer
it can be made to work with USB 3.0
firewire or Thunderbolt the killer
feature for me is an automatic backup of
your Facebook and your Flickr photos and
finally our number one wallet friendly
portable drive is the WD my passport
portable sure it's not the thinnest
drive or the prettiest but it's a great
value and it's also the first portable
hard drive to offer up to two terabytes
of storage we're taking everything with
you and moving at the speed of USB 3.0
this is your best option for more top
fives like these head over to top-5
