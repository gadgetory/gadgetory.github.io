hi i'm molly wood and welcome to the
buzz report alright i'm trying people
I'm trying hi I'm Brian Cooley in for
Molly Wood on maternity leave welcome to
the buzz report first the gadget of the
week it's the package shark a brand new
device for opening these stubborn hard
to deal with plastic molded packages you
know the ones they're really stiff when
they refused to come apart until they
suddenly do package shark neatly opens
round ones small ones thick ones tall
ones even dr. Seuss books but if you
study their video on their website and
carefully parse the utter lack of any
detail it offers you come to a
depressing realization package shark is
a box cutter so keep opening these
molded packages the old-fashioned way
nothing wrong with it nothing going to
be wrong with it hmm now the news the
geneva auto show is underway and while
there are many important innovations
coming out of it i'm going to tell you
about this one because i think it makes
the best cocktail party conversation
it's BMWs new lane departure warning
system formerly known in their Munich
engineering center as their ass thumper
you see when you straight out of your
lane the car rattles your seat bottom
with what they call haptic feedback it's
a device built into the seat cushion the
vibration is meant to simulate that
ratatat tat attempt of those lane
divider dots before you actually drift
across the real lane divider dots and
kill somebody possibly yourself now
using tiny video cameras and image
processing software the car hopefully
we'll know when you intend to make a
lane change versus when it should turn
on this rum pum blur and warn you that
you're making one you don't want to make
otherwise you'd be beat into submission
by your car like some Teutonic
red-haired stepchild oh by the way in
California this technology is considered
sexual harassment and this is the year
when Sunday March 11th becomes the new
improved start of daylight savings time
now unlike that y2k deal a few years ago
which was kind of abstract and hand
with great aplomb by the IT community
this one is a very clear issue and as
the world in a fit and I think it's all
microsoft's fault peru's if you will the
support page that helps you update your
windows mobile device it makes James
Joyce seem approachable for example if
you connect your device directly to a PC
follow the instructions for windows
mobile users who connect to a pc to
synchronize if you do not synchronize
your device or a phone with a pc follow
the instructions for windows mobile
users who do not connect to their pc to
synchronize duh just buy yourself a
Rolex they're usually off an hour anyway
and with any luck the one you buy i'll
be off in the right direction and word
of new research hit my desk this past
week positing that America's kids are
actually doing homework much of the time
they're online you know I thought about
it and I can actually see that I can see
the kids nurturing the 3 R's online
reading how they'll crack iTunes drm
writing on myspace how they'll
decapitate their teacher and doing the
arithmetic of how many years they'll
serve for the above two offenses but
honestly the survey really showed a
refreshing candor on the part of
America's youth just nineteen percent
download music only fourteen percent use
email just nine percent instant message
and a scrawny five percent read blogs oh
and my calculation ninety-nine percent
will pull your leg until it dislocates
I'm Brian Cooley this has been the buzz
report thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
