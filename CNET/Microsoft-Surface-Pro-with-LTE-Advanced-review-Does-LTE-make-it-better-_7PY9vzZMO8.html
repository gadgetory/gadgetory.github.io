something we've seen before it's the
Microsoft Surface pro looks almost
identical to the one from 2017 that we
tested is identical with one big
difference this is the new consumer
version with an LTE antenna built in and
that means that you can get a cell phone
style data plan and get online anytime
from there Joe you tested this did you
find a big difference between this LTE
model and the regular Surface pro from
last year didn't notice the difference
in performance or in the form change in
it at all pretty much like the original
one so how did you get the SIM card
inside the inside of the system
um it's actually if I can move it it's
located right behind the kickstand and
it's right over here you take a little
typical you know cell phone push pin you
pop it out slides right in and out the
thing I was worried about is LTE and
that's different kind of antenna on
there how does that affect battery life
because we do a battery test that does a
lot of online streaming Wi-Fi is one
thing using using an LTE antenna is
something totally different
unfortunately we got a decent signal in
the lab and it turned out about the same
time as it would with Wi-Fi so it was
exactly the same battery life whether
you were streaming video over LTE and we
use t-mobile for this mobile yes versus
just going over our regular Wi-Fi
five-minute difference in favor of Wi-Fi
over LTE okay but really no difference
so about eight hours and change crush
four for both versions now of course
this cost a little bit more than the
regular Surface pro I think there's
about a hundred and fifty dollar add-on
for the LTE and then you have to pay
extra for some other stuff too yeah I
don't I don't I don't know yeah I don't
know if I'd want to pay all that extra I
think they can yeah I think they should
start including the keyboard and pin I
mean it's even if you buy a very
high-end version the pen is $99 they
call it the surface can and the clip-on
keyboard which is really the best part
of this is a hundred and twenty nine
dollars for a basic one and I think 159
for one with little fabric II cover like
this yeah I actually noticed one thing
different between this one and the
service surface pro for that actually
keep the keyboard that we actually got
with that one a keyboard actually lights
up oh the backlit keyboard
yes and some of them are not that I can
understand is an add-on accessory but I
think standard it should just come with
a basic keyboard now the thing with the
LTE is years ago I said to myself oh you
can only get LTE or a mobile broadband
whatever they called it back then build
into a couple of high end laptops
usually business systems usually it was
an expensive add-on I thought oh a
ventually this will come everywhere a
couple years later what happens you
still could hardly get it anywhere
that's why this is so notable because
almost no consumer laptops have an LTE
option you still only see it in a few
business laptops and I always figured
that's because everyone just started
tethering from their phones that became
so common and you know because of the
way that the phone data plans are are
structured yeah I actually um yes I am
one of the few people that point it out
for an iPad with LTE I did one other
place you could get that an iPad they
sold the LTE version and you could buy
the the coverage for that and my reason
at the time for going with that was cell
phone companies weren't exactly battling
like they are now with the plans and if
you did have a hotspot it was maybe like
30 40 dollars for like two gigs and once
you went over that two gigs they'd burn
you whereas through t-mobile when I got
the iPad data plan through them they
gave you like maybe like five or ten
gigs but then they throttle you there
were no overages so that was one great
thing to have and it can also be used as
a hotspot so that was that was initial
drawing for me and then of course it
started becoming more mainstream and
you're kind of locked in you're like
okay how can I get out of this how can I
get out of this my iPad broke so that's
how I got out of it the iPad the tablet
this guy is a tablet you used LTE on
your iPad with it radically easier than
just getting your phone out and doing a
tether um yes and no in early stages
when you use the hotspot on your phone
you had to physically turn it on I guess
over the over time with Apple's updates
you allow to tether to your device and
it would turn it on you automatically
for you
that's iOS to iOS as terms of like a PC
to your phone you have to still
physically turn it on so it definitely
was a lot more convenient having one
within the system itself but I still
don't think we're gonna see LTE built
into a lot of consumer laptops with one
exception later this year we're gonna
see the first laptops with Qualcomm CPUs
on them
HP's making one a few other companies
are made
and besides having batteries that they
claim will last you know 20 plus hours
there are gonna have always on LTE
connections because Qualcomm makes chips
for phones and it makes a lot of sense
the trade-off of course being these are
not Intel chips so they're probably not
going to be as powerful as a regular
standard laptop or a PC tablet they may
not run all the same software but will
have that great battery life and they're
gonna have those always-on connections
so I guess we'll see if people will
adopt that as a standard or people will
just keep tethering to their phones or
using that Starbucks so that are that
Airport Wi-Fi another one was sitting in
the park wire-free it's true that's true
would you pay extra for an LTE enabled
laptop or tablet well let us know what
