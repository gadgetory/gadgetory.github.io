easily the most ambitious appliance that
Samsung has ever tried to get people to
buy models start at about 5600 dollars
although in fairness we are starting to
see discounts down to about $4,300 and
that's obviously still a ton to spend on
a fridge but I've got to give the family
hub some credit it's the best-looking
and most fully featured refrigerator
that I've ever tested the four door
design is the same as you'll get with
this chef collection model that we saw a
couple of years ago and it looks better
than ever in black stainless steel the
touch screen looks great too it's bright
and vivid and it also feels snappier and
more responsive than the pre-production
model that we tested out in the CNET
smart home two months ago chalk one up
for software updates now a lot of these
apps center around the whole family hub
feed calendar the notepad the photos it
all kind of harkens back to the way we
used fridges when we grew up with
magnets and paper that helps this fridge
feel grounded but at the same time it
also makes a lot of those apps feel a
bit redundant when magnets and scratch
paper worked perfectly generations
before still there are plenty of
features that are designed to help you
use this fridge in ways that you've
never used a fridge before take the
cameras on the inside for instance by
tapping that view inside button on the
touch screen you can take a look at
what's inside and even drag little
countdown timer icons over your specific
ingredients that you want to keep track
of that's a handy feature more useful
than I even expected you can also pull
those images up on your smartphone using
Samsung's app to check if you need
ingredients while you're out of the
store now is any of that actually
necessary of course not but it's cool
it's useful it works as promised and you
can't do it with any other fridge on the
market as for the refrigerator itself it
offers a total capacity of just under 28
you big her Foreman was decent too with
consistent temperatures in the body of
the fridge and in the bins I was
especially impressed with that flex zone
though temperatures were always accurate
and consistent at all of the settings
both in freezer mode and in fridge
moments a cool feature and it works well
most of us can't afford this fridge but
if you can and you want it don't let me
stop you from getting it at the end of
the day it's a gorgeous and capable
luxury appliance that ratchets up the
cool factor with features you won't find
anywhere else keep in mind though
samsung also sells
nearly identical 4-door black stainless
steel models that don't have the
touchscreen or the cameras for thousands
less for now at least the fridge of the
future comes priced at a premium</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
