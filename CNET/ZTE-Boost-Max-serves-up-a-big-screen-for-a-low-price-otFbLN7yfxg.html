boost max plus sounds like a great value
especially when you consider premium
phablets cost upward from six hundred
dollars unlocked but if you're looking
for a budget device the max plus does
make some compromises for its low price
first off the basics the handset is big
like I said before it has a 5.7 inch
display and features a 720 pixel
resolution but it's also big in terms of
other phablets as its heavier and
thicker than its competitors overall it
runs Android 5.0 lollipop with some
preloaded apps from boost mobile and it
has a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core processor
you'll also get two gigs of ram 16 gigs
of memory built in an expandable storage
up to 64 gigs on the front there is a 1
megapixel shooter that can record 720p
do and on the back is an 8 megapixel
camera that can record 1080p video
however photo quality isn't that great
the flash can cast a blue light on
objects and even when you don't turn on
the flash you could sometimes see this
blue hue overlaid on photos the phone
also has very little on board available
storage so you may run into trouble
storing your files immediate content one
good feature however is that the phone
has a 3.4 amp your hour battery which
lasted an impressive 13 hours and 20
minutes during our own testing for
continuous video playback the ZTE boost
max plus is a decent enough budget
handset but if you're willing to spend
more for a big screen device without
splurging all together the motorola moto
x pure edition is a good halfway point
if you can however and want to keep
within the two hundred dollar price
bracket the LG G stylo is more reliable
comes with a stylus and is worth looking
into again I'm Lynn and you've been
checking out the ZTE boost max plus
