checking out the blackberry passport
this smartphone will be available later
this year around the world and it will
cost five hundred nine nine dollars u.s.
there's still no word on what carries it
will be available for or what the price
will be on contract so let's get the
most important question out of the way
yes it fits in my pants pocket no it's
not exactly comfortable the phone is as
big as it looks thanks to that square
four and a half inch display it's
definitely unique and personally I kind
of think it looks great it just screams
slick and professional with a sturdy
stainless steel frame and a compact
physical keyboard running underneath
that display the square design major can
comfortably fit a lot of text on the
screen without necessarily scrolling a
bunch or flipping over to a wider
landscape mode it's a pretty nice screen
too with a 1440 x 1440 resolution again
that's a square texted photos look
really crisp and shut the phones with
offers obvious bonuses to the keyboard
which is nice spacious keys that are
really easy to type on quickly and
accurately after a bit of practice the
keyboard is also touch enabled which is
pretty clever it works as a sort of faux
touch bag you can scroll around
documents and web site to things like
that this is incredibly useful while
reading because it means you can keep
your hands off the screen and out of the
way and the touch enabled keyboard is
even more useful while you're writing
consider predictive text as you're
writing three options appear over the
keyboard just three suggested words and
you can swipe up underneath each option
to stick it into your text if you need
to edit a scented you can just double
tap on the keyboard and a little
magnifying glass popped up you can just
scroll around and put that wherever
you'd like so you can edit in line and
there are plenty of other nice features
like great battery life a 13 megapixel
camera that takes pretty good shots an
intelligent phone speaker that will
adjust the call volume if you in a noisy
environment and Blackberry 10.3 OS which
lets you run Android app it even comes
with the amazon appstore but the
passport has an obvious size problem now
I've got big hands and I generally
manage to get about without issue for
the width still makes it noticeably less
comfortable to hold and use and even
gargantuan devices like the Galaxy Note
3 it's actually wider than that it's
also a pain to do things like web
browsing or texting
one hand and they say that a really
creeped up if you're holding something
and one or a popular text you need to
really like physical keyboards to get
over all the size compromise with this
square shape introduces now if you're a
blackberry fan or a busy professional
who spends a lot of time hammering out
emails you're going to find a lot to
like here but for the rest of us the
awkward shape is going to make it a bit
of a hard to sell I'm Nate Ralph be sure
to read the rest of my review on cnet
this has been our first look at the
blackberry passport thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
