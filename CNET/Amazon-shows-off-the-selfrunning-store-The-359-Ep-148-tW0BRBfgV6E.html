welcome to the 359 when we talk about
the top tech news of the day you know
the crap we want to throw it I'm Roger
Chang I'm Alfred hang so Amazon wants to
redefine the physical shopping
experience the online retail giant
debuted Amazon go the concept store that
lets you walk in grab what you want and
go all without taking out your wallet
now Amazon only has one location Seattle
and it's only available for customers or
employees right now in the beta but they
say it'll open to the public next year I
don't get the new concept of this I walk
in stores and grab stuff and leave all
the time
that's called shoplifting offered oh oh
is that not allowed here I would have
yeah sure is friend pawn a little bit I
mean I think I think it's a pretty cool
concept I just think it'd be annoying
with like you know so the way that works
is what like it scans your card or
something like that and when you pick it
off the shelf yeah well I believe
they're cameras all over - selection
knows when you pick up three items it'll
add it to your digital yeah grocery bag
and it's actually smart enough to
recognize if you put the item you know
how that's gonna be really annoying when
you have that kid that wants to like
that really wants that starburst and you
know we're not getting the starburst now
it's not like oh you know take it out of
the car it's I'm just gonna take it in
charge now no he's gonna take he's gonna
take the candy he's just gonna run right
up yeah orange charged so I mean good
luck with that otherwise I do I think
you know something like this makes
shopping a lot easier um but it also
like you know what it does it makes me
like forget like how much money I'm
spending well I think which entire point
I know yeah so and yeah it's again it's
Amazon and trying to find new ways to
reinvent the physical shopping
experience even though you know they're
bread butter is online sales they won't
get close to your home yep
do we want to move on the music yeah all
right so I put out a story today about
2016's memes and the worst of them all
that should probably be dead by 2017 um
I spoke with a professor at Indiana
University who basically who's been
studying memes this is a real job by the
way and he essentially told me that like
a lot of the memes that you see are
they're all bad they're all awful post
none of them are high quality they all
get stolen from each other and it
just you know it's just building onto
something that's like a crappier version
of what it was before um so there's poor
Pepe the Frog a few of them Pepe the
Frog Colonel Ron Bay you know they
they've all changed into something that
they are they weren't originally yep and
the other ones you know they've just
gotten old like they're just not that
funny anymore I mean one of the things
that I looked at you know delete your
account was hilarious yeah and then it
just became something that everybody
said and like holy was overused it was
completely over use there is there one
that annoys you in particular um I
herim Bay is easily the most other thing
because it's not gonna die like that ape
is long dead and you know what hurrah
made completely deserted watch yeah so
it was look I
if you read my story there's a whole
like there's AI I go in a hole like
rants about why Harambee is the worst
meme but I'll save that for this I will
leave with that so lastly we wanted to
check out the oculus rift I got a
refreshed review now that Scott Stein's
had a chance to take a look at those
controllers those fancy touch
controllers and he came away pretty
impressed right it's well design is
compact and it finally gives you hands
yeah virtual world which is which is uh
which was a big missing fact which the
vive had for a while that's the thing it
doesn't have the kind of whole room
tracking that the vibe has so you can't
walk around with these things but it
does definitely give you a little bit
more of dementia a little bit more
tangibility to the virtual world I'm
actually glad let you know this is the
next move that they're kind of doing
with it I mean like I guess like phase 1
or step 1 or y'all was kind of just
getting the screen onto you and being
able to see and experience things but
now you know I think this was you know
what it really needed to you know jump
it's on to the next yeah I mean I think
the idea of just using an Xbox
controller to roll is not that great so
I thought Merced it takes you out of
that that experience that said these are
$200 yeah I was gonna say this like you
know with the controllers I think it's
cool that you can finally you know
interact with the world but to me I
don't care how good the controller is it
for me is more about a conveniency
factor so I've been a big fan of like
the Google daydream where ya bone is the
controller yep well your phone is a
controller that actually comes with its
own little Oh
oh yeah it has that remote - okay which
is actually kind of neat
we're trying it over the weekend yeah
except it yeah it has some bugs yeah but
I will say this that it is a lot more
convenient than like those two you know
controllers on both hands yes well we'll
have to leave it that for more on that
story check us out on SEANET I'm Roger
Cheng I'm out for ding thanks for
