content you can get off of the surround
360 v1 it's a shot in Grand Central
Station and it gives you that ability to
feel much more closely like you're there
feel but we're not done yet we're not
fully immersive there's more we can do
so we want to push the immersion chain
further one of the challenges of 360 3d
photos is when I view them in VR if I
happen to move around if I move to the
left a little bit or move forward the
world is still locked it's still locked
wherever that camera happened to be
placed and so we want to fix that
problem and we've been designing the
second generation this is the X 24
and the X 6
these are cameras designed in
partnership with FLIR who's been working
with us to integrate their camera
modules into the center of them but what
we've done is we've done a camera layout
specifically designed to maximize pixel
overlap and every single part of the
scene not just around the outsides but
in every part of the sphere and what
that pixel overlap does is it allows us
to take our expertise in computer vision
and go to town we can get a very
detailed per pixel depth map of every
part of the scene that you're capturing
with this camera which starts to break
into this ability to solve this six
degrees of freedom problem what do I
mean by this this is what I mean you
place a camera in a fixed position this
is this camera that's around 360
prototyped shooting actual content I
place it in the scene I then am a viewer
and I put my VR headset on and as you're
going to see she's going to move in a
position the camera never was she steps
forward she bends over and leans down
she's looking at positions in the scene
the camera was never there to capture
but because of the quality of depth
information the resolution and the
arrangement of the physical Hardware of
the camera and the quality of the
computer vision code on the back end
were able to recreate views that didn't
exist before to give you that sense of
immersion like I can move around and be
in that scene this is what we mean by
really immersive video context we're
going to get these cameras into people's
hands this year we're working with a
variety of partners we've learned a lot
in the last year about how filmmakers
like to produce in the real world so
this camera is designed to work with
your tool chain no lock into any
proprietary back end system use your
tool of choice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
