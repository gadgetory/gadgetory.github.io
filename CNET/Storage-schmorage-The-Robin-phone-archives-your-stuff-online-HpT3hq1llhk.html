phone with android six points off twere
well I already named Robin anyway I like
the way your different design looks on
you and your pretty slim which is cool
but the whole reason that you exist the
thing that makes you tick is that you
automatically archived the apps and
photos that I haven't looked at for a
while right and you store them online
okay I got it I got it like I can still
download them anytime I need them but
when I run out of space on my phone
they'll just go into hibernation mode
and the icons spray out without me
having to do anything and when I do
download them again the lights on the
back next to this cloud icon here I
start to flash and that's how I know
when it's working right okay great so I
do have some constructive criticism for
you like for a phone that wants to put
everything in the background that
persistent icon on the front that
manages archived apps it really does get
in my way and I wish there were a better
way to automatically organized the icons
on the phone because I keep swiping past
all these ghosted apps just to get to
that active one that I want also photos
take longer than usual to capture and
exposure sometimes off i'm also really
confused by this speaker because it
looks like a home button but it's not
but at least the volume is really loud
so I like that in your lock screen that
doubles as a fingerprint sensor that's
really awesome it works really quickly
and accurately look you're four hundred
dollars you're not bad for the price but
to be honest you do seem like more of a
novelty device and your face pretty
stiff competition from other cheaper
phones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
