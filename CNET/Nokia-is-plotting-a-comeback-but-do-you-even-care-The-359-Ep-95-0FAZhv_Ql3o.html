to another week full of the 359 podcast
well semi full it's episode 95 and you
are joined here by Roger Cheng and
Samantha Rhodes what is going on today
happy Monday hello yeah what's what is
going on we've got it we've got a couple
of cool stories for you we're gonna talk
about nokia we have young piece this
morning about the startup bringing the
nokia brand back and how the how the
other plotting to come back and whether
or not you care honestly uh and we're
gonna talk about whether or not we are
our first experiences with our phones
Sam has never had a nokia phone which is
unusual for folks at least at my age so
makes me feel old and then next up will
be talking about the the next wave of
iPads coming out over the next two years
well then lastly just a bit about a
couple hotel chains that were hit with
some mom we're just something be aware
of so as always if you have any
questions leave them in the comments
section or producer Brian will pick out
the best ones and we will do our best we
will do our best answer them like sam
says ask us ask us anything well almost
anything we will sorry Carol answer yeah
I now within reason within reason and
preferably with the topics that we're
actually talking about but yeah or or
just general Apple questions because we
know you have them and we will answer
them so when we get started you're
promising the world here right all right
let's let's let's kick off the podcast
alright audio to speed will be taking
questions in exactly three minutes and
59 seconds starting three two welcome to
the 39 when we talk about the top tech
news of the day and all the other crap
you want to throw in I'm Roger Cheng I'm
Samantha roads so nokia is back finished
start of AMD's plans to bring back the
brand to help raise awareness action AMD
has hired Pekka Rinne Tala the former
CEO of Angry Birds maker rovio and a
long time no key event in a story that I
a published this morning it just sort of
brings me back then I had a lengthy
email chat with with Pekka and he seemed
to be convinced that people still value
the nokia brand
and I've questions about that especially
from from some like Sam who has never
owned has never owned a millennial who
has never owned a nokia phone and what
is your take on the nokia brand yeah i
only know nokia is the kind of phone
that can like a cockroach can withstand
like a nuclear holocaust or something i
know very mean those things were tough
whenever that I know has or wants to
have a nokia phone so it's an
interesting dilemma because he seemed
really convinced that people were just
you know it's a nostalgia playwright
they they they grew up with the Nokia
phone and you know a lot of people are
still kind of loyal to the brand and
they feel I feel like if they can come
out with a decent android-based phone
people will come back but it has to be
pretty good though because we we always
think of tech is like going forward and
red though the nostalgia might work I
don't want to be going backward in terms
of high technology no that's actually a
really good point I mean for me the
bigger thing is Apple and Samsung sort
of dominated our minds when it comes to
smartphones come to advanced technology
and then you've got a brand like Nokia
which has had a lot of trouble over the
years and it's been linked to windows
phone for a while right and it didn't
really do so well so I want to see what
happens we'll have to see I probably
won't buy one thought of that well I'm
you gonna see it come back but we'll see
so apple also is planning at ten and a
half inch iPad pro for 2017 and 0 le D
iPads for 2018 yes so oled so all that
displays are a you know they've been a
feature mainstay feature for samsung
devices they've been our phones and
tablets the the benefit is that the
colors are vibrant the blacks are truer
they say that it's you know it's a
better visual experience so it's at that
time that Apple kind of caught up right
but although I mean on a broader level
do you think any of this will make a
difference like do you care about iPads
at this point not really i don't use an
ipad but then again people just crave
new Apple products Frau they're going to
be excited about it we'll see I mean
like Apple has definitely struggled with
the ipad business it's it basically was
on a downward spiral up until the last
quarter and so we'll see if like a
better display will actually help all
right lastly this is more of an
why he booked a hotel with Starwood
marriott or hyatt watch out the hotel
chains have been hit by malware that
exposed customer data so if you booked a
hotel between march first of last year
to june twenty first of this year you
could be hit yeah it's 20 hotels the
united states and they have a link
online so you should go find out yeah
check us check it out on Tina for sure
we've got a link there you just put
hotel right are you saying I did yeah
I'm safe i booked at the crowne plaza
and minneapolis although other
minneapolis hotels were hit so yeah I
mean this is just sort of the latest
incident where again hotel chains
airlines have just been hit by by
hackers I mean it seems like we're we're
not poor never safe right yeah
everywhere gets hit DNC Hillary Clinton
yes yeah and with you Donald Trump I
guess that's a good thing I don't yeah
he was at he was a fan that one yeah so
all right oh why normal rocky stories
check us out on cnet I'm Roger Cheng I'm
Samantha roads thanks for listening whoa
way under I realized you don't need to
tell everyone that for once we're gonna
hit the mark on a three minute 59
podcast as opposed to be in like four
minutes and 6 seconds that's true okay I
decide to change it up by going under
door not over you were efficient yes no
one's mad about that alright we have
some great freaking commented I honestly
I was a bit distracted when you started
cracking up in the mill was like what is
going on is this bad then I was trying
that I didn't know what's going on so I
just kept talking so I just have this
might be my favorite comment of all time
that we've ever gotten in the show
alright so the snake game will be back
I'm boss on that the snake game
appropriately by a user named Scott boss
nice very nice got boss I challenged you
to snake sand do you know what this net
game is I know a game called snake game
where you have a little snake yes and
that was like one of the that was I
think a default game on most nokia
phones back in the day and there's
really like the only niggas the screen
the screen was tiny yeah how do you just
how long was the game as long as you had
patience for it yeah as long as it kept
going like you could theoretically keep
going if you were skilled enough
and if it's a small screen eventually a
snake just takes up the whole yeah again
you're done and then you're pretty much
done this is how you occupied your time
in high school you would get my age you
could well for me was college but you
couldn't download any new games or
anything so like if that was basically
it all right Lee I challenge everyone
out there let's get it let's get it
trending hashtag bring back snake yes
let's do it maybe hm deal do it maybe
that's that's their marquee feature by
the Nokia phone it's got snakes mm-hmm
there you go yeah we work with the
nostalgic culture we live in these days
that would actually work i don't know i
mean if the power rangers can come back
that's true that's true also ashley in
gaming always loved snow at nokia
sneaking keep it coming more snake
everyone let's play snake rudolph and
cocoa what do Apple think of Samsung do
they hate them and they hate them well
an interesting that's an issue in
question no return i would say apple
doesn't hate samsung but apple
definitely feels that samsung has ripped
off a lot of stuff jay has evidence by
the myriad of lawsuits that they fought
against and vice versa and vice versa
for sure for sure but Apple really
kicked off the whole you guys are
copying our stuff uh battle yeah it's
not a full hate let's go if it's full
hate you know I mean to be heroes behind
the behind the curtain conversation some
of the executives might have but as far
as her public presence at you know what
i would i would probably bet that Steve
Jobs probably hated Samsung probably
they probably hate google more though
basically anyone that's copied you know
what what he brought out to the iphone
so everyone ever yeah yeah uh well yeah
they all they borrowed all the ideas for
their stores but now Apple has new
stores true what stores what stores you
mean windows stores no no like Amazon
doors the physical stores yeah I mean
I'm talking about people who copied
Apple oh yeah yeah yeahs Microsoft or
yes yes yes uh there's my google store
isn't oh I haven't seen a google store
but there that'll be cool but in those
stores Microsoft at Microsoft sorry
um Mohammed says I still use my nokia
e90 communicator made a thousand dollars
yeah with legit I don't remember that
indicator i think was like i'm even
never the numbers were terribly mixed up
but i think that was was it a tablet
almost like a almost like a proto tablet
i honestly don't know anything about if
you give us more details man mohammed
does more focus of my ID yeah we're all
were all blinking you know what we have
the internet we can look this up that's
when thanks to you Brian wash I don't
have the internet will they run out of
ideas for their iPads that's a loaded
question um no but also I would argue
that you know they did it's definitely
tougher to innovate on product like the
ipad now like I feel like it's it's
pretty polished at this point has
basically everything you want in it it
goes fast enough for any app you want to
run on and so I keep changing the size
but I'm trying to think of any sort of
cool things that could come up with
there hasn't been no really I mean like
the coolest thing for that that Pro was
the like the connector for the keyboard
and that is something I sold for
Microsoft so I don't know in terms of
ideas for a significant upgrade to an
ipad I don't know you know I don't got
any more of those I think we're gonna
see more phone stuff before we see
anything on the tablet yeah absolutely
and even then they're kind of like
reaching at straws I should just make it
waterproof and wireless charging just
like everything else like I wouldn't
mind a waterproof like that run out in
the rain waterproof anything would be a
huge leap forward yeah an across the
board yes so to remind everyone we're
talking about the big nokia come back
and we got Tommy in the chat room saying
I don't care I don't even want to know
Thank You Tommy for clicking through
watching the 30-second ad absolutely
there's nokia topic that you don't care
about you know that's the thing there
are people who care about the brand i
think it's definitely sure hits hits a
certain age right like you have to be
kind of like my age basically or older
like in the mid to late 30s because
below that like yet nokia sort of lost
its relevancy and it was any real reason
your phone was a a pink razor pink
razors for a lot of people like the
motorola the moto motorola razr the
original one the thin flip phone their
first i was my face those things work
last
my girlfriend went through three of
those in college yeah yeah yeah they
weren't that durable no no no he dropped
in it just yeah it powdered it was bad
did it literally powder is that what
does she do that phone no everyone you
just drop it in him yeah no it wasn't it
wasn't difficult take a single hit like
if you put it down on the counter too
hard it shut off I mean that was the
first it was first of a wave of like
form over function products right yeah
letting you know you started valuing the
way it looked good before that like most
of the phones i had before the razor
were pretty bulky were pretty durable
yeah nokia ones were pretty awesome like
they were you could use it as a
self-defense weapon throw it at thrown
against someone you know exactly
Shahriyar is talking about the Golden
Age of Nokia saying that they should
just kind of like ride off into the
sunset remember when it was wonderful
antec pimp expands on this yes tech pimp
sure raving about their camera features
their camera functions for me yes he
says project already 1 megapixel all the
carl zeiss lenses the way ahead of their
time yeah they were was like mm n 95 and
90 series was uh these were kind of like
pseudo smartphones they had like slider
capabilities that they were basically
regular phones but they had really
awesome cameras for the time like I mean
nothing nothing they were making then
compared to what we have now yeah then
the 41 I think the 41-megapixel I think
that's a reference to the Lumia 1020
that Nokia made under uh under Stephen
Elop there's a windows phone as a
smartphone actually had a really
kick-ass camera I have to admit I mean
promise you had to be into Windows Phone
and people who weren't really into that
speaking of ahead of their time and
innovation Muhammad points at the Nokia
had video call before FaceTime yes they
did they had a lot of features before
for a phase before Apple did maybe I'll
have new ones now that all be a sort of
that deal and you know what vehicles mmm
that would take a huge amount of
processing power she imagined you're
legitimately thinking by bike Oh PR come
he was like why the real Jeff Goldblum
Co you never really asked if we should
I know that I think that's a problem
with the note with the start of a shin
be there they're trying to create been
using Android so they're going to be
like every other android phone out there
so I don't really know what they're
going to do to set themselves apart I
mean this guy I talked to you know
really talked about the the marketing ID
the brand identity is being the real
differentiator but I don't know if it
has its much sway as yeah that's all
yeah any other questions still scanning
more bring back snake come on keep it
coming guys but yeah we're done we are
in total agreement bring back snake I
don't think my reflexes are that's good
you know it's really really good at
snake yeah I spent a lot of time playing
that game well dad do you think there
will be any Android involvement with new
nokia products no I don't think I think
they're just going to take stock Android
they're not going to they're not gonna
mess with the too much I mean they
probably will but and they're not going
to be working with Google to like create
any cons unique features I think they're
gonna they're going to do this stuff on
their own I also don't know if they are
going to build any kind of unique tweaks
to it to set it apart will say it's
there they're not looking to launch
their phones this year they haven't we
talked about a time frame but you could
probably expect first phones and tablets
to show up next year at the soonest
going back to the the ipad topic tallest
says you know with the trend of iPads
and tablets replacing a lot of actual
home computing experiences maybe that's
a direction to consider what are some
things that we see on a pc that you know
besides something like the optical drive
which is out in itself outdated what of
those should be on the forefront to
innovate into a tablet experience
specifically the ipad that's it's
interesting point i think what Apple's
doing with a home kit and trying to
integrate the IO either iOS device
either your iPhone or your iPad as sort
of the controller for your home yep I
think that's a really good concept and
they haven't really done much with it I
know they you know you can kind of
control your lights and control certain
smart appliances with your iPad but
hasn't feel like they hadn't really have
made a big push in that it seems like a
law separate not a lost opportunity but
an opportunity that they it could be
capitalizing moron I would like to see
something being someone who does not own
a tablet something that would kind of
bring me over as bundling it with
peripherals so buying kid that had a
keyboard and a mouse with it oh yeah
yeah yeah like right off to show it
either I mean I want something that's
really gonna thank me what have one yeah
otherwise like I like my typing
experience on my laptop or that kind of
thing and that's just me have you Robbie
if you guys try like the surface or
surface pro and that that kind of small
thin keyboard I had right that's why
want to see more of you okay got it got
it I mean I mean they're doing that the
ipad pro though right oh is it yeah i
mean sup the promise is not much that
it's not bundled you know they've got a
pencil to get the stylus they've got the
keyboard neither which are free i mean
you have to spend extra money for that
so it you know that cost adds up there
yeah it's like buying a new charger for
your computer 80 bucks yeah yeah nuts
yeah i mean just make me pay it out the
gate and not think about it again just
hate myself once right instead of a my
cell twice three times well with apple
if that's case you would be hating
yourself quite a bit over and over and
over yep absolutely true yep I think
that's all we got for today is probably
good time to wrap right there all right
great thank you so much for everyone
yeah really Zack loving the snake
comments keep trending bring back snake
hashtag bring back saying um it's gonna
happen man I'm is going to you sir
Pokemon go no actually is Pokemon go so
thing I'm still playing which makes me
wonder if it's no longer things so I
obliterated my data plan and week really
yeah so I kept on tmobile nice sorry
Pokemon goes for you I'm grandfathered
in from working for this company on a
tentatively good deal through AT&amp;amp;T oh
yeah you're not an endorsement nor a
criticism that's just where I
interesting cuz I talked to the carriers
about how much data Pokemon go takes up
and they argue that it doesn't really
it's not that heavy Brian can when I'm
differ spending a weekend working out of
Philadelphia with limited access to any
form of Wi-Fi and warning around the
city and occupying that time by catching
them all yes yeah we quit Wow well love

idea yeah the bring back snake long live
