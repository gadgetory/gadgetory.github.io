hot seat yet again several videos
emerged Monday morning on Facebook and
Twitter showing a man being violently
forced off an overbooked flight from
Chicago to Louisville and the social
media community is not having it this
just two weeks after the airline refused
to let two teenage girls board a flight
because they were wearing leggings
according to several witnesses the
airline was asking for volunteers to
give up their seats to make room for a
standby crew when no one volunteered
they began selecting passengers at
random the man in the video and his wife
were selected but did not comply
passengers overheard him saying that he
was a doctor and needed to see patients
the next day and that's when things got
ugly and the security personnel were
ordered to escort him out this video
posted on Facebook shows two men in
uniform approaching the row followed by
loud scream it's unclear what exactly
transpired after this but his lip
appears bloodied in this next clip
posted by another passenger on Twitter
as his limp body is being dragged out of
the plane the man then came back one
more time looking disoriented before
completely leaving the aircraft
shortly after United confirmed the event
took place on its Twitter account six
hours and about four million Facebook
views later Oscar mu√±oz the CEO of
United apologized for having to re
accommodate passengers and said the team
is looking into the incident</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
