up here I gotta say that because I know
looking at this thing right now that is
the dealing AC 3200 ultra Wi-Fi dir - 8
9 0 l /r router now this one here is
probably the most attention-seeking
rarer on the market is so wrapped so
radical so ufo-like that if you bring it
the white house you make it arrested but
it can't fly and there's no need to
bring it anywhere something you want to
use at home just hope this one port here
- you're eating a source such as the
modem and you'll cover your home with
lots of Wi-Fi signals now locks because
this is a tri-band router
meaning it have one and 2.4 gigahertz
band that top at 600 megabit per second
and to foggy hood man each top at 1300
megabit per second for the total
bandwidth of 3200 megabit per second at
any given time now the reason for the
extra 5 gig hood man is so that it can
host more client on this band without
them adversely affecting one another
speed you can set up those three band
with three separate Wi-Fi and network we
can group them into a one single Wi-Fi
network in the smart connect mode now in
this case the router will decide which
client connects to which band by itself
the road is very easy to use by the way
its web interface here is very simple
very well organized and allows you to
access different parts very easily
there's a network map here that show
connected clients and allows you to
interact with them you can even connect
the router here with the mydlink poro
and manage your home network view your
phone or tablet when you're away but
this level is of you also mean that the
rail has quite limited settings and
feature for example it can only reserved
and unreserve an IP address for a client
when that plan is connected to the
router and the QoS engine here is very
simple you can only put one client as a
top priority and there's no way to
prioritize based on application or other
categories
overall this means savvy users
like me we'll find this rather quite
lucky a performance why the Delaney
excelled my testing at close range with
the sustained speed of some 600 megabit
per second among the fastest I've ever
seen
unfortunately it rained wasn't the best
ever seen just somewhere between 120
feet hundred fifty feet now note that
the router six antenna here are not
detachable and that means you cannot
replace them with a high gain antennas
for a better range to make up for that
the wire has stellar Wi-Fi stability I
used for a week continuously and it's
never disconnected once now a part of
the gigabit network port and USB 2.0
port the router also have a 1u speed 3.0
port to host an external hard drive and
when it does it become a very viable
network storage server in my testing it
offered the sustained speed of more than
65 maker by per second for reading and
more than 35 megabytes per second for
writing via a gigabit network connection
that means it can handle file sharing
and media streaming really well
unfortunately it does not support Time
Machine backup
you know stacking this router against
all the AC 3200 routers I'm review is
not the best not the worst it's about
the average and that's partly because of
its like a feature and short range but
mostly because currently it is the most
expensive at 310 dollars for more check
out my full review as cnet.com basically
if you decide to get it make sure you
prepare for the attention that you will
get or not get because of it also is
unlikely you have the eye catching eyes
that are mined and that's because I'm
don't know and it has been the first
look at this AC that is crazy rare thing
for dealing
what's the name of this thing again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
