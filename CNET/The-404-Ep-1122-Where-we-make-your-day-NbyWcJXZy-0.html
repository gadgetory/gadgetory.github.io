Justin yes I see you've already been on
the whole East wooding bandwagon after
last night it when the
publican national convention offered the
stage to a senile old man who rambled on
for what felt like an eternity right
speaking to invisible president and
chair show us what you want to show us
what has the internet created you seem
so surprised that this has become it's
just too easy Gina not just to when you
yourself posted something about him
earning an Oscar nominee that was it
thousand I'm done right and I was last
night when I was very drunk watching it
right now I'm kidding well not not
everyone is aware of the memes that have
come out right of course after i agree
that you know it's what's been like
eight hours so just don't expired is it
yes come to show especially we're still
talking about honey badgers and david i
think don't you think honey badgers
funnier than Clint Eastwood get not at
all you know because honey badger was
made intentionally DB forever surely she
was taking himself completely seriously
and that's why it's funny yeah go on um
this is the one that I thought was the
funniest see it's a less publicized
parody I miss screenshot via Abe Simpson
in a newspaper yelling at a chair yeah
that's exactly where this is come once
again Simpsons predicting the future no
genius that's pretty good there it is
and then of course you have cherry from
pee-wee's Playhouse Playhouse cherry
cherry really quick i get did you watch
uh the nomination now yesterday so uh
kleeneze what was the big get for uh for
the republicans yes he's the youngest
celebrity they could find and he had a
speech that lasted about five minutes it
felt like Pharrell like eight hours five
minutes of ambien induced rambling I
mean I like Clint Eastwood don't get me
wrong right he's a fantastic director
right he's done all these great films
how does he still direct yeah are people
just like whatever Clint I'm gonna do
what I'm gonna do and you're just gonna
sit there and say action and cut how old
does he know he's poor over 70 years old
I think he's got to be above 889 I think
we so he's pushing nine yeah he's a very
old man and I think that accounts for a
big reason why oh no he's 82
82 okay all right my biggest thing is
that he kept calling Obama mr. Obama
which one he's actually President Obama
to you mr. Clinton but he wasn't mr.
Clint Clint east on user journeys would
he is actually from San Francisco is
born chances come yeah don't publicist
I'm just let you know um yeah i mean
he's made some great films of our time
it's just odd that they're big yet is
this very all are you probably one of
the oldest people in the audience I just
wonder if he had a teleprompter script
no I how they go off oh I was supposed
to be ad lib I do believe um the GOP
came out and released um a statement
that said it was mostly adler but it was
meant to be that way like there was no
script even i'm not sure about tire I'm
sure maybe he had little at an outline
right the guy's 82 you don't care yeah
okay honey badger he's a total he
doesn't give a crap to you probably
couldn't read the teleprompter like
Steve Guttenberg whatever it was it his
hair was the best though his hair he had
like very Ernie McCracken hair go
alright yeah Inkpen just sort of there
you know like no one even touched him
before they pushed him out on stage yeah
they just wound him up from that crank
in the back right just let him go I was
five I was fun it's fun it makes it
makes for and you know obviously all the
media outlets ate this up oh yes it was
just it was just like free entertainment
it was like a battle of the parody
Twitter accounts online with invisible
obama uh pretty much taking it 20,000
followers in less than an hour what's
amazing about that to me is how
organically of I hate sing the word
viral but really that was a definition
of it right there yeah arm how does the
how did something resonate so well and
catch on and just see you know seep
through all the cracks in in Twitter and
everyone knew about that because that's
a big part you when I was watching this
all three nights you have to have
twitter open because that is like the
commentary that you want to hear you
know um it's it's really fun to follow
yeah sure so obviously the best part was
when he brought out an empty chair yeah
and pretended like president obama was
sitting in it right and i couldn't tell
who was chastising who write because he
kind of made it so that obama
huh yelling at him and tell him to go f
himself right and then he would also
respond with questioning his uh his
decisions about get most frankly odd it
was just frankly a very bizarre varies
it is the first I'm hearing about yeah
yeah sound super strange it was where he
was literally talking to an empty chair
well like Obama as if you were on the
404 right now yeah in this empty chair
right we actually talked about yesterday
getting Obama on are shown here yeah and
there is again it's weird because um our
people are categorizing it is sad it was
kind of sad but you know what's sadder
that it will not affect any voting
whatsoever right I mean I can't see
anyone watching his amusement while I
was gonna vote for Romney before but
after watching these would fail I'm not
gonna do it anymore yeah I don't well I
don't know I can see I don't know how
these things really translate into you
know voter behavior yeah but I don't
know man I can't really see anyone
seeing that being like I'm now you know
into it what do we have up here on so i
just wanted to show some eastwood what
we're talking about this there it is you
just point out a chair yeah you know
pretty good it's not how it's not too
hard hmm not too hard at all brother do
that right now east wooding let me see
it can you eastwood the guest chair yeah
here it is let me say they can you
eastwood it for me play the overhead
yeah you're just switch to the guest
year there it is there it is there is
obama right there the guest cam isn't
working that's cool that's fine it broke
um what were some of the best tweets
that were that i saw yesterday i saw one
that was like uh Jim gap oh okay go
ahead i was gonna say somewhere
backstage uh clint eastwood is yelling
at someone for almost sitting on obama
jim gaffigan said that chair looks
nothing like barack obama thought it was
funny yeah alright let's get out of this
discussion and move on to what we said
we were going to do today we have the
taste testing oh that's right okay this
always makes for a really good radio for
our audio look yeah so no because we'll
describe it so from thinkgeek are our
friends at thinkgeek we we were given
two items that were really psyched about
bacon candy which is made by mel
villes yeah um hand-poured candy bacon
in three varieties savory maple honey
and barbecue yeah you know I'm actually
looking at the ingredients on the back
here bacon on anything about bacon I
think it's bacon flavored right there
artificial corn syrup water and
hydrogenated soybean oil they also sent
us a bunch of these sriracha pops
sriracha's of course the rooster sauce
that everyone loves at Asian restaurant
you want one re oh I'm okay my oh that's
right you're still working on the
biggity your predatory and it's big I
can't make it out you could technically
feel the evil for you ok so I think what
I got in my hands right now wow this is
a lot gooier than I thought it would be
do not smell good oh no they don't smell
good at all but you know what we
promised people we're gonna do this we
have to do this ya writin don't you
gotta be you gotta really open it up and
get it gosh it doesn't sound good yeah
you can you try this while we're doing
that no he's not gonna be happy that's
right you're gonna try this Roger on
chacha pop will try the bacon I'm sure
it will have a worst case regardless of
whether or not we like these all these
fine items and confectionaries are
available at thinkgeek com yeah by the
way you could spend literally 24 hours
on thinkgeek and not see the entire
catalog they have so many crazy products
on there alright so here's the bagel I
think there's bacon bits in this okay I
think this is definitely the honey I'm
not tasting any bacon maybe takes a
while to get to River trophy wall go to
return this is my angel I'm scared to
bite into it cheb bite into it up
there's the bacon yeah all dear is it
good they put bacon bits in this one hmm
you know it's it's a little salty um the
lollipop part is pretty good though I
like that Justin finished his read minds
childproof okay and I'm done that was
interesting yeah don't that's a novelty
right there how's this ah it tastes like
sriracha does it really but it's but
it's
you can you're enjoying this kind of
sweet it's okay yeah can I try it hey I
want to live get your own manner would
pop open one of the yeah I tried one
before the show admittedly I couldn't I
couldn't wait but she wasn't very spicy
yeah right it didn't leave I it tastes
like cinnamon yeah here's a min lollipop
it does not like sriracha but good okay
oh this is odd too yeah this is strange
cuz you know everyone knows jirachi it's
the it's the hot sriracha sriracha yes
rachi shut up it's uh it's like the hot
 sauce right yes because it's got
that big rooster on the on the the front
of it with the green cap in the clear
bottle yeah um it's yeah I'm getting it
now it's it's weird no no this is not
doesn't really burn your lips though
right know what I was going for it
sriracha has like a very vinegary taste
which i think is key to the flavor of it
and this does not contain the vinegar on
the Joe right it's just like a spicy
lollipop yeah Brad one before it's well
the thing about true rachi right mm-hmm
it's got like garlic and chili in it to
it and savory the lollipop has garlic in
there too and I'm gonna stop I'm done
with that oh yeah that's weird two of
them don't pair well together this wait
this is gonna be crazy watch I'm gonna
do here i'm gonna go i'm gonna switch
off bacon and sri racha oh ah that makes
my feet hurt I don't know why ah ok
green shot for the day yeah yeah that's
good fisting it's so strange little Oh
anyway there's other fine products
available thinkgeek com don't let this
be an indicator of how good the other
product and uh it's just so weird yeah
it's pretty gross there's like a there's
like a there's like a fight in a taco
bell in my mouth we got some water yeah
oh maybe during the break now anyway
I'll get you other flavors that maybe
hopefully will taste a little bit better
yeah we talked about the honey badger
before and uh did way later wait
months and months after the joke is
already jumped the shark there is a
honey badger barbecue sauce kickstarter
funding that you can be a part of its
the honey badger barbecue sauce made by
three guys Paul Chris and Leigh if
there's a Kickstarter backing then they
need about 40 thousand dollars to make a
limited edition run of the special honey
badger branded barbecue sauce but the
reason why it's forty thousand dollars
is not because the barbecue sauce is so
detailed that it needs a lot of money
it's more about the packaging so look
check it out here uh watch a video of
this at the same time the the packaging
for it is a honey badger battling a
cobra snake actually kind of cool funny
man that you watch that video and it's
still funny right shouldn't this be
honey badger honey I mean why barbecue
sauce doesn't make sense well because
you don't put honey on anything you
don't just put honey on steak yes
something you put barbecue sauce on a
lot of stuff you would use it quick you
would use it a lot more you know how
many times you use honey I use honey a
lot bring my tea yeah okay weirdo but
that's you know barbecue you're gonna
use a lot more often but uh what I want
to know is is randall getting any of
this Randall Bennett no matter the
original guy do you realize those named
Randall um I'm not sure I don't think so
I mean he wasn't the one that made the
original video anyway but he popular uh
he is the one who made the original it
not the National Geographic course not
but he parody didn't he's the one who
came up with the voice in the whole sort
of thing I mean I'm not trying to give
this guy a buttload of credit but he
still is responsible for the you know
the video in the meme of it all well I
think they're taking this one day at a
time because they just don't have they
don't have the money just yet then all
of its apparently going to the packaging
they're not probably gonna be making a
lot of profit off of it they've already
reached their goal though forty nine
thousand dollars and 903 49,000 three
dollars out of four Stan why we can't
just pay for our debt through
Kickstarter people seem to be funding
every kind of crap on the face of the
earth
no but uh you know things are raising
millions and millions of dollars why
can't you know Barack Obama's like all
right we're gonna get this Kickstarter
thing off the ground at all fixing the
debt yeah you know and disguise it as
something else like you know we're gonna
renovate the Oval Office or something
yeah but then what would people get if
they pledged a certain amount of money
like there's those prizes for every
pledge you mean like the incentive yeah
the incentive is that our nation won't
fall into the eighth circle of hell as
an incentive that's not good enough
you're right that's not good night
usually much rather have a hand nurse a
limited edition uh barbecue honey badger
yes that's the intent of am looking for
yet include a flag with that or
something ridiculous yeah simply silly
let's move along to uh uh uh spotted in
the wild we talked a little about
Nintendo Wii U yesterday what Justin I'm
saying why do we have our own
Kickstarter account for things like
merch for t-shirts and because we
whatever they for that stuff ourselves
okay but i'd rather have other people
give us much yeah but uh you know it's
to me it's like why do that because we
should be making the shirt than they if
they want can buy them right they
shouldn't have to pay to buy them the
same thing though you know pay for the
ability to but yeah i'm on pay i'm on
board with you we can maybe do a
Kickstarter for something else but i
like that idea talked about the wind on
nintendo wii u yesterday and how
internal be in new york next month
announcing the date and price spotted in
the while i found this on reddit is a
Wii U console looks like someone took
this at an airport or something looks
like a bunch of people have them in this
photo yes so what I'm gathering is that
I mean this isn't that big of a deal
because we've already seen what the wii
u looks like especially when we get to
play with it and when they come to New
York and when we were at e3 the wii u
consoles always in this glass box and we
could sort of understand what it looks
like so the fact that someone here just
ripped it out of a box and you know they
could be working for Nintendo whatever
it is it's it's it's an anonymous photo
but that looks legit and there there you
have it nintendo wii in the wild is it
only to come in black I don't know me
see here I don't know they haven't
announced the colors yet now they'll do
that at the at the event on sep tember
13th
is that is that Nintendo's first black
console haven't they all been some oh no
they've I think it's the it might be the
first one that launches in black I'll
actually take that back the gamecube i
think when it launched came in purple
black and another color and gamecube um
and then the wii was available in black
eventually yeah so there you have that
um this is an interesting to a statistic
about netflix and the amount of
streaming it accounts for in North
America how much do you think Arielle
does it count for account for streaming
movies in North America what do you
think the percentage of internet traffic
oh let's see you're trying to cheat I
could tell hahaha I don't look think
about I say it's gotta be a lot yeah
significant um percentage percentage is
this streaming media will give you I'll
give you three choices is it a
25-percent be fifty percent or see ten
percent so this is all streaming media
yeah all this is all data transferred in
North America okay what is it what was
your last one my last one was ten
percent 25 50 or 10 say fifty percent no
it's 25 what 50 would be insane yeah
wouldn't mind blowing but 25 is insane
to our odds all the internet traffic
streams think about that are going to
netflix streaming that's crazy to me and
this comes from an article that David
Pogue specifically Netflix yeah just for
Catholic overall media streaming okay
I'm sorry all right then 50 that it's by
more than three um but yeah all holes
all traffic in the car is crazy
twenty-five percent wow I would wonder
if you combine all the streaming
services like Hulu Netflix Amazon
streaming that probably accounts for i'd
say like eighty percent i'd say like 35
now it has to be more than 50 if netflix
is 25 why you don't think i think
netflix is the by ority all by far not
hulu no okay um well regardless this
article is kind of comparing netflix to
Amazon because David Pope from the New
York Times is saying that the playing
field it's kind of getting leveled one
more people are adopting Amazon because
they can get an Amazon
I membership with it now and it's it's a
little bit different uh pricings model
you get for seventy nine dollars a year
of flat rate you can pay by the month
even though that 79 does kinda factor
out to less than netflix is right always
what I also think they're their library
is not as robust no yeah that's right
that's a big key right that's a huge
thing is that although the movies are
sort of similar in the amount that you
get uh there's a lot more television
shows that are streaming exclusively on
netflix not to mention Netflix's own uh
exclusives as well like uh rest
development they're only gonna be on the
netflix exactly and you know things like
lillehammer they did an original series
called lillehammer right the event sent
there's a lot of things that you know
they're the incentives in my opinion
more are kind of make Netflix worth it
right um but yeah he said that most
people have netflix set up for automatic
pay so it's really easy to just kind of
forget about it and also we talked about
this recently in our promo but not on
the show Netflix just introduced the
automatic advanced feature where if you
just sit there at the end of your movie
it'll go on to the next one or suggest
other movies that you might like so you
never have to pick up the remote again
it's pretty cool like the netflix rabbit
hole it is man it's a total of this it's
a spiral that you can never really get
out of I've been doing that with the
seriously and it's just like forget it
you know you just find yourself you like
what i thought it was light out a minute
ago yes 6am you know that's a big part
about Netflix's appeal is that they do
the recommendation engine yeah and
Amazon does it really have as good of an
engine for that for sure like you know
but again you know it's that two day
free shipping thing or whatever it is
that they offer with Prime that yeah or
makes everything worth it but but if
that's you have to spend a lot more you
make it worth something you know what do
I find even the free shipping even when
they spend more than 25 bucks on amazon
for most products you get free shipping
right I'm blown away as to how fast that
free shipping is I mean it's like I've
had stuff coming two days yeah you know
so it's you know you sort of have to
have that little insider information
before you do something right or four if
you have a private count I think
overnight shipping is only four dollars
yeah it's really good if you
if you get a big order was last thing
you even bought on Amazon um about like
a table by table like a kitchen table
yeah or something like that or like a
nightstand or something look I buy a lot
of stuff on Amazon you do yeah I don't
really buy the last thing I bought was
the head scratcher like the exploded
eggbeater head scratcher yeah about one
of those we can only fit so many things
in your apartment yeah I have to pick
one thing a year to buy you know and
every time you do the garbage you can
put something else one in one out all
right before we hit the brake and our
Beth and break of the day let's go to
this final story in a run-down
fantasizing for porn tech one sec porn
fantasizing those uh the headline is
basically fantasizing about ditching
email is like porn for tech people
that's just kind of true I is it yeah I
ve cuz even scandalous no I mean a
better a better comparison would just be
that checking email all the time and
then giving it up is like normal people
giving up porn gotcha uh so uh yeah you
guys have heard of like Y Combinator
right it's like the startup incubator no
talked about before it basically like
helps startups through the funding
process okay anyway one of the founders
this guy hard tagger he put up this blog
about how he's giving up email and uh
more specifically mobile email he
basically unlinked his account his gmail
account from the iphone mail app and
he's talking about all the benefits that
he's experienced obviously and then not
so obviously so one of those less
obvious ones is that he finds that his
perception of time has actually changed
since he's given up mobile email that's
very important email his gaze feeling
what regard they feel longer days filled
longer he finds that he has more
original thought because he spends more
time thinking about you know ideas that
he comes up with and informs unique
thoughts based on that he also finds
that it when he walks from place to
place he's more perceptive about things
that he see he remembers how he got
there yeah exactly so like kind of
patient really interesting outside
sources you know I'm starting to worry
about that stuff yeah not that I don't
know where I'm going anymore but just
you know the amount of times I do check
my email on my phone definitely
interferes with normal sort of date
day you know absorption of information
it's about walking around it's easy to
kind of trick yourself into being like
yeah I can check email cuz it's still
work related right kind of you know it's
a distraction so it's not like gaming or
sure about stupid YouTube video now
you're right it's kind of productive
yeah but still distract and that's
that's such a bummer but yeah I'm like
to do this first I don't even have work
email on my phone periods well good for
you that's not because you choose not to
it's cuz he doesn't know how to do yeah
that's why you have work email and
you're for sure do and how can you never
respond to any email there's a
difference between having work email on
your phone and looking at ignoring which
I ok hahaha you gotta learn how to
balance that you know yeah so uh yeah
it's it's an interesting sort of thing I
guarantee you everyone would change
their lives would change if they just
got rid of email on the phone right no
doubt about it and then after that uh
all the benefits that he got from
dropping work email his phone he also
ended up dropping things like Facebook
Twitter and core apps to which also
increases productivity yeah I could get
rid of facebook I could I wonder how do
I wouldn't like to get I wonder how that
guy at the verge is doing giving up
everything internet related no I was not
going to be on the internet for a year
nobody knows yeah that man is google his
name I don't know uh but what's what's
silly is that he just has a proxy now
and he just has someone doing it for him
yeah you know he's still in directly
connected which is there's just i defeat
the purpose i thing yeah anyway let's
take a break when we come back we have
video voicemail some regular voice mails
and we'll finish up the week here on the
404 we'll see you on the other side of
this break stay tuned
somebody call 911 shawty fire bandaid on
the desk take three formation of the
horn action first you want to get tab
and then forward I can airplane like to
have here and when you do that you want
to bend it back then I can happen again
on each side cat get it already down the
sides so that's how you make the poor
you can we can put it here on the front
of your head oh so
that's phase right uh nothing better
than father's troll in their side I
haven't seen that on on anywhere no so
is it an old video it's a little bit old
but there's not a lot of views on it so
I think of one of the writ under the
radar I was no money in 10 years when
the dad reaches him the video no no pun
intended but that dad is it dick yeah
that's a dick move dad so forth I saw
this video yesterday I tried it at home
indeed you can make a hole yeah sure
yeah sure you can add a black tile that
sister man try it it works it's really
even sure it's really where all the top
and then full decides right all right
not see it's how easy and the guys like
how do you how do you do it son ya gotta
go to the scene at that gobblers 244 and
check out our show notes how you know we
should pose I don't know we can it's a
towel the towel horn it's a harmless
towel I thought he was gonna blow into
it like a horse yeah yeah yeah all the
horns not working but then I realized
that he met like a horn on like a
unicorn Michael I thought I thought I
thought that it was actually going to
make a noise yeah is what I thought I'm
like oh this would be interesting yeah
my gonna do that yeah I thought was
gonna be like I trombone I to do yeah
that what man that dad is such an ass
let us get two hours the mom she she
would have stopped I don't know I think
there's a reason she's not around
anymore um yeah let's play the video
voicemail from our buddy Ziya Josiah who
also he talks about net potty neti pots
um that's the internet bad is the net
buddy uh it doesn't the whole ear wax
thing that we got into that you almost
made Bridget vomit from yeah remember
yeah and and then he breaks out into
like a whole you know beatboxing Let's
Plays is a
our buddy therefore for its up don't
mind that noise just driving you know
who driving talk to myself and you guys
listings a headphone kill you draw any
pod thing it's pretty gross I heard
about that a long time ago there's a
whole of your days will come down for
them to get through and uh that's why
it's not really a good idea to do it but
a introducing I might recommend that one
time I took out a large big bull wax up
one of my ears it was causing pain nasty
and shocked me that it was even in there
be honest but I got tons of hearing back
and it was amazing getting rid of that
plus there's no way for me this to get
through your brain in your ear canal
unless you've hurt yourself already so
there is that also Jeff don't listen to
the haters man we all love you you
entertain no matter what if you piss me
off or make me laugh it's all the same
and finally I do believe that I you need
some more done step into life buddy oh
good not enough of it so here you go
oh my god and then he gets into a car
accident that's part of does that ok Wow
watch out for that rock what is he
what's the guy who does it he's like
open the doors I that was awesome yeah
talk about multitasking to recording a
voicemail listening to something in his
ear buds driving and beatboxing I'm
pretty sure those all fall under the
distraction categoria just be safe man
you know that's that seems a little
dangerous I'm not sure that we have been
resolved that um yeah is it okay to
drive like that no and also he's he
seems like he's suffering from video
vertical filming syndrome yeah it's okay
Josiah you you have talents elsewhere
mm-hmm just turn that camera around you
know it's easy all right let's get to
some voicemails yeah uh also what just I
was saying is true you can get rid of a
lot of earwax and then put the videos up
on YouTube after the show yesterday I
showed Bridget one of them she gagged
she liked how she I think she almost
threw up that's not funny she did you
made her sick and she who is she like
kept talking about how she was scarred
by this video because she's got a
fragile little yes I forgetting that if
people aren't desensitize do that to
people like that especially women who
you know that don't know you yeah but
you know what if you you can't really
appreciate the really adorable like
kitten and puppy videos until you've
seen the horrible stuff on YouTube
that's my justification for watching
this that's a justification is not in
any way she reformed the way by Calif
it's like how are y'all had to eat that
nasty ass burger and now the next Burger
he's gonna eat is probably a teammate
I had bacon yesterday yeah yeah I did
have you know he loved it every second
of the same thing you have to be rubbed
it on his face he commode extremes to
appreciate the good I don't know man you
know but your voice sounds weird when
it's coming out of your butt let's key
to another uh set of voicemails right
here in the hopper let's are the first
one about the Central Park Zoo a few
days ago Jeff said that he was surprised
that central park was man-made I just I
can listen to this dude's a pack all day
long they're a central park zoo yeah
what do they think that all the wild
animal just naturally cage themselves Oh
nature alright well keep up the moderate
work ya know you dingleberry I knew they
were the park was formed there naturally
no that's uh that's a funny joke his
real accent yeah that's what people
wasn't just joking around he's got a
pretty thick Boston I like that dude
it's a wicked pissah of an accent sounds
cool it sounds pretty badass uh we don't
have that will have really unique
regional accent oh you guys suck san
diego vs portland vs utah yeah it's all
it's all although I like the Chicago
accent it's kind of almost Canadian yeah
you know the long in the northeastern
Boston the dude wicked I farted wicked
red and jerseys and there's jersey in
New York yeah which we will move on from

call we really appreciate this what's up
for for this is Boston from Andre
another dude I'm a longtime listener
first-time caller just want to say I
heard about all the hate you know I know
you guys already got enough messages
about it but I just got to say I listen
to about cornea 30 podcast a week and
what I have to say about yours is that
it's not a new story motional it's not
just talking about the newest games it's
it's like life it's friends it's like a
community a real community yeah and
there aren't a lot of podcasts to do
that I can only think of rooster teeth's
are
I don't know Katie mod but just keep up
the good work guys don't listen to the
haters it's like life I like that new
slogan yeah screw high-tech low black
low blow low brown it's like life it
kind of sounds like he's having as
difficult of a time explaining the 404
as we do um people ask me what are shows
about a noise like well it's like pop
culture it's now attack its its its life
yeah it's like how people had difficulty
explaining Twitter when it first came
right like the collective subconscious
of the Internet exactly right or why
Jersey Shore's popular um okay next call
