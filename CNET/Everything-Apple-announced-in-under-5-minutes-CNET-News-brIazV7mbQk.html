first to welcome you to the Steve Jobs
theater introducing Apple watch Series 3
and it has cellular built in we have two
versions of series three there's one
with cellular at 399 and a version
without cellular that has all the other
great features at just 329 orders we'll
begin September 15th and availability
will be September 22nd
this will bring cinematic quality to
virtually everything that you watch
that's why I am so excited to introduce
Apple TV 4k so now you'll have the
biggest releases in the best picture
quality all on iTunes all available for
the same price as HD new Apple TV 4k
starts at $179 it joins the existing one
you can order it starting on September
15th and it ships just a week later
iPhone a
iPhone 8 this is a huge step forward for
iPhone the design is all new it has
glass in both the front in the back
using the new dual cameras in the 11
Bionic chip and the iPhone 8 plus the
team has come up with a new feature
called
portrait lighting you compose a photo in
the camera app using the portrait mode
the dual cameras in the isp sense the
scene they create a depth map they
separate the subject from the background
and then you see machine learning it
creates facial landmarks and actually
changes the lighting of the contours
over your face that happens while you're
composing the shot iPhone 8 is
incredible for shooting photos it's
incredible for video there's a third
category of use of the camera that's
going to become increasingly important
in our mobile devices and that's
augmented reality what's really cool is
with AR kit the metal 2 on the new
iPhone we are able to experience games
in an entirely new way and now with
iPhone 8 with its glass back we're
enabling the freedom of wireless
charging will really happen to your
iPhone 8 it's gonna start with twice the
capacity at 64 gigabytes and of a second
one at 256 gigabytes and the price will
be six hundred and ninety nine dollars
iPhone 8 plus will have the same two
configurations 64 gigabytes and 256
gigabytes and it will be priced starting
at $799 we'll be able to preorder them
starting this Friday on September 15th
and to be available a week later on
September 22nd we do have one more thing
this is iPhone 10 it is the biggest leap
forward since the original iPhone to
start with the super Retina display is
five point eight inches on the diagonal
now with the display going edge to edge
and top to bottom bottom there's no more
home button I know what you're thinking
about what about unlocking how do you
unlock your phone with iPhone 10
your iPhone is locked until you look at
it and it recognizes you nothing has
ever been simpler more natural and
effortless we call this face ID when you
set up face ID you just follow the
on-screen instructions and it tells you
how to move your head around in the
camera so if s ID can recognize your
face and that's it you do that once when
you set it up so our team created
something called an emoji these are
animated emojis if you were by chance
wondering what humanity would do when
given access to the most advanced facial
tracking technology available you now
have your answer
iPhone 10 also comes in two
configurations 64 gigs and 256 gigabytes
they'll be priced from $9.99 you can
order it starting on October 27th and
they begin to ship on November 3rd so
this is the future the smartphone
shipping this year that is iPhone 10
