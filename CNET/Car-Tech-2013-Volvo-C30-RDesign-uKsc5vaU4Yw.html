legendary P 1800 es wagon let's see how
its come forward many decades as we
drive this 2013 our design with the high
performance pole star package and check
the tech okay here's the defining
feature of ac30 it's got this all glass
lift gate hatchback that is very much
like that P 1800 es I mentioned you also
can tell by this little badge and one on
the dash we have the pole star Edition
and it's also in our design that means
it kind of has the badass wheels and
bodywork and trim okay first things
first if you're around 6-2 or certainly
any taller you can just go click out and
look at some other video you are never
gonna buy this car it's cramped inside
I'm six-two and I can't begin to get
enough legroom the seat doesn't go back
any further nor does it go down any
lower it's kind of undriveable to be
honest my knees are at 90 degrees or
more when I'm driving now for the little
guys here's what we have in the cabin
Volvo's got this very Spartan design
which I normally like but when they
execute it at a lower price point like
this it starts to look a little cheap
huge expanses of featureless molded
plastic over here and it just isn't
quite rich now let's get the substantial
issues this is the head unit you will
not get an LCD infotainment unit in ac30
this used to be kind of cutesy retro
Spartan lean sort of not anymore now it
just annoys me it doesn't show me enough
in the right way which isn't to say we
don't have a GPS Navi not the Swire on
this remote and aim it at this little
bump sticking up on the dash peekaboo
here comes our little friend we've seen
this before on Volvo's a few years ago
it was kind of a decent bridge
technology now I just hate it it's very
slow because it's dvd-based
the resolution is not great as you can
see you can really pick out the lines in
the LCD panel you operate it either
the wireless remote that I just used to
pop it up which I find to be very odd
while I'm driving or you've got this
little controller behind the wheel which
has a little jog stick and a back and an
enter button now in terms of media
sources we do much better you've got
basically all the modern inputs that you
want on this vehicle AM and FM and HD
radio enabled on those satellite radio
is an option under the mode here you've
got your other stuff single slot CD up
there
standard aux USB works for thumb drives
and iPod and as you can see we've also
got bluetooth streaming on this guy also
standard with hands-free calling a few
other cabin ergonomic things on the
Volvo or strange this is the key this
sharp weird little thing sticking out
you don't need to use because there's a
puck you can put in here and it
wirelessly authorizes from the key fob
so why doesn't that thing ever retract
this is a little Volvo thing back here
the storage hidden behind the control
panel it's kind of a signature but it's
not a signature I like because I don't
like putting things where I can never
see them again that doesn't really work
for me nor does this upholstery just a
matter of taste but this kind of cream
color with a hint of seafoam green makes
me feel seafoam green luckily it's
optional you can just go to black on
black as well
now the engine rc30 our design Polestar
is a two and a half liters sidesaddle
inline five in fact every c30 has the
same basic engine what happens is you
get 227 horse and 236 foot-pounds of
torque and the Polestar software and the
horsepower goes to 250 and the torque to
273 that's a big jump
it's turbo no matter what so the
Polestar edition is merely software
changes car weighs about 3,200 pounds
relatively light for a vehicle these
days
delivers 21:29 MPG not stellar
especially since the car prints fairly
small and doesn't weigh a whole lot zero
to sixty on a pole star edition is
around 5.9 if you didn't have this Hot
Rod version and put on about 2/3 of a
second more not night and day
now the first thing you gotta remember
about this car because it's got that
sort of weird add-on nav and no real LCD
I do not have a backup camera here and
it's not too much of an issue because of
that big glass back panel but in terms
of quarters and you can't really see
much now what this vehicle also has they
say is the city safe technology which
means if you're about to run into a car
in front of you up to 31 miles per hour
your speed this vehicle will apply the
brakes all the way to a full stop now to
the performance it's a nice handy little
car because it's got a sports suspension
that's part of our spec or our design
it's also got the Polestar package which
really brings on a lot of creamy ready
torque it's a fun little motor to rev
very little turbo lag in this guy and
yet the ride quality remains quite nice
it's not excessively harsh even over
crappy payment like I'm driving on right
now and overall it's a nice handling car
it's got a light yet planted feel
doesn't feel terribly heavy doesn't feel
like it's flimsy it's a pleasant car to
drive if I could just get comfortable
but I can't because this thing is so
okay so let's presume you're under six
feet tall and you want to buy a c30
here's how I prices out about 26 4 is
your base for this guy and the our
design package for this cool look and
you're adding 2350 there now the
Polestar update is 1300 bucks all it is
as far as I can tell is just different
engine software that's a lot of money
for rearranging the ones and zeros and
the engine computer differently but take
it or leave it it adds a lot of power
and torque and I did enjoy the way power
comes on in this car so if this car is
right for you it's about 34 grand CNET
style right for you is the key you'd buy
it because it has a unique look because
you like Volvo because you like their
city safe technology and because you're
not terribly tall or need to carry an
awful lot of stuff in this
it's a real city car it's got a distinct
flavor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
