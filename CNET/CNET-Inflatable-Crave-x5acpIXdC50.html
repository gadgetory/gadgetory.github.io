podcast I'm Veronica Belmont and I'm Tim
Monahan the crave rookie and I'm an
editor here at seen it crave rookie well
everyone pretty much is a crave roki
that's true these days we have someone
new every week which is awesome variety
so anyway crave video podcast of course
is the podcast based on the crave blog
at crave dot cnet com so we talked about
some of the wild and weird stuff that we
find on the blog which you also are an
editor of so execs you know all the
stuff that goes on there with weird so
tell me a little bit about pop a row
we've seen pop a row before the robot
that you know says konnichiwa I don't
know if you remember that or not but
anyway yeah it has a new tricks now
it'll actually videotape you create a
video blog out of that and look up all
the related links apparently wait so at
cross-references your conversations
great and then little creepy makes a
blog yeah okay so that means that we're
kind of out of jobs exactly no that
means weird is up to I'm gonna stop
doing the robot no yeah no more this
robot so getting away from robots a
little bit why don't you tell me about
some of the stuff that you've brought to
crave today I will say Patty's Day is
coming up which is nice and just in time
for that Carolyn McCarthy found
something on an inflatable bar an
inflatable bar label bar so it's good
because it sets up really quickly uh-huh
can take it down really quickly if you
like to drink until your head hits the
bar it's a nice soft leg oh yeah okay
it's really good because an inflatable
bar is a great place to meet inflatable
women which we do enjoy little baby well
that's that's that's fortunate yeah
exactly I like how you could just pack
it up and put it in a bag and take it
with you wherever you want it lights up
from the insect so at the bar of course
you may want a really powerful blender
yeah right and one of the most famous
blenders on the internet is from the
advertisements for will it blend and I
think the company is called Blendtec is
that it fits in there and so they have
this whole internet meme going on with a
blend different things and well let me
show you an example will it blend that
is the question I love my ipod it's got
my own personal songs and it's done
personal Brooks in it right I'm ready
for the latest so out with the old in
with the new
that's one smoking ipod don't breathe
this okay so I pods blend they do but
you probably don't want to do it at all
no I wouldn't they say that right there
on the bottom this I think that breaks
your warranty a little bit well there's
tons of videos on there of all different
things that they throw in the blender
this has been going around for a really
long time so don't I've seen it before
but I just thought it was time that the
crave audience Kiptyn it's good well it
slammed guys yeah so won't you tell me
about that crazy helmet that I saw
there's a its kind of opposite of the we
you know the we you're really in motion
and getting in shape there's a new
gaming input device it's not available
yet but it reads your brainwaves and
actually makes the game interact with
your thoughts and your feelings that's
like way beyond even 3d that's just like
in your head it's a great rolling the
thing yeah it's the matrix pretty much I
can just imagine people sitting there
with these things stuck on their heads
with a girl down the side of their face
just being like I'm in the game so a
trick style do you have to say I mean if
you're controlling the game do you think
like if you're playing contra do you
have to have to think you know up up
down down ba ba select start or do you
just think I want 30 guys and that
happens I don't feel ya do you say like
jump in you exactly or do you just think
about yourself jumping I think you're
just thinking about yourself jumping
yeah these are things they got higher
now it's good so I wanted to book end
this podcast with robots so of course
we're gonna go back to our regular robot
watch segment starring me

never toy manufacturer just made a line
of toys to go into happy meals at a
Donald so of course I had to go get one

excuse eee McDonald's once a week right
