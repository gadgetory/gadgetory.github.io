its windows holographic platform to
hardware partners in case you don't
remember what windows holographic is
it's a version of Windows 10 that powers
Microsoft's wearable hololens headset
when a person wears the hololens powered
by Windows holographic they can see an
augmented reality or AR with floating
displays or 3d objects overlaid on top
of what the real world looks like and
then they can manipulate those in real
space Microsoft says it is working with
a bunch of processor companies including
AMD intel and qualcomm as well as a slew
of pc makers like dell HP Lenovo and msi
these partnerships could lead to a
number of different devices that can all
take advantage of the mixed reality of
Windows holographic and these devices
could be able to work with each other as
well the company hopes that with these
hardware partnerships they can lure
developers to make all kinds of apps
since now microsoft's hololens won't be
the only hardware to take advantage of
windows holographic microsoft says it
will position its own hollow lens the
same way it does its surface line of
computers which is sort of a more
high-end product and probably more
expensive than other devices that will
come out using Windows holographic that
is it for this tech news update i'm jeff
