about when buying a Wi-Fi router is how
large your home piece if you stay in a
small place like a one-bedroom apartment
is pretty easy because almost all of the
router can cover the entire space but if
you have a big home you probably
wouldn't have two devices one router and
one access point be connected to
together to increase the coverage until
option you have to understand the
standards of Wi-Fi 802.11 AC or AC is
the latest in a Wi-Fi standard to give
you the speed of up to around 500
megabits per second I mean sustained
speed you want to get that if your
device is also support AC but if you
have all the devices that support only
the 802.11 and then an AC router will
not help with the speed but it does help
with the range yeah now I'd say this
extender they don't work very well and
even when they work well they lose 50
percent of the speed now keep in mind so
the best thing to do is you connect the
first router to a to the access point or
second router using a network cable but
running that quick able to paint the
best alternative is a pair of powerline
adapter what you do is that you connect
the adapter into the wall socket they
will create a connection between the two
of them basically turning the powerline
of your home into network cable ran at
CNET you should check out the best list
here I list all of the best router in
each different category and is to take
all the articles about the basic
networking I talked in detail about how
to make the best of your network
we test networking devices very
thoroughly it has the speeds and we
increase the distance to as far as
possible to see what the max range of a
router is and then we also test the
reliability of the router we always test
them at least for eight hour now if you
feel intimidated by the setup process
just know this is a one-time thing
after that you know it's done now most
router actually very easy to setup
but don't just spell out money just
because it's easy to sell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
