have arrived on the market and these sky
buds which retail for $200 are one of
the better models available though they
distinguish themselves more from a
performance standpoint than a design
standpoint what I like about them is
pretty simple they actually work and
sound pretty decent for this type of
headphone they also maintained a
reliable wireless connection and work
decently as a headset for making cell
phone calls are they comfortable
relatively speaking yes but they're not
as comfortable as Apple's air pods they
did manage to stay in my ear securely
and their noise isolating design
passively blocks out a good amount of
sound you charge and store the buds in
their companion battery case battery
life is rated at four hours at moderate
volume levels and the case gives you an
extra five charges a free companion app
allows you to update the firmware and
there's a new pass-through mode that
makes the buds let in ambient noise
while their sound quality didn't blow me
away it was definitely a step up from
what you get from Cheaper totally
wireless earphones while I can't come up
with a very compelling reason for you to
buy these instead the air pods overall I
did like the sky buds and think they are
one of the better totally wireless buds
