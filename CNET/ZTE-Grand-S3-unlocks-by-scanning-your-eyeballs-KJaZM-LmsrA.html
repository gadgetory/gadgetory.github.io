Mobile World Congress 2015 we're taking
a look at the ZTE grand s3 a mobile you
can unlock using your eyes let's take a
look so let's start with that
interesting ion locking feature to
trigger it you just swipe down from the
top and the lock screen here and then
you position your eyes in this box here
at the top once the phone recognizes
that the eyes are yours it will unlock
and you've got access now ZTE says that
there are algorithms in place that mean
you won't be able to fool that eye
scanning technology by for example just
holding up a photo of someone's eyes it
does work better in bright lights if
you're in a really sort of dark room
then there is this big area of white
space on the screen that should provide
enough light to just get the eye
scanning tech working says he also says
it's not going to be a problem to use
that eye scanning technology if you're
wearing glasses now let's talk cameras
so on the back this is a 16 megapixel
camera if I spin it around on the front
that's an 8 megapixel camera so loads of
pixels to play with for your video calls
and selfies so elsewhere this is a 5.5
inch display you get 3 gigabytes of RAM
it's got a quad core processor as well
and there's 16 gigabytes of on-board
storage which you can beef up using a
micro SD card if that's not enough space
so quick note on design what we're
looking at here is a pre-production
model so the final version won't have
this little circular homescreen icon and
it won't be available in white either so
the eye recognition tech is definitely
interesting we're looking forward to the
full review where we'll be finding out
exactly how practical that is and how
well it really works alright that's all
for now but check out C Netcom /mw C for
much more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
