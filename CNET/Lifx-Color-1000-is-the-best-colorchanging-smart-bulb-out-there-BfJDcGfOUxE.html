the front-runner in the color changing
smart bulb category but I think there's
a new bulb to beat and that's this one
the lifx LED this is the
second-generation version of the lifx
color-changing bulb it's a lot like the
original it's a little bit smaller but
the same general design and it has the
same attractive color quality of the
original the greens look green the Blues
look blue everything looks true and
vivid that's a little bit better than
Phillip - which can't quite put out a
nice exhibit green let's take a look at
that photo there it's yellow and washed
out now color qualms aside Philips hues
big advantage up until now is that it
had a very nice platform that worked
with almost anything but lie fix is
caught up it has a nice Windows 10 app
it works the Nest Learning Thermostat
you can use it on if and you can
automate it using the Amazon echo smart
speaker so here if I take the Amazon
echo smart speaker and ask Alexa to
change my bulb green the bulb will turn
green on top of that the lifx color 1000
is a brighter option than the newest
Philips hue bulbs puts out over a
thousand lumens at its default setting
of 3,500 K you can see this graph here
of all the white light settings it
offers it's the strongest there at the
default setting trails off a bit at the
top and the bottom of the spectrum there
but still a nice bulb in terms of that
white light spectrum something else I
like the lifx prices come down when I
first debut the bulbs cost $100 each but
now they're down to 60 bucks apiece
that's the same as you'll pay for
philips hue and because this bulb uses
Wi-Fi to connect directly with your home
network you don't need a hub and you
don't need to buy a two hundred dollar
starter kit to get into the system
that's a very nice appealing way to add
bulbs to your home outside of that I
think that the life Excalibur and is the
bulb that I would go with I wanted to
add color-changing smart light my</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
