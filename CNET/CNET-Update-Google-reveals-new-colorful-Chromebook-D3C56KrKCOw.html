cheap laptops I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your cnet update google has released
another budget-friendly laptop the HP
Chromebook 11 is on sale now for two
hundred and eighty dollars it's cheaper
than most laptops because it's not like
most laptops this doesn't run Windows it
runs the Chrome operating system and if
you need to download specific programs
for your work you can't really do that
on a Chromebook but if you do all or
most of your work and entertainment
online and many of us do these days then
it's worth considering this year's model
has a sleek new design and you can get
it in white with a choice of accent
color in Google's primary favorites
green yellow red and blue or if color
isn't for you just go with all black the
screen is 50% brighter than most laptops
and the speakers are tucked under the
keyboard also unique is that it's
charged via a micro USB port so this
laptop charger can also charge your
other devices that's a chord saver while
traveling as for other specs it has two
USB ports a vga webcam and a slimport
video out it has two gigs of ram and a
16 gig solid-state drive wayne and at
2.3 pounds you could see this as a
lightweight secondary computer for
getting online quickly a spare laptop
for kids doing homework and its price
also makes it a laptop that Google is
pushing for schools more than 5000
schools are using Chromebooks in the
classroom there is a 4g model being made
but the price has not been announced yet
if that laptop doesn't excite you then
how about a smart smoke detector for the
home huh nest is a company run by a
former designer for the ipod and after
making a smart home thermostat the
company now is trying to bring sexy back
to smoke detectors with the nest protect
no more annoying chirps when the battery
is low and it won't start blaring if you
just burnt the cookies it'll tell you
what room it detects smoke or carbon
monoxide in and the alarm will get loud
if things get serious it works with a
smartphone app each of these units is
130 dollars and to outfit your home you
up to invest in four or five so it can
get pricey and here is a little perk for
amazon kindle fire tablet owners amazon
is giving away money for buying certain
apps seriously well the money is credit
in amazon coins but it is part of a
promotion for Amazon's App Store you can
find these money making apps in the
amazon appstore coins rewards category
some apps or in-app purchases can earn
two dollars and fifty cents in coins
that's your tech news update but you can
get more details at cnet com / update
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
