but it's charging the least I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update
t-mobile will finally begin selling the
iphone five on Friday April twelfth
t-mobile's the last of the major
carriers to sell the iphone but buying a
smartphone on t-mobile now has a new
twist there are no more contracts
t-mobile is breaking away from the
traditional model by offering data plans
that are cheaper and simpler also
there's a lower upfront cost to getting
a top-of-the-line smartphone customers
can get the iphone 5 for a hundred
dollars and just pay twenty dollars a
month for two years to pay off the cost
of the phone it also costs one hundred
dollars to walk out with the galaxy s4
the HTC One and blackberry z10 so if you
wanted to splurge and go with the top
smartphone and t-mobile's unlimited data
plan you'll pay ninety dollars a month
that's seventy dollars for the service
and 20 for the phone feet until you pay
it off not only does it come out to be
cheaper than other carriers but you also
paid less for the phone up front if you
want to leave t-mobile at any time you
can because there's no service contract
you're just responsible for paying off
the phone and if you want you can trade
that phone back for credit or if you
want to keep the phone and leave
t-mobile will unlock it for you if
you're looking for a deal it's cheaper
to buy the iphone 5 from t-mobile than
buying it unlocked from Apple the only
downside of using t-mobile is that the
wireless network isn't as advanced as
some others t-mobile just launched 4g
LTE speeds in seven markets and it will
expand that network throughout the year
it seems google is desperate to get
people to think it's social network is
cool I say that because it just added
the option to allow an animated gif as a
profile picture on google plus but
google did make a more useful update to
its Google Plus apps for Apple and
Android devices the app has new photo
filters and editing options and users
can share their location with specific
circle groups you'll notice that
Facebook has added the option to reply
to someone within comment threads but
the options only for brands or company
pages and popular public figures with
more than 10,000 followers
that way when comments get out of
control you could just reply directly to
one commenter so it's easier to read we
have car news rolling out this week as
the new york auto show kicks off and
cars are getting more techy the new BMW
6-series has a voice recognition system
that lets the driver dictate emails and
text messages and it also has a new
digital instrument cluster so you can
switch it to look traditional or
sporting and the car compared to phones
at a time that's your tech news update
you can find more details at cnet com /
update and you can follow along on
Twitter from our studios in New York I'm
