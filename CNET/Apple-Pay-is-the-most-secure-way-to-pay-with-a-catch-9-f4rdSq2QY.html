a new concept but with the launch of
Apple pay it might be something people
actually start doing Apple pay works
like this when you're checking out at
the cash register you'll grab your
iPhone then without even waking up your
device tap or wave the phone in front of
the credit card terminal within a few
seconds you'll choose the card you want
to pay with scan your fingerprint with
touch ID and you're on your way out it's
true that using a plastic card doesn't
take much longer but that's not why
you're using Apple pay when you buy
things using your phone the merchant you
never seized your credit card number in
fact your card number isn't even stored
on your iPhone what the merchant does
see is a token a random 16 digit number
that's as useful as an expired credit
card tokens are stored in the secure
element it's super secure tamper proof
and can be only accessed when you
initiate a transaction that's why only
the iPhone 6 and 6-plus can use Apple
pay they've got the secure element Apple
isn't the first to introduce mobile
payments flashback to 2012 when Google
Wallet launched and you'll experience a
little deja vu
there was tokenization there was a
secure element and there was a pretty
fast checkout experience
well Google didn't have was the
infrastructure but it is available for
instance cabs in New York City they
accept Google Wallet still there are
only two hundred and twenty thousand
stores in the u.s. that can actually
accept Apple pay but hang on tight by
the end of 2015 a new law will encourage
many merchants to switch to smarter
credit card terminals until then
consider using Apple pay where you can
you'll be thankful during the next
credit card secure
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
