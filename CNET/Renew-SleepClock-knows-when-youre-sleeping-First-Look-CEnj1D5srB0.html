bringing you guys a mobile accessory
this time called the renew sleep clock
by gear for now this device isn't like
most clocks but it has many of the same
functions you can still charge and play
music from your iPhone iPod or iPad play
the FM radio and set an alarm through
its free app called renew but what makes
sleep clock different is that it can
monitor your sleep pattern through a
radio frequency emitter that sits behind
the clocks interface without using any
wires or watches to start make sure the
device is nearby your body without any
obstruction then set your alarm before
you go to bed you can use an exact time
or if you want to be slowly waking up
you can choose a window of time where
the sleep clock will play an alarm and
increase the volume gradually for your
alarm you can pick your music the radio
or a list of sounds that comes included
in the app when you're done hit the
sleep button the clock will immediately
start tracking your breathing and motion
patterns as the night goes on and logs
all this info in an easy-to-read manner
you can also access nightly weekly
monthly or yearly summaries of how well
you slept see how many hours of deep
sleep you got if you have a consistent
sleep routine and how you compared to
the average of someone your age and sex
through this app you can also dim the
clocks interface send reminders to
yourself to go to sleep and share your
sleep summaries on Facebook and Twitter
the renew sleep clock works with the
iphone 3gs and up the third and fourth
generation of ipod touches and the ipad
and ipad 2 it's sold in Apple stores for
199 dollars again I'm Lynn from cnet
bringing you guys the renew sleep clock
from gear for
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
