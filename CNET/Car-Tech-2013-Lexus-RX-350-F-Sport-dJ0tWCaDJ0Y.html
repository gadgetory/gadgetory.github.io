crossover market let's see how its
faring 15 years later as we do a quick
look at the 2013 lexus rx350 F Sport and
check the tech now given seen in rx in a
while the styling has more edges than
you may recall and the new family face
called the spindle grille our F Sport
Edition has an even deeper Messi version
of that grille several sporty body cues
around the edges and 19's in all four
corners instead of 18s but all our X's
remain to row 5 passenger vehicles no
revolution inside but the Lexus cabin
remains handsome and very tech looking 9
speaker audio is based with all the
important sources including USB and
bluetooth streaming you can bump it up
to 12 speaker premium sound or all the
way up to 15 speaker Levinson surround
audio and 330 watts but annoyingly to
get HD radio you also have to get a
backup camera I don't mind that but not
everybody wants those things tied remote
touch is the controller when you get
navigation a bass Rx wouldn't have this
and no one else has a controller like it
navigation as I mentioned is optional
whichever package you get it in will
also bring you the inform app suite with
Bing Pandora OpenTable Yelp and more
under the hood the f-sport rx gets the
same powertrain as every other rx that
is not a hybrid that's a three and a
half liter v6 doing 270 horse 248
foot-pounds of torque 0 to 60 and 7.7
seconds very garden-variety rx stuff mpg
is a little underwhelming at 1826 but
not awful for this profile and weight of
a vehicle now where the base rx has a
six speed and front-wheel drive an F
Sport has an eight speed and requires
all-wheel drive
mention of the F sport is well sport but
not adaptive or anything tricky
it's just firmer which can mean harsher
I've been underwhelmed by the escort
bars I've driven so far I feel they
missed the mark of what Alexis is so
good at refined hi-tech luxury that is
dead reliable these are not AMG or M
fighters especially the rxf sport since
it has no power train bump as a result I
don't feel the package is worth the
harsher ride and slightly poser trim
that detracts from Lexus luxury let's
try the 2013 Lexus RX CNET style
I'd go base with an RX 350 naught F
Sport at just under 42 delivered get the
Navin camera package for about 6700 that
will also include the remote touch
controller back up camera and forum apps
heated and cooled seats HID headlights
and more become in just shy of 50 grand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
