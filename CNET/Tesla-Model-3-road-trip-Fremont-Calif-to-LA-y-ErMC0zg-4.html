and because I picked it up in Fremont I
have to get it back home which means
roadtrip time so I'm gonna be trying out
autopilot for the first time I am gonna
get my tunes going I've heard the stereo
system is awesome
we are gonna supercharge down at the
Madonna Inn in San Luis Obispo and
hopefully we're gonna make it back to LA
before dark but I doubt it so let's go
it appears that the built-in radio
options or music options on the car are
kind of like radio stations so if I
decide I want to play Sophie Tucker I
can only play Sophie Tucker radio unless
I go to my iPhone and switch over to
bluetooth which hands down this is the
best sounding Bluetooth connection I
have ever heard for music in a car it's
amazing I would really love it if in the
future maybe Tesla integrated Apple
music Spotify I mean TuneIn is there but
I don't use TuneIn so one or more of
those streaming music services would be
super handy especially considering most
people have an Android phone or an
iPhone like those things seem like they
should be the default I'm using the
adaptive cruise control and it's set to
four car lengths
I don't have to break it off we go
through curves and sort of slow this
down as it eats too you know we just
kind of glide right through pretty nice
I think it's time to activate autopilot
I'm a little bit scared I'm a little bit
excited area you gotta do the stock
twice there we go
it says keep your hands a loyal which I
certainly will be doing both get this
car driving itself oh my god I'm
freaking out we're going on a curve I
loosen it I've been flipping through
some of the options here and I found an
option to turn on creep which is
allowing the car to kind of roll forward
if you take your foot off the brake at a
stop sign and as a Californian who
enjoys her California stops it's a good
option we're not running terribly low on
battery but we do need to recharge to
finish our trip so we're going to stop
at the Madonna and super charger and
also eat cake
all right oh wait wait do this I
remember yeah press the button and it's
let's open it open hey all right all
right there we go is charging the green
lights flashing we're doing it charges
car
supercharging is done it was really fast
surprisingly fast and I paid about 1250
for a supercharged session that got me
to 90% Tesla says to charge the battery
anywhere between 10 and 90 percent
that's where it likes to live so I did
that and we're ready to get back on the
road let's go home
that's it road trip is over this is your
stop
I am all done here I'm taking this thing
to go get washed immediately because
it's covered in bugs but until next time
I will see you on the road me good
