operating system has had a little-known
feature called services that can
significantly speed up some common tasks
in most applications on the MEK it
appears under the application name in
the menu bar now for some apps they're
not coded to properly use services but
the majority of apple's applications do
so what can you do with services well
plenty for starters ever run across an
email just that hasn't been linked to
and want to email that person just
highlight the email address go to the
application name then services then mail
then select send to services will
automatically open up mail and put the
email address in the from field without
you having to copy and paste when here
text spoken by the max it built in voice
synthesizer instead of launching
universal access options just highlight
the text go services and select speech
then start speaking text all your base
are belong to us need to grab a
screenshot of your desktop select
services then grab then screen it will
automatically insert the screenshot into
your document there are even some
keyboard shortcuts for launching some
Universal Services want to open up a
sticky note hit command shift why when I
search for some text in google hit
command shift l need to find a piece of
text in a document on your computer
using spotlight hit command shift F
there are dozens and dozens of built-in
services in the mac OS but services is
actually extendable some applications
will automatically install their own
services to this menu like skype if
there's a common test that you want to
perform there's probably service out
there on the web for you I'm Wilson Tang
