looking forward to in 2019 and once and
for all
what's the best Christmas movie well hey
what's going on everybody welcome to
CNET's nope sorry the debate show where
I Jeff Bakalar argue with my friends and
colleagues over three rounds of dead
serious debate joining me on today's
program is I as act our host of alphabet
city and all of those YouTube videos you
love so very much welcome Aya's thanks
for having it's a damn pleasure all
right here's how the game works we've
got three rounds and three topics is and
I will debate each topic and we will
receive five points that are up for
grabs for each round
who's assigning those points you asked
well it's none other than our moustached
long-haired friend you know him from
Dazed and Confused mr. Nick Henry
what's up Nick hey Jeff how's it going
buddy oh it's going great you know I'm
excited to be here let's get to the
first round we flipped a coin before the
show started
Aya's is gonna go first in the first and
third round mr. Henry lead us off please
pour the first round as you guys know
2019 is coming up pretty soon it's it's
a parent oh yeah and there's some stuff
coming out next year that we already
know about for this round you have to
pick one piece of tech that you should
care about in 2019 90 seconds on the
clock
far away okay Andriy origami proteins
all were made better by folding now
folding phones are gonna be the future
it's gonna take a stagnant product these
boring devices that we all carry and it
would be much larger and way more fun
larger batteries and as large device
that fits in your pocket folding phones
for the future and would be amazing in
2019 okay all right that sounds fine I'm
not so sure how much a bigger battery is
something I want to be looking forward
to in 2019 I am cautiously emphasis on
the cautious I'm cautiously optimistic
about the notion of 5g just because I
want to get rid of my internet provider
at home they will remain nameless but I
hate them and I want them to die a fiery
death because they are slow and they are
way behind the competition and it's a
damn monopoly where I live let's get rid
of the monopolies let's enter the world
of 5g where it doesn't matter where you
live hopefully as long as you're within
some sort of range of receiving that
high-speed the Exede know you can get
that that internet over the air and it
can be your home internet and you don't
have to worry about it I am hoping I am
praying that 5g has some kind of
legitimate presence in 2019 I look
cautiously optimistic I know it's gonna
take a while the rollout but let's go 5g
don't don't don't depressed
I think 2019 is gonna be the year budget
all right we'll see well we'll see what
happens what happened there mr. Nick
Henry I as is excited for folding phones
I think that's something really
different and I think he made some
pretty good points of why that would
actually be a good thing other than it
just mean a gimmick but you made some
nice points with 5g too and I am I
understand your frustration with
internet companies I think izes was just
a little more positive a little bit more
future thinking so I'm gonna do three
two ayahs and two two Jeff Bakalar okay
fair enough now I just need to be
positive to make Nick happy okay now the
new year is all about being positive at
least at the beginning oh I'm sure I'm
sure Tory 19 is gonna be super positive
all right three to two after one round I
will be leading off this next topic
what's it gonna be mr. Mitch Kramer all
right for round two we just said 2019 is
all about being positive but we're gonna
flip that right away what piece of tech
do you hope meets its end in 2019 90
seconds on the clock take it away all
right I am hoping and praying for the
death of all kinds of activation codes
I'm talking two-factor authentication
I'm talking put this code in to activate
your HBO subscription I don't want to
email anyone back I don't want to verify
anything I don't want to get texted a
code I don't want to get figure out a
new goddamn way I am so sick of doing
this why are we living which 2019 and we
have to fumble around with our phones
just to confirm that I'm the person all
that stuff is nonsense too because it is
the most hackable sim swapping capable
stuff ever I don't want to activate
anything get rid of these alphanumeric
codes I feel like we're you know I sure
as don't want to do eyes I never
again want to click on a tile where all
the traffic lights are I don't want to
do that well I'm this is the future well
guess what the future sucks I share your
rage about the activation codes but my
rage is set for fax machines because I
freaking hate these things still exist
when somebody tells you hey you send it
by fast they might as well tell you get
a carrier pigeon you can do it but why
it's 2018 the no 2019 and we still got
these idiotic things going through these
thermal
printers why why can't somebody take
their phone scan it and send it it's
such a waste of time and every time I
have to communicate with another person
goes back to me I want to say another
f-word no look I'm with you with that
but it's it's lawyers lawyers are the
reason they're still fax machines I'm
telling you they're like they're in love
with them Donna it's like big fax
machine I don't know anyway what do you
think they're mr. fax machine well I
think both of you guys have dealt with a
lot more lawyers in 2018 than me which
is surprising but uh I liked both of
your arguments I am frustrated by both
of these things I think yeah I factor
she's really really grounding your gears
yeah that's all I was gonna say I think
I use activation codes a bit more than
fax machines and I think most people
would say that as well and it is a very
annoying thing you said that it was very
hackable though Jeff and I feel like
this is a step that's kind of needed
right now in 2019 to prevent hacks as
much as possible so to say that is
hackable without any actual concrete
evidence I thought was a little
problematic I liked
izes carrier pigeon reference so I'm
gonna have to give three points to Jeff
and two points to is oh man all right
it's 5:00 5:00 we're tied up it's a dead
heat that's the best kind of nope sorry
you could ask for round three is gonna
decide who takes this one home I is
gonna go first with the topic Nick what
is it all right
sudden death round we we you know we've
stuck in this this tech round for the
first two rounds which you know as you
know I'm like a huge tech guy but for
this third round we're sticking with the
with the holiday spirit what is the best
Christmas movie mine is the 12 dogs of
Christmas but I am NOT in this debate so
90 seconds on the clock go greatest
movie of all time
clearly gremlins because it's got the
best mix of or comedy and a huge moral
lesson for all the kids never dress up
the Santa Clause and go down a chimney
or you'll end up like he became its dad
it is the greatest story that's told
within the movie
and there are gremlins in it the title
is fantastic if you didn't know what
you're gonna get you have some weird
stuff going on plus it takes place
during Christmas what else would you
watch like it's a wonderful life which
actually plays in the movie so it's
definitely a Christmas movie so anybody
saying it's not a Christmas movie you're
wrong no that's a Christmas so I think
that's my point on gremlins for now okay
I think the best Christmas movie is a
little film called Trading Places it's
an 80s film it's arguably one of the
finest comedies of the last 40 years it
has an amazing cast you've got dan
Aykroyd you've got Eddie Murphy you've
got Jamie Lee Curtis you've got some
cameos here and there not only does it
include one of the most ridiculous Santa
Clause poor trails in the history of
movies where Dan Aykroyd is like a drunk
psychotic Santa Claus who's like who's
got a gun and he's like stuffing salmon
in his pants it is an amazing film
not to mention surrounded by the whole
Christmas spirit the bad guys wind up
getting what's coming to them in that
film good prevails it teaches a good
lesson and it teaches an amazing
economics in stock market lesson to boot
that people still talk about those man's
inhumanity to man we did what it's
overcome its overcome its its overcome
Nick Henry what's the best Christmas
movie this was tough they're both fine
movies you guys both argued them very
well I was gonna say Jeff was again
going a little too negative but then he
said the message was good the message
spread the Christmas cheer the show he
kind of saved himself there however I
think I has argued that gremlins are
such a unique movie and it shows it's a
wonderful life within the movie so it's
got this kind of meta you know one like
modern Christmas movies so therefore I'm
given the round two is three two is very
close I went if there was decimal points
it would be like a two point seven two
two professional points don't exist on
this show Nick you and I both know that
very well
eight to seven is the final score I as
Akhtar is your winner for this episode
of nope sorry what did he win gets what
I guess you want some drew
I shampoo oh wow I've always seen this
like on television to the stars that's
the best that's Nick Henry trying to
tell us something I guess look at those
look at those locks though who could
argue with that
that's gonna do it for this episode of
nope sorry if you want to submit a topic
for us to debate on the next program
please leave a comment in the section
below until next time thanks for
watching
oh yeah mr. Kramer we're looking for you
