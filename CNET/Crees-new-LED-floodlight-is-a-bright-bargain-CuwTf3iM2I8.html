the second gen Cree BR 30 LED floodlight
now this is a new bulb from Cree that
takes the existing BR 30 floodlight and
adds some subtle improvements and cuts
the cost down from twenty dollars to ten
dollars that's a pretty significant cut
that first gen bulb was more expensive
than all of these good competitors you
see here and the new version the bulb
cost less than them now if I turn the
bulb on here you can see it's got a nice
yellow eat glow at 2700 K you can also
get a version with a wider color
temperature of 5000 K for a dollar more
it's a little brighter than last year's
model about 50 lumens brighter at 700
lumens or so and it's also more
efficient it's got a power draw of nine
watts as opposed to 9.5 watts before now
those are pretty incremental steps
forward it's a very slight improvement
over last year's model but again that
price is half of what used to be so I
like that a lot
however it also has some of the same
weaknesses as last year's bulb
last year's bulb wasn't very good at
dimming it flickered a bit on the dimmer
switch as we tested this one had the
same problem as flickered goes it's
definitely very light but if you're a
stickler it might bug you
last year's bulb was also not the best
in terms of heat management and this
bulb is almost the exact same you look
at this graph shows how the light levels
off after about an hour so you can see
that the two cream olbes that red line
on that blue line are perfectly mirrored
right there at the bottom that's not a
bad result anything north of 85 percent
at that steady-state is a good result
but other bulbs like the GE reveal and
the green Creative Cloud LED did a lot
better something else of note is that
along with cutting the price in half
Cree cut the warranty in half last
year's bulbs gave you 10 years of
coverage this bulb only gives you 5
that's still good but not as good as
before so if you like that long-term
protection you might be disappointed
although you'd have to be happy with the
fact that this is the cheapest major
manufacturer of floodlight on the market
today and run out the home depot and
grab one right now for 10 dollars that's
as lower prices you'll find I like that
a lot because if you need a bulb like
this you probably need more than one you
probably have a lot of recessed fixtures
in your home
need to upgrade a whole bunch of bulbs
and a low price point is gonna be very
enticing if you have dimmer switches
maybe consider splurging on the GE
reveal BR 30 LEDs I couldn't get that
just flicker no matter how hard I tried
but this bulb is still pretty good from
basic lighting setups and worth the cost
for more check out the full review at
cnet.com and hit me up on Twitter with
any light bulb questions you've got
we're seeing that appliances I'm right
