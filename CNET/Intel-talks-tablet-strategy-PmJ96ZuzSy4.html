the general manager for our tablet
business unit so responsible for all I'm
sorry responsible for all of our tablet
business engagements with our customers
and driving Intel to be successful in
tablets exactly so what is android made
to entail now in 2014 there's a lot of
food oh I saw the dual boot the
switching tablet downstairs got a good
demo that how
i Henry just can be hugely important for
us on tablets you see everybody sees
where how much subtractions got in the
marketplace we're doing Oliver
development both on windows-based
tablets as well as android-based tablets
will give our customers to choice
whether and they want to run Windows on
a machine they went to run android on
that same machine or they want have a
dual boot option to get a customer
request company do do you have any idea
any sense from customers how many doable
devices were coming out in 2014 I know
zs uses both on 11 and 13 that's all
I've heard there's a few coming out a
lot of customers are looking at an
explorer ian what we really think is in
bandages with the x86 architecture we
can support android or windows or both
on the same machine that gives customers
choice and flexibility right
but enticement of a dual-boot switching
really excited not Little Buddha Julius
would really switched about distraction
it's like three or four seconds yes that
seems to be the really new thing as far
as so I understand Intel's manager so
but you think it's more than just as
soon as obviously you think there are
other bigger Liam Twomey our two
switching tablets like that and yeah I
would expect to see some others coming
out over the course of the year and
again they're exploring they're trying
to understand the opportunities in the
usage models so really I think most of
the machines that you'll see in the
market are going to be Android specific
or Windows specific but you'll certainly
see a few experiments in a dual OS fire
do you not have any idea how those
tablets work by the way how they share
memory or anything like that we could we
do okay you have we're going to do a
deeper technical 1 i'd love to have a
conversation with you look guys it can
go through like how you manage the
memory between the machines how you
accelerate switching time between the
two operating systems it's pretty cool
and the switching part is that in the
silicon actually or is that an assault
as a strictly software its offer
Drummond or it can be given by heart key
but there's a say you have to have the
base silicon support to enable that okay
and that's silicon supporters in has
well of course is it is it in
hey Carol it's actually in any Intel SOC
or any Intel processors so with the x86
architecture we can support windows or
android on any of those machines okay
and one questions always been in my mind
since you know this nature LP man i
should say is so as well is also very
attractive for example I've a surface
pro 2 that's ball inside I'm George
mallet so are you sending any shift
maybe a little bit shift towards as well
or more you know I'm more welcoming
attitude to attachment and maybe before
I know I think people are really excited
about householding it's a great product
it gives you an incredible increase in
battery life relative to where you're on
ivy bridge and graphic support
significantly increase with I word some
graphics right says if you look at the
tablet market next year or sorry this
year it's probably 280 million units the
pc market is will north of 200 million
with a market that size you're gonna
have people that are going to want to
buy us to our great performance and a pc
like experience as well is the perfect
product for that you're gonna have a lot
of people who are going to want the
thinnest lightest for a factor the
longest possible battery life and
baytril is a perfect solution for there
so i think the market is big enough for
these architectures to code this we
really giving people choice about what
they want
um in del city now I was
was it a target of 40 million this year
tablets or is it was that stated
explicitly what I believe Brian said and
the analyst report is a4x increasing the
tablet units you're on your relatives
were so that comes to roughly forty nine
we're saying 4x will left the analysts I
DeMatha what I think it really says is
that Intel is making a real decks in the
tablet market place as a reflection of
our confidence in our architecture and
the products were bringing to market and
the great partnership we have with our
OEM customers but that has something to
do with the Android to write the back
gate Android yeah because that's such a
huge mobile OS sure it's about great
windows tablets great too and ones great
Android devices we're going to have
Android in seven and eight inch and 10
inch devices absolutely we're gonna
dress every part of market we can you
want every operating system with our
dust on Intel Architecture okay and
finally looking forward to Broadwell and
what's the next what comes after bay bay
trail is i talked about cherry trail
which is very first 40 nanometer SOC and
is that coming out this year we have
talked about production in 2014 and then
we're not going to get more specific
about lunch okay Broadwell is coming to
see
in the second row odwalla started for a
second okay great thank you very much
