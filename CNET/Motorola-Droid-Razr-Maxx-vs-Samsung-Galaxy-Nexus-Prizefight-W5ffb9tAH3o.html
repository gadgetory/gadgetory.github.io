and this is a battle between two of the
baddest 4G LTE phones Verizon has to
offer
it's a prizefight punch out between the
Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX and the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus our judges for this fight
are senior editor brian sings like tony
bennett senior associate editor jessica
tennis gold court and myself ring a ling
a ding tone now we'll take all three
judges blind scores and average them out
to the nearest tenth each round the
final prizefight score will be an
average of all rounds using the same
festival system it's 5:00 Rumble and
tumble rounds first is designed the
Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX takes its
previously skinny form factor and fills
it with more battery giving us a better
balanced design with its 4.3 inch HD
AMOLED display its build quality is
top-notch with a Kevlar backing that
actually might stop bullets and a
water-resistant nano coating now the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus is slightly more
narrow and it's easier to hold but it
brings a larger screen at 4.65
inches of HD AMOLED glory it also brings
us one of the first curved glass
displays with smooth rounded corners and
a textured backing now I personally love
its contour design but the premium build
of the RAZR MAXX takes this round with a
4.7 and the Galaxy Nexus gets a 4.3 next
round is user interface and control
it can't be any more different here the
RAZR MAXX brings its best iteration of
the motoblur interface with its social
networking hooks I'm a big fan of their
lockscreen with quick access to the
camera or muting the sound but this is
still running on top of gingerbread with
a vague promise of Ice Cream Sandwich in
the future and it's holding it back the
Galaxy Nexus brings us the sweetest
flavor of Android yet and we love the
clean look and feel of the Ice Cream
Sandwich UI settings within apps it can
be a little frustrating because there
are different places you'll have the
facial recognition unlocked if you're
into yourself which I am and other bells
and whistles like data usage tracking I
scream you scream we all scream for ice
cream and it's the difference maker here
the Galaxy Nexus gets a perfect vibe and
the razor max gets a 4 so after
averaging 2 rounds
Samsung leads by 3 tenths of a point
next round is features these phones are
feature packed freaks of nature with
dual-core processors and 4G LTE
connectivity but the Motorola RAZR MAXX
stands out with its 16 gigs of internal
storage and an expansion slot supporting
up to 32 gigs it brings an HDMI out port
Bluetooth 4.0 support and a web top
functionality plus on the software side
it's smart actions that changes aspects
of your phone depending on what you're
doing are unique and useful now the
Galaxy Nexus brings us a sharper screen
that really can't be beat and 32 gigs of
internal storage is a hefty amount but
there's no expansion options you'll need
a dock for HDMI out and one of its
killer features NFC works for beaming
contacts and info to limited phones but
it's Google Wallet feature has been
crippled by Verizon the RAZR MAXX swings
back with a perfect 5 and the galaxy
nexus gets a 4 next round is web
browsing and multi media web browsing on
both phones is almost a push but on the
Galaxy Nexus it's sharper screen is
evident here on top of having an updated
browser with features like saving a page
for offline viewing and when it comes to
viewing multimedia again Samsung comes
out on top with a bigger screen and a
crystal clear image quality that will
make you double take now with the
cameras the razor max is 8 megapixel
eyeball took clear shots for some scenes
but the colors were more washed out
overall compared to Samsung's 5
megapixel sensor so it's no surprise the
Galaxy Nexus takes this round with a
perfect 5 and the razor max gets a 4
after averaging 4 rounds Samsung still
leads by 2 tenths of a point it's still
anyone's fight and the final round that
decides it all is called quality and
performance both of these phones have
solved call quality overall at times the
Galaxy Nexus might be described as a
little tinny but that's being nitpicky
now the Droid RAZR MAXX is battery life
is its claim to fame and it delivered
with 20 plus hours of talk time in our
CNET test it's the best of any 4G LTE
phone on the market that will last you
from the morning to your lunchtime break
all the way through dinner and when you
wake back up it's amazing and if you
want to watch a movie our tests at 50%
screen brightness lasted 19 hours and 47
minutes straight that's just plain dirty
the RAZR MAXX delivers in the final
round with a perfect 5 and the Galaxy
Nexus gets a 4 so let's average out all
5 rounds and enterprise buy it where the
Galaxy Nexus took a lead early the RAZR
MAXX fought back in the final round and
we end up tied at 4.5 points apiece but
you know we're here to find a winner and
we go to the hundreds of a point where
the Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX takes this
battle 4.54 to four point four six and
is your prize fight winner
this was another epic battle that could
have gone either way but it ultimately
comes down to if you want the Galaxy
Nexus with androids most modern
operating system or you want the RAZR
MAXX
that can hold its own and will last you
days i'm brian tom thanks for watching
we'll catch you guys next time
for an another prize buy this
