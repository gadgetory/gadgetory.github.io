lying around
you also have an old hard drive that you
could be using as an external hard drive
all you need to do is remove that
storage and put it in an enclosure
together they make a pretty cheap
external hard drive but before you go
out and do that there are a few things
you need to know if you pull your drive
from a laptop it'll be a 2.5 inch drive
that looks something like this
if you pulled the internal drive out of
a desktop it'll be a lot bigger a 3.5
inch drive that looks like this most
people are going to be dealing with a
SATA drive but if your drive came from
an older machine from before 2003 it'll
be a pay to drive so just keep that in
mind now that you know what kind of
drive you have it's time to start
thinking about the enclosures so there
are a few things you'll want to look for
first of all make sure you're picking
the right size for your drive a 2.5 inch
enclosure looks like this and in
enclosure for a 3.5 inch drive looks
something like this one difference that
you'll notice with this one is that
it'll come with an AC adapter which
makes it a little bulkier and not so
good for portability next you'll want to
pick your external interface that
determines what kind of connection
you'll use to hook up your drive in most
cases you'll go with a USB 2.0
connection because any computer can
connect with that but if your computer
can take USB 3.0 or firewire go with
that those are faster connections now
that you have those details out of the
way the last thing to consider is what
the enclosure is made out of when you're
shopping for enclosures you'll notice
that they come in aluminum or plastic
always go with aluminum it'll keep your
drive a lot cooler okay once you have
your enclosure in hand all that's left
to do is put it together and that's
really simple I'll grab my hard drive
and put these two connectors together
now I'll take this part put it back in
the enclosure
and screw it in with the provided screws
and the provided screwdriver give it a
good twist and my external hard drive is
complete now this enclosure came with
this court it has mini USB on one side
and two USB connectors on the other
reason being that this drive needs more
power than normal USB devices so I'll
put my mini USB in here connect both of
these USB cords to my laptop and there
it is my computer recognized it just
like it would any other drive so now I
can open it up browse some really old
files on here or I can reformat it and
start with a clean slate if you have any
questions during this process please let
me know on Twitter and check out the
accompanying blog for more tips for
