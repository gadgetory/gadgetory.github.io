Amazon I'm Bridget Carey this is your
cnet update it looks like google has its
eyes on amazon google has a plan to put
a Buy Now button right next to the
products that you find in search this is
according to a report from The Wall
Street Journal the idea is to keep you
googling longer preventing you from
bouncing off to a retailer site or to
Amazon Google is not turning into a
store or doing the shipping rather
sources told the journal that Google's
talking to retailers to come up with
something similar to Amazon's 1-click
ordering system so Google handles the
transaction for you but let's be honest
it's going to take a lot more than a
button to get people to shop on google /
amazon most people go straight to amazon
to search for a product according to
forrester research because it's easy
when it comes to shopping amazon is
Google's biggest search competitor but
that's not all that's going on with
Google the voice control google now
program has a new trick you can control
your nest thermostat with voice commands
by using google's app on android and iOS
google bought nest labs for 3.2 billion
dollars back in january so it was only a
matter of time before nest tied into
google services google now shows the
status of the thermostat on your mobile
device and with your voice you can make
quick temperature changes you first have
to say the words ok Google followed by
your command such as set the temperature
to 72 degrees and on the topic of google
the search giant released the list of
the top trending search terms of 2014 as
you can guess big news stories rank high
the biggest spike in search was for
Robin Williams now when it comes to tech
stories good old flappy bird made it to
number five on the trending search list
right above the ALS ice bucket challenge
for users that typed in what is
questions what is Bitcoin came in at
number four what is gamergate and what
is whatsapp ranked sixth and seventh
whatsapp was acquired by Facebook this
year for 22 billion dollars even though
it has 600 million active users it's not
well known in the US the biggest how to
question on Google
was how to airdrop it's apples file
sharing feature introduced in iOS 7 back
in 2013 but this year Mac computers got
the ability to use airdrop between
mobile devices to share a photo from
your iPhone or iPad you have to go to
control center and activate airdrop and
then when you're on a photo you click
the share icon you'll have the option to
share it with anyone near you that also
has airdrop activated see you can always
count on seeing it to answer your google
questions that your tech news update and
there's always more at cnet com you can
follow me on Twitter to stay updated
