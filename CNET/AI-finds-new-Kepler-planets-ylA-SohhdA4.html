with eight planets in it NASA held a
press conference to discuss two planets
discovered using a neural network and
machine learning the event focused
specifically on Kepler 90i a planet
orbiting the star Kepler 90 the
discovery brought the total number of
known planets in the system to eight
which ties with our very own solar
system it's the first star known to have
at least as many planets orbiting it as
our own Sun and because the eight
planets orbitting kepler ninety are
located in the equivalent of our inner
solar system scientists said it could
mean systems with eight or more planets
are much more common than previously
known so how did a machine discover a
planet Christopher Shalu a senior
software engineer at Google AI and NASA
Sagan postdoctoral fellow Andrew
Vanderburgh built a neural network and
taught it to scan signals from existing
datasets collected by the Kepler
telescope machine learning allowed the
network to flag potential candidates for
planet designation spotting them even if
the signals were originally too weak to
catch the algorithm scan dips in
brightness as possible planets traveled
in front of their respective stars NASA
hopes the development means discovering
additional information in data about
existing systems by giving astronomers
even more time to investigate patterns
flagged as possible planets what do you
think machine learning could help
astronomers accomplish leave your ideas
