back with episode 126 of the three
fifty-nine sorry for the short hiatus I
was dying glad you're feeling better
thank you yeah we are back yeah look
better hello viewers happy Wednesday
we're glad to be back on YouTube you can
see our lovely faces again I guess no I
don't know i wasn't on on Monday or
Tuesday it's true yeah there's me and
Alfred mm-hmm filled in quite admirably
step okay that's fine that's fine i'll
try not to cry um so in in honor of
tonight's presidential debate we're
gonna we're gonna stick to one theme
politics that's right so leave now sorry
no Samsung Apple did the tree today yeah
yeah yeah bullying tech politics sure
yeah we're gonna be talking about
likelihood of voter fraud and whether or
not hackers can actually affect the
election rigged it's it's rigged it's
all wrong yeah so I can't I can't do it
and I'll just if to the entire thing but
now that cuz actually I because my nose
is stuffy but actually we did it already
yeah might jump in gagan not a safe
place then we'll be talking about what
Ben's stories the rise of cartoon Trump
on The Late Show Live animation it's
actually quite remarkable it's kind of
awesome yeah I mean you probably saw if
your Big Sisters fan you saw an example
that when I over did his live Q&amp;amp;A back
in May those back am well go lastly
we'll talk about a pair of unlikely
Democratic VP candidates that that
emerged that I never happened never
happened but emerged out of some of the
wiki leaks leaks yeah we don't actually
know if those are legit we couldn't
verify them we just won't throw it out
the Lord and talk about the way we're
talking about it anyways so did you have
any questions about this or frankly if
you have any questions about apple or
samsung google pixel well still try to
answer those as well i'll leave in the
comments section Brian will will pick
out the best and we'll uh let's get good
answer so yeah let's let's do it all
right we'll start the recording in three
two welcome to 339 when we talk about
the top tech news of the day
rap we want to throw in I'm Roger Cheng
I'm then Fox Rubin so in honor tonight's
presidential debate we wanted to go all
political first up is this election
rigged yes actually it's a lot harder
than you think one researcher found 31
instances of voter fraud between
2000-2014 which means that you are 15
times more likely to die by a lightning
strike then for voter fraud have been
committed yeah okay what I thought was
interesting about this story was how
messy the voter rolls can oh yeah yeah
so I guess if you're dead if you die if
you move yeah like there's no way for
the government to really keep track of
any of ya if you're gonna do something
as selfish as dying from old age do
people a favor let people know yeah let
the voter people know the Registrar
notice it's really not nice of you no
not cool folks I guess at the end of the
day it seems a little surprising that
there aren't more instances of voter
fraud considering how messy the rules
were but then again our story also
mentioned that there's a lot of
technology being used today to clean up
the voter rolls yes to make it harder
for me and my concern about voter fraud
and raked elections I mean it's a valid
one given the fact that they've been so
many hackings that that yeah we've had a
we've had hackers actually kind of
manipulate you know where the election
sort of going what the disclosures are
what the controversies are so yeah rest
assured though it seems like voter fraud
isn't actually as bad as anyone thinks
yes so go out and vote and your vote may
or may not be counted so on a related
note i have you been watching The Late
Show you've watched host Steve Colbert
talk with an animated version of Donald
Trump Ben you wrote this you wrote about
this tech that actually animate sir
bring to life cartoon Trump yeah tell me
more about this yeah it's Adobe
character animator it's a fairly new
form of software and there are a lot of
different kinds of software that are
already out there to do motion capture
and different forms of live animation
but this is really one of the first ones
that allows different shows and YouTube
youtubers to do this like quickly
cheaply and just do live animations so
you could do certain things like a live
Q&amp;amp;A with
cartoon character or like like Homer
Simpson from back in May right or in in
this instance there was a Late Show
episode back in july during the
democratic national convention that he
interviewed cartoon hillary clinton on
live television which is pretty cool
that's pretty awesome yeah daily so this
could go in a lot of different
directions I the idea is it the software
tracks your face right so yes so you can
you can sort make your mouth gestures
and Tom real-time yeah so so technically
like you don't have to be such a like a
genius programmer and writing you just
have to have a face right and you don't
have to the ideas that you have to prep
a lot of animation at a time yeah well
you can really do it live anyways right
like can have an animator go and like
sketch well that was the that was a joke
Homer Simpson made that joke like 20
years ago that like why aren't there a
lot more live animations and it's
because it's an incredible strain on the
animators right oh now here we are like
20 years later and it's actually coming
to 40 it'd be really cool to see what
ends up happening with it okay and last
we want to mention there are a couple
interesting VP pics that were at least
being considered back in march according
to a wikileaks leak so take it with a
grain of salt definitely but no no idea
what not this is true apparently it was
Tim Cook and bill gates were being
considered in the running for Hillary
Clinton's VP candidates I mean I okay
this is one-sided because like if you
know if tim cook or Bill Gates where a
state you want to be VP like why would
they go through that kind of the worst
job in the world I would tell them you
are not et cetera yeah the guy who or
the person who's behind the most
powerful man in the world but yeah or
woman or woman you're right we'll see
what happens in November will see for
more about these stories check us out on
cnet I brought your chain I'm Ben Fox
Rubin thanks for something and that is a
cut on the podcast recording we have a
few questions Alexander wants to know if
we specifically here at the table or if
anybody out there in podcast land have
done early voting I haven't their guy I
have done to it either I just moved a
man
and I plan on taking full advantage of
the law that lets me leave work to do
this ooh I like that there's a law sure
really there's some I mean it's it's not
like it's yeah it's more like a
gentleman's agreement but yeah i'm the
same way i'm probably gonna come to work
come to work late i think though in the
morning yeah i know i haven't early
voted but i'll try to come home or I'm
gonna try to come home early ish so I
can take my kids with me hopefully we
don't get like I don't know we'll see
what happens at the polling places it's
not going to be like pandemonium or
anything so yeah there will be various
people saying you know you're not
allowed to vote you don't look like you
belong here Wow was it various various
odd Trump from people with the the other
have you guys allowed to like they
weren't allowed to be within were like
50 feet of the yes all right yeah so
once you get clear that crowd your I'll
just I'll just run and then I'll be okay
throw your kid of the crowd oh all
jokes aside I like Eric an in the chats
sentiment like you should be paying
attention this is serious we should all
go vote absolutely yeah yeah I look I
would say it's too easy to kind of poo
poo on this and crack jokes yeah II crew
it it's all like this is a right and
responsibility engine that just to get
on my high horse for a second a lot of
people around the world don't a for
can't afford so I do sincerely plan to
take full advantage and take off of work
right now if you're I mean no matter how
to solutions you are about this and it's
been a crappy election yeah you should
definitely it doesn't matter who you go
for you should vote yes it's been a very
long hiring process for our new
president I'm afraid to bring this up
but a couple people have mentioned this
in the chat and I if I'm taking us down
a path I apologize in advance but what
is project veritas vert vert emeritus
project veritas is is yes is it so it's
a right-leaning quote-unquote media
operation yeah well what i do is think
speaking of paying a 10
like apparently I have not paid close
enough attention there's a guy that does
like various like videos where he tries
to get liberals to sell nursing things
well duh he does it this extension
something right yeah in cameras yeah
yeah cameras &amp;amp; sake did something
against NPR I think yeah he got like a
corn yes shut down that stuff like that
so that's nothing new how about its
history and I got a group it's the one
guy it's the guy and he has some buddies
yeah yeah yeah so I think he tried to to
Iran bone cyst don't really random that
that came up though yeah it's a
political podcast stereo so he tried to
hack the phone system for I think Nancy
Pelosi a couple years ago like I may
have gotten arrested for it oh just
google that don't don't take my word for
it yeah things are definitely nine um
let's see what else what else what else
what else yeah are you think why Bates
by the way tonight um yeah I've been
enjoying the two debates so I thought
the first one was definitely very
comical in that like Trump like just
really did not prepare like I thought
the rail so quickly I thought that that
was a scam that they were pulling at
first where they were like no he's not
going to prepare like it gave me the
expectations yeah exactly but like then
he really didn't prepare and it was like
pretty amazing to watch but then you
know the second debate was also kind of
interesting because he was he was doing
a lot of like walking around it was so
distracting I kept yelling at my
television to be like sit down well done
so a San else get at the cold open yeah
running to the shark maneuvers yeah yeah
Alec Baldwin is definitely doing a good
job with a trump impression yeah it's in
terms of comedy value is definitely yeah
so I will definitely be watching the
last one but I don't think I mean like
everything that I've been reading about
it is is that really shouldn't have that
much of an impact so right you know the
cake is baked your were less then if you
can bone you're probably waiting for for
that revelation right until well that
he's decided no his decide yeah he's one
of the undecideds right I feel like he
must have decided by now
I don't know he's been too busy dealing
read it so I've been trying to get Scott
Stein to dress up as ken Bohn for
Halloween ah we all really need this
yeah we really do anybody's chip in and
just by the sweater and yeah yes anybody
that's listening just tweet to Scott
steinitz at jets guide at Twitter and
just at this traveler akimbo just beg
him that just needs to dress up his ken
Bohn I'm sure he's not gonna take it
very well well does it all doesn't
change the fact if we have to make him
to it i would i would pay to see that
that's all I'm dollars in right now good
good let's let's try to make it happen
we've got a man yeah it's coming very
very soon yeah so the UH the vice
presidential thing is fascinating to me
like this would that would have been
such a joke yeah I'm sorry like I'm not
I'm not trying to say that Tim Cook is
not unintelligent or buildable orbital
gates are plausible they're just so much
more powerful doing there what they are
doing right what they see more like p
buying a mascot than hiring BP canada oh
yeah finally not only that but I yeah
they're both had hella hammering at its
best are they they're both in California
right sure don't know bill Bill Gates is
a Seattle or up in Washington okay
either way those are mostly blue states
so usually you want to make your VP
candidate somebody from like a
battleground states a little bit no
there's absolutely no political logic
okay fine fine God is looking into it
too i'm pretty sure they didn't even
bother to approach either them cuz like
well quick to imagine what they look
like don't get outta here here we go
here we go our loyal friend Michael
Brown hey Michael um out of all the big
tech CEOs who would you vote for to be
the president who great question great
question is a great excellent question
gonna go with Elon Musk because I love
my vows oh my god you know he's up to
some crazy like we're all gonna be
Oh what haha okay it's on YouTube I
thought we could drop a few ass bombs
every now and then nevermind i won't i
won't ever sorry body Oh mommy let me
try let me think of another tech CEO
that who
timken can't get to the White House it's
on a Windows Server I need sound effects
but um I don't know who'd be a good one
Carly fear you know what no she tried
she did try speaking of sound effects
insert prices right bump bump along you
know Sachin adela actually speaking of
microsoft and windows he could be
interesting could be a really good I
don't think he technically qualifies
right I don't know born in the US I'm
I'm unaware if that's true or not
thingies and believe he's an immigrant
we'll have to find out anyway you know I
think would be a great presidential
candidate is Jim lands owned oh you know
he never watches anyway doesn't matter
hopefully not today the head of CBS
interactive our parent company just by a
chance just by chance he's really smart
and good looking yeah tremendously
handsome he doesn't get any of your
razor quest so just to top right all
right not very funny in any more trouble
oh all right last last dimension it's
actually my twin's first birthday don't
throw that out the birthday they're
probably not watching but in case they
are I'm sure they will one day yeah I
could always play it back on YouTube
yeah so I know they won't care at all ya
know they will dare you mention there
are you can imagine when YouTube to them
is like oh dad your stupid beta play
your Betamax turn off your stupid
bareback service how are you going to
reconcile those showing this clip to
them while you drop in espa that would
be fine really fine I there are surround
them sometime real already well I don't
speak English so I guess it doesn't
actually matter so I'll get Brian to cut
it out yeah uh-uh so brian Tong for vice
president let's get out of here Brian
co-mvp Bob up a bomb few idea that you
