are going to take a look at the Bose
solo TV sound system this is the first
truly affordable sound bar that Bose is
made and it comes in at just $400 now
traditional sound bars are long thin and
they sit in front of your TV but the
solo uses a pedestal design so it sits
under your TV rather than in front of it
I'm a big fan of the pedestal design
from an aesthetics point of view as it
cuts down on clutter and it also avoids
the annoying problem where sound bars
sometimes block your TV's remote sensor
Bose isn't the only sound bar with a
pedestal design but it is the best
looking model it has a solid feel even
though it's a plastic cabinet and its
rounded edges make it look considerably
more refined than the boxy looking zee
Vox 420 the attention to detail carries
over to the remote which is the best
I've seen on a sound bar which is basic
volume controls and a nicely textured
feel the only slight misstep is there's
no display on the front panel so you
don't get any visual feedback letting
you know when you're close to maximum
volume it's not a huge loss but it would
have been nice inputs are on the back
and there's not much you get both
optical and coaxial digital audio inputs
plus an analogue audio input Bose is
planning on you connecting all your home
theater devices first to your TV and
then using the TV's audio output to
connect to the solo this arrangement
works pretty well and you're only
limited by how many inputs your TV has
the other thing to note is that the solo
is pretty small and Bose only recommends
placing TVs on top of it that are 40
pounds or less so that works great for
32 inch TVs most 40 inch TVs will work
and some 42 inch TVs will fit on top of
it but if you have a larger TV you're
going to have to go with a different
sound bar the major compromise with the
bow solo is sound quality on its own it
sounds pretty good and it's definitely a
big bump up from the built-in speakers
on your TV but if you compare it to the
$300 e Vox 420 the Z Vox is definitely
better sounding considerably more
powerful especially on movies it's also
worth pointing out that traditional
sound bars that include a wire
the subwoofer generally sound better
than both pedestal sound bars having a
separate subwoofer really makes a
difference but I don't think that boses
middling sound quality should scare off
too many buyers especially those that
put a bigger premium on style and
simplicity if all you're looking to do
is replace your TV sound with something
a little better without impinging too
much on your living room aesthetics the
bow solo is a solid home audio system
I'm Matthew Muscovy ak and this is the
bow solo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
