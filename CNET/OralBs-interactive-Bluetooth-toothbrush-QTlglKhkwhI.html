2015 here with my man Chris partlet
communication manager at oral-b and we
have I like to call them the blue
toothbrush I know it's a blue tooth
toothbrush but here you go tell us all
about this we know that it's now in the
US and just why maybe people will want
to use something like this Brian we're
so excited to be offering the oral-b
smartseries blue tooth toothbrush here
in the US it's all about increasing
compliance with our consumers our with
dental professionals and dental patients
go do we replace the word compliance for
just being lazy yes or a lack of time I
mean that's a busy world and we need to
do whatever we can to increase the
awareness and importance of oral care
so what the app does it's actually
two-way communication between the
toothbrush and the app on your phone and
what it's meant to do is give the
consumer a visual stimulation and
feedback on how they're brushing it
tells them how long they're brushing it
tells them if they're if they're
applying too much pressure so it's
giving them that visual and physical
feedback on their brushing experience it
also tells them what mode they're in for
those that need the multitasking to be
entertained while they're brushing you
actually have news tips you get live
news feed while you're brushing your
teeth to get you to brush those two
minutes now this toothbrush itself like
I said available in the US how much does
it retail for the MSRP is 159 retailers
actually dictate the price of the actual
brush on shelf but the MSRP is 159 now
you also mention there's like a next
level up version of this brush yes there
will be
innovations continuing to come the
oral-b 7000 smartseries 7000 will have a
few more modes as a real sexy travel
case see I want the 7000 because I want
a sexy travel case I'm pretty sure we
can hook you Brian I don't take I will
not accept that bribe alright it's not a
bribe all right let me see should I just
try and use this right now why not okay
according to the app you did great see I
brush mama and I floss all right there
you go
the oral-b bluetooth toothbrush I call
them blue toothbrushes here at CES 2015</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
