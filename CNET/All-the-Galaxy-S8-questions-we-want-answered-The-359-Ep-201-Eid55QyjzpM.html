York I'll be at the show just reminder
the show will not be tomorrow's podcast
will not be going on as will be busy
actually talking about for attending the
event so every time with that and we
couldn't do the show without talking a
little bit about spider-man that new
trailer that just that just debuted at
me I had a little brown anonymous Jess
well giggly about it oh yeah very very
excited talk serious Samsung and then
get silly spider-man that's right as
always leave your questions whether it's
samsung or spider-man related brian will
pick out the best and will get answered
will get them answered in three minutes
59 seconds all right and starting the
recording in three two
welcome to 359 we talked about the top
tech news of the day and all the other
crap we want to throw in I'm Roger Cheng
I'm Alfred hang tomorrow is the big
Samsung unpacked event here in New York
will be done with all the rumors leaks
and speculation and get our first
official glimpse at the galaxy s 8 until
then today we're going to pose the
questions we want answered from
tomorrow's event so the big one for me
is will this phone be impressive enough
to wipe away the bitter taste left from
the galaxy note 7 to buckle I think
they're going to wait have to wait at
least two more years you can't even
bring up Samsung without somebody
talking about you know oh is it going to
explode is there gonna be a fire John
Oliver did a whole segment like two
weeks ago yeah yep that was like an
entire like year over a lot of people it
is it's an issue that's still fresh in
the mind yeah it's not I don't think
it'll drop until you know at least the
galaxy as 1000 so I mean what are some
of the questions you want answered well
I've in the last like three to five
months I've seen so many leaks about the
galaxy SI it's gone to a point now where
I'm wondering you know are there any
surprises left in the tank for samsung
on this yeah I don't know that's that's
a really good question it just seems
like basically every facet of this phone
has been revealed right we kind of I
mean if the rumors are correct you know
we kind of know that there's no more
home button the bezels are much smaller
it's gonna be a much bigger screen pack
into a smaller body presumably I'll use
Qualcomm's latest snapdragon chip so
it'd be faster and more powerful you
know there's a lot of things to kind of
get excited about this product assuming
of course all these rumors are correct
of all the rumors which one to use seems
the most likely and which one seems like
it's definitely a rumor it's not happen
I mean most likely is obviously the
display change right getting getting
away from the home button packing in a
bigger screen you saw it with the LG G
six I think that's it's gonna be the
trend for this year for phones I think
you're gonna see with apple and the next
iPhone removing or shaving off some of
that bezel making as thin as possible so
you could pack in that bigger screen
that's what people want right there
staring at these things all the time why
not have as big a display as possible
and which rumor seems like the most
far-fetched
uh you know in terms of the the super 4k
video recording I mean that that's one
that Sony kind of has that sort of
locked in I don't know if people ever
want that it seems like you know it
seems like excessive not 4k video
recording I'm sorry 4k display 4k
display is something that I've seen
rumors about I'm not really sure about
that one and then again sony has done
that with their experience no one
replies those things I mean the rumor
that seems to me I don't think it's
going to happen is then pulling an apple
and getting rid of the headphone jacks
for the USBC cord oh yeah that would be
a bold move but i doubt i think they're
gonna try to dinging Apple again by
saying yes we do have headphone jack all
right so next up couldn't do the show
without matching the new spider-man
trailer DC did you watch it plea please
take notes that's I mean it's a great it
looks amazing I i I'm kind of worried
that they gave away the entire movie in
the trailer yeah yeah it feels like
Latino you can sketch out the plot just
based on this trailer but yes I'm still
gonna watch it or I'm still gonna find a
way to convince my wife to let me watch
it I mean I I think it's interesting
this in this spider-man you know it's
more about the suit where like the suit
kind of gives him the powers as opposed
to all the other ones were like the zoo
is just kind of like an after note on it
yeah they're making a big deal of it the
students kind of cool it has this like
it's it's sort of uh like latches onto
you yeah yeah yeah it's kind of a cool
effect uh and Michael Keane I mean
Michael Keynes awesome basically
everything he does what is with this man
and being like a bird in like I know
Birdman he's the butcher now he was
Batman I don't know what it is what he
likes rocking wing also I know bats
aren't Birds they're mammals they flow
yes a fly no I get it I get it all right
you want more of these stories check us
out on cnet I'm Roger Cheng I'm Alfred
Aang thanks for listening
all right first and foremost we got to
remind everybody what time is the
keynote tomorrow yes a really good point
the keynote starts at 11am Eastern 8
a.m. Pacific will be there much much
earlier crakkadawn way in line to make
sure we have the best seats making sure
that the photos that we have for you
guys are wonderful were there will be a
live blog by the way this time Cena it's
not doing live blog but we will be live
tweeting from the event will have a page
up collecting some of those tweets so
you will get live updates from us on
cnet but but definitely stay tuned we're
going to have a sort of full court press
in terms of Samsung coverage and we'll
have I as akhtar Bridget Carey and Ben
Fox Rubin at the desk here in the studio
doing a pre-show post-show roundup yeah
I would be talking to you and maybe even
dan ackerman out on the floor getting
exclusive first look so come and tune in
at Cena at 1030am eastern standard time
and yeah livestream cnet com I think
we're facebook liveing it as well yeah
yeah so awesome we look forward to
seeing you all there so a perv is asking
will Bigsby be a big fail for samsung
like Tyson uh well that's really
interesting question she as big a fail
is Tyson no no I mean Tyson Tyson's
really it sort of takes the cake in
terms of software failures no one's
using although if you have a gear s3 or
gear s2 you're using a size Tizen device
which I don't actually know how many
people actually own that device but in
terms of bixby though you know in terms
we've talked about our race cars are in
a story about pics beans or the vision
of that AI it's going to be very limited
at first they want to incorporate new
features from some of the startups they
purchase over the last year so you could
expect bixby to get better over time and
you expect Bixby to be show up in more
products you know microwave TVs TV
refrigerators so it might be more useful
it's remember this is sort of an AI to
kind of control your phone it's less I
think it's going to be less like Google
systems yeah kitano where your you rank
searches it's more about like they
called it a sidekick for your phone to
kind of control the the parts of the s8
that you know that you normally be
basically things I like
yeah just like controlling your phone
without having to touch it so like if
you want to pull up a photo like can you
pull up all the photos I took yesterday
right it'll be able to sort that as
opposed like you going and then like
scrolling people and all that stuff it's
basically trying to make using your
phone a lot more based on your voice and
you know touch screen using your touch
that said yeah I rarely use voice
assistance now so I don't know if I'll
use this I mean I only use voice
assistant for like small features like
that to be honest like where it's like
set a timer where I don't want to open
up yeah like that's true i mostly ask
Siri for the weather yes point though
yeah yeah so you know as opposed to me
pressing like the weather app and then
like going through like what the
forecast would be yeah just ask it I
mean that's how i feel about timers like
small menial tasks which is kind of what
they're going like all in on with big
speed right though right do we know when
the release date for the essay it's
going to be or is that going to be
announced tomorrow okay announced
tomorrow I think speculation is late
April according to the chat yeah I think
that's what the rumors are calling for
again will well sort of part of the
problem is that they can actually
announce their own launch date they
usually wait for the carrier's to do it
since they they all have slightly
different dates right so like I would
imagine shortly after the event you'll
start hearing from at least here in the
US you start hearing from 18t and
t-mobile and Verizon these guys don't
start rolling out announcement dates and
prices samsung actually doesn't talk
about the price of these phones rightly
weights they wait for the carriers to do
it here's an easy question and he wants
to know are they going to bring back the
note 7 well yeah we can answer that yeah
apparently yes unfortunately not in the
US though if you live and fortunately or
fortunately right if you live in America
you are out of luck the imagine that
they'll go after certain emerging
markets or other markets that didn't
have note 7 the first time around you
think that they would be able to work in
the US so like let's say I go all the
way out to Vietnam and i buy i have a
note 7 there i'm back to the US I me
possibly it depends on assuming I can
get on a flight with one right it
depends on the radio the frequency yeah
otherwise when I'm cups from the the
u.s. better possibly I don't really know
phone do we think there's going to be
any waterproofing to the essay asking
asking for Daniel I would say that's
pretty safe bet there's gotta be yes
seven
resistance water resistance the s7 and
the node 7 were both water resistant
both features that customers love and
the iphones also water resistant it
would be a mistake if Samsung took that
feature away re speculating any changes
in the camera I don't know the rumors
have been kind of their inconsistent
wasn't one of the rumors that they were
gonna you know kind of do the same thing
the seven plus did with the dual rear
cameras yeah yeah we saw that song yet
okay and uh yeah I don't I don't really
know what what they're gonna do with the
camera that's uh there there are a lot
of inconsistent rumors so that I think
that's one of the questions we want to
answer definitely like what's up with
camera are they going to put big speed
on the s7 as well uh that's a really
good question I mean it's a software
thing though so I mean I don't think it
would have come eventually had the s7
hung on without any flaws and eventually
the software update probably what
brought it on boards well like a
rerelease or to note that the that Bixby
will have a physical button control on
the essay so I mean yeah you can
theoretically just call it up on the s7
as a as a software update but that's I
don't know I mean from what I understand
though Bixby is not supposed to be a
very high demand software update like
they've been talking about like you know
if we're not gonna put on your TV maybe
we'll put on your TV remote right right
you know which doesn't really have the
most high-end like chip running it
that's true yeah it's not it's not a
very you know exhaustive you know
software updates I can see it coming to
some of their later phones but as you
said it a lot of it has to do have
hardware so it is not always listen yeah
it seems like they're really big on like
having a physical button for HP so that
doesn't really work backwards
compatibility was from what I understand
the reason why they wanted it the button
though is so that you know get in one of
the issues that they looked at was like
how people like look at um voice control
and like voice assistance where I you
look kind of silly when you're holding
your phone out like this yeah they
wanted the button to kind of be like
making it look like you're naturally
talk to my phone yeah the idea was it
gives a walkie-talkie phone yeah right
Kareem is asking will the noh8 have
fingerprint scanner on the
glass panel I the rumors say no that
that they couldn't figure that part out
on time and that's why the fingerprint
scanner will likely be in the back of
them and what is your opinion on that
location of the scanner and how it will
function it kind of depends on where the
back of it is I you know we were not
sure yet I think that where the pixel
has their Center print readers is pretty
decent sort of in the center of the back
lephone that I think the rumors are
calling for it to be a little bit higher
than that so I don't know it depends on
how the phone ultimately looks and how
to hold you how it started held in your
hand sure also it might be a plate again
people don't want to use the irish /
face scanner more right all right if
they don't want to have to like reach
out to the back and it's like just like
looking right at it that's what todo
saying in the Chad they want to promote
the iris scanner above the touch scanner
yeah yeah definitely uh call the duty
gamer 1999 that's a great name what
about 3d touch think we're gonna see 3d
touch uh no well that's an apple yeah
that's an apple thing in terms of haptic
feedback I mean Samsung phones already
had haptic feedback so i don't think
they'll have something like 3d touch
though this is a question that's over my
head why will us get Snapdragon and not
XE knows that's a really good question i
would say partly for competitive reasons
i think they want to have multiple
suppliers for their their chips it kind
of keeps both sides honest in terms of
making the volume of phones that they
make i think it's smart to have sourcing
from two different suppliers supposed to
rely on just one and you know in the US
i imagine qualcomm has already spent
some money kind of building up its
snapdragon brand and they want that
relationship of course and there are
enough kind of high-tech or tech savvy
people out there who you know who do
care about what ship that runs their
phone right so essentially they're the
kind of i mean they are come they're
gonna be the same you know they're
they're all manufactured by samsung
anyways but you know one bisbee Qualcomm
one happens to be the homegrown version
interesting perspective coming in here
people are anxious about VR will there
be any new VR gear or gear
sorry gear VR for the sa yo so they
actually introduced a new gear VR system
back in Spain last month at mobile
Congress it's basically a the same
headset but it comes with a controller
looks a lot like daydream the
controllers actually motion sensitive so
like you can actually kind of wave it
around and recognize that as well as
thumb through a touchpad just like the
daydream controller so you can imagine
that will be part of some sort of bundle
or where Elias will be sold as you know
part of this package yeah and I know
Snapdragon ever at least on there on the
SH that will have the Snapdragon chip
they have been like pushing really big
for that for the 35 to be right to be
very V are ya ready for it yeah yeah
1,000 frames per second camera true or
not I don't know that seems a little
lofty that's yeah that's already i seen
that rumor it's in our room around up as
well i am a little skeptical about that
that's an idea but maybe not yeah i
think i'm not sure what the iphone one
is it's like 250 i believe um but yeah
that's that's just for the slo-mo camera
Lulu we don't know the cost yet we'll
find out tomorrow with the rest of y'all
will they have a boca camera feature
like the iphone plus 7 iphone 7 plus you
have the bunch of the portrait mode that
is one of the rumors I don't know it's
like I mean I don't know how likely it
is it's you know obviously I think a
feature that people want apples
definitely made that sort of a coveted
feature I mean I use that thing all the
time I freaking love it when it works it
is a little hit or miss but when it
works it's wonderful um I think that's
probably a good spot to leave off
because I think we've answered all we
can answer your time being yeah we don't
look we don't a lot of answers right now
with you were anxious to see yeah yeah
we're definitely interested excited to
see what happens again just a reminder
the show will not be on tomorrow I'll
actually be at the event it's over at
Lincoln Center and Ben I as and Bridget
will be doing the pre-show starting at
1030am and I'll dial in and give you
guys some impressions from from the
event ahead of the actual start time if
you but it goes from 11 to
we think noon should be an hour long
presentation we never really know that
sounds about right yeah yes so stick
with it all the way either way but
you'll be able to follow our live tweets
tweets for myself just dull chord chart
it can who are our SF folks who are in
town especially for this event and
before we wrap it up for the day let's
geek out for a second about that
spider-man trailer odd that those look
good so good he's the best spider-man he
really is yeah the most of all I don't
think there's anyone is gonna argue
against that there are people who would
defend Tobey Maguire to eccentrics and o
people defend ain't Garfield but they'll
still turn around is a wall but just on
Tom Holland looking like a kid alone
yeah we require or Tony look like a 30
year old playing yeah like why would
they be in hiding all good yeah I mean I
thought Andrew Garfield did a better job
of looking like high school student than
to them but it wasn't it still wasn't
that convincing Andrews Andrew
Garfield's a terrible Peter Parker he
looks nothing he's like Custer ish
hipster cool way to redefine the modern
geek in the mine geek still plays
Dungeons and Dragons he doesn't it laid
all the time Garfield although I thought
I liked how he was like he was
definitely like thinner there like a
thinner frame to like it seemed like two
looked good in the Soviet Toby kind of
was he look bulk a little bulky
relatively I was good i like that but i
mean back to this one though like he's
an actual kid yeah you know he looks
he's small ya mean short relative to
some other heroes i'd answer yeah actors
dance yes yes yeah i like yeah you all a
lot of flips in real life just to like
yeah she like the instagrams of yeah
just a standing flips like wow yeah he's
like but seconds on screen in the
avengers for people to instantly fall in
love yeah so good i want to see you know
they took a lot of departures with that
amazing spider-man franchise like we
didn't ever get to see the Daily Bugle
really in effect and I would really like
to see the main temples of Peter
Parker's legacy quantity fair I don't
think the Daily Bugle would be
successful or up and running in in like
today's time so well if it's analogous
to the New York Times maybe it is but
they legality I'm sorry isn't there a
billboard an amazing spider-man 2 that
said something like Daily Bugle blog or
something like that yeah that's what it
probably would come boy yeah alright
like jonah Jameson would not be paying
that much for photos of spider-man with
the new way sorry not the times the post
I guess it's now now just piss off like
New York tabloid yeah yeah yeah um
anyways there is a rumor floating around
who might be playing JK Simmons a JJ
Jamison and it won't be JK Simmons a and
although you can never beat that oh yeah
he's the perfect jonah Jameson so the
rumor I heard hmm was ice cube what
really just a rumor but think about it
at my first reaction was to reel back
and then I went wait no he's such an
asshole he yells bye Felicia every time
granted just a rumor no validation i'm
with you i'm reading all the spoilers &amp;amp;
blogs and everything and i took a second
turn away oh man i would actually love
to see him screaming at tom holland
that's true yeah yeah he could do a good
job and again there's no there's no
validation the bat he's not anywhere in
any call sheets of cash sheets but
that's not a bad fan cast to be honest i
also i do like pal a diversified his
friend now is not he's played by an
asian actor it's kind of nice to have a
what was a character's name i forgot it
i completely forgot it but it's a
character for cut they pull this on the
ultimate comment yes yeah yeah yeah but
that's again we're getting a great
rounding out of the rogue's gallery we
got Liz it's not just Mary Jane right
right we're gonna actually see that like
no Peter does have friends is a besides
Harry is MJ gonna be in the business
she's not in this one definitely not in
this one he's had three different
girlfriends now across three different
movies Leia and they call him a geek
yeah right the one thing I don't want to
see is I don't want to see another going
Stacey because if nothing more that was
the best part of the amazing spider-man
franchise was Emma Stone oh yeah yeah no
question I didn't like that French s at
all I'm not validating the franchise I
didn't really care for it either but I
thought she was fantastic yeah but just
Emma Stone is pretty awesome in general
so it seems like this spider-man's like
a lot more gadgety though then like all
the other ones yeah yeah it's like it's
all the zoo like coming out of a suit I
MacGyver kid who got like a sponsorship
deal Yeah right if you think about it
though which works in the spiderman
cartoon in the 90's I was a lot more
gadget
until yes like scheana he record his own
web days it sells toys he has like 14
different suits you know they're gonna
sell an action ticket for all of them
Tony Stark takes away all of them I
think it's kind of an interesting idea
like it really ties them back into that
science e tekky kind of MCU that they've
built we have very much works in a
contemporary setting well it's I do like
how they like they address that issue up
front you know when the when the vulture
like shows up in the trailer Tony
Stark's like let the etic let the root
let the real heroes kind of deal like
they're addressing the fact that there
is this kind of universe of heroes I
forget that so like what it does he want
spider-man for like only solve like
crimes but like only like some crime
like straight line crossing street level
crimes like bank robbers like if there's
a super villain we call in the
adventures to give somebody like a
kick-ass suit like that don't you just
do like the normal but that's the entire
premise of that is like Oh without the
suit you're nothing oh wait of course
he's not that's the whole point is going
to prove that he doesn't need it yet
that's it they give him all the toy I
reading they really give everything away
yeah well I'm okay with that I'd
Marvel's been good in the past about
still keeping something under the hood
that they can surprise us with I thought
that line was incredibly ironic though
coming from iron man Massoud yeah suit
yeah well that's him getting back in
touch post age of Ultron where you know
he taught quasi retired right yeah well
technically retired after iron man 3 and
like they kind of wiped that whole thing
away like here already destroyed all the
suits as like I don't need to see to be
Iron Man right and like they could be
slightly late Voltron and I completely
wipe that away with the age of Ultron Oh
back with the new suit just built a
course he's got suits hidden away in the
closet somewhere all right we've
efficiently wasted enough time we
covered some Samsung stuff we got to dig
out a little bit and it's time to wrap
it up I do Ice Cube interesting hood
