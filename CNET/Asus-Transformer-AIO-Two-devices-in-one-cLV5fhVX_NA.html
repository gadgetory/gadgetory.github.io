gonna take a look at the Asus
Transformer all-in-one this is a really
unique new system from Asus it's gonna
be available in April for $12.99 and
it's probably one of the more involved
desktops we've ever reviewed here in its
standard configuration which you see
here it's a pretty simple system it's
Windows 8 you have a wireless mouse and
keyboard it's an 18 point 400 screen
with a 19 by 10 resolution there's a
core i5 chip inside it a terabyte hard
drive a King's of memory as well as the
more or less expected ports from USB 3
analog audio out SD card etc etc so
while 18.4 inches is definitely small
for a standard all-in-one in this price
range what you also get with this system
is an Android tablet I can push a button
aside and swap over to the androids 4.1
jellybean OS you can see here then the
screen comes off and I have a pretty
gigantic tablet to take around the house
and the reason that works is because
there's an NVIDIA Tegra 3 chip inside
this display which lets the system
function by itself so we've seen a
couple other systems like this there's
the system from Lenovo coming out later
this year and Sony already put one out
during the launch of Windows 8 last year
so like that Sony the idea with this
Asus system is that you're not really
gonna take this tablet out on the train
or really in anywhere where it's gonna
be a true mobile device it's mostly for
taking this screen around and using it
someplace where you wouldn't want to use
a traditional desktop say plunking it
down in the kids bedroom for a little
while you get on the couch to browse a
newspaper now even more interesting with
this system it also has a remote desktop
feature so we can either hit this mode
switch icon or hit this button on the
side and the system will automatically
go back into Windows 8 via remote
desktop mode so the tablet connects back
to Windows 8 via Wi-Fi in order for that
to work both the base station and the
tablet have to be on the same wireless
network and you're probably best off if
you use a 5 gigahertz network as opposed
to a 2.4 gig which is more common tends
to have a lot of traffic on it even
further extending the utility of the
system it also has an HDMI output so
that means you can connect the standard
PC monitor to the base unit use that as
a standard desktop and then pop off the
display here and use that as an Android
tablet or even a remote in and have
to users on the same Windows 8 system
via separate monitors the benefits of
Android on the tablet are that you get a
clean interface a giant app library
compared to what you'll find in Windows
8 right now as well as a pretty good
touch input experience it's also
interesting to have the tablet and the
base station sort of work as two
separate computers so if you want but it
overall the concept seems like it would
be a little smoother if it just ran
Windows eight throughout granted then
you wouldn't have the multi user
experience but there'd be a lot less
fiddling and back and forth between the
different OSS and it probably generally
an easier concept with people to
understand it's also worth pointing out
that the tablet is heavy it's not as
heavy as the Sony Vaio tab 20 actually
which came in just under 12 pounds this
is about 5.6 pounds so for battery life
we found that the tablet has just under
five hours of use if you want to use it
for watching movies and in Windows 8
remote desktop mode it comes in at about
three and a half hours so there's
definitely a drop-off there so
ultimately of course the question is who
should buy this thing and right now it's
kind of hard to say we're gonna have
Intel coming out with the next
generation of CPUs in the next six
months or so they promise better
performance better battery life and
hopefully smaller more lightweight
versions of systems like this other
vendors are also working on PCs with
similar design and that it's an
all-in-one and a tablet there's various
iterations of how you can do that of
course but I think by the end of this
year we will see a whole fleet of PCs
like this and we'll kind of have a
better idea of what we want what we
expect and what a good price is so all
that said I can recommend the system if
you like give you have a big tablet and
you want sort of an extendable desktop
and you like Android the mainstream
consumer though the system is probably a
bit too expensive to recommend
particularly with so many other pcs like
it coming out of the next few months so
I'm rich Brown this is the Asus
Transformer all-in-one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
