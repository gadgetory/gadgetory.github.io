important part of our global community
and many of the values that Europeans
care about deeply our values that we
share from the importance of human
rights on the need for community to the
love of technology and all the potential
that it can bring now we've always
focused on all the good that technology
and connecting people can bring and as
Facebook has grown it has helped give
people ever around the world new tools
to stay connected to the people they
care about most after the recent
terrorist attacks in Berlin and Paris
London and here in Brussels tens of
thousands of people have used our safety
check tool to tell the people they love
that they're safe refugees arriving in
Europe are using Facebook to stay in
touch with their loved ones back home
and find new communities here there are
18 million small businesses here in
Europe that use Facebook today mostly
for free almost half of whom say that
they have hired more people as a result
of their use of our tools but it's also
become clear over the last couple of
years that we haven't done enough to
prevent these tools from being used for
harm as well and that goes for fake news
foreign interference and elections and
developers misusing people's information
we didn't take a broad enough view of
our responsibility and that was a
mistake
and I'm sorry for it it's going to take
time to work through all the changes
that we need to make here but I'm
committed to getting this right and to
making the significant investments that
are necessary to keep people safe
for example we are doubling the number
of people working on safety and security
at our company to more than 20 thousand
by the end of this year on top of the
investments that we're making in other
areas I expect that these increased
investments in security will
significantly impact our profitability
but I want to be clear keeping people
safe will always be more important than
maximizing our profits now let me start
by explaining the action we're taking to
prevent what happened with Cambridge
analytic from
happening again back in 2014 we changed
our policies to more tightly restrict
the information that apps could get and
to proactively review all apps asking
for more data so now we're gonna go even
further than this first when you use an
app it's now only going to get limited
access to your information your name
your profile photo and your email
address unless they've gone through a
full review so that's much less
information that apps can get on mobile
platforms today second if you haven't
used an app in three months
we're gonna prevent that app from
accessing your information until you
authorize it again third last month we
showed everyone on the top of their
newsfeed a tool with a list of all the
apps that they've used as well as a
simple way to remove permissions for any
apps that they no longer want access
finally we're investigating every single
app that had access to a large amount of
people's information before we lock down
our platform in 2014 I really think we
have a big problem here and it's not
solved by saying we're gonna fix it
ourselves
and you have to ask yourself well how
you will be remembered as one of the
three big Internet giant's together with
Steve Jobs I should say and Bill Gates
who have enriched or world and all
societies or at the other hand in fact
the genius will create a digital monster
that is destroying our democracies and
of society solemn oh that's a question
that you have to put yourself for
yourself
perhaps you're horrified by this
creation of yours on what it's led to I
don't know but what is absolutely true
is that since January of this year
you've changed your modus operandi
you've changed your algorithms and it
has led directly to a very substantial
drop in views and engagements for those
that have got right-of-center
political opinions would you consider
your company as a monopoly and I have to
say is that as a politician I believe in
markets and rules but I also want to
stop
all kinds of possible monopolies and
that's why I think it is time to discuss
breaking facebook monopoly because it's
already too much power in only one hand
we exist in a very competitive space
where people use a lot of different
tools for communication or the average
person uses about eight different tools
for communication ranging from all sorts
of private messaging up to more
broadcast mediums to things where
they're communicating with groups of
people and and all their friends at once
so from where I sit it feels like there
are new competitors coming up every day
there are competitors that reach tens
and hundreds of millions of people and
we're constantly needing to evolve our
service in order to stay relevant and
serve people well so that feels like
it's a competitive environment where
there are many choices that people have
it's very important to me that we're a
service that allows for a wide variety
of political discourse we view that as a
a big part of our responsibility and I
can commit to you here today that we
will that we we have never and will not
make decisions about what content is
allowed or how we do ranking on the
basis of a political orientation terror
bullying self harm election integrity
which is obviously extremely important
are prioritizing them first by our goal
over the coming years is going to get to
developing the AI systems and hiring the
staff necessary to be able to
proactively review more of the content
as it's coming into into the system will
never be perfect on this you know our
adversaries especially on the election
side people are trying to interfere will
have access to some of the same AI tools
that we will so it's an arms race and
we'll need to constantly be working to
stay ahead but our vision for how we
should manage the system is going to
move from one of reactive management as
people in our community flag things to
one where we're more proactively having
systems look at the content flag things
for tens of thousands of people to
review and we're already making
significant progress in doing that I
think I was able to to address the high
level areas in each
and I'll make sure that we follow up
with each of you afterwards to make sure
that your specific questions get
addressed and we're gonna have someone
come to to do a full hearing soon to
answer more the technical questions as
well so thank you again for I think
there was one question raised by a giver
who said and which that's linked to my
question and that's the separation of
different services and I think it's a
very important question in this round
the market power of Facebook and the
question if you cross use for example
data between Facebook and whatsapp so it
would be good if you say at least one
word to that will you allow users to
escape targeted advertising
I mean I asked you six yes and no
questions I got not a single answer and
of course well you asked for this format
well for a reason okay I'll make sure we
follow up and get your answers to those
okay I think I want to ask you if it's
possible to have right answer for any
question from from you yes in the next
days oh well we are all well prepared
for intervention so we have them on
paper we could mr. president you collect
them you give them to the team of mr.
Hsu compared to mr. Zuckerberg himself
and we receive written answers on it
because let's be honest I have not so
much I don't think that the right ways
to say and now we're gonna put it in
Libra and so I know there are a number
of questions has been put by other
colleagues that I want an institute that
said I'm anxious of this new brave new
world that mr. Zuckerberg has presented
us a brave new world
what tens and tens of thousands of
private people are scrutinizing us and
are saying what is fake news what is not
fake news what is hate speech what is
not hate speech mr. don't you think
there's a public creation of this
discussion in this format as well as in
the Liebherr format this is very obvious
I think first of all
but is it possible to talk to a trivet
answer based on by Christians with a
right answer
bye-bye mr. duChemin in the next days
for every question but okay competition
for example a European antitrust thing
that's important do we need I think
we're on a push or antitrust ad agency
to go into this if there is no good
answer to I think you the problem is the
timing for me a firm is possible to say
that there is a flight but I think if
mrs. sorry I think this is the format if
do you agree mr. Joe cable for for right
answer in the next days for a question
by question is possible to travel right
answer the question okay yeah okay thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
