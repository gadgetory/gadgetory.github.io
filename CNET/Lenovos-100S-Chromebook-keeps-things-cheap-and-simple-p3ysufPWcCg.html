Chromebook is one of the cheapest ways
to stay connected but this laptop is
running Chrome OS and your options start
to get really limited once you stray
away from Wi-Fi now the Nevel knows how
to make a good keyboard and the one here
doesn't disappoint
it's roomy so your fingers won't feel
cramped and the keys offer a nice amount
of feedback in depth with every press no
typing mistakes here Chrome OS has
different shortcut than you might be
used to so the keyboards loud is gonna
be a little different but it works well
if your needs are simple the 11.6 inch
screen has a 1366 by 768 pixel
resolution that's not great but it's
right in line with the price there's an
SD card slot on the side for importing
photos or if we're using it as a bit of
extra storage as well as a pair of USB
ports for external devices but the
laptop only is 32 gigs of internal
storage space and 2 gigs of ram now that
isn't very much at all but that's kind
of the point you use the limited storage
for any files you want to keep close at
hand offline and you'll keep the rest of
your stuff up in the cloud performance
it does take a hit though now when I'm
using Chrome I have a habit of firing up
a lot of tabs and this machine starts to
get a bit sluggish if there's a little
more room in your budget
the 229 model doubles the RAM up to 4
gigs which should make things a little
less painful now you're definitely
getting what you pay for here read my
review to find out the trade-offs are
worth it
I'm Nate thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
