of my grounds club just kind of flying
around the Madden really enjoying
ourselves a lot of people go to pay and
play sites where you just drive around
the site but then you get bored because
you're always doing the same circuit and
you never really push yourself this way
there's a means to an end that there's
actually sort of something at the end of
it and you're sort of competing against
other people and seeing what other
people couldn't do on the same bit of
ground and maybe it's a bear ground that
you maybe not would want to drive
otherwise I think it's kind of a thing
which kind of gets under your skin there
a good boat car as well but you can also
build a special car like this and just
get out there in a bit of fun it's a
it's a good budget motorsport my parents
got me into it from about the age of two
so I've been coming to events for 20
years now I think part of it's the noise
part of this culture we're all so I try
to be very friendly group it's a good
laugh there's a lot of decent people
about lot of friends there really good
crowd anyone to help you out if you have
a problem
everybody would be around the car trying
to help you out with it this is my
beauty this is a present for years game
we've kind of rebuilt it and done a few
modifications to it here and there I say
that's definitely the ceiling mechanic
and I'm very much a spanner monkey has
to slowly learn still learning
yeah I've got this one which is we're
doing a time file today but I've also
got another one for doing ordinary
trials because they're so long-lasting
you get you do get attached to if you've
had one for a long time you do get
attached to it
a lot of people grow up with them
there's a lot of them out there
everybody sees them they're just a
little bit different to everything else
the iconic British vehicle and
everybody's in it for different reasons
some people want to modify them and put
lots of blingy bits on and other people
just like the off-roading
some people never take them off road so
it's it's different for everything and
they're so adaptable
everything's bolt on and you can just so
easily change them into what you want it
to be started a long time ago when I was
in the ta you still see Drive a lot of
Land Rovers for that and then when I
left the TA
something was missing and so that's what
led into it for me just adventure I
think you're not really limited only by
your own imagination
it's just the way they're built they're
just so sturdy and bomb-proof and
they're just so strong underneath you
can't break them it's gonna be a bit of
a device to be interesting to see what
they replace it with whether they can
keep the icon going but it's gonna be a
long time before you actually see the
fenders disappear I think because
they're so repairable you just very
rarely scrap one no matter what you do
to it you can always find enough bits to
put it back on the road
relatively cheaply as well
