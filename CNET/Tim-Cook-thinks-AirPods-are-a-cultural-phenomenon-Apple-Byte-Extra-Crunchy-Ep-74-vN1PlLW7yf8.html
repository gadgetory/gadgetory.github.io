have I hate talking by myself too it's
just I know there's never a shows never
is good when you talk by your side now
just get that out of the way hard it is
hard you need two voices alright let's
jump into it the story that
kind of shook the Apple world up this
week comes from The Wall Street Journal
people might have gotten a little head
of themselves but the Wall Street
Journal basically posted an article
titled apple's next iphone will have a
curved screen now we know this we know
already in advance that they've pre
ordered 160 million OLED screens
components in advance of what we believe
is the apples 10th anniversary iphone
according to the report Apple has been
used ours planning to use these OLED
screens for a curved edge phone quite
honestly much like we've seen from
Samsung already right in the s7 and the
upcoming s8 phone which if you look up
has been completely leaked by boy genius
report but then as you continue to go
down the line you know they talk about
one at least one of the phones we're
expecting three different iphones and
one of them will be the 10th anniversary
will have this curved edge front using
an oled display potential wireless
charging blah blah blah lots lots of
things going on with that but little
deeper into the article they drop this
line I'm going to read it for you they
said that apple would induce introduce
other updates including a USBC port for
the power cord and other peripherals
instead of the company's original
lightning connector okay hmm now
instantly the internet set on fire and
everyone was writing apples dickey
lightning Apple getting rid of the
Lightning port Apple going with USB see
what is going on ah ah Apple screwing us
again with a new port okay slowly roll
like right when I read this article and
people were like hitting me up my boy
Gil Cabrera guilty okay GC GC he's like
dude if they switch the USBC I'm gonna
go crazy and I don't like okay let me
let me look at this article the article
doesn't outright say they're switching
to lightning they say updates include a
USBC port for the power cord and other
peripherals now one thing that you might
not all know is the ipad pro my favorite
apple jads do you want to throw up
already no no I talk about all the time
I read comics right on time you need the
ipad pro for the comics okay one of the
options for the ipad pro is too
by actually a 29 watt power adapter that
connects one of the connector ins is
USBC because that provides more juice to
the ipad pro the ipad pros lightning
connector n supports that higher that
higher wattage that it can charge it so
why so first of all Apple included a 12
watt power adapter which sucks it takes
the ipad pro like literally I'm gonna
argue six or seven hours to charge up oh
yeah it grew a long time long asked I us
this is a pro to this is my big boy so
I'm like I'm gonna buy this USBC power
adapter to see what all the fuss is
about that thing charges literally two
and a half times faster I think I get up
to like eighty percent in maybe like an
hour and hour and a half that's like
ridiculous about an hour and a half lit
so it's an adapter it's just a power
adapter okay it's still hot you still
connect to your iPad pro with the
lightning but the other end is USBC nice
and the actual power adapter supports a
higher wattage that then goes into the
ipad pro and it because right now our
phones are only a 12 can support 12 watt
power adapter yeah yeah so right not as
much to use going in charge it slower
hmm so i think that this is exactly what
they're doing except it'll be for the
new iphone it will support a USBC port
based power adapter 29 wats unlike what
the current phones do not remove the
Lightning port don't get ahead of
yourself work over a second I was like
wait are they putting a second port on
them now no that's not going to happen I
mean Apple there's a lot of crazy stuff
now but that's what I think it is I
would also like to ahead of time thank
apple for making me by the faster power
adapter which arguably they should just
put it in there the power adapter costs
49 bucks and the cable is like another
nineteen or twenty five bucks that's
mucci so that's expense I spent seventy
five dollars just a power my ipad pro
faster come on brah that's great come on
Apple I I mean it is needed though like
my ipad 3rd generation that are like a
rock out like forever like I just
overnight all charges yeah it's like a
whole it's a long time yeah there's no
quick charging where you can even plug
it in for like 10 minutes and get like
twenty percent use there's nothing like
that on the iPads
so that's what I think they're going to
be bringing to this new iphone 8 I just
want to calm everyone's nerves even
after that report came out and the
internet was set on fire and everyone's
like us bc us bc uppal going us bc KGI
analyst ming-chi kuo John Gruber from
daring fireball blog they also are in a
line with btz and the Apple buy extra
crunchy podcast with beach and tong
they're there they're on there on team
just a USBC port for the power adapter
so this is kind of this story is
supporting the what we talked about last
week the bigger battery so it's just a
move by Apple like we're going to put a
bigger battery in the phone so now we
got to charge a faster I hope so yeah
that would make sense totally I mean if
you're in product development like
Stephen Beecham appears to be just now I
am that product development for Apple
and most secret spy inside cnet well you
know that actually could be true because
two floors of our office you actually
belong to Apple we just can't access
them I'm on their payroll now no I'm
just kidding I try to climb through the
ventilation it didn't work yeah it did
locked it up man they they're cut all
cables going into that floor they just
caught them you're like oh this is your
of sillas drive or you're right Great
God they cut it out they cut our fiber
basically all of our fiber slightly
rewire a building uh like what's up with
that I'll just look like a wire cutter
so I don't be like that come on guys I
would do so who would do such that Apple
that that is absolutely a bad apple
alright moving on Tim Cook recently had
his a / Apple shareholders meeting I
said a / app / APRA shareholders meeting
now here's the thing shareholders are
basically a bunch of old dudes with a
lot of money yes I didn't want to have a
steak and apple and they're like yeah I
meaning they're making more money I'm
going to make us more money time now 11
of the they also vote on a variety of
initiatives so the board of directors
are there they vote on new initiatives
for the company I'm not going to make a
big brouhaha about this because I know
the majority of shareholders are from
one specific ethnic group but there was
a there was an ishit of to basically
increase the diversity on the Apple
board of directors oh really and the
shareholders the large amount of
shareholders had an opportunity if you
own any stock in them had an opportunity
to vote for it
only six percent of those shareholders
said yeah we should diversify we should
make apples board directors more diverse
like make an effort so it got completely
shut down so congrats all the little
white tea to login it down they're like
yeah we got to our apples are Apple
stock is fine the way it is yeah let's
just keep it down we're sitting on a
boatload of cash amor in some island off
off the app you know outside the united
states like no one screws at all brian
continue to buy our products just keep
buying a brian you taught to keep
talking positively about them beat them
you buy them too so i do those are some
of those initiatives also just kind of
financial stuff it's a lot of that but
the highlight of these meetings is that
shareholders get to ask him cook direct
questions now they may they're not
always the smartest questions i'm going
to throw it out there like for example
this is on the record one of the
shareholders directly asked tim or told
him that you know I think that we should
build a could you build a super smart
dumb phone in a round design yeah yeah
like I saw like a circle maker clear
like regular phone I think a circle and
Tim Cook replied in quotes not sure
we're going to create a round phone yeah
yeah buddy the easy way of letting him
down this is this is what was the type
of people were talking about yes I heard
that one of them also complained about
how his phone got brick from an update
and then Tim Cook was like doing tech he
was doing like I t work like trying to
fix this guy's phone in the meeting that
happened right yeah this is shareholders
or just rich people with wrist problems
but let's be real about that now there
are some cool interesting kind of
nuggets that you always pull out from
some of the from you know from the
shareholder meetings one of them was the
cooks comments about the air pods yes so
Cook says that they're trying to build
as many air pause as fast as they can
for those of you that are trying to
still hunt them down they're still
pretty hard to get sometimes you can
walk into a store and they might have a
few around twelve o'clock when they get
their shipment most the time they don't
so let's be honest they're still
backordered it's what now six months
since they announced it oh man
and they're still not readily available
there any others delay and they're still
not readily available Tim Cook called
the wireless earbuds from Apple quite
the cultural phenomenon yeah that's very
questionable that's a very questionable
quote hahahaha for me oh well here's the
thing let's let's keep it real Tim okay
I I like to talk about some examples of
maybe we could use in comparison as
cultural phenomenon cultural phenomenon
would be like Pokemon thank you that was
the first example i came up with you the
show like everyone was doing that that's
yeah how about Hillary Clinton was
talking about it when she was running a
president how about let's go let's let's
turn the clock a little bit what about
the Macarena Macarena that was a
cultural phenomenon that was you yes so
when I earpods no I don't see people
going nuts like making memes like
posting stuff posting you know all their
own I just don't see it we're we're here
in the Bay Area in the heart of Silicon
Valley I don't even see I would say
let's be even generous one out of a
hundred people don't even have an air
pods that they're walking walking around
wearing not even I mean I see maybe like
one person every couple days that's what
I'm saying lucky you know so let's not
get ahead of ourselves to me no cultural
phenomenon salt bay salt bay is a bigger
yeah yeah this is sprinkle sprinkle roll
safe roll safe yeah i mean there's
there's so many more you could think of
it it's just so you know that's that's a
little silly when you start drinking a
little bit of that kool-aid that's
that's all I'm gonna say Tim Cook was
also asked directly about apples focus
on you know basically someone called him
out and said aren't you focusing on
consumer the consumer space more than
the pro space and let me see if I can
let me see if I can find this oh here we
go so in response to that cook said that
apple will do more in the Pro area he
also called out the creative field
especially as especially important to
Apple but then here's his quote and I
like this is kind of one of those quotes
that you have to like to think about for
a second all right don't this is what
Cook said don't think that
something we've done or something we're
doing that isn't visible yet is a signal
that our priorities are elsewhere but so
he's facing yeah if you haven't seen it
doesn't mean that we're not working on
it but I would need to art exhibit a the
mac pro still have not seen an update in
three years and two months oh wow that's
that's a pro machine yeah that would
tell me that you guys might not be
talking about look like your priorities
aren't there so maybe they'll shut me up
in there rumored March event I don't
even know if there's really going to be
a March event because it seems like the
iPads are going to get pushed out but we
might still see at least a March event
for iPads and and maybe some other stuff
we'll see but they need to get on that
there's also other other shareholders
asked him code directly about the
prospects of seeing an iPad separate
from a mac and this kind of really made
me feel like the sinking feeling in my
heart Cook said he doesn't like talking
about future products but he reiterated
that he sees them as separate so the mac
and the iPad at separate he later on
expanded and said that we're going to do
the ipad that you see now we'll be able
to do a lot more but he still feels the
mac is a more feature-rich product and
that just clearly tells you that all of
you dreamers including me that we're
hoping that maybe one day Apple would
create some sort of a hybrid operating
system so that the ipad pro kit at least
do maybe a few things that the surface
pro could do but in their apple way it's
just not going to happen yeah there's
still like a big disconnect between my
phone and my computer you know like i
wish that there was some marriage there
but it just does not happening good luck
ask but good luck even your you're an
apple customer who is there's a lot of
many it's like little tiny things
they're like piecemealing to us you know
but it would be cool if I you know hop
on one thing and everything's the same
on the other you know what happened to
the big like you know apples like boom
here's the hammer this is what you want
and it was like hell yeah we haven't
seen that a long time oh no maybe
they're just seeing success with having
different you know different things I
don't know their carry their carrying
their father basically creating yeah
yeah multiple
versions of a phone with slightly better
upgrades and they're quite honestly
actually making more money from it don't
so the market isn't telling them that
they're doing anything wrong when it
comes down to the dollars they're doing
everything right should we take a little

Apple watch news the Apple watches
record-breaking cord this is according
to IDC data that pretty much covers kind
of the market and sales receipts both
online and at brick-and-mortar according
to this report Apple watch series one
and two have become a magnificant
magnificent success recording their
best-ever quarter in the wearables
market according to IDC apple shipped an
estimated 4.6 million Apple watch units
in the fourth quarter of 2016 that's up
from 4.1 a year ago also it shares the
wearables market include and this also
includes like all basic fitness trackers
the Apple watches bundles in that they
took an estimated thirteen point six
percent of that market share a little
down from the 14.1 a year ago also
though Fitbit experienced one of its
largest declines ever in the fourth
quarter Fitbit shipped 6.5 million
trackers in the quarter down from 8.4
million in the year-ago so it was a
record-breaking quarter for Apple but
overall the market not so hot but apples
really been pushing to this like a
fitness device lately yeah is that I
think people might have already just all
bought their fitness devices and there
they kind of all these things last well
I mean yeah I'm see this was actually
look out look at how silly because I'm
wearing both I'm rocking with my Apple
watch's visit today because I wanted to
some people like hating on me they're
like why do you wear two watches or why
do you wear if it'd been a novel watch
because I can that's because I'm Brian
calm yeah so your Apple watch can
contract your steps to it does but I
actually I do feel that the Fitbit
tracks them much more accurately okay I
even did things like I would go on hikes
and basically take the distance that the
hike says you know I guess if you trust
the internet right I'd look at how long
is this actual hike
you know for miles yeah and the Fitbit
every time tracked it more accurately
even in rough steps consistently when I
do multiple times like there's um
there's a why can't I remember off the
top of my head I feel so stupid I do a
few hikes like pillbox in Hawaii a
couple others and I just did it just to
see how accurate it was and I didn't
feel that the fifth it was more accurate
that's cool in at least one is tracking
your steps nice so there you go ok as we
continue to roll on through the show
Apple has 1000 engineers working on AR
augmented reality and may debut it in
the iphone 8 this is according to
Business Insider a whole slew of people
now 1,000 doesn't mean everyone is doing
like all these crazy you know putting
all these traces crazy pieces of puzzle
but we could see it as early as the next
iPhone that we've been talking a lot
about the different 3d depth sensors
that are expected to be used in the
iphone how it could possibly drive up
the cost even with the fact that the
home button on the new iphone at least
the premium oled screen version appears
to be embedded under the screen which
means touch ID might at least
temporarily go away to certain degree or
you'll use space unlocking to unlock
your phone faster I love to try to you
though I do too so helpful I do too I'm
used to it right now yeah we're all used
to it so hopefully they don't get rid of
it I I mean it would be interesting to
see how I feel like all you know
everyone's throwing every feature that
the kitchen has at the new iphone
premonition yeah not I don't think all
of its going to be in it but if it is
then everyone's going to buy one
probably like if this is I don't see
other how much better a phone might get
after this generation yeah like it's
already slowed down but there's a point
now at least for an apple foam because
we've seen these features and other
phones you know if it's really almost a
completely buttonless phone and then the
reaction time of this face recognition
or you know touch ID might live in some
some way shape or form like you have to
touch in a certain area yeah and it'll
still detect your fingerprint but all
that stuff wireless charging blah blah
blah
it could be like okay this is the phone
now this is the phone now I mean we know
we know other phones have some of these
technologies but maybe this is this is
the one that does it because no matter
what you say whenever Apple releases a
new redesign like a different-looking
phone everyone wants it Oh totally
likely that iphone 4 came out everyone
like I need that it looked so cool and
it was it was the cool to me was my
favorite design it was cool yeah it was
my favorite design so uh augmented
reality been thrown around a lot Apple's
been talking away too much about it so
it's like not exciting anymore you know
Tim Cook's like just so what you know we
love augmented reality really so do we
Tim yeah so do we all right Apple makes
me sad here trailing in the TV streaming
service category youtube or google
officially launched and announced
youtube TV what will it be it'll be a
$35 per month live TV streaming service
it will carry the big four networks
that's ABC CBS NBC and fox golf
channel's on there i'm probably going to
get it you know who's the parent company
of golf channel and bc baby it'll be on
it I most likely be it'll most likely be
on if you like pause there's a video
that shows all the channels you might be
able to catch it I don't know you can
look for it well you can look yeah it's
right there you can look for it while I
keep on talking about this SMS NBC
sports network yep it's that's where
it'll be that's probably where I know
you oh here we go golf right there
Shakalaka all right thank you so the for
all you table lovers though there really
only going to include cable channels
that are related to the big floor
networks and what does that mean that
means cable networks or families of
channels like Viacom which is vh1 MTV
and Comedy Central like Time Warner
which is TNT and TBS or a station like
AMC that our cable exclusive they will
not be part of the package that's so you
really have to like all these plans you
really have to figure out what does it
have and if it works for you but again
Apple does not have a live TV streaming
service YouTube does sony playstation
does AT&amp;amp;T DirecTV now does and sling TV
does yes they have some form of package
my favorite still right now is the
PlayStation view although it doesn't
have Viacom anymore I don't want
mtv I don't watch vh1 I could nobody
does anymore I I don't make enough time
to watch Comedy Central quite honestly I
don't watch companies generally more
either way neither do i they just kind
of fizzled yeah I mean so I'm telling
you PlayStation view is is where it's at
at least for me and I think that for a
lot of people you'd be like that usually
like yeah PlayStation views the jam so
there you go youtube it'll be launching
in a couple months they expect it really
most of their users to be streaming TV
to a mobile device so it's going to be a
standalone app it won't be like embedded
into anything and then will also be
available for television sets a laptop
as well as google chromecast and one of
the things that is coming soon is you'll
be able to talk to your google home and
say watch this is us have you seen that
show now that is an emotional i don't
know anything about it that is an
emotional roller coaster like what's it
about what do you rhian is it's a
dynamic of these people that are related
that have their own issues that are
still trying to find themselves that are
forming it's it's just deep though it's
not like some like it's this is us it
should be call like this is crear like
this I mean I don't know I I got pretty
teary-eyed in multiple episodes really
no i watch stuff to make me cry I avoid
it but a bit off your movies I'm like no
but it's like heartfelt in a good way
and in a bad way okay people that are
listening during me like yeah they're
like this is us damn that show got me
I've been watching the new BBC the world
what does it no no planet or in a day
planner pretty awesome oh my gosh yeah I
want to that'd be on youtube streaming
people don't know I brought BBC America
probably not as people that are
listening overseas before we continue as
we competed talk about all the shows we
like BBC america got the planet or two
series like basically two or three
months after be be seated oh holy BBC's
like oh whatever like I saw that long
ago i'm just like dude like remember
that snake baby iguana chase oh yes oh
my gosh ah so they first showed it on
the on the web like on a mini clip but
they have a full extended version on the
actual program something and it's like I
don't know those people are geniuses I
would love to just like sit with the
crew and just watch them go to town I
know
right yeah amazing yeah I mean they
build like technology to film this stuff
like they don't just buy a special

to push hard into video and then a fun
one the Nintendo switch is coming out

in the store for I don't know why you
should have just pre-ordered the damn
thing or and then return it or sold it
if you didn't want it or people that
have pre orders coming on friday but
here's a fun story so the switch and the
macbook pro and even the macbook have
USB see ya so this guy on twitter mike
murphy decided to be like Oh what
happens if i connect the two right if
you connect the 2 x USB see in fact the
nintendo switch actually charges the
macbook pro that's a fine it acts as a
secondary battery weird like how does
that happen even honestly I didn't let's
be honest you guys can educate us I
didn't look it up like what did what
determines the direction of the charge
yeah or is you know what takes priority
or does it have to do with the order
that you plugged it in so it's the
switch supposed to be able to work with
like a power brick like if you're on the
go when you dock it you when you dock it
it has a USBC connector okay so it has
it's a little dock with hdmi and stuff
yeah what else has a USBC connector it's
forward-thinking it's pretty cool so
that it that is crazy yeah I do want to
switch I definitely well I'm a Nintendo
collector so I have every Nintendo
friend on periscope faded away says the
macbook charges the switch if the switch
is turned off ha Oh again Oh interesting

then boom let people just pull up up
open the podcast app and you're right
there that would be sweet anyway take
care of guys thank you love that we love
all those suggestions because a lot of

educational yeah yeah like sure even at
my guard oh like yeah like even a
dresser right you're showing up you're
throwing up clips and web pages like
there's learning ones like having to
source ly feature I like all of that
yeah like ted talks is one of the number
one podcast so that can definitely my
man you have been hired by the apple
byte extra crunchy I don't know what for
but you have great idea you know I deal
with ice creams a lot actually like with
our podcasts and they're so everything
on the iTunes platform is so bare bones
like they don't want to do any work yeah
you know they just want people to put
their podcast up and have it work that's
all they want to do and that's kind of
how I don't wanna start writing like a
hobby honestly like jobs like there's
this podcast thing and he clearly
believed it because he liked to talk
about but like he said they're kind of a
little more hands-off with it right very
hands-off like it's difficult to get
them to do any work for you if you want
something fixed you know and like a lot
of times I go back and forth like trying
to explain to them what I want fixed but
uh yeah I don't see them ever doing
anything like like what you'd recommend
like unless they really get into it they
figure out a way to monetize but I don't
see anything we had a happening even
though it would be awesome I would be
awesome and just a quick thing for
people watching us live on periscope
they can't hear the calls we are working
on that hopefully we'll get something
soon well we're going to be back in our
studio the end of this month oh that's
right March 24th I'm gonna be here that
weekend night a week so when we have
full capabilities again it'll feel like
Brandi though it's gonna feel like
Brandi right we've been doing this like
basically putting together what we have
but it's so much more fully fleshed out
there yeah this shows held together with
rubber bands right now okay next call
hello this is divorcing Charlotte just
have a question do you think the 5k imac
is going to replace the mac pro is the
official workstation for professionals
who prefer apple products just wanted to
hear your opinions thanks give or I
think it comes down the professional
quite honestly like there you're the you
know I think we all choose what is our
pro machine the imax and the MacBook
Pros have more than enough power to be
pro machines so I don't think there's
ever should be a distinction like this
is the de facto pro machine look even
the mac pro which hasn't been updated
for three years at the time what's a
machine that some pros chose to use and
some still said I'm just going to get a
beefed-up macbook pro yeah so it comes
down the user for me I mean for me I
have both I have an imac on my desk and
i have a mac pro laptop definitely want
to edit on my imac they were my mom
screen I mean I do add it on my macbook
but it just takes a long long time to
you know it's hard to get two buttons
and in a hot keys and stuff and then
just exporting takes forever so I Mac
power big screen beautiful screen yeah
this is so much easier okay next call
hey guys it's matt calling from ontario
i'm looking at taking the dive and
buying a 15-inch macbook pro I'm just
wondering would it be worth waiting for
the new refresh I'd love to hear your
thoughts love the show he's about to
dive in so Who am about to dive in Trey
Songz baby
um look I think you should wait you're
at a point in time where the new macbook
pros ask I'm gonna throw it out there
because I still haven't heard from
enough of you because that means also
not enough of your buying this thing I
don't know many people that have bought
the new new Mac Pro and said they're
totally in love with it yeah yeah I know
a lot of people that are actually a
little more frustrated over time that
the touch bar just hasn't isn't really
all that and I no plan and I'm not
saying one guy I'm saying multiple
people so what I would say for you is
that you're probably going to most
likely use your macbook pro the same way
but wait for the faster process or wait
for the larger ram support like wait for
all these things that could make it more
special and you would I'm sure you have
a computer that you could deal with for
the next six months I wouldn't buy one
right now I would buy one right now even
if the macbook pro stays exactly the
same which it most likely will touch bar
will get better those things will
improve so at least you'll get a
slightly better machine I don't know how
much more function will be it's still
going to be dongle town song sounds
going to tell you the dongle town baby
so it's it's going to be about the same
but you're going to get a little more
power in juice so why not just wait if
you don't need it right now cool cool
I'm waiting for a long time okay this
message for brian Tata my name is sugar
I'm so expensive in you and I was
wondering i mentioned won an ipad i have
a macbook an iphone but what's the best
ipad to get shall wait for the new plane
17 ipads or get older model let me know
what you think thank you both the show
please let's hear your thoughts first
man i would recommend an older model
because they're cheap and they are going
to work forever still and i'm going to
be just fine let's say give you an
example i did a little i did a little
digging because people would ask me like
oh how much do you love your ipad pro a
lot especially comic book readers you
can find a 12 point nine inch iPad pro
refurbished on apple's website for 649
right now that's pretty good that's
really than what about my daughter Jen
and so I'm talking about so the ipad is
that type of thing where you don't have
to get the latest one now like really
what's going to happen in the new ones
it will be a new redesign it will
they'll almost like to support faster
USBC charging and all of them will have
the true tone display the pencil will be
improved a little bit but most people
don't use the pencil I don't think this
all those things you said I don't think
it's worth it no seriously not at all
yeah not I think the only thing that you
might want to make sure you get is a
true tone display ipad if you even want
that there's a lot of artists that are
like I don't want it to change color on
me because it doesn't show my work as
its intended to be if it's just the wipe
you know the white now I make sense so
you know maybe wait the new iPads are
supposed to be announced sometime if it
is true in March some of them might come
and spring you wait 3-4 months and then
the current iPads will be lower in price
let's do that there's also all kinds of
weird deals for like get a free iPad if
you buy this you know there's all these
weird deals all over that I see like
even some of the phone carriers like if
you buy that maybe I'm sure the iphone 8
get the iphone 8 to your agreement you
get a free iPad Mini or you know stuff
like that happens all the time so just
to look out for that too I saw a deal up
by an ipad pro get a free tinder account
oh you're ready there you go dude you
got to do that again go cool okay we got
one more call one more calm it's 18
seconds thanks for being fast hello this
is John from Minnesota and my question
is with wireless charging does that mean
that we will need to buy new imacs or
you make movies that have the technology
inside thank you so um see Jon Jon's
been reading a lot now there were rumors
and there's an actual apple patent out
there that they were hoping to use
long-range wireless charging and
something like the base of the imac
would actually be able to send out that
connection or you know be able to charge
wirelessly by outputting the transmitter
in the base but that has not been
confirmed yet that is not is not a fact
yet all reports say that Apple is still
trying to figure out this wireless
charging thing and most likely at least
in this first run of the Apple iPhone
and it'll just be the standard wireless
charging again depending on the model if
it is a model's wireless charging where
you just basically put it on some sort
of a plate now of course if Apple wanted
to go big and shock us it would be
wireless charging for with range even 10
to 15 feet it was like something cool
you just plugged into the wall and it
just like sent out a signal and charge
your stuff as you walk by even if it
would be rad even if it fried my balls I
might try that okay even if i get like
lymphoma hahaha even if one of my balls
is bigger than the other because of it i
might still do it yeah I start growing a
third ear or sometimes I serve all like
another iphone you know in the third
year I'm gonna say a third all time I
might do that I learned all that beer at
two three balls are better than than to
radioactive babies you need you could be
a juggler sure sure why not so back to
your question we we probably if at the
very least let's say let's just
speculate and they do this long range
wireless charging they'll create some
sort of a station that will be an
accessory but you won't have to buy an
entire new imac for it but if you're
rich and they do that sure yeah why not
why not train we've seen trust me i
worked at the apple store back in the
day i saw plenty of dudes dropping down
cash for things they didn't need as long
as you told them it was the newest thing
soy oh you know you wait for those guys
to walk we do like oh this guy's walking
would you like to 23 inch apple cinema
displays with your imac god you're like
you I better watch two movies at once
okay great it's like I'm miss you know
what I'd like to get a digital editing

dollars each i love that sure sale cool

dot Mac before i was called iCloud so uh

call attach rates people retail know
what we're talking about right you

like being a server in a restaurant you
like would you like fries with that yeah
same same deal do
measure people on fri attachment rate oh
you have to upsell if you're working in
the restaurant but you got up so man
that because that increases your bill
