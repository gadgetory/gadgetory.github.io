here at CES 2013 with samsung's top-end
television it's going to be available in
March 2013 in three different models 46
at 55 and a 65 we don't know pricing is
yet but it does have a lot of top-end
features as well as a very classic sort
of design what you've got is a new Smart
TV engine which in court includes now a
program guide for the first time what
you have is an S recommendations engine
which pops up at the bottom of your
screen and integrates with your cable
box and show you what's playing at the
time of course this is also compatible
with the new evolution kit which has
just been announced and that will
presumably be announced next year as
well what this does have is an upgraded
picture engine on previous years what
you get is micro dimming which wasn't a
feature of last year's TVs so what it
can do is turn off areas of the picture
at once very very micro areas of the
screen and you get much better according
to Samsung black levels as a result so
you can actually get very high
contrasting images without it being
detrimental to dark or the light areas
at the time as well the 3d engine has
been upgraded with the with up to 30%
increase in light levels when you're
using the active glasses so this TV will
be available in four sizes of 46 a fifty
five a sixty and a sixty five there are
rumors of a 75 inch but that's yet to be
confirmed so that's the Samsung f8000 TV
which will be available this year for
prices as yet to be announced it's been
