the 2013 shelby gt500 mustang it has 662
horsepower and 638 foot-pounds of torque
it is the first production Mustang to do
200 miles per hour I'm kind of hoping
that's going to happen today although my
track driver says probably not although
they are gonna let me drive at 600
horsepower favorite day ever in the cool
know you're just able to harness 662
horsepower right there my track driver
for the day gene Martindale he's an
engineer with ford special vehicle team
and just a little bit of background on
gene when he is in testing cars he races
them professionally you know it's fun to
drive but it also exercises the cars
really well so we get a feel the
suspension feel the steering feel the
tires feel the brakes all that kind of
stuff it's really cool
it's got a lot of power doesn't it I
think 550 is the most i've driven
actually because it really is the new
horsepower maximum for me though are you
doing just great you did awesome and the
sheer awesomeness cannot be overstated
let's check out some specs the car is
powered by a 5.8 liter supercharged v8
engine which produces 662 horsepower and
631 pound-feet of torque it has a
6-speed manual transmission which I can
tell you is a lot of fun the car itself
weighs just 3852 pounds it's top speed
is 200 miles per hour and it gets 15
miles to the gallon in the city and 24
on the highway inside there's a 4.2 inch
color LCD screen the shelby gt500 also
has souped-up system controls you can
drive the car like a racecar even if
you're not a race car driver like the
power assisted steering can you reach
over and push the bug that has the
steering wheel on it now do you see that
well yep okay now try it see what the
steering feels like Oh totally that's a
big difference isn't it yeah Wow so we
spend a lot of time tuning to make the
car feel this way but the best part of
this car its ability to do amazing
burnouts let's let's stop here let's do
it let's do a nice little burnout yeah
okay come to a complete stop
so rev it up to about 3,500 rpm or so
okay now go
easy easy easy easy clip are you okay
now if you want to do a Burnout without
all the hard work the car also has a
launch control feature for more
controlled wheel spins the result is
better balance for the tires during
maximum thrust you can set the mode
through their LCD track apps menu or by
just pressing this button ok let's stop
here again we're gonna do the same thing
we're gonna do at launch control so
complete stop you can see the camera can
see you ok perfect now keep your foot on
the floor unless I tell you otherwise
that's ok sorry you're in first gear
yeah plant ain't rely on ok go ahead now
this can't go for it hey my god
I have to have us after a few more laps
it was time for gene to take the wheel
oh we're gonna get chased that siren
tells you a temper my fast lap this is
gonna be good I'm gonna die you may want
to hold on this time huh you don't have
a handle in here uh-huh two hot laps
here we go okay so i just switched the
stability control to full off otherwise
known as jeans fun mode so so here we go
mode okay are you ready I'm ready
my god why or that thing yeah is that
crazy we actually left the ground though
slightly frittata did
I have to learn how to do that is it
incredible oh my god you're doing 1g at
95 miles an hour really that was 95 we
go a little faster next lap go ahead and
go a little faster next time all right I
