efficient little cars lately but how
about one that's got some real
old-fashioned guts that may be what
we're dealing with right now let's try
the 2014 Ford Fiesta ST available only
with the 6-speed manual bless their
hearts and check the tech
so what is the Fiesta ST first of all
it's the hatch body car only up front a
hot little turbo motor and you got four
nice-looking 17-inch wheels all around
unique to this car body style quite a
bit massage deep front chin a very
nice-looking deep aggressive rear fascia
deep rocker panel treatment connecting
those and a little ball cap lid on the
rear hatch what you can't see underneath
is a sports suspension what you
definitely can see on our car is the
color green Envy not as clever as they
were in the 70s when Ford had colors
like anti-establishment and Freudian
guilt but I'll take it not too different
than any other fiesta my Ford touch and
this connected head unit our base
although navigation is optional that
module isn't always there in the upper
right corner now here's my issue with
this my Ford touch which has had plenty
of Knox for being too detailed and
fiddly in this case it's also too small
and too far when I'm comfortably in this
car and I'm actually sitting forward for
the camera right now that's not really
reachable without me pulling myself
forward on the wheel to get to it I
don't like the Fords that have it up
here the little cars the bigger Ford's
put it down lower and nearer and it's
important to notice that see if it works
for you you can also plug in an iPod via
USB here's your CD slot right here this
car still has optical satellite radio AM
and FM and that's also got HD radio on
top of that now luckily given the
distance and smallness of this climate
control is broken out separately down
here now we have the optional Recaro
seat package in this car which is kind
of like that girlfriend you had back in
high school who was a foot taller than
you just grabs you everywhere we got
bolsters here that are so narrow and not
adjustable by the way that if you're big
of ribcage you almost run aground on
them and don't even feel the back of the
seat much kind of kind of wedge myself
in there big all five bolsters as well
if you didn't have these which by the
way include heating and heated mirrors
this cabin gets pretty plain Jane pretty
quick so I pretty much endorsed these
nothing unusual in the instrument
cluster but one thing is missing overall
in this car put it in reverse and
nothing happens you can't get a rear
camera in this car optional standard or
otherwise kind of a weird oversight
because given its body design and it's
huge
c-pillars it's a little hard to see out
of in parking maneuvers now speaking of
that rear camera notice what I did to
try to invoke it that's right 6-speed
manual in this car notable because
manual gearboxes are getting rare as
hen's teeth than many applications and
that's the only choice you can get on
this vehicle right on Ford one last
thing I want to show you this goofy
little button right here they're kind of
taking a page out of the Kia Soul or
vice versa and that is this one that
changes the color of illumination around
the cabin there's a light underneath
here friend of mine was asking what is
this for does a pen go there no it's
actually for nothing that I can tell
except for the light to live under it
also controlled the lighting under the
footwell and down here in the cupholders
port likes these lighting schemes I can
live it out now one of the short little
snout is a short little engine a 1.6
liter inline-4 sitting sidesaddle
driving the front wheels only but it's
highly tuned has a turbocharger and
direct injection for its EcoBoost
combination but in this case kind of
tweaked more towards performance the
numbers bear that out
197 horse 202 foot-pounds of torque all
that going into a car that weighs just a
little over 2,700 pounds gets you up to
60 in about six and a half 6.7 seconds
with again that one choice only 6-speed
manual
they've also hotted up the suspension
all around so it's firmer a little more
aggressive and you've got torque
vectoring on this car that's done by the
brakes we'll talk more about that on the
road in a moment your mpg is really good
26:35 considering how much performance
you're also getting out of this car so
there's not a lot of sacrifice going on
here one thing I want to show you here
in the engine bay see this little tube
right here that goes into a valve
enclosed in this plastic housing under
hard acceleration this butterfly valves
gonna open up and pull in a little bit
of the intake engine sound not the
whooshing part but the revving part and
that takes the audio through a tube to a
outlet somewhere under the dash through
the firewall for it's not the only
company doing this but it's an
interesting statement on the fact that
cars have become so well sealed and
quiet inside that now when you want a
performance model to sound like one
you have to circumvent your own
engineering to bring in some noise
something we used to get for free back
in the 60s and 70s there's that nice
sound coming through that thing that for
it calls the sound simple
just a nice little tight engine note
nothing raspy nothing intrusive and then
when you're not on it
things get quiet again so nice little
touch I got to say now we're in a twisty
road here in the here's what the car
does that I love so much it does what
all great cars do it loses weight when
you get on the accelerator from a 911 to
a well balanced Audi to this car the
great cars all feel lighter than they
really are that's the great attribute
and this one nails it clutch and gearbox
are real good it's a hydraulic clutch so
it doesn't have that kind of I don't
know overly light feel of a cable
operated mechanism I prefer hydraulic
and the gearbox throws are all a good
reach not super tight but you know one
would call them long now you're gonna
read some breathless reviews about this
car that say it has absolutely no turbo
lag it doesn't have any torque steer and
they're wrong it has a little bit of
that no one's iron to that out certainly
not at this price point so when you're
down at low rpms and regular traffic
let's say and you need a boost real
quick that's when you're gonna miss it
it takes a moment for some power to
develop if you don't keep the thing on
the burner at higher rpms
it'll be an issue now as for the torques
to your question when the front wheels
lose a little grip they scramble around
doing this a lot trying to get back on
track that's a front wheel drive high
torque thing and you can't conquer that
either not entirely but all in all the
cars balanced it's got a vectoring
technology it's not torque vectoring
with power its vectoring the inside rear
as part of the stability control it'll
do a little inside rear drag brake and
that'll nose it around and give you a
little bit of oversteer or at least
prevent understeer the steering is
electric assist on this car and I agree
with just about everyone who's driven it
and thinks it's a great well done system
bottom line this car sets out to be
practical it's based on a four-door
with a decent cargo bay sporting in a
way that is really accessible on real
roads and economical and it nails those
I love cars that set out to do something
and do it
okay prices as he has to st starts us
off at about 22 grand with destination
then there's really three things to add
to go CNET style 795 for navigation
$2,000 for the Recaro package the seats
heated and heated mirrors by the way the
base seats are also heated and another
800 bucks to get the moonroof purists
are gonna delete that to keep the center
of gravity and the weight from moving
around now all in about $26,000 I think
this car is a good value though it's a
$26,000 fiesta that kind of throws some
folks back on their heels but this car
sets out to do a certain mission and
accomplishes that well and I like any
car that does that whatever the mission
is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
