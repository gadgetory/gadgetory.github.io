here is a Cuisinart CSO 300 steam and
convection oven and this is a toaster
oven that'll set you back 299 dollars so
the first obvious question is why is it
toaster oven worth $300 that's as high
end as toaster ovens get well from
Cuisinarts point of view it's worth it
because of this this is the water
reservoir that holds up to 1.4 liters of
water and it'll pump that water into the
toaster oven for steam baking and also
steam broiling and also just pure steam
cooking which is great for rice now if
we just take a look at the oven itself
it certainly looks like a high-end
appliance it's got this nice sturdy
stainless steel body it's got this blue
LCD screen that looks great matches the
blue reservoir it just looks like a
high-tech high-end device and you like
that a lot another small feature that I
actually like a lot are these handles on
the sides if you look at them just right
they're located in the right spot and
they make it really easy to pick up and
carry around but one thing I don't like
is that if you do move this toast
driving around it leaks it makes kind of
a mess it leaves these puddles and kind
of spills a little bit it's always got
water dripping out of it when you move
it so that could be a little annoying
the LCD screen is another great feature
it looks really nice with the blue
backlit display and it's just really
easy to use it's got this circular dial
that will turn and let you pick exactly
what mode you want to use for your meal
so all in all this is a very well
designed well-constructed easy to use
toaster oven and for $300 you kind of
expect that right I mean it's got to be
good if you're paying that much money
for it and it is the real question
though is how well does it perform how
good is the food that it makes and we
did a lot of tests we did a lot of
cookie tests and toast pizza burgers
chicken and of course the rice and a lot
of the other unique things that this
toaster oven can make that others can't
we tried it all out and at the end of
the day when it comes to the basic foods
the foods that you can make in any
toaster oven it doesn't do a better or
worse job overall than any other toaster
oven it's a little better I'd say with
pizza maybe a little worse with cookie
it's kind of close though at everything
there wasn't really concrete data for
this one it just sort of was on par so
that means that the justification for
the price all comes right back down to
this team either the steam cooking is
worth it to you or it isn't now for
making rice and making really good moist
roast chicken and some of the cool stuff
you can do a steam it doesn't it's true
it works you know we like the rice we
like the chicken that cooked so if that
excites you if that's something that you
would love to try out and love to use in
your kitchen on a daily basis especially
then maybe this is the toaster oven for
you if you want to buy a new toaster
oven anyway if you want to upgrade and
get a high-end model I would recommend
the Cuisinart just because it offers
that new functionality there are other
high-end models that might cost thirty
dollars less or something like that but
they're not going to offer you steam
cooking and for me that's worth a thirty
dollar increase it's not worth the
increase over a budget model like the
Panasonic flash Express that we found as
low as $90 on Amazon I would rather have
that toaster oven than this one at that
price but if I'm going to spend a couple
hundred on toaster oven I'm going to get
the one that can make the most types of
food and that's the Cuisinart CSO 300 so
for CNET I'm Rui Crist happy toasting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
