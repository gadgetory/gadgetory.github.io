makeover I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your CNET update as consumers were
always on the hunt for new gadgets and
sensors to keep us connected or make our
lives easier but retailers are also
hungry for new tech and how it can be
used to track us in stores and get us to
spend more I stopped by the National
Retail Federation Expo in New York City
to see how technology is changing the
way we shop Microsoft showed how the
Kinect camera can be programmed it's a
sense when a customer picks up something
from a shelf in this demo when you pick
up a videogame the nearby TV instantly
plays the trailer for the game you
touched the Kinect is tracking the
location of what you touch so a store
has to put a product in the right
pre-programmed spot for this to work
future shopping carts could come with
tablets Microsoft also hosted a demo of
the media cart it lets you scan items as
you shop to keep a running tally of your
bill and of course ads will pop up on
the screen as you go through the store
it knows your exact location so you may
see a kleenex ad when you walk down the
tissue aisle
Intel showcased the memory mirror it's
now being used at a Neiman Marcus store
in Walnut Creek California this mirror
is really just a giant video screening
camera it records you giving a spin so
you can see what you look like from the
back or you can show to a Pitts you try
it on side by side and you can see
instantly what a sweater looks like in a
different color as it overlays the new
color on you in real time if you're
freaking out about the camera keep in
mind this isn't behind a closed door
dressing room this would be just outside
the changing area eBay demonstrated a
different type of smart change in room
mirror it created for Rebecca Minkoff
boutiques there's no camera here but
RFID censors know exactly which items
you brought into the dressing room and
the items show up on the mirror screen
if you need another size or color just
select it on the mirror and ask for
someone on the floor to bring it to you
the mirror also lets you change the
color of the room lighting and it saves
data about your session so the store can
give you more personalized service every
store wants your phone number these days
and even the mirror asks for your digits
Intel's booth also showed off ways to
keep track of products in real time
instead of tracking customers a business
will use RFID tags to track where
products move throughout a store it
knows how often a shirt was carried in
and out of a dressing room your local
bar can know exactly how much beer is
left in a keg using connected scales and
if there aren't already enough screens
in your life smart drink coolers display
translucent advertising that can change
in real time to promote your local
team's game and of course it tracks how
many times you open it at least it
doesn't want your phone number yet for
seeing that I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
