Apple bite you can all recite it with me
it's everything good and bad inside the
world of Apple so let's get to it now
the iPad pro is still headlining the
latest news especially after the results
of testing by display mate categorized
it as a top-tier display the iPad pro
rated very good or excellent in many
categories but it fell short to the iPad
Mini 4s display that set performance
records for the best absolute color
accuracy color gamut image contrast
record low reflectance and more now
Microsoft Surface pro 4 earned an
overall better grade than the iPad pro
display as well display may says the
iPad Mini 4s display unquestionably is
the best and most accurate display of
any LCD tablet they've tested but
display mate the pro is the only iPad
that can use a pencil the Apple pencil
that maybe 5% of all iPad users are
really going to use daily and I know I'm
being generous
come on that has to count for something
or nothing look I was trying to make
people who got one feel better now some
iPad pros are becoming unresponsive
after charging overnight and are
requiring a hard restart to turn them
back on how do I know this because I'm
one of those people see I thought it was
broken at first and it's happened
multiple times Apple is not officially
commented on the matter and stories like
this one only get real when they affect
you and guess what it affected me so
you're getting a bad apple Apple all
right you know I read the comments and
it feels like some of you just watch the
show just for the bad apples and you
don't care about anything else so you
know what that's a bad apple on you
now I feel better all right some Apple
stores are receiving super limited stock
of the Apple pencil and the early online
pre-orders should be arriving by the end
of next week that's good for people who
want the thing that makes the iPad pro
unique but how durable is it it's the
internet and we know people love
destroying tech all the time just cuz
Kozak's Tralee kept pushing on it and
bending it and seeing what it took to
break the Apple stylus
I mean pencil so in conclusion if you
Bend something hard enough and enough
times it probably bends and ends up
breaking okay we know the iPad pro comes
in silver gold and Space Gray but do you
believe that the silver iPad with a gold
touch ID ring exists well believe it
there is such thing as a multi-cultural
iPad pro a nine-to-five Mac reader
shared what Apple calls an extremely
rare manufacturing error and what did he
do do what anyone else would and sell it
on eBay apples selling a magnetic Apple
watch dock of its own for $79 your Apple
watch can lay flat on it or rest on its
side and be docked it's design looks
like a white UFO and will only really
match your home if you live in an Apple
Retail Store speaking of 79 bucks people
who listen to our Apple byte extra
crunchy audio podcast yes that's a
long-form version of the show with more
stories and we're talking and more
everything you all should just check it
out
well the question came up if Apple sold
the new Apple TV touchpad remote
separately and they do for 79 bucks so
get this bundled together for 149 means
the new Apple TV remote cost more than
the entry-level Apple TV box I repeat
the remote cost more than the Apple TV
holy crap that's just horrible and yes
that's another bad apple alright a Wall
Street Journal report says Apple and
banks are in talks for its own mobile
person-to-person payments service is
basically like PayPal or venmo
specifically for Apple pay and Apple
devices Apple has granted a patent for a
person-to-person payment system using
devices that communicate wirelessly
earlier this year it's not clear how
Apple expects to make money off this but
a launch for the feature could get off
the ground next year
Apple pay is also making some progress
globally in the UK Tesco bank and TSB
have launched Apple pay support Apple
pay is also finally available in Canada
and for my friends down under in
Australia but only if you're using
American Express I know baby steps but
it's better than nothing for now and
most importantly to meet Apple pay will
roll out to Domino's and Cinnabon
locations by the beginning of next year
seriously Cinnabon
it's my secret to keeping me all you
know sleek and slim and in a story that
deserves attention some of you might
have seen the video clip of a group of
black teams who were asked by an Apple
store employee in Australia to leave the
store because employees were worried
they would steal something they just
worried you might steal something oh yes
it's as bad as it sounds in disgust yeah
I need to ask you a question now the
senior manager at the store later
invited the teens back to apologise and
made it clear they were welcome anytime
The Sydney Morning Herald reports one of
the teams said she apologized to us and
told us that we are welcome here any
time it feels like we have justice now
Tim Cook then sent an internal memo to
employees making it clear what happened
was unacceptable and the video does not
represent apples values the message
Apple is open now this type of stuff
happens every day everywhere in this
world and yeah it's wrong but kudos to
the store's manager an Apple for
handling this correctly and I seriously
hope there is something that we can all
take away from this really just be good
to people all right that's gonna do it
for this week's show you can send me
your questions and comments to the Apple
bite at cnet.com or tweet me at brian
tong thanks so much for watching it will
catch you all next week for another bite
of the Apple
