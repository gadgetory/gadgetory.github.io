in the city of Los perdidos and our new
hero Nick Ramos is trying to escape with
his life let's jump into the game
you
you
hi
bye
oh crap
long way back makes trying to get to the
city center before nightfall we were
discovered location of a safe house
using the power the xbox one we've made
a rich open world with no load times
deliberately not only on massive scale
but the same incredible density would
expect from any city in real life
well
anything and everything is a weapon but
you're not just limited to what you find
let's go ahead and try to make something
a bit more effective for fighting in the
dark
ok watching
zombies are attracted to every move and
this can lead to overwhelming odds if
you're not careful fortunately there's
multiple ways to distract them
oh thank ya
whoa
damn it that's the only way back
hmm
ok
the world is filled with hundreds of
weapons you can create improvised
combinations with anywhere it's really
up to you to discover and customize the
way you do on deal with the zombie
threat
look up
driving is a critical part of
exploration as you scavenge for supplies
cars are the best way to get around but
zombies are still threat
ah
mix approaching the city center but it
looks like it's going to need something
a bit more effective than a combo weapon
to get through this on me bored with
addition of smart glass you'll buy cars
equate to go with zombie outbreak let's
just go ahead and call in some artillery
support now
dead rising
this holiday exclusively for the xbox
one thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
