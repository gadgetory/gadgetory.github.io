headlines first the robots came for our
jobs and now it turns out they're coming
for our world records ever wind company
and limited made one thousand seven
robots all danced together breaking the
previous Guinness World Record for most
robots dancing simultaneously
I almost double the number of robots so
how did they make it happen
every robot was controlled by a single
mobile device and encryption technology
ensured that there would be no
interference from nearby devices they
had to complete a synchronized dance for
a full minute
a handful of robots couldn't keep up but
more than enough made it through the
time to capture the new record besting
Chinese company up tech robotics 540
robot record will this start a new
dancing robot race between companies
only time will tell I like this kind of
technology race if we're gonna make
robot armies let's make them dance I
think yes I think dancing she solved by
dance competitions with robot yeah I
think that is um I think that is that is
the most delightful robot story I've
seen in a while
ever since VR started gaining traction
we have literally been waiting for a
story just like this
Erin Posey is a game developer with a
very specific mission he wants to bike
across Britain but he's not jumping onto
a frame and hitting the road no no he
wants to make the trip while staying in
one place and never leaving his house
using a samsung gear vr headset a
cadence monitor and an exercise bike
Jose uses Google Street maps for a
surreal but interesting VR ride across
the UK he started the journey back in
May and recently reached the halfway
point he's been keeping a diary of his
travels and says he has a new
appreciation for nausea and VR after
getting sick a few times while writing
it's definitely not a perfect process
there are lots of glitches and weirdness
while poos a rides through the areas but
it's a start toward virtual reality
applications made
this sort of tourism slash exercise well
clearly we're not there yet cuz he's
puking well yeah but I mean you could
argue that if you bike too hard you make
yourself sick anyways in real life I
guess but man I don't know I didn't
realize how much he would get sick
because he is very apparently he found
out he was very sensitive to nausea well
also they're not using an app that's
dedicated for this right it's it's using
just kind of jank together Google Maps
of course you're gonna throw together
Google Street maps with these white
cubes that look like you're playing
pacman yeah of course you're gonna throw
up it's I'm sure the framerate is awful
too it's like come on bro so what do you
like more dancing robots or I mean I
think that VR one is bears more
conversation yeah I mean the dancing VR
robots are adorable but I think the I
think VR and bikes and exercise and this
sort of like people talking about doing
bike tours in Italy and and in the UK
and stuff and this is exactly that
except it's very sort of primitive yeah
I like it I like the marriage of active
VR and I also like the idea of being
able to visit places and do things that
we normally couldn't yeah that's pretty
cool so if you guys were gonna use an
exercise machine to explore an area of
the world where in fact would it be
use hashtag hey TD VR rowing machine
rowing down the Amazon I would say a
rowing machine but at the Great Barrier
Reef cuz you don't get back you go
underwater they're good too cool um so
yeah hey TD is the hashtag hit us up on
Twitter tell us what you would want to
do for exercise in virtual reality
because I'm dying to know yes you can
also follow us individually on twitter
@ashleyesqueda yes oh that being said
everybody it's time for our phone of the
day
today's photographer is Scott who took
this glorious photo on his iPhone 5s
Scott wrote us an email and said Ashley
Jeff and producer Logan
I am deeply saddened of the news that
tomorrow daily will no longer be part of
my dreary existence I've enjoyed the
show since the very beginning and
without the sparkling ray of light your
show brings I may have to resort to
actually doing my job to fill the time
as a parting gift I thought I would
share the best photo I ever took this
was taken back on the morning of
December 7th 2013 on my old iPhone 5s as
I was flying from Sacramento to Los
Angeles you of course have my permission
use it on the show missing you guys
already Scott
pronounced like hot but with an S see
instead of an H oh I love that he gave
us the pronunciation Scott you're a real
Joker yeah we like it on it awesome
photo I always whenever I fly and I get
to see that that like blanket of clouds
I always feel like I should just I just
dive into it and let landside bounce I
know I just like be hugged by the clouds
yeah I agree but you probably just fall
through to your death it's the reality
I'm sorry it's a shattered dream I guess
I won't leap out of the plane then so
yeah if you guys want to send your
photogra feet we're accepting font
ographers until next week yep and we're
looking for the best picture you've ever
taken like Scott did see stuff hot Scott
um and you can email them to tomorrow at
cnet.com and you have to do four things
four things let us know how to pronounce
your name like Scott did well that's
gone tell us what device you took it on
so we know cuz we like tech yes give
permission to use it on the show because
we don't like lawsuits legal check mark
and a little story about why this is the
best photo you have ever taken indeed
and if you want to like shade some of
the other photos and be like no mine
this is why mine is not only the best
photo it's also better than everyone
else throw down listen guys throw down
now's the time we're in the last like
week and a half of the show so once
again we will be spinning down from our
daily on the 18th so that's the next
Thursday
Jeff will not be here tomorrow or
Thursday so make sure you get in your
stuff
a ASAP so we can discuss and check
things out early next week and that is
it for today's show I will be back
tomorrow with a brand new rocket of
science faculty in science fiction but
until then be good human</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
