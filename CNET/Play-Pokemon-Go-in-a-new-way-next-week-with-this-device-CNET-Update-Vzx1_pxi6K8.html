phone to catch pokemon in the wild
nintendo announced the pokemon go plus
wristband will be on sale next week on
Friday September 16th that's right this
hot toy is arriving the same day as the
iphone 7 and the Apple watch it's going
to be a good day to be a geek this $35
pokemon device was first announced in
June as a way to play the pokemon gold
mobile game without having to always be
staring at your phone it pairs with your
phone over bluetooth and it will light
up and vibrate when pokemon or nearby
you just press the button and it will
throw a ball to try and catch it it also
vibrates when you pass pokey stops so
you can collect items by pressing the
button just as the Pokemon mania seems
to be cooling off the game may be
getting a new jolts from this device and
from the Apple watch Nintendo and apple
announced the game is coming soon to the
Apple watch but the watch app will only
alert you when a Pokemon is nearby you
still need to pull out your phone to
catch the critters meanwhile gamers
looking for something bigger than
Pokemon may be interested in the newly
announced PlayStation probe console sony
announced this new system is going to
have double the graphics power of the
standard ps4 to improve the look of new
and existing games it also has a faster
processor and twice as much storage it
can support 4k resolution and play 4k
video from netflix but it does not play
4k blu-ray discs which is pretty odd
considering Sony would want you to buy
its movies in 4k and the xbox one s it
does support 4k discs the new
PlayStation pro will play all the same
games as a standard ps4 it comes out in
November 10th for four hundred dollars
there's also a slimmer version of the
standard ps4 coming out next week
September 15th it costs three hundred
dollars I'm Bridget Carey you can keep
