Conte and it's time to get loaded we
have a lot of news about amazon today
first off there's a new Kindle DX it's
cheaper costing 379 dollars instead of
four hundred and eighty-nine dollars
which was way too expensive it also has
a darker graphite body and claims fifty
percent better display there's also new
Twitter and Facebook integration amazon
is taking orders today and the device
will ship on July seventh amazon is also
going to start selling books that you
can read in your browser meaning you
wouldn't need a device to read kindle
books or even a software program this
will be called kindle previewer for
html5 it looks like it won't have full
books at first but rather previews of
books but I do have to think that full
books in the browser are coming soon
this will be available in a few weeks
and finally amazon has bought woot com
the online retail site that offers daily
discounts on popular products the
company claims that it will continue to
run independently but certainly the
daily deals will be featured on amazon
too and Google is accusing china of
blocking search suggestions this is yet
another bump in the road and Google's
long standoff with China over searched
censorship I won't bore you with the
history because it would take up the
whole show this is merely an update to
that saga Google News got some new
social features there's now something
called news for you which will give you
news that Google thinks are tailored to
your interests you can edit this to help
Google out in the Edit personalization
box you can also keep track of stories
that you want to follow and share
stories or groups of stories from the
news page in your social networks as
well as in Google Reader and Microsoft
is backing off on the Kin the company
will not sell the phone in Europe after
all claiming instead to want to focus on
the upcoming windows seven phone the kin
will stay on sale with verizon in the US
but after a big price drop this week
it's clear that the Kin was not a big
success for Microsoft and a diversion of
their attention from where we all think
it should be getting windows seven
phones out and pronto that's your news
for now thank you for watching I'm
natali del conte with Cena TV and you
just been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
