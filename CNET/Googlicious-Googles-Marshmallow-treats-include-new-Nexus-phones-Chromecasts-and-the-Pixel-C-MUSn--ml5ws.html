your Google Isha's it's everything
inside the world of google that we can
pack inside of a show and there's plenty
packed in after google's big product
announcements now let's jump right into
it and the rumor mills were right on the
money with the new Nexus 6p and 5x
phones Google's two new phones are
different from each other with the 6p
setting itself up as the flagship phone
to showcase Android marshmallow the
Nexus 6p brings a 5.7 inch AMOLED
display with a rear side fingerprint
sensor a Snapdragon 810 processor with
three gigs of RAM as well it also
features the best camera we've seen from
the Nexus line with twelve point three
megapixels laser-assisted autofocus and
an F 2 point 0 aperture I can't wait to
stack it up next to the other phones on
the market now the 6p also has Gorilla
Glass 4 and dual front-facing stereo
speakers one of my favorite phone
features it starts at 499 for the 32 gig
model and is available for pre-order now
now on to the Nexus 5 which might be the
best deal in town with a 5.2 inch screen
for a pure Android experience it brings
the same camera the same fingerprint
sensor a more-than-capable Snapdragon
808 processor 2 gigs of ram and Gorilla
Glass 3 with a starting price of 379 for
the 16gb model available for pre-order
now an either phone brings optical image
stabilization there's no wireless
charging and no microSD card slot these
might be big emissions in a step back
for some people I totally agree but
where the nexus 6 really didn't resonate
with its bulky design the new 6p + 5 X
will be great phones for users who
really love a pure Android experience
and I already have mine on pre-order
that's right the Apple white guy can
have an android phone and I also had an
HTC One so I'm sorry if I broke your
heart but i just love tech now the
products that really captured my
attention along with everyone else with
a new chromecast and chromecast Audio
forget how the dongle looks like you'll
barely see it and forget that they
called this color lemonade not yellow
but lemonade and this one is coral I can
tell you as an expert in colors that's
not coral that's red and this is black
so yeah they got that one right both
will retail for a cool
$35 and bring improved 802 11 AC Wi-Fi
support the new chromecast brings faster
video playback and its new app brings an
improved search that looks for a movie
or a show and tells you which service or
app you can watch it from the chromecast
Audio can stream music from your phone
to any speaker in the house it's
connected to and now supports Spotify
for premium members it's even designed
like the smallest vinyl record you'll
ever find now google also announced
their play music service will be getting
a family plan option for for 295 46
users that's the same as Apple musics
pricing but the magic with chromecast
products is being able to use any iOS
device Android device and even your Mac
or Windows laptop it truly supports any
platform and this might be the ultimate
stocking stuffer this holiday season
you'll just have to teach your mom or
dad how to use it all right Google
wasn't done and made sure to throw its
hat into the tablet with a detachable
keyboard market with the pixel see
pitting itself directly with Microsoft
and Apple this holiday season it has a
10.2 inch screen 308 pixels per inch an
nvidia x1 quad-core processor and it
will be running android marshmallow not
chrome OS its magnetic keyboard case
looks sleek and sturdy and was even
demoed in every position by Andrew
Bowers who honestly looks like a cross
between apples Tim Cook and Neil Patrick
Harris and I only bring that up because
all of you were thinking it or at least
one of you were now the pixel C will be
available later this year and starts at
499 for the 32 gig version the keyboard
is 149 and if you weren't sure Google is
making it clear that it wants to be your
one-stop tech shop for the Android
ecosystem I think overall it was a solid
keynote the new Nexus phones will win
back users at it were turned off by the
Nexus 6 because it's really all about
featuring marshmallow I love the
chromecast the pics we'll see isn't for
me and the lack of a Chrome OS will turn
off the diehards but it's literally
Google's own answer to the iPad and my
favorite part of the keynote this guy
who is really and I mean really into
playing that angry birds go game alright
that's going to do for this week's show
you can email us at Google it's just at
cnet com or tweet at brian Tong tell us
what got you fired up or what let you
down and we'll throw some of your
comments in the show next week thanks
for watching we'll see you next time for
some more of
boobalicious google Isha's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
