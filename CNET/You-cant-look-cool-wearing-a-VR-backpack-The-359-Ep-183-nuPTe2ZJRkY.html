on Wednesday februari 22nd it's episode
183 of the 359 podcast and joining me
today as a dream team Ben Fox Rubin and
Roger Cheng good morning guys OMG the
originals original the a choice yep yeah
welcome back Roger by them thank you
roger was a little sick yesterday it was
feeling a lot better feel a lot better
mostly mostly still eating oatmeal bread
yeah he's still slow so be kind of nice
to him on the tred now it's fine if you
want to punch me the face plug benefit
oh yeah if the guy is not in the stomach
context he had food poisoning exactly
the guy that says I want to punch Roger
Cheng in the face shows up today we
would definitely be happy to have you so
what's on the show today we're gonna be
talking about a VR backpack that's
almost two thousand dollars Rogers gonna
fill us in on more 5g wireless network
trials oh yeah it's it's coming it's
coming eventually yeah and also Alfred
Inge who is often on the podcast wrote
about the brooklyn botanical gardens new
algorithm powered a drainage system so
we'll talk a little bit about that too
as always send in your questions and
comments Brian will get to the best ones
at the end of the show that's about it
let's let's get moving as do it all
right we're gonna get this recording out
of the way everybody hang out will be
back and join you in the chat and we'll
hang out have a lovely morning together
in exactly three two welcome to the 359
where we talk about the top tech news of
the day plus whatever crap we want to
throw in I'm Ben Fox Rubin I'm Roger
Cheng our own dan ackerman reviewed the
MSI vr1 a fairly ridiculous looking 1900
dollar virtual reality backpack that
lets you move around a little bit more
easily in vr by untethering you from a
stationary PC oh yeah this is genius
Roger would you buy this thing no well I
mean if I wanted to ensure that I would
never have sex again yes totally ah this
is the best for messages option it
really is some serious birth control you
can watch the video here Dan moving
around in the viewers
some and to be fair it does what its
promise it promises it does work it yeah
usually with these high-end VR systems
like oculus rift revive you have to plug
it into a a PC a powerful pc at usually
stationary so you've got these wires and
cables everywhere I find them really
annoying actually Oh totally so it's one
of the most annoying parts of like it's
apparently you're supposed to be
immersed in this VR were right which
console eat ripping over this caves axis
oh so this is a solution right to take
away that that that cable element and
put it in put in your backpack case
you're wearing your VR system it looks a
little comical it's a little dorky I
think it's way too pricey at two
thousand dollars yeah and you still need
to get a VR headset it's not like it
includes exactly this one is integrated
with the HTC vive right did I pronounce
it right that time yep the vibe okay bye
you know so it's I was still clunky I
can appreciate what they were trying to
do this this feels like this kind of
bridge to you know that that real
solution of getting everything kind of
integrated into your headset so you
don't have to worry about having this
cable connected to your PC whether it's
all your back on your table this is sort
of a sort of a quick fix if you really
need to have right now featherless VR
experience a full of your experience you
know this is probably your best bet but
it's also just wait around for a little
yeah the long waited a little bit longer
we did see some of this stuff at CES
that there are going to be some wireless
vr add-ons a little bit later this year
so I would probably recommend you hold
off and not buy this thing but if you
really really need it today I guess go
for it next verizon is continuing trials
for its 5g wireless network Roger
Phyllis in on the details the 5g hype
train continues so so much hype I know
for those of you not know five G stands
for fifth generation the next generation
of wireless technology where you've got
4g LTE now which is pretty comparable to
your home broadband speed a 5g is
supposed to be way way faster you know
ten to a hundred times faster than what
you're getting today that's than
anything you can even get at home with a
wired connection yeah that's better
right better than even fiber yes if it
actually does what it claims it's good
though what verizon announced was that
they're launching
test more tests in 11 US markets and
Arbor Atlanta Bernards ville New Jersey
Brockton Massachusetts Dallas Denver
Houston Miami Sacramento seattle and
washington DC if only I lived in
Bernardsville New Jersey sadly I would
be on the L on the dodgy New Yorkers are
out of luck as well as folks in SF post
both coasts unless you're new jersey I
guess so theme it is is it's not true 5g
mobility that's the other hook right
this is really meant as a more of a home
broadband replacement so instead of all
the cables coming into your house your
cable box or dsl modem you'd have this
actual 5g modem and it actually be
broadcast to you wirelessly powering
your home's Wi-Fi internet connection
pretty cool stuff we're slowly getting
them yeah pretty cool stuff it's not
really you know it's not the full
promise of 5g but step in the right
direction right so last Alfred in wrote
about the brooklyn botanical gardens
algorithm powered drainage system which
makes sure the water garden there
doesn't overflow during rainstorms seems
like a pretty cool concept definitely
check out the story and yeah if you want
to read more about these check us out on
CNN I'm Ben Fox Rubin Roger J thanks for
listening and welcome back I think we
actually ended on time at that time no
you didn't I got yo good I gotta yell
that yesterday and enough for picking 20
seconds over in seconds this is
difficult this is this is listen we are
very rigorous here at that's 359 for
those of you end at four-twenty that is
not good for those in well it might be
great for some it might be for those
ambitious podcast pursuers don't ever
try to marry yourself up to a distinct
time right and have it be the title so
you can never change never get away from
it until you started caring right Danny
Green in the chat is looking forward to
5g tests and charlotte so shout out to
charlotte all right yeah is that blowing
on the city's i mentioned i don't know
you named all named a whole bunch of
them probably wait to find out probably
way too many all 11
um let me see I don't think sure I don't
see it on the list yet know that good oh
you're looking forward to yeah I mean
look it's it's gonna get there again
this is this is kinda the early days 45
days I've been really true 5g since they
haven't figured out what the standard
looks like but it is compass it's a cool
idea that you know I thought the deal
with a verizon technician rolling up to
my house and like laying down cable and
wires going my drilling holes into my
house putting cables in to connect my
home this is all done wirelessly right
kind of nice yeah Annie's definitely
cool Danny also asks if the iphone is
going to work on a 5g which nope nope
sorry not for a long time nope no no
sorry Danny how many years are we
talking here a couple years okay so look
again this is a home broadband
replacement it the 5g signal goes in
your home and it turns into basically
your Wi-Fi signal or your online
connection right powers everything in
your home but it's Ted in terms of
things actually be able to keep capable
of picking up a 5g signal we're still a
couple years away because companies in
the world hasn't really agreed upon a
standard what 5g looks like since this
why Verizon stopped laying down fios
cable because this is going to be the
next iteration pretty much I mean I ok
they kind of see this as ultimate
solution in terms of getting past the
expensive hurdle like deploying all that
physical wire right fibers right
so--okay so does that mean that the
cable company is not going to have these
monopolies in like they do in a lot of
areas that's why I was pretty attention
about the idea of fios but then they
stopped developing it they stopped
growing it out well they also realized
how expense for wine all right but if
this is if this is a way for them to you
know provide some level of competition
in the market then yeah no that's great
for custom this is these are all early
trials they don't have enough spectrum
to really do this in a real big way so
we're a couple years many years away
from this being a real legit service for
everyone I mean there are a lot of this
is test love this is its kind of
building on the hype of 5g but it's not
quite there yet we're not this could be
a couple years before we cuz this isn't
all the hype show we're talking to
the hype of VR the hype of 5g fiber VR
that backpacks real man package is real
it is beautiful yes the backpack just
makes you want to play laser tag yeah
that's that's what it looks like our
minds me a Ghostbusters a little bit ago
Tom pack but more laser tag just because
it doesn't look as cool as it
Ghostbusters proton pack the truest
busters thing is definitely cool looking
like you would walk around like imagine
if they have that at for Halloween
imagine if I had peripherals like the
actual proton gun you know I mean that's
because DC vives has that accessory that
if someone built like a fixed actual
what is it done the proton gun actual
proton gun they could plug in the five
accessory and it actually see in the
virtual world you actually bring the
back gun ok right now sold on virtual
reality and shall we get thousands and
thousands of dollars I can live at all
my childhood fantasies yeah Stay Puft
Marshmallow Man shows up in the virtual
world firing at with your proton gun why
hasn't anybody done this yet let's go
back to 5g for a second let's talk about
competitors yeah about eighteen t 18
eighteen t was they actually put out
another announcement today in five you
saying that they'd actually completed
that trial testing streaming DirecTV now
video service over 5g so they're the
same kind of place of verizon it so kind
of doing these little small trials kind
of trumpeting the fact that you know
we're doing fudgie we do the 5g you know
you can make the argument that they're
they're talking about fives you so much
because they're for the core business is
not doing so great right yeah yeah in
terms of core wireless business t-mobile
and Sprint or eating their lunch right
now and so they're kind of looking to
the future like yeah so our business
today isn't doing so great but look at
tomorrow so the you are those discount
guys you know t-mobile and Sprint are
they also doing these five trees yea big
yes they're all doing 5g trials to some
extent I would save verizon AT&amp;amp;T or
definitely up ahead they've talked about
this a lot earlier they've been
deploying these tests around the country
for longer than sprint and t-mobile have
so the thing of it is is again it goes
back to spectrum they all have like a
little bit spectrum that they can test
5g at on nobody has in a spectrum to run
like a full nationwide network which is
why no one's talking about that right
now so until that matter gets settled
until we actually get some nights
5g is still kind of a come a pipe dream
staying on the topic for a second Arjun
and Danny arjuns got 150 megabyte
internet in India he says and says this
God light jealous of you also jealous of
Danny yeah who says he's got google
fiber which we do not have here in New
York yeah but he's still looking forward
to the 5g because it sounds like it's a
whole lot less to install a lot less
overhead yeah and that's great for for
both companies like Verizon as well as
well as a customer right cuz it's really
just like sending you a box and like go
pushing a few buns on the Home Office
and that's it you can it sounds like
Google Fiber probably ran into the same
problems that Verizon I think that's
what I think that's why Google's pulled
back on the fiber is so expensive it is
it's it's expensive and you know what a
lot of cities google actually go fiber
head really easy because a lot of cities
were inviting them in to like bring in
bring Google Fiber to us we wanted
Verizon and even 18t when they were
deploying fiber over the last couple
years they had to deal with a lot of
this municipality is asking for things
right like oh well if you're gonna put
this fiber and could you also like
install a park here and maybe add this
little thing like they were asking for
all kinds of favors to get the full
permissions called franchise and get the
franchise to be able to actually put in
fiber it was always a weirdest thing
because when Verizon was fighting this
battle to get fiber in it seemed like an
obvious there's no brainer like bringing
a competitor to cable right like we want
to have something else that's
competitive to cable TV and fast
internet service but communities all
over the country overs were like well
you put the stuff in could you also
write water my garden yeah you know but
it's interesting they didn't treat
google that way i guess a lot of those
municipalities probably looked at it and
be like hey we have google as a partner
yeah becky i think at the point that
google started doing it they community
started smart nothing like whoa actually
having fast internet is a serious draw
now it wasn't as it wasn't before is a
lot more of a draw now and of course you
have the cachet of being a Google Fiber
city which was its wrath is so rare
thing right it's gonna yeah I mean it's
it's going to continue to be rare
because they're just not laying down as
much fiber as they had been well because
they say also see what Verizon sees what
ATT sees the food
isn't doing it wirelessly right without
in the ground infrastructure you save so
much money so much time so it's just
yeah it's just easier to go wireless
it's just interesting to hear that we're
not really close to that actually
happening you're talking two years away
I mean like 35 years away something like
that which is a long time in the time
you know you know I mean optimistically
yeah three years would be good ooh you
know it's it's it's a little tough I
mean I think the i think verizon 18t
would probably quibble on a timeline but
I've said it's gonna be difficult
getting the spectrum for us all right
speaking of timelines before we wrap up
because we're just about out of time
here yeah let's speculate one more time
about iphone support for 5g because who
was asking in the chat um oh I'm sorry I
lost track oh come all was asking in the
chad do you think it's gonna be upwards
of 10 years or less than that oh yeah
let's lesson take that would be business
suicide i'm thinking they'll be honda
like 7g by then I think everyone's
saying broad adoption of five jill
happen by 20 20 20 20 20 21 that sounds
about right so i can see apple kind of
jumping in around that time maybe maybe
a little bit longer because apple
usually takes a little bit longer to
adapt new technology yeah they've just
remember the first iphone the first
iphone was not 3g ryuuji phone they went
to 3g a year later so same with LT like
it took them a while to get the LT it's
interesting to things that Apple tread
so cautiously on it's not like faster
service is thin ice right but they they
all whatever it alone take the backseat
it when everybody else innovative in
favor of it as much as Apple gets you
know just credit being an innovator they
really do like to sort of follow along
I'm saying it's interesting what they
play it safe on I would argue they play
it safe on almost everything yeah fair
enough fair enough if they had balls
iphone 8 would be 5g well no I would be
a little that would make no sense
because there's no 5g now that was a
great marketing though that would be if
they Jesus age I'm a 4k TVs before
anybody broadcast friday it's true
that's true we're ready it would be a
fun little coup are they do part of the
problem is to stick a 5g radio the phone
now would make it the size
I don't know a couple of bricks yeah
look at me i would have the old school
break ya again welcome to iphone 5g oh
hey right bae one last minute question
came through and it's a good one um what
do you guys think about the comeback of
the note 7 uh wait what come back of the
nose oh you were sick oh you said you
saw it early I I saw the headline it's a
little bit of a rumor mill but
apparently the note 7 may be coming back
I really I wonder skeptic no nothing
just in an augmented form so it's gonna
be small with smaller battery to
accommodate and it's basically like note
7 light no 7 diet I mean the euro same
phone if I were samsung I would just
wait for the no date like that's what
everybody yeah that's I think that's
kind of what everyone's playing Alex
what are you doing yeah cuz they're
trying to salvage the name well they had
to recall the thing twice already so I
think I were if I were samsung I just
just wait for the sled dog it's gonna be
awesome the eights gonna be awesome they
learn from their mistakes arguably the
seven was also awesome well you jazz
some soft rough minor minor problems are
you minor very minor just saying it's a
good question thank you for a total for
submitting jacket I mean I don't I'm
skeptical about that but yeah all right
okay that's a good place to wrap it up
you wanna you want to out Ross go I'll
do it I'm guys yes all right I'm gonna
look up at the at the notes the 359 time
gave myself a label on iTunes TuneIn
stitcher SoundCloud feedburner and
google play music boo boo and of course
of course of course on sina com thanks
everybody for watching we'll see you
again tomorrow cuz of me I'll be gone
for a week going off to Barcelona for
mobile world congress oh look please
check in the cnet and see all of our
swords we'd have a ton of stories of the
next couple days about all the comings
