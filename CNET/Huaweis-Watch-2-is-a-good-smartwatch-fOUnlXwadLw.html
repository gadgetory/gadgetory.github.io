connectivity but don't have an iPhone
Huawei may very well have you back the
Huawei watch 2 released in Australia
comes with 4G supports the cellular
connectivity also works in the US while
a says but only in metro areas and with
select carriers the perks of this
connectivity include listening and music
while you're on a run calling an uber if
your phone dies and making James
bond-esque calls from your wrist you'll
likely get less usage out of this than
you think I had to go out of my way each
time I use these apps cuz I had my phone
with me anyway other than the 4G
connectivity the Huawei watch 2
represents all the good and bad that
comes along with Android smartwatches
it's big and it's bulky but it's stylish
as far as big and bulky watch this book
it also needs to be recharged everyday
possibly more depending on how much 4G
business you get up to it'll give you
all the regular text email and Facebook
notifications if you're into that sort
of thing Android wear is a good
operating system Apple's watch OS feels
a little bit more fluid but Android wear
is still more cohesive than fitbit's OS
and smoother than the Tizen system with
Samsung's wearable travels what area
where Samsung has a design leg up though
is hardware you navigate the gear s 3
using the rotating bezel in conjunction
with the screen for the watch 2 though
is all touchscreen at one point 2 inches
there's not a lot of space especially if
you have fat fingers like me and that's
exacerbated by the screens in Cleveland
the Huawei watch 2 also has all the
features of a dedicated fitness tracker
there's a built-in GPS in there which is
helpful for runners and cyclists plus a
heart rate tracker vo2 max calculator
and even a virtual code it's also
dedicated out which will relay you all
your health data well it's missing is
waterproofing sorry swimmers the Huawei
watch 2 is a good SmartWatch
but like all smartwatches out there
Slone in the central wire i'm daniel
