a wiggle of a finger I'm Bridget Carey
this is your CNET update when it comes
to smart home technology you could say
we're in an awkward adolescent phase
right now companies are giving us new
ways to control our home devices through
apps but they don't always work together
nicely some respond to your voice
commands but who wants to yell at your
TV to change the channel and then
there's hand gestures the company
eyesight has developed technology to
control your television with little
wiggles of your index finger I got to
check out a demo of their product in
action it's called single cue and you
mount it to the top or bottom of the TV
it's about the size of a Kinect the
camera inside the text when a finger in
the room is raised and that finger just
has to sway left right up and down to
scroll through a menu to make a
selection you tap your finger to your
thumb if you're channel surfing you
could do rapid-fire tapping to cycle
through channels it's very sensitive on
my first try I was a little irritated
trying to get it to select what I wanted
and sometimes it wouldn't register my
finger is being raised maybe it takes
some time to perfect those Jedi channel
surfing skills you can also put your
finger to your lips in a shushing motion
to mute the TV I was concerned about the
privacy but the creators say it's not
identifying your face or sending that
data off site anywhere rather the camera
is just looking for the shape of a
finger if you put your finger down and
someone else on the couch lifts their
finger they take over control it picks
up anyone in the living room in a 67
degree arc the single cue connects to
multiple cable and satellite boxes as
well as media streamers like the Apple
TV it connects with Phillips smart
lightbulbs if you want to set the mood
lighting with your finger it's $200 and
on sale now that's pretty pricey for
something that can be temperamental at
times you can spend less on a logitech
harmony home control all-in-one remote
but then again finger waving is more
impressive to guests and speaking of
Logitech it just came out with another
new home gadget an Internet webcam
called the largest circle it's not quite
a traditional security camera for $200
you can get push alerts when motion is
detected but it also lets you check in
on family members with a live streaming
video feed you can
have a conversation with two-way talk
and it sends you a 30-second video recap
of your day it competes with other
webcams like the nest cam but maybe the
best invention to come to the smart home
is the smart Budweiser beer cooler
dubbed the Bud II it tracks how much
beer is inside and it shows a number on
the front door of how many cold ones you
have left this link IQ smart fridge also
knows how warm your beer is based on
when you put it in it gives you a cold
countdown when beers are ready to drink
it also reminds you to pick up beer
before game day and you can set it to
scroll a custom message on the front but
you may need to have a few beers to
convince yourself it's worth three
hundred dollars that's it for this tech
news update for Moorehead to see Netcom
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
