surveys we get some dope advertisers
that make sense for the show will keep
the show rolling but you know we're
getting there we're moving and we're
moving along rice is a step in the right
direction awesome okay big news today
this week this day on this day apple TV
released out to stores you can buy them
right now if you're listening this and
you want to get yours you can stop
listening to our podcast go to bestbuy
go to apple stores they have them
physically there I've been able to play
with the Apple TV I know I I led the
story with the ipad pro stuff each of my
time just talking about Apple does
everyone cares about that sorry yeah
right but at the wrong link so I've had
a chance to play with it I think it's it
surprised me it's a lot better than I
thought I think the interface and the UI
is really smooth the touchpad when the
way you move around through icons it
just really it flows like butter I think
one of the biggest issues with that
touchpad though is typing whenever you
have to type in a you know authenticate
your username your email addresses your
passwords you know things like Netflix
things like your apple account it's
really hard because that that there's
not a duck it's not a yes directional
pad it slides all over the place ah it's
it actually drives me oh so there's no
like but no actual d-pad anymore it's
just a like a force touch Yeah Yeah Yeah
right um but the touchpad overall when
you move around through icons and shows
really smooth the other thing that I
really dig about it um the voice
commands the siri commands everyone i
don't think a lot of the reviewers who
got it really took enough time with it
because all they said is and it just
does TV shows and movies which is true
it is a little more contextual where you
can say shows from the 80s featuring
this actor which I like which is helpful
which is helpful it all
so if you just say the name of a show
it'll show you based on apps that
support this voice search where you can
purchase them or watch them so it'll
show the netflix option the apple store
option and i'll show hulu option so
that's good that's helpful but no one's
talking about the fact that i just tried
all these different things um it didn't
do anything calendar based but you can
look up stock prices on your Apple TV 2
shown on the bottom you can find out the
weather in your area or other places and
you can also get sports scores so yeah
you know it's just some extra stuff
because although it is limited
specifically more to TV shows and movies
it does other things Apple has
officially said on the record there's a
BuzzFeed article that they just said
that Siri support will be coming to
apple music which is big so fair enough
music subscriber it's not there yet
really a lot of the services don't have
Siri support you could say play hotline
bling play me some Drake call me on the
cell phone actually bought a drink some
not a Drake famine this bad thing I
liked it yeah so you'll be able to do
that soon it's not out yet but series
support is coming there they need to do
it put in a lot of other places I just
said with Siri show me my iCloud photos
and then it launched the photo app which
was cool so it's is doing little things
a few things here and there um but you
know we'll see how it evolves I think
the UI is really a big deal looks really
nice and then the biggest killer the
sleeper everyone's talking out it's
really it's an iphone on your big screen
now so you have all these apps and these
apps I played with I did like there's a
seven-minute workout app that actually
is pretty cool um some of the games like
that are classics like Jetpack Joyride
remember that yeah yeah it's just fun
and stupid a play that on your TV I can
totally see with my nieces and nephews
or if you have kids playing stuff like
that there's not any of the crazy
complex games Apple has put a 200 Meg
limit on app sighs so there's a lot of
really killer apps out there that are on
my iPad that are on my iPhone that you
can't put on the Apple that's a bummer
that just because a storage space on the
Apple TV so it's not even that I think
that Apple decided this is the limit
that we're gonna point because they want
you to put more apps on it they want
them to be more lightweight but for
example i just i love mortal kombat and
the controls would still work on that
touchpad yeah but that things like I'm
guessing that app is around 500 600 megs
and that's why it's not available yet
the problem with this 200 mega limit is
that apple says oh you can use it to
these apps can actually download on the
fly data as you play them or as you use
them but that doesn't work for all apps
is that what do you mean that's like
kind of like works like a cloud yeah
exactly so they can put these assets up
on on their cloud and then as let's say
a game progresses it'll download
something like the levels or things like
that but out of the gates is a 200 mega
man I i think i think that's to me
that's a bummer that is a bummer because
I think riedel gates they would have had
a lot more apps actually available for
the Apple TV it's a little limited and
right away you're limiting developers
you know he's like I don't know if I
want to make something for this because
I can't make what I want to make yeah so
they're super lightweight games overall
uh but i think that the App Store is
going to be big when it comes to
interactivity there's a QVC app which is
cool because you can like buy stuff and
watch TV I'm waiting for the sports apps
to really evolve Apple showed a demo of
the major league baseball app when they
first showed it off where you could
actually if you had something like a
major league I don't know what they call
it if they call it the season pass for
NBA it's called NBA League Pass yeah but
you could watch your games stats would
show you could switch between games and
see that's that's pretty cool that's
interactive TV yeah they're looking for
ways to just you never have to turn off
your Apple TV just give me on all trying
to get but I want to see this taken to
the next level I think that if we can
eventually and this is down the road get
to the fact that look we can already
start streaming some of these live TV
programs and again whenever they're
streaming they're a little behind maybe
four or five seconds behind yeah but if
you could do live voting and live
polling yeah I'll watching a TV show
that's on your Apple TV um that would
help you know this whole interactive TV
thing that we're talking about that
would that would make it next level to
me yeah and so I hope that as things
evolve we get to that point that's way
down the road but right now they've got
to be able to load this with really more
pelling apps that are going to work well
for us that was cool I'm just a quick
thing about other details just the
overall appletv story amazon is
following through with their
announcement that they are yanking and
removing all apple TV hardware and
resellers from the Amazon my website
they also removing chromecast as well
their argument is oh we don't want to
it's confusing consumers no it's not
dude that's funny because I brought my i
bought my chromecast on amazon exactly
it's a it's a competition thing amazon
and the problem with that is amazon is
the base online retailer in reality
they're actually going to lose business
they will because sure you can sell
amazon fire TVs but people look at how
the numbers are bearing out it's not
like just cuz i go to amazon i'm only
gonna buy our TV they go to amazon for
the best price they're going to lose
money by doing this thinking that it
will force people who were looking for
an apple TV 2 by a fire TV is not going
to happy I don't think anyone's gonna go
to amazon said I can't find the apple TV
so I'm gonna buy the M the fire TV yeah
no that's not gonna happen no there's
going specifically there to find a
specific thing one hundred percent of
the time I believe it's a stupid move
yeah it's a stupid move it's stupid is
dumb all right also on some cool things
and some subtle details about the Apple
TV the apple TV actually supports 3d TV
content so how does that work date to
hold your TV no I'm sorry Oh by the time
I was thinking oh no so some games
currently I think it's only Pangaea
games or Pandora games I can't remember
the name of the company off the top of
my head I should maybe if I look in this
article it'll say it but they did a long
time ago they did some fun apps there's
like a bugs world app what else you're
right pendulum Pangaea software so if
you turn on they have games like air
wings bug them to was on those like
original imax way back in the day nano
sore was this like flying game where you
had like a dinosaur eggs and stuff you
can actually turn on the 3d feature of
your TV set pop on your glasses and your
game will be in 3d so the apple TV
supports this not all games because
games were
originally really built for the ipad and
the iphone they don't have this 3d
support yet but it's cool that you'll be
able to get some of this fun 3d gaming
directly onto your Apple TV it's already
baked in there you don't have to do
anything it's just a matter of game
supporting it and turning on your
settings that's pretty awesome when you
first said that I was thinking 360 video
that's why I was like I'm gonna pick up
your TV and moving around but but that
is pretty cool yeah you don't have to
have a special TV for that oh well you
have to have a 3d compatible 3d
compatible and long as you do that
you'll be good so that's all the apple
TV news again I think overall
surprisingly a lot better than I thought
I actually really like it I'm still not
sure if it's better than a roku 4 from a
Content standpoint it's not but from a
UI standpoint and the potential of the
app store the app store is not there yet
but that's gonna eventually happen and
then the UI though is actually really
slick let's go really really Glee David
Katz Meyer cnet reviewer gave it pretty
high marks right yeah yeah yeahs review
guys yeah we've got it we've got a price
by going on check out cnet's review see
what you think but it's a fun device
alright moving along another Apple
gadget that we're waiting for to come
out in November rumors have pointed to
early November apple plans to start
selling the ipad pro on november 11th
that is according to a report from nine
to five Mac earlier reports this week
show that Apple has been training the
retail associates with the deadline to
finish that training on November the
sixth which would then typically I used
to work at apple retail back in the day
they give you that lead time and then
the product is typically coming out
within a week after that deadline date
so November 11th appears and nine if I
Mac has been on the money geez yeah on
the money it's not even close i mean
apples probably like mad at nine if I
Mac they were they know so much about
what's going on with them November the
11th is the target date for the ipad pro
which is I've told people over and over
it's although I know the surface pro is
a better product that does more I've
just because of the ecosystem of the
apps I've want I've wanted a big-screen
ipad for a long time nice and I'm gonna
grab or two right I'm gonna get the
whole I'm we don't know if I care about
the keyboard but I'm gonna I want to get
it just to have it when I do work on the
road yeah
the pencil I don't care about because
but I'm going to buy it and test it out
they also announced that there will be a
little kind of a dongle adapter because
right now they show people connecting
the pencil there's a lightning port of
the ipad right Soto you can make like a
protest sign ah you won't have to do
that you can't you could but there's
also a little adapter to connect it to
an actual lightning cable if you want
someone was asking about getting impaled
with that Apple pencil that made no
sense you can't get I mean everything's
possible right yeah maybe will there be
you someone that gets impaled by an
apple pencil in our lifetime probably
let's hope suggs that'll be very good I
think it's ER for ya good story it'd be
good story for us yeah um also as we
transition so yeah ipad pro november
11th that's a big deal i'm pretty stoked
about it and we're not gonna tell you
anything but we got something baked we
don't we have something cooking yes we
have something cookies cooking and it's
awesome man I'd be like I was singing it
for like two days straight haha we have
made my head right now we have been
cooking we have been cooking so look out
for something in the next couple couple
weeks or so to time with the release of
the ipad pro okay we want to get through
this really quickly but just kind of
tell you a little brief overview of
apples earnings why is it important it
kind of just gives you an indication of
what's happening with apples business
they released a recent earnings report
for q4 of 2015 which is fiscal q3 based
on earnings apple had a record revenue
result of 50 1.5 billion dollars that's
revenue and 11.1 billion dollars in
profit that's billion with a be Billy up
51.1 burien dollar that is incredible
now if you want to break down some of
the things who are the rock stars it's
always Apple's iPhone that continues to
drive the business which makes investors
a little worried and a little you know
like uh what happens when the iphone
doesn't sell anymore well the iphone is
still selling 48 million iphones were
sold compared to 39.2 in the year-ago
quarter so that jumped up significantly
ipad sales still down
nine point nine million compared to 12.3
million from last year even with the
iPad pro beach I don't know I don't know
I'm saying I'm saying as a second
thought even with the ipad pro coming I
don't see that number changing
drastically yeah me neither I I think
feel like everyone who has an ipad they
already have it they know what it does
and they're not gonna you know they
gonna hang on till till the bitter end
I've had pros a niche market yeah
definitely you know I don't know many
people that have an iPad they're saying
I've got to have the ipad pro people
that are artists and creatives are
saying i love that ipad pro looks like a
cool option yeah but still I don't think
that's super get sly Kasich alee apple
ipad sales from last year in the same
quarter have dropped about two two and a
half million units an iPad pro is not
gonna make up those two and a half
million units no I don't see it I could
be wrong Apple could surprise me we will
see also Mac sales rose from 5.7 million
compared to 5.5 million in the year-ago
quarter so Apple doing big things there
the i have iphone continues to dry
iphone i can't even talk iphone continue
to drive their business thirty percent
of iphone buyers in q4 of 2015 base on
this switched from an Android smartphone
the trafficking of those trying to
convince my parents to do the same man
is it'll make your life easier to write
yeah sending them pictures and stuff
they're always like can you send us
separate text messages with the photos
because we can't get them on our android
la la la la so now after like you know
it's a pain in the butt i also wanted to
show love real quick note Apple is
partnering with American Express to
bring Apple pay to Canada Australia
Spain Singapore and Hong Kong nice
expanding their you know they're
targeting the beginning of 2016 for this
I know haven't got a lot of
international love and a lot of
international listeners out there so i
have actually we have a phone call about
about this later Oh am I got to be able
to answer it no it's it's more just like
he's just kind of giving everyone a
heads up about some marketing deal with
different credit cards that have
different companies on them Apple pay
will not allow oh because of marketing
legal rights or something
so listen to the guy's voicemail later
he's gonna he's gonna educate I was
gonna break it down a little bit break
it down break break down all right here
we go just a little quick story Apple
always facing lawsuits here and there
when you products come out if for
whatever reason it just happens but this
one's kind of interesting and I wanted
to bring it up there's a
five-million-dollar class-action lawsuit
against apple over iOS 9 s Wi-Fi assist
feature causing it to use too much data
and potentially overcharging some
customers this comes out of i believe it
was a santa clara county or san jose
where it was filed but think about this
when iOS 9 came out Apple turn on this
feature called wife Isis what does it do
basically when your Wi-Fi doesn't have
the best signal it uses your cellular
data to make up kind of supplement that
and help out but then a lot some users
are saying well look now I have these
crazy data over charges because instead
of it just trying to go slower over
Wi-Fi that the cellular data that was
picking up the slack is helping me out
about this right yeah which is important
because guess what not all of us have
unlimited data yeah they've they're
pretty much most people don't have
unlimited data plans anymore yeah
totally so I'll tell you how to get to
this setting if you want to turn it down
you go into your settings and then you
go into the section called cellular and
then you'll have lunch options but you
have to scroll all the way down you got
to scroll all the way down down down
down down at the very bottom and there's
this icon that says Wi-Fi assist the
problem is Apple turned it on by default
so they never really explain it to
people they leave it on by default it's
up to you to turn it off if you want to
turn this off I think I'm I'm not going
to turn it off because i am a unbothered
unlimited data guy but yeah that's
that's a big pain in the butt it is I
think Apple never and this is one of
those things that guess what when I
think of the reason why they're putting
this class action lawsuit is that it's
not known for the general user apple and
explain it and yeah if I had to tell my
parents about this they would be like
what are you talking about well it's
funny because I see in this image on the
the post here says youtube kids yeah and
my son just watches like he'll just sit
there and watch me why your heels
better turn that will just run the data
up i'm sure it will it will so that's
the heads up it's the Wi-Fi assist
feature go to cellular in your settings
scroll the way down and you can turn off
if you'd like you can kind of monitor
monitor this by looking at your how much
data you actually consume but it's just
a heads up i think it's important for
people know about this cool okay
something that we thought was important
to know about but ended up being a total
bust nintendo right nintendo has been
holding out of bringing their properties
their games their licenses over to the
smartphone world nothing on android
nothing on iOS nothing anywhere well
nintendo this week announced their very
first smartphone game and it's called me
tomo me tomo me tomo now what is this
game they shouldn't even call it a game
it is literally like a social networking
app for your meez hmm so you could
create an avatar if you haven't already
it asks you a bunch of questions and
then it connects you with people and
with your friends at armies it's not a
game yo this is Nintendo's first-ever
entry into the smartphone market and
this is what they gave us it's a big big
mistake all they had to do was put Mario
like a like a new Lex was really like
about cheesy version of mario on the
phone and they would have sold a million
cut not even cheesy we've talked about
that they just had to put a five-dollar
version of the original Super Mario
Brothers on a smartphone and it would be
over but Zelda on there I would replay
Zelda it would be over instead we got me
tomo you know there is a big huge
community that connect that collects all
these like you care no no no I know but
I don't give a crap like but there yeah
to the general you know Nintendo
continues to lose its charm you know
lose what made it great they continue to
stay in their little walled garden they
continued look it's 2015 basically the
end of 2015 this game is coming out in
2016 so they basically have their very
first smartphone game in 2016 that is
crazy ho ho brah you should do a google
ish asst and talk about all the
emulators you could give you can't know
for like we don't care about you
nintendo we got our emulators we really
don't care you can release whatever you
want it doesn't matter yeah all right so
yeah nintendo that that that's a big
fail all right also another big fail
here critical acclaim tons of positive
reviews a great score overall for the
Steve Jobs movie but then the box office
totally different story this thing is
pretty much just flatlining huh it has
even it hasn't even hit a line dude
that's crazy so it looks so good it does
look it excited to see the funny thing
about is like it is good it is Oscar
buzz worthy just to give you perspective
of how this movie is performing it
debuted to a measly 7.3 million dollar
weakened are you that's when it came out
in full like a little release 7 million
7 million mouth they let me give you a
perspective of this which is really sad
to me that's only a little more than the
Ashton kuchar jobs movie that made 6.7
million oh wow and that was horrible
yeah like that is it was garbage why are
they keeping Steve Jobs movies wrong I
don't here's the thing i don't think
that they got this wrong I just think
for whatever reason people are
connecting to it the studios Sony
originally had it Sony let it go but
there's all these crazy email storms
about how Sony like was gonna do it and
they kind of like tap it on it Universal
ended up picking up the distribution
rights for this movie a universal
thought it would do well people were
guessing that it might have a 19 million
dollar opening weekend it got 7.3
Universal believes that the picture can
recover because it's had really good a
feedback and result in viewing in cities
like San Francisco New York but there I
mean 7.3 million that's enough that's
nothing that is nothing they also argue
that because Michael Fassbender isn't a
top tier 3 no audience grabber meaning
who are some of the people they were
first talking about their time I like to
Caprio to be in it yeah like I was
really talking for Lincoln the guy odd
what does Daniel day-lewis I was reading
about him boo that's good jobs it would
have been cool yeah so they also are
blaming maybe some star some lack of
star power although if I spend her
supposed to kill everyone that watches
this movie every movie critic said this
movie is amazing I guess I have to blame
myself because I said I
watch it but i still have been able to
see it yet yeah I've been wanting to see
it I meet you be able to make it so good
because our fault Oh be cool of you and
I went to the movie and just like put
like periscope tea and just in our
commentary we're like algae podcast from
the movie yeah he sucks oh my gosh can't
believe it came to this hm why are we
doing this why can we're gonna end the
podcast early guys and just leave so
anyways uh that's just a little whomp
whomp sad note on the Steve Jobs movie
status i'm kind of I'm kind of bummed
about the bday whatever they should have
casted you and me dude who played a
wozniak again uh Seth Rogen when I saw
that I was kind of like that's a
question that's a questionable they do
say he did a really good job I think
also there are some I think Apple in a
weird way is probably happy about it
they're the most oh yeah oh my god all
the Apple employees that were close to
Steve Jobs said it didn't do it justice
although not all of them saw it Wozniak
and John Sculley people that were part
of jobs jobs is you know I guess inner
circle but also saw him rise yeah they
said the movie was really entertaining
not exactly the most accurate but they
also did say that it captured the
essence of Steve Jobs yeah just which is
important yeah from day one the critics
were kind of like ah there's a lot of
push back right away yeah yeah so so
anyways there you go we've talked about
a way too much let's get to the phone
calls right do we got voice mails a big
one here only do we you know what we're
not gonna get calls next week cuz we
forgot to even tell people getting the
show call how horrible are we own number
we we have a sponsor but then we can't
get then we forgot about the phone calls
no one's gonna call the phone okay we
have a bunch though phone number is 801
806 162 638 yes okay that's gonna be
close okay what is the first voicemail
hi Brian hi rich it's mike from canada
great show etc I'm just wondering where
could I support my music artist the most
by you know using Spotify going offline
with their music or just buying from
itunes
you know will they get more from there
not sure but anyway so there's the
question Thanks right that's a great
question because we both here create
content you don't know what Beecham does
but I mean tell people what you do on
the side Steven yeah for for a long time
I've been producing music for at various
studios around the Bay Area and you know
the best way to support an artist is to
go see them live and by their by their
t-shirts and buy their CDs and stuff but
in terms of streaming or purchasing
music online i would have to say it's
probably itunes or from the artist
directly whatever they have on their
website Spotify pays very little to
artists I know like I have a bit
Albanese it spent literally penny it's
like under ten cents yeah it's like
percentage of a cent you know I mean
like I think on Spotify I get these we
put on an album a band i was in a long
time put our record and I get you know
like information about how many people
streamed it and from Spotify it's like
point zero zero one percent and for
itunes it's like a penny and a half or
something sometimes so um I would say
definitely purchasing it from the band
from their website wherever they want
you to buy it from and just go see him
live you know if you're a big fan yeah I
think that you know if you can even go
to their online I was my hunch well a my
I definitely was like yeah you got to go
to see them live because that's where
any artist actually makes their most
money yeah even the big name artist
that's where they make their money but
beyond that if you can buy their CD
directly from their website if they have
that that's gonna help give them money
even you know even more than I guess
we'll t-shirt is it a bit serious gotta
go you gotta go t-shirt yes so um yeah
go directly to the artist for sure
that's also i mean i'm i'm one of those
old-school guys like I'll I so bye bye i
buy stuff that I don't buy records I
just bought an LP the other day oh
really vinyl which one well it's one
that I mixed mixed in like a thousand
seven it just got released so i still i
buy everything I work on I try to buy it
I mean Stephen does a lot of genres you
you uh did I mean when you told me what
was that artist of on
yeah i did a von tulum record a lot of
nabob stuff we're for me i was with bad
boy records was there a fun bad boy bad
boy Petey where's Danny man you know I'm
doing this where did he had what does
didya city's a personal trainer was
there that day but not did he bummed out
alright next call ok hi my name is sarah
and brian i remember when the iphone 6s
originally came out you said that you
thought that the home button was on its
way out with being able to contact
theory by saying hi Siri without holding
the home button down but i was wondering
is how would touch ID work without the
home button thanks bye mansehra she's a
really good listener yes she calling me
out Sarah you are a smarty pants okay so
Sarah here's I'm kind of why I remember
when we talked about that topic there
are stories actually like legitimized
stories at apple and also the technology
exists where the actual touch screen
will be able to eventually but this is
years away when i say years i'm talking
about 34 years away where the screen
itself will actually have some of that
touch ID tech in the screen so not
anytime soon will we see it but you know
for example you could touch on part of
the screen it would be able to read your
fingerprint without actually having a
physical button I still like the
physical button but that's that's the
direction that reports have said Apple
and others will eventually be moving
towards down the road but again I don't
see the homes button going away within
the next three four years but I think it
might be soon after that honestly so
you're right I wasn't trying to state it
as fact but what people are working on
and going towards I personally like the
feeling of a home button though I don't
know about you definitely definitely
have to have I for me yeah I have a home
button I do like the feeling of it even
on the apple remote this new touchpad
remote it has a home button it has a
physical home button but it does have a
touchpad you know they could have done
something like you might even do a
gesture on the screen and it'll act as
the home button meaning if I swirled my
finger in a circle
and a detector that that could be the
new home button to I mean today take me
home haha Siri Siri home 30 pulling home
so you are right we did talk about that
but it's something that will possibly be
coming down the road in the future yeah
I know like since the 90s since I was
first interacting with the internet
there's always been a home button I mean
right here i'm looking at UH firefox and
there's a home button so God take me
home take me home okay next call hey
guys Blair in West Hollywood I was
recently happy to find out the best buy
added Apple pay and when you were
reading the top 10 list for Apple pay or
best buy and deeply amused to find out
that you cannot add the best buy credit
card to the Apple wallet even though the
bank is saying you can comma they said
that it's basically a licensing logo and
home by best buy for the credit card so
I hope you found that amusing as well
take care that's very interesting I I
think that all the credit card support
and the Apple paste of it's still not
it's just still not that easy per se
yeah I mean but he's right it should
work yeah I mean you think like they
would have every other but bases covered
when they're trying to launch this
massive thing but it seems like that's
been a flop to his Apple Apple pay yeah
I don't know i don't know if it's a
complete flop it is that people are i
mean i use it as honestly i think it's
just cuz i think it's fun i use it as
much as I can ha like even with the
coolest thing about Apple pay is to me
is it's purely on the phone there's
certain apps where mantri allows me to
buy food on my phone and then I just
used my fingerprint to authenticate the
sale right so instead of having to enter
in any of that credit card information
it just it's right in the app which is
which is probably the coolest thing so
um yeah it's not this whole mobile
payments game it's still not super
widespread in the US APPL probably has
the lead on that but it's still not that
big it's a still not you don't see
everyone a lot of times even sometimes
registers I went to a jack in the box
and it said it supported Apple pay
I pulled out my phone the scanner didn't
work they're like oh it doesn't work
right now but I my cuz is supported and
they're like yeah it does but I'm like
but it doesn't work like yeah it doesn't
so I'm like Africa right when you run
into those situations you just don't
want to use it anymore yeah you're like
go get your IT guy real quick and I'm
gonna wait here with my cheeseburger hey
Jack in the Box I t where you at fix
this thing I just want to use my Apple
pay and get out of here so uh yeah it's
not the easiest thing still yeah alright
well that's it that's all that's on the
call okay stick 34 excellent so
