episode 311 of the 359 podcast my name
is bebe G and your hosts today are
alfred Inge and Roger Chang what's up
guys hey am i hosting this - every
Monday nah I'll host a night all right
we're both hosting co-hosted yes sure
these group show up to a great start
yeah we're gonna be talking about our
iPhone 10 or iPhone X drop tests which
did not fare so well thanks across yeah
exactly give it to you we will talk
about Sprint t-mobile saying no thanks
to a merger that happened over the
weekend and falen will do some details
on Sprint's consolation prize it was
rather sad and then lastly we're just
gonna talk a little bit about our flick
at couple features that we that our
colleagues wrote Katie Collins on a nice
feature on how deliver Roo is making a
top restaurant or allowing top
restaurants to deliver food to you a lot
easier and our colleague Terry Collins
did a nice year review on how Trump
really changed everything in terms of a
political dialogue with Twitter what
this modern presidential yeah for better
or worse so we won't offer any judgments
their opinions to yourself
there you go if you have any questions
though or opinions please express them
Brian will pick out the best we do on
yours we will get to them in three
minutes to 59 seconds and here we go for
the recording of the podcast see back in
the chat in three two welcome to the 359
I'm dr. Chang I'm Alfred hang well that
didn't last long the iPhone 10 endured
our drop test and actually cracked on
the very first drop yeah that is not
good news the the rear is a rear glass
shattered had bits of crack and had
cracks in it and we dropped a couple
times after that it just and that was
pretty much again this is the rear glass
not the display but still think about
how often you drop your phone and like
imagine I cracked every time you dropped
it it would not survive three months
like it would be pretty much dead yeah
and I think it's it's a much larger
issue when the phone itself is like a
thousand
dollars yes situation where I don't
think anyone would want to take their I
feel like they're gonna have it like on
a chain I was like a chain wallet thing
like it can't drop and remind me how
much is a cost for to actually repair
the glass about $280 110 dollars more
than the iPhone 8 repair so a little bit
of a PSA if you are getting an iPhone 10
please cover it up because it is prone
to breaking and just to be clear Vanessa
who dropped the phone she dropped it at
a height of 3 feet so that's basically
you know pocket height and so yeah she
didn't even Hodges didn't even drop it
on like spikes or anything that was like
a normal job that seems like a drop that
anybody could do by accident yep and you
can sort of see in the video now there's
that little crack on the corner and yeah
and she cracked she dropped it a couple
times it got worse fortunately you know
it seemed like the display was okay so
the phone still works but you know it's
it's a thousand-dollar phone you you
want to keep that pre pristine it's just
disappointing that it was the first
attempt I know
usually we kind of like take this to the
rigor on it exactly an Apple actually
boasted about how you know this is
supposed to be the strongest glass ever
they work with Corning their glass
supplier to make you know a phone that
would that would directly hold up to
this kind of abuse but no all right next
up we want to talk about t-mobile and
Sprint over the weekend they both
confirmed that they would no longer be
merging that there were tons of talks
and rumors about the to gain together
really I had heard from several sources
that you know this was supposed to be a
done deal
turns out it's not they're going their
separate ways
and Sprint offered a bit of a
consolation prize on Sunday announcing
that they've struck a wireless retailer
deal with cable provider
Altice if you happen to be in that
region we're actually in the lt''s
territory or at least I am out of Long
Island you can you can get Sprint
service there so what were the pros and
cons of merging and why did you know the
cons kind of outweigh it for Sprint or
t-mobile alright for Sprint t-mobile
that you know allow folks on Wall Street
projected that this company would save
about 50 billion dollars if they got
together share their resources into
investing in their networks now
the pauses for consumers for you know
merging would have been that
theoretically these two could have
created a really kick-ass Network with
all their combined spectrum assets they
would have had really great coverage
that would have been comparable to 18 t
and verizon downside is while those who
are integrating well you're down three
players it's a lot less competitive
prices theoretically could have gone up
so there's some pros and cons there but
there are a lot of reasons to be if
you're a consumer to be happy that these
two were to go in their own way but what
were what were the contant like I guess
why did they back out at the last minute
this was supposed to go through so they
backed out ultimately because at least
reportedly Softbank wasn't happy with
the way the deal was structured because
they would become the minority owner
they owned Sprint and Softbank as
background as a Japanese carrier who
bought a majority stake in Sprint under
the combined combination Deutsche
Telekom which is t-mobile's parent would
have been the majority shareholder or
south bank would be the minority they
didn't want to lose that control and so
they decided to part ways
all right lastly we just want to give a
shout out to two stories
Katie Collins with a nice piece on how
deliver Roo which is sort of like the
seamless of the UK basically are setting
up these little portable these little
kitchens local kitchens around a London
to allows top restaurants to extend
their delivery range actually allow for
delivery and to extend the range so you
can get sort of you know high quality
meals delivered to you as opposed to
like weighing for and fighting for
reservations and lastly Terry Collins
with a nice review of Donald Trump and
how he's basically redefined politics
with his thumbs and through Twitter so
both great pieces I'd highly recommend
checking them out that's that's all the
time we've got form other stories check
us out on CNN I'm Robert Chang I'm
Alfred Aang thanks for listening all
right everybody thanks for joining us
for the recording of the podcast I'm
gonna go ahead and start delving through
your comments and questions and bring up
some more chatter for us to to go on and
on about here on the show until then
what do you guys want to fill with let's
drop some iPhone tens yeah just to be
clear we don't actually have any iPhone
tens in this room right now to drop yes
a please don't come knocking on our door
come at it else
yeah these three individuals here did
not do that we as in CNET broke the
iPhone 10 already yes and we broke it in
in record time so look that's that's the
risk you're gonna run we you've got both
a glass front and back right that's the
glass is gonna be fairly more fragile
the front didn't crack as easily as the
back did I wonder if it's just because
of the placement of the device or if
it's actually the front screen is
stronger than when back when I first
read the story I had thought that it was
like a targeted drop like she aimed for
like 100 just straight like flat drop
when I watch the video yeah I don't know
I feel like it's like a big waste of a
thousand dollars but it is a great
device well it's highly rated by our
colleague Scott Stein but yeah you just
this is sort of a reminder that you
should be mindful of the phone make sure
you have got a nice cover a decent cover
like is a bit of protection because
you're gonna need it I love that Apple
like also recommended like you should
probably we quote this is their direct
quote by the way we suggest using one of
the many beautiful cases available to
protect iPhone well I mean to their
credit there are many many cases
available for this phone yeah and I feel
like that's like a standard now for
anybody that has a smart phone but
you're gonna have a case with it yeah
paper thin mine is too mine was more for
a grip thing though because like the
iPhone on it sounds like super slippery
right and even with the clasp back yes
and help yeah but I I do hope one day
that there's you know just a phone where
you don't need to put on a case at all
that's never gonna happen an
indestructible phone no just one that
you don't need a case for like you could
probably drop it like the same amount of
times in a wouldn't crack yeah I mean
that's that's gonna be that's we're a
long way off of that yeah everybody's
already mad at us for not putting in a
case like that's that's the point guys
that's why we have a drug that's why we
did it you vote for you
readers man you should have had a case
but yes when I when I have my iPhone 10
I will put a nice case on it or at least
are you getting one I am getting one man
when are you getting yours why weren't
you in line not for a while cuz I've
been one away in line or wake up for
pre-orders Danny Green says he's seen
several drop tests in the
was the only one where actually did
break that quick I did anyone else look
at any of the other drops of course
everybody and their brothers doing well
yeah I know I saw that video from Mao's
the the phone case maker young they like
snuck in guy my phone 10 with like
they're in the media rush and then they
put a case on their phone that
apparently they just kept throwing up
not even during the media rush to buy a
phone to pray like there apparently
that's cool that's a really cool thing
for your company to do good job guys
they were laughing about it yeah that's
a video the rebels rebels man that's
really cool and ethical too you know
these streets Grover people that waited
in line for days another video then
challenged people to try to break their
phone yeah
what a great thing for people to do
right now moving your questions
sure let's start out with Michael Brown
he's got an easy one what price do we
think the iPhone X iPhone 10 sorry
I'm never gonna break that habit that's
fine apologies everybody it's just
ingrained we should just sounds give up
and say I thought I'm sorry it just
sounds cooler anyways what price you
think the iPhone 10 should have been oh
you know that's a bad question for me
because I'm cheap as hell you know three
dollars two hundred no I mean I well now
we do work for CBS and and our parent
company does on The Price is Right so
whatever I put $1 I would say I mean if
you just sort of look at the truthfully
speaking I don't know if there should be
an iPhone 8 an A+ and an iPhone 10 right
if they were really kind of sticking
their conventions it should have been
iPhone 8 and iPhone 10 and sure drop out
the A+ and by that logic I would have
been happier if had been closer to 750
800 what's the average yea which seems
like you know that's kind of in the
range of the no date that's kind of in
the range of that that that premium
flagship plus price range but you know
they decided to there was a break new
barriers when it comes to price there's
that we decided to break their back
that's right there's a youtuber Scotty
Allen who like he went to Shenzhen China
and bought the parts and oh yeah
constructed himself yeah yeah he there
was like $300 in parts but I was like
the 6s
not sure how much it would get I mean
this one would be more expensive again
getting the display from Samsung getting
the facial recognition cameras that's
gonna add some cause to it but Apple
famously likes to keep its margins very
high yeah so higher than anyone in this
tree by far and so in order to do that
they got a jack up the price make sure
they're making that money my theory is
that it should always be 75% of the like
cost to make it yeah that's also why I'm
not rich
yes why you're working here ouch I can
even cheap for the people why the
journalists and not you know an
entrepreneur my money I mean I'm an
advocate for the people cheap wads like
me all right all right back into the
chat for some more questions more about
pricing Philadelphia awesome name do you
think the iPhone 10 will be the same
price next year as the eight is this
year how far do we think that is Rob
yeah I don't that's a great question I
don't think it's if it does drop it will
not I would originally I would get like
a $50 disc no no it'll drop $100 like
they usually don't not that much they
drop $100 like the iPhone eight seven
drop $200 this year it'll do the same
yeah my girlfriend was considering
waiting for Black Friday to get the
iPhone 10 for a discount like yeah
you're just gonna have a longer wait so
yeah all right
Mac oh five or so Mac 55 yeah Mac 55
sorry I heard what happened
too bad please can I have the Ramones of
the remains of the phone please
so here's a question let's let's talk
about functioning with a busted device
yeah I've never cracked the phone I can
change that I've cracked Android screens
but not at my iPhone but how long would
you two like soldier on without trying
to get some kind of well I think it'll
depend on where you crack the phone the
phone the back it's just like a facial
is that it correct on the on the screen
like you can still use it but there's
just cracks on the screen yeah if
they're cracks on the screen I don't
know how long I would last I know
there's people that do
like like they changed our wallpaper
said like somebody punching like the
screen so like links so at least feels
like it's intentional yeah I can't I
can't do that I'm like incredibly vain
about I would say it depends on how far
away I am from like paying off my phone
I guess if I'm if I'm like a year or if
like I just bought my phone yep then I'm
probably gonna need to replace it but if
I'm like two months away from my phone
being paid off and like going through
the whole upgrade program again I would
probably just wait it out yeah all right
some more from the chat let's talk about
the screen a little bit more Matthew -
or the - in the chat
I'm sure the iPhone 10 uses Gorilla
Glass which version are they using well
if it's girl a class 5 but Apple kept
hinting at the fact that they were
working with Corning to make their
version better or stronger this was like
the way they kind of worded that worded
the comments during the presentation but
I think it's just Gorilla Glass 5 Cooper
glass throw the glass 5 is very strong I
mean it's you know it's tough but
obviously as evidenced by a drop test
it's not strong enough all right so more
on the screen Danny Green says I notice
a post here before logging in about a
screen issue on the iPhone 10 if you
guys seen that story yeah oh yeah the
burnin is echoed by Eric in the chat as
well yeah look the iPhone 10 uses an
OLED display just like just like the
pixel just like Samsung Apple a said
that they've worked with again they made
these comments while working with the
supplier working on developing a kind of
version of OLED that is less prone to
burnin but they warned that burnin is
still an issue it's still a potential
risk I don't think I've seen any actual
reports of it I haven't I'm not like not
like the pixel to Excel which obviously
tons of burnin issues
exactly James Cook why is t-mobile
charging for down payments upfront and
no one else is for new for the new
iPhone I think a lot of it probably
depending upon your credit if your
credit isn't you know premium or prime I
think you do have to pay a bit more I
don't know if you know it might come
down to sort of the differences in the
terms that each carrier offer but if
you're making a down payment
for a phone for t-mobile chances are if
you go to Verizon HTT they'll probably
ask for the same thing yeah most
providers are probably gonna let you pay
off this monthly right they're not gonna
ask for $1,000 like straight up uh yeah
exactly
you going on a monthly fee but again if
you have poor credit they'll often ask
you to pay more upfront yeah couple
hundred bucks here there James H one
thing that concerns me is how I turn on
the iPhone ten the screen at least so
how do I turn on the screen without
pushing an actual button because of my
disability James if you don't mind me
asking could you let us know what that
disability is so we could try to
evaluate further in the meantime Michael
Brown has another great question
does anyone think Apple does spend more
or less than competitors in R&amp;amp;D and
marketing and they definitely spend a
comparable amount on R&amp;amp;D and marketing I
would say that they make most of their
profits up by jacking up the prices
aren't there aren't there competitors
there are Indian marketing Oh actually
yes no there they do use high-tech
components from their suppliers for sure
I would also say they also they force
the carriers to shoulder some of the
marketing burden so they have to spend
as much there you know because if you
see 18t and verizon sponsored Apple ads
all the time right so in that respect
they they extend their marketing reach
by having the carrier's tell their story
for them all right we are getting down
to the last bit of time here but let's
knock out a couple more questions
Subash asks is the face ID on iphone 10
really a revolutionary step towards a
mobile security is Apple going to going
on the right track in ditching the touch
ID I would say so yeah I don't know if
it's revolutionary because it uses some
of the same tech that's been around on
Microsoft devices yeah my I think it's
revolutionary for them that's like just
for Apple you know all these banks and
mobile payments that are going to be
using it like switching to that as
opposed to touch ID it's gonna be much
like consider you know going up to an
ATM and then not having to put your card
in and like if your phone is like within
the vicinity and it's like yeah it links
with the ATM
yeah something like that and just like
look at it and I'll be able to recognize
that that's not gonna happen for like a
couple of years but right you have to
kind of like it's all gonna start from
something like this Microsoft Android
you know all these other companies that
do have facial recognition it's gonna be
a little bit harder for them because
they don't have the infrared security
kind of standard that face ID does well
Microsoft does I think there are Windows
hello
okay it works very similar ok uses it
Freddie uses a facial mapping it's I
don't know if if that's accurate
yeah there's no mobile security goes for
I it's definitely up there in terms of
security for sure you know Samsung has a
facial ID system that's their bins like
exactly I've yet to see a situation
where the face ID has been spoofed but
yeah that's a fairly new it's only been
like four days yes but I think we've
seen a lot of use we see a lot of people
try to fool it and with different tricks
and it's done a pretty good job yeah I
don't like and and you know as far as it
definitely helps of getting with
changing the form factor on phones where
you don't need like the touch ID or like
fingerprint scan or on the front anymore
I'd like to get more space there yeah I
mean I still I'm still holding I hope
that one day they figure out how to do
fingerprint sensor underneath the
display but we'll see cuz I finger
princess yeah same here
so James has clarified for us he has bad
hand movement you can still use finger
movements but not very well thank you to
Michael Brown for actually jumping in
and saying you know double tapping the
screen will turn it on as well I was
looking up the phone to 90-degree angles
so expanding on that eric has been
asking how does facial net recognition
work from multiple angles like if the
phone is on the table you want unlock it
right you have to pick it up so we
actually saw saw that where it does have
to be somewhat perpendicular to your
face apparently yes re parallel lift it
too far it wasn't fully parallel like it
wasn't flying the table you can do quite
he couldn't quite look at it from the
table and unlock it but he had to lift
it a little bit slightly to get it
unlocked so it it kinda works I imagine
just like touch ID this is gonna get
better it's gonna get more refined like
they'll be not sure if there's a way to
just look at it and go straight to the
home screen yet which I would like
because I think that would that would
remove one step and make these a lot
faster but it's gonna get better touch
ID got way better over the years and
facia face ID will do the same
so we got time for just about two more
and this isn't this one's really good I
that we should think about this do you
expect Apple to use the iPhone 10 to add
a luxury or high-end tier for phones in
the future like MacBook vs MacBook Pro
do we think this is gonna initiate more
luxury life in order to connect on it
like the MacBook Pro when we think it's
gonna expand you think they're gonna
like like a X like a x2 or something and
then like a no I think generally
speaking across any and all Apple
branded products do we think this is
kind of opening a Pandora's box I mean I
think it's already an open I think the
MacBook Pro with the touch bar was an
example of a luxury item with innovation
that you can only get if you pay up yeah
right you know we might see this a look
across the line with iMac with the
products the iPad pro I've had probe
they'll be some sort of iPad pro X the
super watch the Apple watch well there
was order yet there was have a super
luxury I thought well Apple watch sorry
I thought Apple watch but it didn't sell
that well yeah they do have one now
that's like a couple thousand stuff like
the ridiculous price what was how much
was that like fifteen thousand yeah it
was ridiculous I loved all the articles
but here's all the stuff you could buy
instead of this watch right which is
like a car so my prediction for the
future is ultimately they're going to do
away with all of their actual hardware
lines there will be no more laptops or
be no more tablets no more phones number
watches they're just going to develop a
surgical implant called the eye eye
power of a Mac Pro in your eyeball that
does all the functions of the watch your
steps your phone calls and you just you
just tap your eye and it's already you
just see a crack all the time now oh my
god wearable life we've imagined yeah
that would be terrible
all right one more question before we
call today we're going back on a Sprint
t-mobile Preston says I just called
sprint to get the new plan change from
switching from t-mobile
two years ago Sprint has no backup for
these customers as switched two years
ago what do you think about that has no
was alright what back a plan for
actually making the switch for previous
customers
till I get them back sounds like it yeah
well it's pretty yeah sprinters stuff we
struggle with that they're there
customer service I know they've got a
lot of aggressive plans out there you
guys know that if you go on if you go
title if you go online you could sign up
and if you're if you're a customer
switching from another service you can
switch in for free for three years worth
of service you gotta bring your own
phone but it is a full year free service
and then will start charging you after
that a thirteen month so they're trying
to get people back in but I've heard
there are complaints in terms of
customer service being able to kind of
support this stuff partly because they
intended that program to be online only
so that when you try to get our phone
with someone it doesn't really work so
well so yeah I know I know that's
they're working on it but it's tough
you're struggling I think they've all
been a little distracted trying to get
this deal done with t-mobile now that
it's now that it's off the table they
can focus just have been called t-mobile
if they combined or would it have been
like a new name no brain no one knows I
think that it would have been it could
have been something I mean I think it
wouldn't more t-mobile dominant we knew
that whatever happened the combined
company would have run would have been
run by John ledger and his team so the
Sprint team would have been out sprint
mobile baby mobile baby
hashtag sprint mobile baby and that's
the right way
Roger want to take us home yeah if you
liked eight that you saw or heard here
check this out see net our podcast is
also available on iTunes student
