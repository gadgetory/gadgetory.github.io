thrive tablet that hasn't already been
said about every other tablet out there
hi I'm Eric Franklin's senior editor at
cnet and the answer to that question is
well quite a few things actually the
Thrive runs on honeycomb 3.1 like nearly
every other new tablet it has a
front-facing 2-megapixel camera and a
5-megapixel back facing camera for
pictures and video it's 10.1 inch screen
provides a 1280 x 800 resolution and
it's why bezel makes it look kind of
like a larger version of the tmobile g
slate when picking it up the first thing
we notice is the groovy textured back
side which feels really nice and grippy
so Sheba also allows you to swap out the
back panel and choose from seven
different colors at twenty dollars each
to replace it taking off the panel which
is a bit difficult to remove also
reveals the swappable battery the second
thing we notice about it's physicality
it's just how girthy it is as it
actually measures out to nearly three
times the thickness of the Samsung
Galaxy Tab 10.1 and feels noticeably
heavier toshiba doesn't waste the extra
real estate however as a thrive features
a number of ports including full USB
full HDMI a mini USB port and an SD card
slot you'll also find a headphone jack a
rotation lock volume rocker power button
and a lock for the removable back panel
as well an interesting decision was to
include 3 status LED lights on the bezel
for power battery charge and wireless we
can see this being somewhat distracting
depending on what you're using the
tablet for at a time as for software the
throttles useful and unique feature is a
file manager which provides native
direct access to the file system
allowing you to easily launch files from
the hard drive SD card or USB thumb
drive as for the pricing the Thrive
starts at four hundred and twenty nine
dollars for the
a gigabyte version 479 for the 16
gigabyte and 579 dollars from the 32
gigabyte model be sure to check out the
full review of the toshiba thrive with
much more detailed impressions once
again i'm eric franklin and this has
been the first look at the toshiba
thrive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
