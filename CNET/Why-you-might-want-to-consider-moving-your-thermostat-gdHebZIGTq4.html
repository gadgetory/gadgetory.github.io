temperature you're doing it all wrong
lots of thermostats are placed in rooms
that are tucked away or near temperature
extremes and putting your thermostat in
the wrong place can give you a false
read of what the temperature of your
house actually is for instance a
thermostat mirror front door or garage
would be cooler than the real
temperature because of the draft and a
thermostat placed in or near a kitchen
will always be warmer when you're
cooking same goes for exterior walls
walls with the outdoors on the opposite
side will always be cooler than the
other interior walls of your home if
your thermostat is in one of these
places you might want to move it doing
so will save you money and it'll make
sure your home hits the temperature you
want
so put your thermostat in the room you
spend the most time in and put it on an
interior wall for the most accurate
reading and if you have a smart
thermostat like the nez to be sure it's
clear of any bookshelves or decorations
so that it can maintain a strong Wi-Fi
signal multiple thermostats placed
throughout your home will give you the
most accurate temperature but if you're
not quite ready to make that leap
just one well-placed device will make
your system much more efficient and now
you're doing it right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
