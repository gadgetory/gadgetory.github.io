tried to tempt us of his last couple of
phones by offering decent looking
Android phones at lower prices and his
latest model the Swift 2 and Swift 2
plus is no exception
crucially wily phox has done away with
the paper feel of the last model and
it's replaced it with an all-metal
design which certainly makes it feel
like a much more premium device when
you're grabbing it on the front of the
phone is a 5-inch display now this does
only have a 720p resolution which is
definitely on the lower side and in fact
looking close up you can see individual
pixels but this does come with a lower
price the Swift 2 starts as 159 pounds
here in the UK I'm a swift 2 plus which
has a higher resolution 16 megapixel
camera will start at 189 pounds you get
some decent features beyond that as well
for the lower price you get USB C
charging there's a fingerprint sensor on
the back of the phone and an 8 megapixel
camera on the front the Swift 2
certainly isn't the highest end phone
around but it does come with a much more
competitive price but ms though you can
get some great phones with that price
now including phones like the motorola
moto G 4 also it's not too easy to get
hold of wily phox has yet to partner
with any other UK networks so you can
only get it if you go directly to their
company and buy the phone outright we'd
definitely like to see more carriers get
onboard still if you're after a bargain
price Android phone then the Swift 2
might be the phone to look out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
