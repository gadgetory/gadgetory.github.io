sony's new LCD TVs for 2017 the 65 inch
is the x9 30 eseries and the 75 inch
here a little bit bigger is the x9 40 e
series the sets have very similar
specifications the smaller one uses an
edge lit local dimming format while the
larger one uses full array local dimming
usually philaret goes a little better
picture quality even our test last year
the predecessor to the smaller TV was an
excellent performer too new for this
year Sony's added Dolby vision which is
one of two major HDR formats you can now
get even more HDR content onto these
televisions the sets also include the
Tri luminous color for improved color
according to Sony and in terms of
picture all these sets include Dolby
vision which is one of the two major HDR
formats that allows it to play back a
lot of the content out there from
Netflix and Amazon and the highest
picture quality available they'll also
work with upcoming 4k blu-ray players
that have Dolby vision desks and course
work with standard HDR 10 HDR
compatibility so sony says it has
improved image quality sets over last
year increasing the brightness and also
making the black level a little bit
better we'll check that out we get them
into the lab beyond picture quality sets
include compatibility with Google home
this year which means you can actually
talk into that whole home speaker and
have the TV do things like turn on and
even find things on Netflix these sets
are also powered by Sony's Android TV
operating system so you get all the apps
that are found and even more than most
competing TVs like LG and Samsung all
told you probably need to connect an
external box to watch all those apps on
the set just having the TV connect the
Internet should be good enough so needed
announce pricing on the X 9:30 or X 940
we expect to get that soon in the
meantime check out seeing it for updates</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
