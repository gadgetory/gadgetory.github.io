Cricut explore but first Cricut spell
like this it's not supposed to be bad
English it's supposed to be cool and
secondly this one here is not a printer
Oh sir si is a printer that doesn't
print instead it cuts draw and score
well if you can cut and draw at the same
time with this one does
of course you score and this one is
score big expecially with the ladies
for example you can make a thank-you
note for your mom just like this of
course you can write her a letter or you
can say thank you to your mom directly
but when you have it cut out like this
see now you're sincere and of course you
can make a lot of things with this
machine right here but let's find out
how it works first this is the mat or
the gripping man gripping because the
surface here is sticky its sticky so
that he can put material and it'll move
when you do the job well the cut is done
you can peel the material off just like
this and now you have your art project
let me show you right here so right here
is your thank-you note and then if to
clean up the surface of the mat he'll
gain for the next job and for the
cleaning here our intern Lauren thank
you now the machine can cut a lot
different types of materials from these
preset right here to another 15 type in
custom setting basically and cut almost
anything that's not thicker than 2
millimeter now over here we have us two
slot one for the plate we started
cutting this is a standard play that
come with the machine if you want to cut
something very tough such as aluminum it
would need a type of plate that costs
extra the second slot is for in drawing
pan included here or a scoring pan which
cost another five dollars the machine
can work with two tool at the same time
just like that and by the way the
machine have this pen holder right here
and over here underneath the tray there
is a compartment for the tool like this
one for example very cool now let's make
something else first we need the design
you can either make the design yourself
or chew from a vast option
filed by the Cricut design space most of
these projects here are free other cost
from night I sent to a few dollars all
right let's find something meaningful
and quick to make here ok here we go
how about this let's make love what it's
better than war now as you can see this
one require the iron-on material which I
have here so let's load it up now
depending on how big the project is or
how complicated it is
this might take a few hours or a few
minute to be done now this particular
project here going to take to the fewer
minute with some project you need to use
multiple type materials you can even a
sample different parts into a 3d project
and for that reason I call this machine
here some sort of a 2.5 D printer
the thing that is slightly less than a
full 3d printer that is and voila love
is done being made just iron it on your
t-shirt or Eugene wherever you want so
as you can see this is very cool and fun
machine to you for those who want to get
into crafts and arts it's not so
expensive either costing just 250
dollars in the US on some 250 pounds in
the UK there are a few things you to
know though first this one here works
off the internet completely the Cricut
design space software is entirely
web-based and you have to have an
account and login before you can use it
and that means a few things number one
is machine here is completely useless
without the internet number two the
vendor of the machine can potentially
know everything you make with the
machine so don't make anything too crazy
and note that even when that's internet
you need to connect the computer to the
machine before you can lock in the
account and that means you cannot go to
your library and make your project
before you bring it home to print and by
the way the machine here connects to the
computer using a USB cable or a
Bluetooth adapter with the slot over
here the adapter is not included and
cost another fifty dollars and for more
than machine here check out my full
review and cnet.com you know it's a
great fun machine for those who are into
arts and crafts I just want to make
somebody like your mom or your
girlfriend extra happy is overkill for
me though because I have made many
people happy which is my bare hands as I
because I'm down low and this has been
the first look at the Cricut explore you
can take this I have lots</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
