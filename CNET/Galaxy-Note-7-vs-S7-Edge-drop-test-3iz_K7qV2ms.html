the phone maybe alright three two one
the s7 edge has one of the best screens
we've seen in a phone but the ample real
estate and sexy curves mean it's also
one of the most fragile in comes the
note seven same dimensions and curved
AMOLED screen but with what's perhaps a
sturdier glass it's the first phone
sporting Corning's Gorilla Glass 5 so
does this make it a sturdier phone
that's why we're here so you want to do
the eyes I'll go for it I'm going at
about two feet okay here we go
Oh three two one
okay it has chalk all over it my
beautiful bull's eye would it totally
survive hey here it is two feet my knees
yeah my knee high just about okay one
bull's eye - whoa that sounded so bad oh
we got a winner we got a winner
next up we're dropping it from pocket
height here we go three two oh and it
landed screen up so we know it survives
yes alright little little note seven
let's do this pocket height a little bit
higher higher yep there yeah three two
one oh it also landed face first Oh face
arson that I flipped over
belly up 1.6 meters is what Corning says
that Gorilla Glass 5 can withstand when
it's not altered so that's why we're
going to this height not because we take
selfies but ok here we go
you should take a selfie all right three
two
you won Wow good little guy
Wow Wow Wow
nothing no not nothing this is more
nerve-wracking for me than the phone
maybe all right three two one
perfect landing okay moment of truth
moment of truth oh oh look at this it's
very dramatic it's got chalk all over it
but it's still rolling still perfectly
fine now that we know it Kim survived
face-first both phones it's time to test
the edge so we're going to go pocket
height which is probably the most common
place gets dropped on the edge in three
two one
Oh didn't land on the edge not really
but should we do it again yeah maybe do
it like oh I like it how we're gonna
drop my head so we're going to test out
the note seven from pocket level on the
side three two one
oh we're gonna do Southie level one
point six meters from the side all right
so three two one moment of truth all
right
is there a crack on the back no it's
still good it's so going no leave you're
right there is a crowd there's a crack
so it did break but just a little bit in
the corner and in the back so we're
gonna keep going and I'm going to drop
it with a crack facing up three two one
whoa still good good it well let's do
the back the back oh oh the back is Oh
spider webs everywhere take a look at
that oh poor baby
so after multiple drops in different
angles the back of this is completely
destroyed but the front is intact it's
perfect
which is what you really care about yeah
unlike this phone where the front is
destroyed but the back is perfect so if
I had a choice no seven note seven baby
one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
