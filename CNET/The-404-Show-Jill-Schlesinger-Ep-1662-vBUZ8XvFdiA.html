happened last evening it was a midday
interview for sure you got that I got it
now you know where you stand right in
the totem pole question is which now my
organs let me say this about that it
broadcasts a situation it's a broadcast
attrition here's the problem I I love
doing this you know this is like among
many of my favorite thing this is like a
therapeutic rite of passage no it's just
it's just fun and I love hanging out
with you guys my thing and but then you
had work sure this is fun right yeah
that's work sometimes work just gets in
the way of fun horrible sort but now
also remember the beginning of the year
the stock market was in freefall so it
was very busy hmm then it got better
yeah and then I started doing some other
stuff are you busy when it's doing well
no really no no one ever gives a crap
yeah no one wants to know why it's doing
well everyone's like oh yeah it's doing
what like I am in the sweet spot right
now we're not working that hard sure
because all the idiots are doing is
talking about politics right and so I
mean I did like a couple of segments
like oh let's talk about Bernie Sanders
and Trump's trade policies were
ridiculous we'll talk about that
separately okay odd but I'm really in
this great place where I'm not killing
myself yeah but I have been doing tons
of fun things like what well I reached
the pinnacle of my career Wow and it is
not this show it's close but it got high
with other knock check this out I was
hopin wait a second wait when I tell you
this I went to London okay i interviewed
Dame Julie Andrews
whoa whoa in front of a live audience
like 500 people what I wouldn't have to
put that picture up on the on-site 404
websites crazy me my sister and Julie
Andrews it was beyond I literally got
done with the interview and I was like
oh my god I thought to myself this is it
like it's all downhill from here just
ever it would be like you being like you
know what I hung out with Martin Brodeur
like first weekend yeah pretty much yeah
had sleepovers talking about Oh
everything on by exactly yeah you know
I'm just saying that it was like I'm a
huge Broadway show and of course I live

like you know well we have a lot in
common you know you you started the role
of Eliza Doolittle on Broadway in my
fair lady and I played Doolittle in the
camp point of pines version own was
awesome 65 minutes it went by like in
two seconds yeah that's great it was
beyond it was so awesome so what was it
sir what was it centered around uh well
there was this financial company that
wanted to do something just like this
totally boondoggle nice shirt which is
like let's take our very best people ok

julie andrews for an interview and i
know some people at the company that are
high up and they're like let's get Jill

they're like we we know it's not a
financial interview we don't know if
you'd be into it it's julie andrews and

to do it yeah otherwise how do I get
there yeah it was so she was
unbelievable she was so gracious by the
way forever I'm listening if you don't
know who julie andrews is i'm very sorry
because I figure that now i just
realized that a 22 year old boy might
not know that but remember Mary Poppins

there they act right and at it you know

81 she yeah I can talk to friends of
mine and we all lose our trains applause

story
from 50 years ago anything like how you
just get you just hit the genetic
lottery right is that hides I think so I
do because honestly it she was so um

think that it's really pretty impressive
man she was terrific and you know sorry
so let me just give you a little inside
your kind of fan Girling out here a
little bit beyond I love it beyond I
mean you again I'm such a huge Broadway
show fiend that you know sure her career
is both obviously theatre and film sure
okay and I went into like such theatre
geekdom that in the middle of my
interview I turn to the audience and I'm
like hang on for five minutes will I
become a theater geek and I turned back
and ice like asked like this esoteric
question like how do you feel like
what's the difference between singing a
rodgers and hammerstein score and ass on
x quarter and she went like dealt like
deep dive in Tucson time I'm a huge
Sondheim fan we come back and then we

whole thing an engaged it was amazing
and then she said well you know she says
my favorites on time show is sweeney
todd and i said i don't mind his company
and then she was but you know what and
she's like literally talking to me yeah
and she says uh huh you know my favorite
song like the song that I hear either if
I sing it or hear anyone else sang it
and it brings tears to my eyes and I
literally interrupt her and I said is
the last song and the first act and
Sunday in the park with George and she
goes yes exactly and high-fives meeting
in the middle of the interview you must
have been floating when I picture Julie
Andrews a Jew now picture high fives
yeah I not a thing that I was
high-fiving that's amazing is this
available to wow private event may an
audio no I gotta release the transcripts
of this ride I was like and so we
finished the thing and she turned her
manager was like so protective and
intense sure i don't i don't know like
we don't know yours don't know Hollywood
territory Andrews exactly Big Shot right
and she's turned soon we come off the
stage you should cuz what happens now
we're going to go into the dressing room
you get a bite and then you got to take
200 pictures attendees okay and he's
turned Zeke isn't Jill and her sister
the first photos because they gotta
catch a plane right she takes me by the
arm we're walking out and she says why
don't you come to the dressing room and
have some tea with us oh ok yeah I guess
so no problem like 20 minutes I hang out
with you know what was so great about it
she says to me so how did you get into
this financial stuff yeah and start
asking me questions about myself yeah
that's you did you dream this it's
beyond unbelievable that's I'm so happy
that you got to do this it's so it's so
great that is very very I'm still on my
Julie Andrews side so my sister so by
the way you know I'm negotiating with
these guys for money to you know do this
whole deal and I'm they you know they're
at the low end of my range alike luck
give me an extra ticket and I brought my
sister was right yeah which was also
phenomenal you have a brother or sister
my brother never brother and you have a
brother well sisters I don't know we
just like we're very close sir she is as
into anything Broadway musical as I am
right when I called her up and said
you're coming with me to London she was
shrieking and we realized we had not
been away alone together in 30 years
that makes sense yeah you know life for
Amelie bounces we the best time great oh
that's great oh that's so rad it's a
maser it's totally amazing so that was
great that's it it's all downhill
probably yeah I tell me before you knew
it yeah exactly I'm done uh the other
thing that I did this week which was fun
was I moderated a panel an LGBT panel at
deutsche bank and i got to interview the
only out royalty in the world oh really
and this guy is the crown prince of
india so it's a gay prince it's a gay
pride Wow and he was so lovely and I
gotten he was being honored at the UN
for this thing that he had done so i
went to the UN for the first time ever
I'm like a Niley royalty in the world
that's out that's a
Yeah right Dodd I'd say no it is so not
on my panel was this huge private equity
guy named Paul singer who is like a
gazillion area okay then it was a guy
who's ahead of the export-import bank
and the crown prince mm-hmm so I turned
to these guys were about to go on the
stage I said you know I've always
wondered what happens when three Jews
and a gay Prince walk into a German bank
again we're about to find out and you're
even wrote that for you no I wrote it
myself a thread very funny I've just
been doing a lot you know so I do work
stuff but as your stuff outside been fun
that's all I'm on that's what and you
know what's like different do you
remember when you interview Danny DeVito
the first time it was just like such a
tie and a kick it was there's a lot
going on there yeah and it's the this
moment where you're trying to be
professional remember what you're doing
and then after you reflect and like oh
my god I just all right Danny DeVito is
on my show that cool is that it's a lot
of planning that never uh shows its face
right it's planning for nothing oh yeah
I just like when it's time you're just
there miles per hour and it's got to
happen and it happens and it goes by
quick and that's it you know though I
was so happy to have prepped which
involved reading you know her
autobiography 25 you know but
autobiographies writ unauthorized
biographies written about her as well as
reading every single one of the
children's books that she's written oh
really you wanna hear something wild
yeah when she was and it was in the late
90s she was like 60 years old she had an
operation that was supposed to remove
like some of the scar tissue around her
throat it was a botched surgery she
could never sing again oh wow you
imagine that oh my god imagine being the
doctor who screwed up early Andrews
voice ya feel like you know you're
invaluable instrument yeah I destroyed
right exactly yeah so the managers like
do not bring up the botched surgery you
can't talk about it you can't talk she
can't talk about the settlement yeah
okay I said no problem I'm not bringing
it up three-quarters of the way through
the interview she's like I'm ty asking
about the book she was well you know I
had the surgery and they botched it oh
he says it right and I was like I didn't
say yeah
no that's why I brought up as a fair
game sociable she probably had all kinds
of crazy insurance on that yeah and but
you know what but I mean Julie Andrews
she was gonna be financially fine no
matter what but what is like that's
worth what do you think that that would
be one hundred million dollars see I it
so is 90s so it you know use news
today's dollars I understand and it's
all rumor died who knows her I was
supposedly 20 million pounds so let's
make that you know 40 million yeah 40
million dollars in 1999 which seems like
a big number but is Julie Andrews from
national instrument of both great
britain United right yeah I wonder cuz
you because there are I feel like
there's there are celebrities who have
certain items on their person sure yeah
better ensure it is also interesting
because it's like someone later on in
their career effectively you're not
valuing it based on what she's done
before that's exactly right no right so
you're you're saying okay between now
and West away like what it is right
exactly so they probably said 15 years
at this much whatever yeah but I mean it
really is unbelievable yeah I think this
shows you got a plan for anything yeah I
that disability insurance young man like
you yeah I do you do I do all right Russ
maybe Oh Russ we gotta do some planning
you know I'm on my fiance soon-to-be
wife's insurance at Christie's and they
have very good insurance I'm sure that
this is very nice I mean you're
impressed right sure I'd be more
impressed with Sotheby's better yeah
that's jerk mrs. is the underdog in the
she's like the redheaded stepchild it is
they're trying that's why they just
don't know their nets basically them oh
these days that's okay yeah unless
Harvey's pitching uh so keep it in
sports for a second yeah Islanders I was
rooting for him is so terrible the Apple
s series was theirs it was there it was
like it was like the Pittsburgh series a
couple years ago where they really
should have had it yeah they were such
big underdogs I'm serious was more their
savings I think Taveras after he
single-handedly won the first round
in that amazing game unbelievable which
I was just like we are shrieking it was
crazy I'm sure is that crazy um yeah
they just got a couple bed kind of
bounces that they lost those two games
in overtime after giving up the lead
real late I think it nice the emotional
part of it just blew them away and
that's why the last game i just said to
Jackie we're not gonna watch this this
is gonna be a blowout I knew it yeah
they'll be back I think they're in a
better spot than someone like the
Rangers I think the Rangers are I gotta
tell you great hockey story what's that
so uh I have a friend of mine who works
at american express and she's like hey
we got the box for the Rangers Islanders
game you want to come this was how long
ago the last game of the season she was
a groom right at the point when she
invited me that was like could have been
an important game it's not just year and
i'm at Madison Square okay so meanwhile
it could have been important but it was
not so Jack he's like I'm not going cuz
she's freaked out you will not go into
the garden right because she's crazy she
doesn't want to enter the enemy enemy
exactly she's like oh yeah i really want
to walk into the Death Star even though
they're like her team is playing and
even if we're in the luxury box yes
which does give you like a cone of
protection oh yeah I've worn a devil
jersey into the garden it is not the
best feeling yeah exactly is not yeah
dude it's intense not like going to
Fenway with Yankee yeah close I pretty
close are you gonna say it's worse I
think it's worth before I list so i
brought my jersey huh we put it in my
bag in your bed okay I go through
security the guard looks at me and he's
like looks in the bag and he goes no you
could wear that here and I said why
would I tempt fate and he leans any
whispers to me because I'm an Islanders
and I know how you live on the island
I'm an island just I said and yet you're
whispering yes you know what so you make
security guard yeah so I go into the
luxury box it's like being in the four
season yes yeah so I put my jersey on oh
yeah and you look down at the plebs we
scored three uh three goals in the
second period and the woman who invited
me she's like yeah out of here I'm like
yep let's go we're done our work here is
done yep aight as much as i could drank
as much as I can nice there you go yep
look Lauren
a rough season though yeah yeah I mean I
like I said they'll be back they're fun
they're fun team to watch yeah
goaltending is gotta get sorted out a
little bit yeah what they're gonna do
with that bigger and we're gonna lose
chi lo posso and he's quite good she
gonna go I don't know but I think he's
gonna go somewhere I think I know I'm so
disheartened by sports in general that
you know I think wow they have got this
great this this great team right but I'm
but he's gonna leave that team just to
make more money like when you have an
opportunity potentially to win a Stanley
Cup for the first time in whatever 30
years or 40 years you know like I don't
know how much more money gonna make and
you're gonna go go for some crap team is
he is he a rookie second wrong guy our
first one guy he's now the first line
you play with Taveras yeah see I don't
know if that he needs it to Varys to be
as good as he is I think so i think that
these guys are nuts they go and they
take the money and then like he blows
his Nia I guess what they're thinking is
well I gotta get as much money as I can
I mean I'm sure it's not as bad as it is
in football with regards like how short
their careers are now risky it is no but
but in hockey you do have like a seven
to eight year sweet spot all right sure
that's it and even then like yeah you
can get injured in any moment and what
are you trained for in life if not
hockey professionally I mean if you and
and let's say you're like not a known
person I mean obviously he seems to be
doing okay I don't know enough about
hockey to know any of these people but I
would say like you know you've got to
think you got am accessing you know the
pride thing is a I want to want to stay
on come the smart thing is where we're
going to be in 50 it happen but like
don't you think there's some
intersection of like the potential to
actually win and the money like how much
more money is you get only and there are
certain teams that uh and this is beyond
just hockey for people who are like
Jesus Agra spent on yeah that would be
Makos yes like I've no idea but let me
comment on this no but i think but but
it relates other sports right like there
are certain teams that are able to
maintain people i mean they devils it
with broad or like it basically made him
men make him but they convinced him to
stay with the devil's for his entire
career for less money and he would have
gone out he won
be a franchise player exactly so there's
I mean those are anomalies yeah but it
but you know I would imagine like right
what is the difference between 1.5 and
1.2 or whatever it is like your contract
success thank you like I and you've got
an agent in your ear trying to get as
much money oh please these agents are
nuts yeah to say that they don't think
they do them I don't think they often do
their their clients any good of course
not you know it's redic no it's it's
their do themselves good they're making
choices for themselves and if it helps
the client that's a that's a bonus yeah
and what else is going on with you you
got the baby yeah so yeah when's the
next one is not the thing here yet yeah
he's 13 months ok so right that's right
he's born right near the girls right my
girls exactly so uh yeah he's 13 months
and right now he's like the really great
he's dude is a piece at a perfect time
in his life he's crawling he's crawling
he's uh stay little he says mama dada
are up he says pass the puck yeah he's a
stick save yeah okay I haven't played
goalie no no that's the worst why cuz
the goalie equipment so expensive oh no
no but everyone wants to recruit a
goalie prides like no one gets hurt as
it going that's true they don't handle
stuff but uh yeah I mean yeah I
understand what you're saying but at the
same time no because that not to mention
kids grow so quickly you gotta swap em a
bigger side he'll grow into it no your
swap out the equipment every like six
months it feels like and then you're
gonna you know goalie equipment it's
like twice the amount of regular
equipment no okay thank you fellas right
Andy he'll just wanna you know I don't
dance coach maybe it'll be a dancer
whatever in torrential there I said this
work they'll have every opportunity to
try out I zaki just as he will with
games and whatever else that azz play a
sport ah soccer Oh like and chill yeah
soccer and track she looks like a tracks
yeah she's quick yeah yeah I was so cool
uh no not so quick you know what
happened it was
terrible thing in my soccer career I
grew four inches in one sour and I got
boobs I'm like what are these happen
what happened situation is bad that's a
massive it was crazy someone was
insanity I was like right wing killing
it making like fast speedy girl and then
all the sudden I slowed down yeah he's
like big girls come on top of me and
like what happened that's uh it's called
growing up that's horrible starts it's
not easy on women no all thing is what
else what do you mean so speaking of
women I want to bring up the
ghostbusters yeah oh yeah I can't wait
to see that so I will actually on a
plane I will not go to the movies okay
fair enough III's like specifically for
that movie or movies in general I
general yeah i i'm i'm at the point now
we've talked about this where I either
catch a movie on its way out said
there's no in the theater yeah yeah yeah
anyway you're gonna go see it so I i
guess if we've talked about this but I
what is google humming I'm like what is
going on you heard about the controversy
with this movie now goes bust okay so
let me just bring yeah i just know
Melissa McCarthy's in issues one there's
some controversy about the there was at
least the only thing I heard was that
the woman from Saturday Night Live
thanks inin no no Leslie Jones was it
yes that someone said oh you see
everyone else has a PhD and she's the
the african-american woman doesn't and
she's like shut up yeah I got a job
goddammit whatever but that is the
bigger the controversy that sort of
lasted longer is essentially the first
trailer came out people a lot of people
were like well this isn't funny and
we're like I'm not gonna see it they
were very angry this is not Ghostbusters
whatever and it's sort of morph into
this kind of thing that's like it met
generates a sexist well that was so when
the movie was first announced that it
was going to be a thing there was this
like anti-woman right fallout how
shocking i know right which I being a
card-carrying woman which and feminists
thank you proudly which was like oh
really oh okay whatever why is that got
to be a thing but it is i guess and go
ahead and then so so the trailer comes
out there's this reaction to it
meanwhile like paul feig who's the
director there
very funny director his movies are great
yeah he did spy he did a right thing
like women and he he seems like women
indeed uh so this has sort of just keep
kept evolving with anger and hostility
and the most recent thing this new
another trailer I guess just came out
and some guy from a youtube channel that
has like two million subscribers was
like I refuse to see it well this is my
this is not the Ghostbusters movie I
wanted tion on it exactly Bill Murray
and Harold Ramos and Danny awkward I
have a good memory was dead so they're
not what he mentions that like what kind
of an asshole says that not only that
it's ridiculous to me because it's like
the movie where they tried out the old
actors is the worst the worst one is
Indiana Jones for like you do not want
to see that movie that rats in Star Wars
was good people liked it it's cuz there
was a little bit of the old actors right
it was mostly new people and yet they
were cameoed which I'm sure bill murray
shows up in this movie he might i will
bet I don't know bed money is very
selective about what I know but I think
he'll an awkward my equation i
denounced by the way I know that up well
it's not even that it's like who cares
like this is why here why are you making
this a I'll tell you why it's a big deal
for them is that it ties into this whole
thing of like this war that's going on
this war that I honestly believe they've
created this like culture war the
culture war of like man vs men versus
women and PC vs not and this position
becoming a metaphor for the campaign is
that what this we really becoming I
don't know I it was before the camp a
because it eyes into the whole gamergate
thing as well and it was def you know
what that is dhoni we're not gonna go
else but it is it's all related to this
idea of like people feeling like people
are to pc and too safe and then other
people feeling like freedom of speech
and then you know it's I you know what I
have to say I think freedom for the
speech is quite overrated I think there
are plenty of people who should not have
that freedom you know before we came on
the show we were watching that George
Carlin that old bit you know there are
some people who are just so stupid of
course and I think this is really stupid
it's insanely stupid and why we get Y
and and that we're talking about well
we're talking about it because realm of
what's popular Yeah right trending I
just don't if you put this in the show
notes and tag it with this will get more
people downloading all right SEO be but
I think like for me it's like I would
click on this because I want to just
make sure that there are seeing right
people out there like I'm finally I
listened to other people's opinions I
will think about it I want okay don't
like well once I once I feel like oh
this person is you need a and I
said no and then quickly I'm fine i'll
ignore them but like the vitriol and the
like threatening violence and
like all that stuff is crazy my power
yeah yeah yeah so check this out so i do
a segment where I'm talking about these
trade deals yeah and it was a maybe
month or two ago and I go on and I
basically slam Sanders and Trump the
amount of hate mail that I got oh I'm
sure he's over the top because both of
those are like have like sick dopey
people who are like don't want to hear
facts yeah okay well this is what the
facts are you know you guys wanted like
make some crap up fine go make up your
crap and you why your candidate wants to
make up crap fine that's great I went on
the air and said hey you know what naf
there wasn't a job killer there are
other things that were job killers but
NAFTA wasn't and trade with China people
lost jobs technology globalization
people lost jobs get it but to blame it
on one trade deal is insanity I got such
hate mail and how do you so but you
you're you're thick-skinned you your
idea yeah you're a effect no I do
because I think people are crazy and I'm
a little bit and I'm a neurotic jew so
you're gonna come haunt me get a little
skittish with that I'm more skittish
with it than I'd like to admit yeah how
about that okay I really am because I it
affects me because I I cannot because i
am a rational human being and so there's
something different between an opinion
and a fact right and i get very sick of
people talking about like this is your
opinion this dumbass wants to say i'm
not gonna see ghostbusters who gives a
 right but if you're talking about
like someone makes a statement that
trade is bad
well actually it's not and there are
things about it they can be bad and
they're people who can be hurt and then
I can give you the facts and I laid out
the case but uh so then to have someone
be just right the most disgusting crap
is unbelievable and I think they write
disgusting crap about everyone but i do
think these trolls are insanely focused
on women yep yeah media that's all
places and uh and so uh I get it you
know what I get that like white
middle-class people are pissed off I get
it yeah I have actually that ol
middle-class people are pissed off but
the white seemed to be speaking up very
violently and I'm veer and I've been
talking about income inequality for the
last 15 years so I i understand it but I
hate simple solutions to complex
problems it drives me and that's what
politics is yes you need a 30-second
sound bite you can't go on for five
minutes explaining what your ideas
that's the only five minutes it
shouldn't be a lot of time but it is
yeah you know I I definitely and not
someone who gets a lot of that kind of
feedback but I've had it um I think
there is still for whatever reason this
like misunderstood anonymity uh that the
internet kind of provides but doesn't
provide them they don't understand they
can't understand that there's a person
on the other end right right this oh
they're so they're not like I don't want
to say all of them wouldn't say that to
your face but I think the majority of
them would not well taste like a lot of
people are insanely remorseful when they
realize that this is a water source
right person yet right and and it's not
like a partisan person you know like I I
mean I am partisan but not about this
yeah so I you know talk to me about some
movie to be partisan and you know and
I've been critical I was critical of
Democratic administrations I've been
critical of Republican administrations
like I don't really have you know I talk
about money especially it's very clear
to me what facts are ya and so that
makes me slightly insane but that said I
you know it is a fascinating time to
really see
how much every group needs a scapegoat
right everyone wants to blame somebody
in other words instead of taking all
that collective energy and say like well
this does suck let's figure out a
solution let's instead point fingers get
pissed off and do nothing except stew an
hour an hour by and that's kind of like
with the Flint thing right we're like
it's not about fixing it it's just fat F
everything else we just have to find out
whose fault this is yeah and for and for
some reason when we do find that out
everything will be okay right hand right
what it's like when did that because
there's a human condition thing like you
you hear that the idea of like if you're
angry you hit a pillow right and like
sending an email like that email they're
not sending it to have a discourse
they're they're hitting a pillow rights
their way to scratch the itch of like I
disagree with this person I'm gonna
write a screen to them and they don't
even care than anyone reads I mean they
might in the background of their brain
be like Oh someone might read this but
the few times that I've responded to
those people in email like with a very
calm demeanor it's always they are just
so apologize like I didn't realize that
I'm oh I have had mostly good positive
experiences one time I invited a guy on
my radio show yeah just a disaster it
was a complete disaster go and he wrote
a letter to the president of CBS news
about what a horrible person I was yeah
I'm sure that David read that yeah so
you know the one place where I find it's
much less vitriolic news on linkedin
because it's a professional site and you
know I know that people have fake
profiles but mostly people are using
that because they want jobs and they're
not going to act like assholes right now
I group so that's been a much more
pleasant experience it is the sort of
like we're safe haven right yeah kind of
because you know i mean i'm not gonna
whatever like i don't have people like
comment on my own website yeah my web
versions like you honest do comments
like absolutely not
do I get far too many people who are
telling me what color to wear and I my
hair looks good or bad on a particular
day and they're not all my mother know
there are other people I'm telling you
Jill every time Stacy's like just looks
amazing on her she should have open
comment I'm like yeah like yeah no it
just Stacey open she's like something
about my harrowing it's my hair shut
your hair that's just my hair and I'm
not pregnant promise that would be
interesting it would be impossible
indeed okay now we know yes and now we
know on so yes all about the hair uh so
anyway I'm gonna see Ghostbuster I do
like Melissa McCarthy yeah she's very
funny so like here's the thing i'm i'm
luke i I'm either way like yeah I want
to see it i love the notion of
ghostbusters like that that franchise i
grew up with yeah yeah I want to see
what I'm not trading laces of course not
I mean look Trading Places has a very
special place in our collective heart
yeah I'll understand and financially
accurate exactly pretty accurate pretty
pretty vicious crop report em okay sorry
but are we did you send me the thing
where it's like try and explain the end
of this film yeah it's yeah I sir just
know I'm close to it but it's so it's
very complicated anytime we could do a
frame by frame and I could explain it
yeah I could do that that's might as
well do it it looks funny thing about
the end of that movie is like it is one
of the funniest movies that is the plot
is super simple yeah like the plot not
complicated off then at the end of this
film dan Aykroyd and and Eddie Murphy's
characters attempt to pull off the most
complex sort of like double backs think
you know what it's so great about it is
that it's actually because it was filmed
that was the where I worked that was my
first job on Wall Street and I worked in
that ring so so many of my friends are
extras which is very well to watch it is
why yeah I yeah I like the fact that
five minutes before the most complicated
financial heist movie history someone
gets essentially like attacked and raped
by a girl yeah exactly love ya
androidcentral movies ends like that
never was like I'm just gonna believe
that hey guys i just saw Jamie Lee
Curtis boobs yeah okay move on that is
not a bad part of that movie um what
happened to her where is she she's doing
she does like viber commercial oh you
want to poop better eat this fire Divya
yeah she's married to Christopher Guest
oh I wouldn't know that yeah and they
apparently they're like really into cons
like they go to what I go to conventions
interests out their kids who are into
like you sleep really yeah dress up like
Street Fighter characters yeah if I saw
a couple foot on that nice yeah um so I
want to bring up something a little
different what is GTA V stand for you
don't know I have no idea think about it
it's a video game now that you're done
I'm done that's good so yeah not if you
had a name a video game franchise you
know i would say leisure suit larry
which is not which is actress sure and
you did that was one so fung pong but i
think about maybe right now something in
the last what is one mo you're popular I
don't know it's the day oh wait imma
this is great hold on the best game ever
Jill name a modern vine franchise i
watch TV isn't there a I've got three
letters right to use it clear and you
have three letters she's like grand
theft auto q oh my god it just came to
me although but I don't even know
anything beyond that I have to be honest
with you what's another give me two more
yellow you never be I heard I ever to
call a duty yeah yeah there you go
alright so that's it I thought your
movies I mean there's there's more but
there's more than three games now that's
it but yeah it's a couple more this is a
great game because like Idaho second
service you like that pong ha I mean
you're not wrong it's a 40 year old game
Derek but it's the only game I really
ever oh no wait was there another one
there was another what like a pong like
game where you with blocks yeah like art
noise at tetris tetris a little bit yeah
i was so not into video games except for
leisure suit larry which we were in
compulsive about yeah it's a creep yeah
exactly just agree anyway grant
theft auto 5 the V is oh thank god
alright it's sara monroe think about
this my uh miss money Greg the final
five is sold 65 million cops you know
what a game costs I don't know like the
I have no idea where they have no idea
50 bucks a hundred bucks like no idea
you can 69 six alright so it's not so
bad uh that's insanity globally
milledgeville yeah mold is it uh
dispersed around the globe or is the
United States the majority pretty dis
but I think the US is usually the
majority but it's generally in Europe
yet have a split probably but they have
a portion of it but you're a UK is not a
distributor of that game of 2k okay yep
so you've heard you hear that yeah yeah
take to interact oh you're looking lets
you know give or take like three and a
half billion dollars and gross in that
pretty good which is not bad what we did
at the upfronts exactly you just compare
that to movies like right oh my god not
like I'm throwing about what it does
civil war is up to probably nine hundred
million isn't really yeah so it'll I
mean again a movie tickets Temba shirt a
game six that's right look at it like
that yeah but I just I mean numbers like
that did you expect that had not
affected that anybody I mean we knew is
gonna do gangbusters but that's crazy 65
aside its Quinn US version 5 does that
make versions one through four sell more
or in other words a little bit but not a
significant like really small spike I
wouldn't think it'd be Sigma is it great
yeah it is a very lemon forget but was
crazies the games almost three years old
already what yeah so I'm out on a few
you came out in 2013 in the fall of 2013
and then the new consoles came out and
they made in a new one they updated the
the graphics for it yeah re-released it
then it came out for pc and it's been
the last version came out watin 14 was
pc uh and new joy yeah for maybe late
14th yeah but i but that is smart
because essentially they made one game
and they're getting multiple bites at
the Apple which I game
don't write is that unlike Apple
excessively well done thank you so yeah
that I just why I figured that was
something as a staggering that's a
pretty big number that could be our
number of the week 65 million a good one
that's the number the way yet can you do
that now i'ma send you the story that's
amazing 65 mil of a game mm-hmm wow
you're right multiple bites from the
Apple I have two versions of it either
for 360 and pc jub a big deal you get to
write it off I know but like I that's
not what you've gotten both versions and
so if yet because the pc version lets
you see the game plan a totally new
graphical light I mean they really
improved it and joy you should know that
you can attempt to have sex with people
in this game just like they should Larry
oh well then I'm in so there Joe I
haven't played a game I'm whatever it's
just like it's freaking embarrassing
Jill you're a problem solver why not how
do we fix the line the security lines at
the airport I think the fingerprint
everybody I'm totally fine with that I
am too I'm willing to give up that see
that actually that it may maybe if every
single person were fingerprinted hmm
when you're gonna have you're gonna have
privacy advocates up and I know there is
actually something I just read this
recently that your fingerprint is not
considered an illegal search someone was
saying that said the police could use
your fingerprint to unlock your phone
and it would be okay really I can't ask
you for your password it's like this
weird little in the maybe you should not
use your finger your thumbprint we get
on your phone ya know i'm justing like
that is an absurd louisville yeah I mean
well because who would have ever think
about this so like when I do global
entry right I was going back and forth a
lot hey I went down to lower Manhattan
yeah and they do a full like you you
know you went down they give you like a
security this is the pretty czech thing
yeah and it's not gsa pre but its global
entry right who cares like it the only
we're the only ones doing anything with
the Israelis so you can just forget
about don't be traveling in Europe and
feel safe right all right that's what I
know but the they ask you a bunch of
questions they take your fingerprints
they run background
on you through some database and now you
have this thing so now I come off the
plane and I put my little bum print down
and my fingers and it comes up and it
says hello Jill Schlesinger it knows
what what flight I've been on hmm says
do you have anything to declare no boom
leave I'm out of JFK and like six
minutes I guess my only concern my only
concern with it's not a privacy Kanaan
and I'm just to be clear I'm talking
mostly about domestic stuff okay but
whatever yeah doesn't care its executive
on your name on it would be if we go all
fingerprint and me like I feel like
that's something that you could
potentially very like not easily faked
but fake maybe if I cut your hand off no
what am I like a Russian games like like
in the movies they're always like
lifting prints and then reusing them
it's like a piece of latex right I'm
cutting a thumb off and but what a great
idea in your pocket was like that's
you're a terrorist like why not I'm this
biometric society yeah like that will be
a thing yeah you would need at multiple
points of failure would have to be like
ring so what else would be done I mean
well also i think it by the way the
people who are checking security have
you like got taking a gander at some of
these gigs they're not the best know
kind of scary I mean it's a crappy job
yeah a job you can't see maybe we can
retrain all the guys who lost their jobs
to women and Hispanics and Chinese
people and does insane to me right it's
like this has become a big story in the
last two weeks because oh my god all of
a sudden people realize like there's a
three-hour wait newark airport yep
traveling yeah enjoy afternoon yeah
drive right so the last time I flew when
I went to Vegas I was I get out of the
car I enter the terminal and I'm faced
with like the most chaotic unorganized
district Ellis Island yeah circa 1940 12
3 i'm like what the what is
happening here the NOAA has any answers
now everyone like cattle is just like
horrible bottlenecking into a thing
again you're dealing with bureaucracy in
person generally the only time you deal
with it it's on the phone or like on a
website may be here you're seeing it i
mean it's like the DMV and mass could
you better be like a logistics expert
team that comes in and says look this is
how we
to deal the power airport yeah yeah I
there should be I mean that a government
job resign your Joe that's the thing i
think it has to be a government job and
we have to pay up for it do you think
but do you think the tsa should be
privatized mmm is that it seems to be
the most popular answer yeah I don't
know why that like I feel I guess maybe
it should be I don't know I I feel like
that's a government responsibility and
their private Airlines they are but I'm
just an area but there but so the
airline's of the client of the airport
right the airports are run by
municipalities right right yeah right so
I know I think of it more as a
government job and I think there has to
be like a uniform standard and if we do
it if we privatize it it's going to be
like this one does this this one does
this i don't know i think the tsa has
for a cavalcade of reasons lost respect
from the American public Oh probably cuz
they've had a major fail yeah they're
not so much of it i'm not talking about
security things i'm just saying like in
the process right I just like what DMV
was ten years exactly like maybe part of
your military career is you spend that
idea spend a year doing airport secure
it for the draft is like I'm just saying
like do you think a fully uh military
employed TSA yeah I would expedite I
don't know who I think I think that they
are first of all their rule followers
that's their training so I do like that
and you're intimidating definitely so I
think there's be a lot of people that
would be like i did not get into the
army or whatever yeah but if it were
like okay the wait a second let's say
we're like a medical doctor okay where
the first year of whatever rotation
you're doing here at your residence it's
your residency it's like the first year
of your residency like tough luck this
is part of your this is entry okay okay
and you're not your I mean make it a
homeland of security thing right yeah I
mean it seems like i don't know i think
that uh some of these times when I've
gone through airports it's it's scary
what gets through so I also you know
again going back to the paranoid jus
thing I get nervous
around that and you know what they I
guess there's this moment where you're
seeing them like frisk an 82 year old
nun you're in a wheelchair right like
what are we doing here and was this is
less be smarter and and also the idea
around not having information I don't
know about you guys but like when I go
into a subway platform now and there's
no like when the next train is like
Charles me not insanity yeah all right
but if we have like a little bit more
information and how to navigate it or
you know like you need a ways for an
airport like us yeah line for is
actually faster get over there I mean
but like there's yes it seems like but
just chaos but the government is not
good at that sort of speedy logistics I
know like that would not be a good one
why can't someone just step in and be
like up let's go back to the drawing
board on this entire thing right there's
no way I should be being I should be
herded like some sort of like I said
cattle right through this you know maze
and you don't even get to go on like
face mountain at the end of it right
it's like the shittiest ride ever ever
and then I get to the front and there's
this TSA zombie guy yeah like looks like
he hasn't slept in 43 hours he's waving
people through but that he's just waving
people into like a total sort of you
know gridlock situation behind him and
like dude this is not the answer I just
oh I mean a privatized company their
issues they are potentially our core
they're incentivized to maybe get rid of
the line faster yeah less secure I mean
not to say that CAS TSA is adding that
much security but yeah but like then you
lose the deal alright if you know then
yeah make money and you're into the
privatization i hearing it i I just need
something much but i think it's an awful
idea for like prisons for example i
agree so like there i guess what i was
exactly what I thinking about like it
hasn't worked there so I'm not sure it's
gonna work here I bet it'd be a good
idea for schools like there's like a lot
of potential issues with bringing in
for-profit companies fine i cut corners
in bad place I just I just want the
right thing to happen I don't care who
does it well why don't you just figure
out how to fly the out of the cattle car
and then you can get an expedited
journey do you know if you fly business
or first you get like that cept
line that's your just sign up for pre
it's 80 bucks and you but is it you
don't get the Skip you skip a lot of it
a lot of it yeah and you don't have to
take off your shoes I should have to
take every to me but you know but I
should I don't find out it's a
regressive tax let's be honest and so
it's like this is one of those moments
we're gonna talk about something it's
like you know what if you have money
it's excellent yeah I be no money if
you're trying I would say if you're
traveling once a month one hundred
percent worth it if you're having twice
a year to ice a year to three times I
why don't you get CBS to pay for you to
go business class don't you have a bad
back oh yeah oh my god my back's killing
me oh it is bad yeah oh oh okay my neck
and my doctor said I haven't seen no
doctors note I have a note now makes it
official yep um oh yeah that's funny
you're dr. buckle are cleared up really
when so you know when I was here last I
think that I had just been to Turkey
right that's what it was yeah and I was
probably the last American to safely I'm
travel throughout Turkey which is
because now crazy dangerous down um but
when i was there and we were traveling
he was very interesting to watch the
security not a lot of it yeah and that
to me like flying around the world has
become a lot scarier I know that I know
that can happen anywhere could happen
here god forbid I'm but there is this
sense when you're flying abroad that
there's just like a ton of people
there's less there seems to be less
security in those places again unless
you go to Israel and the evil in London
certainly as well so in London so here's
a problem with London so I flew in and
out of Heathrow a lot it's just so many
people now possibly they could keep
track of everything is amazing to me and
people coming from really crazy places
so it's it's a it's a nightmare to
travel now it really is you know what it
makes you think like yeah I stay in the
US in fact I'd lunch yesterday with a
guy who he and his wife like they're in
their early 30s no thinking about like
they want to go travel but she's like
Aunt Zika virus we're not around playing
abroad I had no idea that that was I'm
like what do you mean so don't go to
Brazil
he's like it's like five minutes away
from being in Europe so you can't take
the chance gonna be in the u.s. to its
here it just hasn't been contracted here
I don't think yet yeah I don't know
another reason by you to basically go
get pregnant no the reason oh right the
no you can't because you don't know if
you're suffering from going in Italy in
September oh how nice ah just book that
where are you going going to the Amalfi
Coast oh where are you staying that's
one of my favorite but I think we're
doing Airbnb ease but do you know what
towns like ravello ha ha no Positano
yeah oh I didn't know your Italian oh
yeah I've got the agenda she's not my
hands that's like doesn't count yeah and
you're not like slurping on linguine oh
no I Negroni here it is what uh what
else there's I think oh we're staying a
couple nights in Naples hmm interesting
supposed to have the best pizza in Italy
all right why I'm sorry that play Naples
I in Hoboken it's like the best pretty
close probably New York someone just
said said to me bet we were like talking
about living in LA and he's like yeah
except the pizza shop yeah a lot of
things suck in LA I mean I think it's a
fun city I'm love to visit it's good in
moderation ok I like it better than San
Francisco yeah yeah oh I don't know if I
feel that way I feel that way but you're
very I think simple you love the gays oh
yeah sure love gay people but la is much
more culturally interesting i agree with
you a hundred percent easily and recited
here's the deal i agree with you on that
front la has much more diversity in sort
of less style and that sort of thing
where San Francisco kind of feels like a
sauna own stuff like a model City yeah
like has a lot almost I like the way yet
san fran awful great services yeah but
then what do you think about Kara
Swisher running for mayor there uh I
don't know is it true I said it's a
widely distributed disseminated rumor
what about nothing because she works and
for the same coming i do LOL find out
yeah maybe not she's she's been talked
about as a mayoral candidate what do you
think I think she should take her
glasses office she's gonna interview
people that's just me
sense but she seems lovely alright I
guess you know how Jill feels anyway I
don't know what I really i find that san
Francisco's a little bit small for me
it's not like a real city so it's a cool
town yeah yeah it kind of shuts down at
night too yeah and there's no real arts
community that is institutionalized like
I know that there's like a subculture
and I friends who are artists there and
they're gonna yell at me for saying this
red you know it's like you go to museums
in in major cities you expect to see a
museum right nothing there and you know
it's those tech guys they're busy saving
the world making sure we're all
connected instead of shelling out checks
to support the Arts they're not alive
they're not like they're not very
focused on their one thing right and so
you don't get a lot of diversity it's
like hurry up and come to San Francisco
never leave the house never leave the
office yeah yeah that's one area never
beat is very very focused on what
they're doing odd so let me ask you
another question all right we got a
couple minutes what's up doggy yeah what
about it how's he doing all right yeah
he's great oh you haven't talked about
him at all no yeah I feel bad for Marty
Marty kind of gets like the back seat
yeah horse now you got a baby you know
he is his claim to fame is like when it
when the baby goes to bed and I get my
parents back wow you know and then yeah
he's no the late late show right now see
a serious James Corden oh there we've
noticed like uh at bedtime he's gotten
closer and closer to like get becoming
like you know the the meat in the
sandwich that's very sweet where he's
like I Eunice's oh my god don't forget
right I'm hear me I'm here um you know
he's kind of like is he sleep on the bed
he does used to not but then when winter
comes he's like a gang I got snuggle
great time now that's getting a little
warmer he kind of like pieces out after
a couple minutes but yeah poor guy um I
do have one thing to say before we're up
the show uh what I feel like this is
becoming a series of Ross rustic New
York stories because I have quite a many
but it seems like these people just come
to me Jim tell so Jill's roses had like
maybe half a dozen
just weird new in your theme song maybe
just for this segment that happened to
him it's almost curve ish but not can
you give me a few highlights well last
week I talked about the fact that this
taxi driver pulled pulled in front of
this woman leaned out the window was
like hey you look like my niece Dottie
some weird stuff just like typical like
actually with not a foreign accent no
with like a heavy New York Italian
accent oh but that's like impossible
right there that's like 25 years ago
right I was also like shocked like I was
very surprisingly authentic yes yeah
like that so just two days ago I've been
having AC issues air conditioning issues
and it's been fun because it's been cool
in New York City but it's gonna get very
hot AC stuff in your apartment in my
part ok so my a/c units like a Jewish
and he has severe condition horse in the
Torah I haven't turned mine on five
degrees in a minute i know i'm with you
i can't let me prepare so i'm working
with my company it's been like a major
hassle get this thing fixed they finally
pc richards comes and delivers like a
giant box the two russian delivery guys
are like we're not putting that together
okay would not do even though they're
supposed to even though they're I wet I
thought that they were supposed to but
they didn't I call I called the
management company that I rent my
apartment from and they're like okay
we'll send guys over there a first thing
in the morning 1030 whatever okay I'm
waiting for them they didn't they don't
show up it's like 11 1115 they finally
show up they is not quite accurate
because one guy shows up and he's about
110 he is a very very old man so he's
older than water and he's supposed to do
your air-conditioned and I knew he
showed up because he was unlike in the
hallway there's only two apartments on
my hallway and he was standing in the
hallway for 15 minutes like staring at
his phone trying to figure out whether
it was in the right spot eventually he
knocks on the door I open and he's like
hey air conditioning like where is it
and I lead him into the bedroom where it
is like I'm like looking at this guy and
he's he's not like you know how you see
those old guys that are like ripped yeah
they I'm like Mike yeah totally amazing
I know now he's built like me uh
110 years old so like this is a bad
situation for everyone involved yeah so
he starts taking the old unit out and
there's like a shaking the muscles are
like me like oh my god I gotta help them
get roketa major problem so Mike okay
I'm like like coming in to help yeah and
he's like no no I got it it's like
waving me away clearly you don't and I'm
standing back and I'm like like is this
the end of his career and he needs to
prove they can like hold it in like with
the young guys rest of the analysis I'm
just like trying to understand so like
he's but he's still doing his creaking
and it's like shaking to the floor and
I'm worried he's gonna like scrape the
flourishing like that's love worry if
he's dying he's mom is dying secondary
secondary point well with no air
conditioning the body's gonna go like
that a little smell so I come in i'm
like okay now i'm gonna help this guy so
I so I take one side wheel slowly lower
it and and he's like okay so I'm good
the thing is out at this point there's a
giant hole in the wall and he's ready to
leave with my old air conditioning what
are you doing I'm like well we have to
put this one and he's like oh okay right
exactly so he's like okay I'll be right
back I need a hand truck so he goes down
why would you wouldn't bring a hand
truck and the first place in the air
conditioning 400 so he goes down comes
back he's like okay I guess we're gonna
do this like totally discouraged about
the fact he has to install this thing
and I'm like it like literally this guy
could die any moment or is that could
break or something terrible could happen
so it's me and him like again both week
gentlemen trying to lift this AC unit
into this box whole situation and it
goes in but like halfway and there's
like foam sticking out on the sides and
I'm like you know it all figured out so
what happened I mean I I like kind of
jammed there's still like a little a
jerry-rigged did it masking tape is
holding his air conditioning good is it
not secured but I pushed on a few times
and it seems to not be moving oh brother
but like who do you send and also like I
there was a half of me that was like
gonna email the management coming like
hey next time you do this maybe send two
guys but then I'm thinking like is this
guy gonna get an email from his boss
being like you couldn't handle the
situation on their own Larry come on
this is strike
Larry oh my so maybe that's like again
paranoid but it was and now I know how
to install a wall-mounted
air-conditioned yes you do almost almost
yeah they don't walk under Russell's uh
oh thanks so these are the Harry these
are the times i ask you a quick question
yeah you guys use uber or not yeah I do
yeah have you used via know is that
another one what is that oh my god I'm
about to teach us I'm gonna teach you
something sensei uh listen to smell it
the is that's it okay it's ride-sharing
for real oh you don't like that rush you
such a snob I'm job in this crap happens
ok well im so cuz I I can't wait to hear
this cuz I'm I bucks I'm kind of done
with uber I got pissed off at uber
because I had to take you know I know
surge pricing I get it right but no
because if when i leave something I and
there's 90 cars and it's still surging
zactly what exactly was going on so I
had to I took a car and I went from the
broadcast Center which is 57th between
10th and 11th and I went downtown to
Wall Street and was forty-eight dollars
 and I was like no way that's crazy
so I'm walking the girls that afternoon
I'm talking to a friend of mine in the
dog run and i said no as I guess so
pissed at Ebor she's got to use via I
mean what's that oh it's ride-sharing
she does now look if you're gonna be
snobby you gotta share the car with
other people I don't give it a people we
talking about three at the most so
you'll never been fine you know I don't
want to sit between see what I've been
experimenting with ride-sharing it's
like I'm it sitting in the middle yeah
well that hasn't been my experience is
one in the front and two in the bed
early fireman okay now so I'm like all
right I could get down with that I mean
I take the bus so I rideshare quite
often totally so I she sends me a coupon
or whatever it's five bucks yeah no
matter Lords right now it's five bucks
no matter what no ma'am no matter what
until they want to make money and yeah
yeah but so I was you know it's it's
sort of like I did like a couple of
trips where I didn't have to get
somewhere in a hurry and I wanted to
make them far distances to see what it
went like what it was like yeah so I
went from my apartment on the Upper West
Side I had to go to the UN okay that's a
real hassle that's the way across town
right cross town in line
shower yeah it was quite efficient
because what they're doing is basically
they're running that there's obviously
the algorithm is pic is flagging people
that are in route to wear your farthest
right your farthest destination / pool /
port and uh but it's five bucks right
side say hey through the app I pay
through the app tipping something zero
no tipping five dollars I mean just to
put that in perspective the bus is 275
right okay it's not like row said it's
not gonna last a king even if it's ten
bucks ten bucks then that I mean that's
that's a big day that's what is it to
anywhere in manhattan is anywhere like
I'm looking at the ranges so 110th
Street and South I guess yeah of 110th
Street right so I'm not going up there
anyway no one's going up there so that's
it's a barbecue saying I this is nothing
about five dollars oh just try it yeah

fun going on I did Game of Thrones
recaps within this week did you realize
like it there's a show I don't watch
he's a diehard Game of Thrones guy to
the point where like we went off the we
went off the air and he was like ripping
into that show really like this show is
a mockery you actually really did a
thing about Game of Thrones recently
yeah with the fire stuff yeah but that
wasn't I don't think that was like super
heady down low hanging fruit it was uh
you should watch it it's good now I
can't it's too violent it is very
annoying and this is one thing you know
it's the one thing I can't take if my
mom can handle Game of Thrones your
mother's tougher than I am that's widely
known all right it is known it's known
as your throws refer what is your um
three what are your three favorite shows
right now that are like top of mind game
of thrones Archer archers in another
season I really i like that across all I
loved better call Saul great second
stage the second season yet and then I
liked it very much very cool I don't
know if I have a number three Fargo did
we say for cargo but it's not all right
that was second season better than first
I think there boy think the first season
is better but they're both excellent is
that on netflix yeah i can binge that
yeah you should i would watch the
private watch them in order a lot of
people cuz one takes place before
watchmen or watch right see better than
the movie no no but the movie it's a day
and here's here's what about Fargo the
show mm-hmm the show in my opinion does
such a brilliant job at honoring the
being of for yes not what are you yeah I
don't you won't go wrong you'll be like
oh yes this is exactly right I agree
with that piece of police work let me
ask you another question you don't watch
the Americans it's like my favorite show
know about love you and oh my god oh you
know I want to thank the dozens of other
fans I think nobody watches the
Americans but every but uh keeps it
because they know it's good so good yeah
my god I'm serious it's good I've been
watching these like esoteric British um
series on netflix that i binge watch
like what and the barrister and the
capitalist that's us Jackie and me I
know like happy valley which is a little
bit intense there's no I yeah as I've
seen it on did you watch broadchurch the
original how much I don't know that's a
crime david tennant god it's so good wow
so that's what you've been doing you
should watch jessica jones if you like
David I like jessica jones it's also a
tiny bit violent finally I watch like
you are sons of anarchy I know but that
that's an ultra vires oh it is it's true
what happened to him in that like didn't
he do another show that failed Kurt
Sutter did the bastard is your ra watch
I you know what I give him a pass oh for
sure I you know he wrote that South Paul
movie that no one like yeah i think you
know anything he I'm not saying he won't
be back but let you know we got change
it up a little bit have you I do you
guys watch veep I do I should ever know
that loud funny yeah that's really great
well you know what I happen to like
Silicon Valley too I really like yeah
you are in Silicon Valley I think you're
on it I love that ring is when I was
working for a start-up it was uncanny
yeah how spot on well what's crazy is
all the Google stuff that happened this
year as week rather they had their i/o
conference which we did not cover as a
tech pockets but that's fine I'll shady
they uh the beginning of it was like so
typical Silicon Valley like who Lisa we
are we're making the world a better
place like no bozos playing the harp
existed like a speaker that knows when
you want to order shampoo yeah it's just
it's kind of I don't even know anymore
you don't know any doubt and that's why
you know the world of tech is like this
fascinating uh and simultaneously
depressing yet it's like everything is
like look at Wall Street like we went
through that are boom and bust and when
I was growing up in on Wall Street it
was disgusting and fascinating and it
was a subculture and people were
horrible and they still are thank you
very much but you know I've had like my
new metaphor that I like
describe the whole idea of banking in
wall street is that I said it's like
it's like having a relative that you
really love but who is a horrible drunk
and then sometimes when he or she gets
really drunk just behaved terribly yeah
yeah but like sort of fun up into the
point they get to that place but when
they get to that place very bad right so
I still love the industry it's just
there's some really know there's some
dark spots there's some pretty major
league dark spots yeah so so before we
go what you have like something you're
really hot on these days that you're
that you're like hovering on your show
or and I I fallen in love with somebody
so I'm gonna who's that and it's gonna
be next week so it's gonna be a
first-ever on the jalan money show rose
who'd you fall no no I had to disclose
it to Jackie yeah oh my god there's a
melon love the man mm-hmm she's back
back on the other side hmm so I'm I was
listening to a podcast guys work he's
very good writer his name is James
Altucher okay and he was actually sort
of a a tech entrepreneur bought and sold
created and then sold some companies but
he had done a podcast and it's called
the James Altucher show and I was
listening to it when I was like on an
Earth Day clean up or something and I
was just struck I just really adored him
and he was talking about minimalism you
like basically got rid of everything in
his life so he's like a Buddhist kind of
dude yeah but not okay because he's like
a capitalist but he may be a Buddhist
capitalist sure and so I just wow this
guy so authentic so cool like he's a
grower if they just love the way he was
talking yeah so there I am on the beach
cleaning up into the podcast I tweet at
jlt sure your minimalist podcast blew me
away would you ever be on my show day
later no rights direct messaged me sure
rock and roll is fantastic comes on the
show like I did something I'd never done
before I gave him the entire show I did
an interview with him for the entire
show so a two-hour terrestrial radio
show we do oil is down to 115 right in
the podcast sure Memorial Day special
this weekend
and now next weekend and I'm so psyched
because I loved him oh that's such a
great interview and so that's gonna be
memorial day weekend on the drill on
money chef that's all something wrong so
that's what I really that that got me
site so how can people check that out if
like they don't catch you in their area
they what they should do is they should
subscribe to the Jill on money pot has a
whole radio show spit out into a pocket
except no commercial right which is kind
of AB great kind of screwed my
terrestrial partners right a little bit
no I mean no one who's listen you know
what in the future and not only that but
honestly like one program directors like
you know I don't like when you put the
podcast up early like oh cuz you think
your people are gonna download the
podcast versus listen to it it's not
that's the thing like it's one thing if
you were doing it so wait you're sayin
you release the pockets before it goes
on the air Shh sometimes all right I can
understand maybe a look it goes out on
the system here's the thing the
syndication company puts it out on the
system on Thursday night yeah okay that
means that they could air it starting
friday at 1201 am sure right so i put it
out friday morning usually alright
afternoon but subscribe to it and it's
fun and and I I'm trying to like I'm
pitching this other thing I might do a
whole separate podcast I got things
rockin and rollin cool I've been and so
then and then after I fell in love with
this guy like I want to interview you
because I've been doing video for
LinkedIn hmm i did a video on linkedin
that went viral it was hysterical I
never had anything like this happen i do
video and i interviewed this woman very
interesting and i put up a blog post
together we embed the video and i said
is college worth it oh nice 285,000
views on linkedin is intense rates
greater headlines Greek a yeah you know
me I could be in writing so sexist so
they see so what was like to take away
the takeaway is that college is worth it
but it is not worth it to go into debt
to get your color and that's something
you've been preached and um but not only
that there are certain people who really
don't need to go to college and they do
need to get really awesome trade
training sure on and there is some
thought that talk about public-private
partnerships that there could be a
really interesting way for come
to basically say you know what we don't
need to go to four years of stupid
liberal arts education drink your ass
off and join a fraternity what we need
is to train you for 18 months of code
our stuff right and we can do that check
I always thought like there's certain
sort of practice like even like i.t
right where it's like well that's not I
don't you don't need like it was even so
we do like right you can teach you do a
lot the question is what you're getting
you're getting more than that when you
get a liberal arts education but you got
to pay for it and like is it really
worth it for a family to blow through
their entire retirement insurance stupid
right not to mention the fact you can
get a liberal arts education at a state
school right you don't necessarily have
to go to a private school and get and
and you know once you get that first job
the value of your undergraduate degree
is basically nothing exactly doesn't
matter so you think we can can we teach
coding in high school yes yeah in you
can catch it all right why shouldn't it
be part of our curriculum I think it
will be it should be it needs a lot of
things should be like understanding
banking like basic banking stuff
personal finance right person is teach
that in middle school personal finance
what else do any coding stuff cooking
stuff is a logic-based so like that to
me is like right in there with like
basic math yeah and it fills in with
algebra yeah like that drives me nuts
wyland use one little pet peeve there
especially just talking about women I
hate when women say to me I'm not good
at math I don't even understand what
that means like you can't add and
subtract think that's the most that you
need math in most of your life that
should be the follow up what do you mean
what do you mean like do you not get
numbers I think there are people that
like when you I think their heads get a
little bit fuzzy when you see like a
bunch of numbers on a page and you're
trying to make conclusions about those
numbers so it's not so much the math
they have problems with it's the
logistical jump that you have to make
using the math that's in front I mean I
get in a way I think that's like
percentage person like percents they
don't know I'm okay with them actually I
just I'm sure since I just drives me a
little bit nutty be especially like I
feel like that's not that's not like a
rational thing it's a knee-jerk it is
used yeah yeah and I really want more
to go into finance engineering and tech
because I think that would go a long way
in closing the wage gap cause anything's
happening not oh not the only wage gap
I'm saying I think there are more there
are more but it's the ratios don't worry
crazy yeah and how do you so how do you
fix that I'm just got a first of all we
have to like stop letting kids opt out
of we just have to that's silly hmm
a friend of mine who is a engineer born
in China raised in the United States
she's like ah you guys need to be like
way more tiger mom about things like get
those kids in and just like okay it's
uncomfortable but like get through it
like that's part of your education you
have to get through certain things here
and have a greater familiarity and they
have to need more role models and we
really have to get people to see that
and and to see and also like I do this
all the time for the CFP board certified
financial planning board of standards I
go out and I say you know what it's a
great job if you like oh I don't want to
be an investment banker it's a bad job
for a mom you know what financial
planner isn't a fantastic job for a mom
fantastic and there are a lot of jobs
where you know what if you can do like
but three days from home and one day in
the office that's a good job for a mom
yeah right but I don't know I just it's
one of those I again I'm a FEMINIST with
a large f yeah I understand we just need
a lot more just letters yeah it's a lot
more role models like that what what we
will not wait so long but I'm what's
gonna happen for you this afternoon ah
this afternoon are gonna put the show up
and then I'm gonna start to work with
the CBS em people on what Vlad and I are
gonna do this to see if it would you
have an idea no we're trying to trying
out some new stuff like a more laid-back
week in recap sort of situation um that
I've been working with the EP over there
on a kind of make something work there I
did what I love doing stuff together so
we're trip you know I was on with him on
monday talking about berkshire
hathaway's investment example all right
oh yeah that's is the apples become a
value enum that's what did they do they
invested a billion dollars which is like
crazy it's a pretty nice number here oh
just shows you how undervalued they
believe the company yeah well maybe you
don't I don't know I I go back
for that I feel like they you know they
really have to start I I don't think
they're there momentum is what it used
to be I'm yeah especially on the
consumer side yeah they need some sort
of industry put like they kind of just
b2b or whatever it's gonna make them
more money to kind of stop blowing
people's minds with products which I get
like you can't maintain that
indefinitely that's the reality of it I
know that's the expectation that's the
hard part yeah how do you shift that
expectation greatly I guess I'll tell
you what you could help shift my
expectation mr. Cooke pay me a crap load
in dividends and spend some of that cash
yeah I think they're going to spend a
lot of cash doing acquisitions and I
think that innovation is going to be
they're gonna buy innovation you're
gonna take a little bit of the page of
facebook like you know your google we
don't have to do that yeah we can get by
oculus yeah you know I think you're not
they've 200 billion dollars invested in
that Chinese uber come on yeah yeah

talking about ready okay oh you know
what this is think this is a problem
with innovation in this country you want
to know I will end on this how are you

many people putting out games instead of
figuring out big problems like how to
make the line shorter at the airport
let's let's redirect look at this like
brain trust what is you to really do on
the line at the airport if not play like
I don't know what you're saying but like
you guys like you like someone like me

esoteric products so people can get
richer no we want to figure out like a
better way

loans right you know I'd like nation to
be right but then uh but then let's take
