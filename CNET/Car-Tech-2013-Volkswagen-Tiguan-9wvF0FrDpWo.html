crossover this compact SUV seats five
people it's lot more maneuverable and
gets better fuel mileage
let's get inside the 2013 Volkswagen
Tiguan and check the tech there's Tiguan
is actually built on the VW Golf
platforms but this is a compact SUV 14
and a half feet long which is about the
size the most compact and midsize cars
it's pretty easy to maneuver in the city
given that size and it all seats five
people pretty comfortably because of
this high roofline there's not a lot of
cargo area in back just a little over 23
cubic feet but you put the rear seats
down you can probably carry your your
weekend IKEA run back there now this is
the SEL trim levels that's the highest
trim level and something the Volkswagen
has been doing a lot recently is these
big panoramic sunroof this thing
stretches all the way back over the rear
compartment it's a huge amount of space
and it also has this nice cover inside
so you can open up the top but still
filter out the sunlight with this cover
and still get your fresh air
now you may have seen Ryan Cooley
complain about this head unit in the
Volkswagen he's not a fan of this
interface but I happen to like it
Volkswagen does this sort of semi
circular menu structure of these icons
here so you just got to twirl this knob
around select all the different menu
options this is showing the navigation
so I can choose address intersection
different ways of entering addresses I
can also use this touchscreen and pop
any of these icons and bring up the
different menus now this navigation
system comes standard in this SEL trim
Tiguan so you don't need to pay any
extra for it but this is kind of why it
would drop down to a lower trim level
because I don't really like this
navigation system so much the map screen
is pretty small it doesn't have traffic
so that it's pretty low tech as far as
navigation systems go and when you're
under route guidance the graphics aren't
very explicit they don't give you a lot
of guidance on which way you need to go
fortunately and this is something
Volkswagens really good at is they about
the center LCD in the instrument cluster
they'll show good route guidance
directions that will actually show
arrows and the street you need to turn
on so I'm usually referring to that when
I want to follow a route instead of
looking over here now of course there's
also the digital audio sources on here
and we've got satellite radio strangely
no HD radio we've got our digital media
sources this is one thing that most
finding does that they really got to get
over this they've got this crazy
proprietary port down here in the
console they with this cable hanging off
of it this one has a 30 pin iPod
connector so if you have a modern iOS
device you have to plug in this little
adapter then you can plug in your iOS
device and boom there you go you can
have music I mean they should really
just have a USB port in the consult
maybe two even because a lot of cars are
going that way now as far as the stereo
system goes though this is another
problem I have with this car
I think this audio system sounds
terrible the base of the mids are okay
they're way you expect in an economy car
a compact car but the highs are just
terrible I couldn't even listen to music
on there the highs are so bad I actually
turned down the treble to make it sound
better now fortunately in the 2014
version of the Tiguan volkswagen is
going to start offering its Fender audio
system and that's
actually one of the best audio systems
we've heard in a compact economy car now
of course we also have a Bluetooth
hands-free phone system and this is
pretty decent you can get all your your
phonebook and recent calls and stuff
like that from the same kind of circular
menu the same kind of format as
navigation and as the audio system and
of course you also have a voice command
here now a voice command here only works
for the phone system it doesn't work for
navigation it doesn't work for the audio
system so again it's kind of a limited
phone system most of the cabin tech in
the Tiguan most of Volkswagens cabin
tech it's pretty basic they're not
pushing any boundaries here they cover
some good bases but it's not the best
stuff now of course we also have the one
choice only automatic transmission here
this is a six-speed automatic
transmission this is Volkswagens
Tiptronic system it has the ability to
like manual shift and it's got a sport
mode but it's not there DSG automated
manual which is kind of a nicer nicer
transmission it's a decent transmission
for what this car is and frankly I
prefer driving around in sport mode most
of the time because it gave us thing a
little more oomph psi that means turbo
stratified injection and Volkswagen
terms that's basically direct injection
with a turbocharger that four speeds air
to the thing also gives it more boost so
we end up with 200 horsepower 207
pound-feet of torque now this engine
gets this car an EPA rated 20 miles per
gallon city 26 miles per gallon highway
in real world driving I've been seeing
low to mid 20s so that's probably where
you gonna get with this car
behind the wheel there are a couple
things that I like about the Tiguan and
a lot of things I don't first of all I
do like the size of this car if you feel
like you've got good maneuverability it
it's easy to kind of jog between lanes
or parking spaces or you know turn
around in city streets pretty easily
it's not bad also this steering this is
electric power steering boost and at low
speeds it feels kind of over boosted so
it's really easy to turn the wheel at
high speeds it actually firms up a bit
so you get a little more heft to the
wheel and doesn't move around as easily
but now the things that I don't like
about this car the engine I don't know
it should be enough to endorse power
tuning sometime feet of torque but it
just doesn't seem to have the kind of
oomph you want especially if you
accelerate you got to wait a little bit
then it tries to charge forward does a
pretty convincing job once it gets
moving but it takes a little while to go
the final thing that I'm just not crazy
about the Tiguan is the ride quality
it's fine on smooth roads but once you
get on slightly rough roads it just kind
of goes all the hell you can feel a lot
of jarring a lot of harshness it really
should be better I'm surprised it isn't
because this cabin has sort of a premium
feel and
I don't know going over rougher roads it
just just uncomfortable the base model
of the 2013 Volkswagen Tiguan thanks for
about twenty three thousand dollars this
SEL model goes for thirty-seven thousand
one hundred and thirty dollars that's
pushing forty thousand dollars although
you do get all the equipment you get the
navigation system all the electronics
leather seating and that big panoramic
sunroof I wouldn't buy this car
I would wait for the 2014 Volkswagen
Tiguan which is going to be cheaper and
Volkswagens going to offer with the
fender audio system in the upper trim
levels</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
