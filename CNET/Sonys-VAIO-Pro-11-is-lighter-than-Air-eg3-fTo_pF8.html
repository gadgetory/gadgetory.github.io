is a look at one very nice ultra
portable the sony vaio pro 11 at 1.9
pounds the pro 11 is one of the lightest
Windows 8 laptops around even with its
power adapter it only weighs two and a
half pounds which is definitely great
for anyone that has to travel with a
laptop daily as is its carbon-fiber body
which should help it take some abuse
ports are limited though but Sony did
build an extra USB port into the power
adapter for charge of a mobile device
open the lid and you'll find a 1080p IPS
touchscreen LCD a backlit keyboard and a
fairly large click pad considering the
size of the system the keyboard is small
but Sony didn't do anything weird with
the key sizes so it's pretty comfortable
to type on and again the click pad is a
good size too and works well though
being so close to the screen you might
just end up using that for things like
moving files and windows around inside
the base model which is priced at about
eleven hundred and fifty dollars you'll
get a fourth gen Intel Core i5 low-power
processor integrated graphics 128 gig
solid state drive and four gigs of
memory it's not a lot of power but it's
enough for ordinary day-to-day tasks and
it has no problem smoothly playing back
1080p video battery life is the big
thing here though the new processor
helped keep it running our video
playback test for six hours and although
the battery is internal soda has a sheep
battery that attaches on the bottom that
basically doubles that battery life all
in all this is an excellent little
laptop I'm Josh Goldman and that's the
sony vaio pro 11</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
