doctor I like to call Rick Reuter
doctors in the house yeah what do you
got today yeah so today I want to ask
you a question Bridgette can your phone
do this are you David Copperfield how is
that floating in your hands yeah so this
is actually a pretty simple item it's
called the ninja loop and just like it
sounds it's a loop that kind of straps
onto the back of your phone case and it
gives you a great way to grip your phone
and also to use it one-handed it serves
a couple of different very useful
purposes for one makes it a lot harder
for you to drop your phone which is
something that was never hurst today
with today's giant screen phones you
know it's kind of hard for your thumb to
reach all corners but when you have the
phone loop in place now I can get my
thumb all over the phone one-handed I
have seen cases that do this I've
actually been tempted by the case that
has the built-in slot but here I guess
you can get whatever case you want and
then like I guess what how do you do do
you like stick it in yeah you literally
loop it around through the hole it's a
3m so I guess that means it's won't
leave any residue or whatever and you
just kind of loop it in up where the
camera is and at the bottom and works
with any case and another thing I love
about this is that it still lets your
phone sit flat and it doesn't get in the
way if you use wireless charging that's
a big one there's a lot of phone gripper
thingies that kind of stick out from the
back like the pop socket or whatever
this lets your phone sit fit flat it can
still charge wirelessly if you have a
magnetic mount in your car just goes
right up like that and doesn't get in
the way how much would you pay for
something like this Bridgette just just
take a guess well when you make it when
you hold it up like that it doesn't
support a fabric with a Barney oh okay I
don't know like I don't want to pay more
than 15 bucks well I got good news for
you so the the ninja loop is only 5
bucks ok that's that's actually a normal
good healthy yeah actually they based
their worried I was worried I was gonna
go like like too low and like
but no that's good yeah so I think if
you buy three you get free shipping on
top of it so gift stocking stuffer just
something for you so pop five bucks a
pop come in all kinds of different
colors good either
I don't gift it and you don't need to
know what kind of phone they have no no
it works with any phone that's in a case
love this is one of my all-time favorite
products and cheapskate deals it's a
super good parent gifts seriously like I
like with a kid I'm always like fumbling
with one hand this is good all right
well thank you buy more deals you can
find more deals at cnet.com slash
all right thank you Rick thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
