play it on your stereo and not just on
your phone sure you can use a Bluetooth
adapter but the sound quality stinks and
if you walk out of the room with your
phone the music stops the best way to
stream Spotify to another device is with
Spotify connect Spotify Connect works
similarly to Apple airplay and that it
initiates Wi-Fi connections between
compatible devices but instead of using
local music it streams from the net and
you could even switch off the host
device completely and the music keeps
playing Spotify Connect currently works
with PC Mac iOS Android and up to 100
certified audio products but the easiest
way to use it with a stereo system is
either to connect up an old PC or buy a
$50 dongle with an audio output such as
the rocky play or gramophone if you're
using a smartphone app this is how it
works so here we are on the main screen
of Spotify just go to my music the last
thing I've played so what you want to do
is get the main screen coming up the
playback screen which you can get coming
up this way what you're looking for for
Spotify Connect is this little icon down
here it's basically a speaker with a
circle around it that is your Spotify
connect icon you press that and it
brings up all of the devices on the
network and also on the internet that
you're logged into for example this
morass receiver this coming up here is
actually at home so basically if you
want to play back any of these just
click on the device and a place to it
the problem is that you can only play to
one device at once and that's basically
Spotify connects very easy to use and
it's very similar experience on the
desktop as well what you're looking for
is that little icon in the bottom right
hand corner to just circle around the
speaker and that's basically all there
is to it so that's how to use Spotify
Connect I'm ty Pendlebury and for more
