camps next-generation Wi-Fi video
monitoring camera the Dropcam pro if
you've never heard of drop camp it's a
start that's quickly becoming one of the
leaders in DIY home video monitoring the
new camera looks very similar to the
existing drop cam HD which has dropped
the HD part of its name and simply
become drop cam but the pro has a black
stand is a little thicker and has a 6
element all glass lens and a larger
image sensor drop cam says you'll get
two times sharper video during the day
and 7 times better performs in low-light
conditions and at night it also has a
hundred thirty degree field of view
which is 20% wider than what you get
with the standard drop cam drop cam
offers a free app for Android and iOS
devices and you can also access your
camera or cameras from a web browser on
a computer real time monitoring is free
but Dropcam also offers a premium cloud
recording service which starts at 995 a
month or $99 a year for seven days of
continuous recording while the video
resolution currently remains at 720p
with the pro you can definitely see a
significant difference in image quality
and a new software update allows you to
digitally zoom in on parts of the image
up to eight times on the Pro and four
times on the standard drop cam and then
enhance the image after you zoom to
bring back some of the detail loss while
zooming it's very blade runner-esque
those of you who've seen the movie know
what I'm talking about
that zooming feature gives you the
flexibility to monitor only a portion of
a larger image or to put it another way
monitor a certain part of a room that
means you're less constrained by where
you initially placed the camera and
Dropcam sees this as a way around
providing pan and tilt hardware features
that would make the camera even pricier
along with the improved audio quality in
the pro yes the camera records sound the
other big feature upgrade is the
addition of Bluetooth le which stands
for low energy and is also referred to
as Bluetooth smart having built-in
Bluetooth allows you to set up the
device via a smartphone or tablet
instead of having to connect to your
computer you simply pair the phone to
the camera and then log it on to your
home Wi-Fi network and you're good to go
it's definitely easy and you can add
multiple cameras around the house if you
want they just have to be plugged in to
a power source in the future Dropcam has
plans to add other Bluetooth accessories
such as a temperature sensor that will
connect to the camera which would act as
a hub for other home monitoring devices
I've liked dropcam's DIY video
monitoring solution since it first
launched several years ago and it's only
gotten better as the company continues
to make it more user-friendly and
enhances both the cameras and the
software that powers the free and paid
monitoring services like any wireless
video product it's going to work even
better if you have a reliable Wi-Fi
network and a fast internet connection
that said I've used it with a more
sluggish DSL connection and it mostly
worked fine at $1.99 the Dropcam pro
cost fifty dollars more than the
standard Dropcam which remains on sale
that may be a little pricey for some
people but I do think it's worth paying
the extra fifty bucks for both the
sharper video and Bluetooth feature
which makes setup easier and gives you
the option to add accessories in the
future I'm David Carr noise that's the
Dropcam pro thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
