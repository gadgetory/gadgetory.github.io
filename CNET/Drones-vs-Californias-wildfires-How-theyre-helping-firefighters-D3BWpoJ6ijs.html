fire and widespread devastation hundreds
of square miles of it
drones of a new weapon to help fight the
flames instead of sending ground crews
into dangerous conditions or using
helicopters that can't fly in heavy
smoke drones are taking photos and
sending live videos of fires and their
aftermath Menlo Park fire in California
in the heart of Silicon Valley is one of
the nation's first fire departments to
use drones they're regularly called on
to help fight California's long wildfire
season drones also create detailed 360
degree aerial images to map burned out
areas after the fires pass through with
a drone you can get darn near the same
level of capabilities without putting a
person in an aircraft which is
incredibly expensive
the drones very low cost relative of
what you get back cameras on the drone
give pilots a bird's-eye view so crews
can see things like the hottest part of
the fire whether or not a fire has
crossed a containment line or if people
are in danger in this training demo
pilots use a thermal camera to see
people through smoke inside a five-story
building I'm gonna switch over to
thermal view and suddenly now we can see
that we have at least two individuals
inside this room joins can also measure
wind speed and direction so crews can
predict what a fire might do next
all of our pilots when they're on duty
have these DJI maddox with them and this
one's wrapped so it stands out as a fire
department aircrafts and then we have
you know charger spare batteries that we
keep with it and this is what's on our
engines on a daily basis
Lajja drones are also a key part of the
arsenal they can fly for up to 40
minutes double the time of many smaller
drones as well as cameras they can carry
other items like an LED light to
illuminate a scene at night some of our
drones can carry 10 pounds or more so
the ability to fly things like a life
jacket a radio a space blanket that
could actually make a difference seconds
matter but flying a drone and working
out what's happening on-screen isn't
easy especially if you're in a
high-stress situation like a fire with a
free app called first response from
agb's details like road names we
speed and crew locations are overlaid on
the drone image so pilots don't have to
cross-reference and other maps the
California Air National Guard is using
the mq-9 Reaper this summer it's a
military drone that flies for hours to
identify where the fire has jumped
containment lions and houses in the
fires path the US government has
contracted for companies to fly
fixed-wing drones to fight fires on
federal land this frees up resources
like helicopters foot water drops and
fire crews aren't the only ones flying
drones to fight wildfires some utilities
like San Diego Gas and Electric are
inspecting the power grid from the sky
with drones these third-party drones
have lied out on board similar to the
technology used in self-driving cars and
generate 3d maps of potential issues
like damaged power poles and lines in
the future drones may truly be the first
responders by having a drone
automatically launch go line of sight to
a call sending information back we can
actually evaluate the scene and decide
do we need to escalate our responsive
deescalate or response while over 180 us
fire departments are beginning to use
drones widespread adoption is still up
in the air they're still working out all
the rules with the FAA on how this all
work so we're happy that in this area
were not being ignored having another
set of eyes in the sky
is an invaluable tool to help win the
battle against wildfires and to save
lives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
