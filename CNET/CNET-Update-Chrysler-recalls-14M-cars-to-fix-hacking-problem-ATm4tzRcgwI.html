hackable cars I'm Bridget Carey this is
your scene that update computer security
experts have proved it is possible to
hack a 2014 Jeep Cherokee and take
control of the car remotely over the
internet now just a few days after that
report was published the car maker is
issuing a recall of 1.4 million vehicles
in the United States in order to patch
the software the Fayette Chrysler
company recall includes dodges jeeps
Rams and Chryslers with a certain you
connect touchscreen entertainment system
models made between 2013 and 2015
include this display the hack gained
national attention after being
demonstrated in this video created by
Wired magazine researchers Charlie
Miller and Chris valasek were able to
wirelessly access the cars entertainment
system which connects to the internet /
Sprint's wireless network systems like
these are turning cars into smartphones
on wheels while the Jeep was in motion
and being driven by wired reporter Andy
Greenberg the hackers took control the
steering wheel killed the engine cut the
brakes locked the doors made the
entertainment system go crazy and
eventually even sent the car into a
ditch Chrysler's voluntary recall helps
customers patch the problem with a
software update downloaded to a USB
flash drive the researchers worked with
Chrysler to alert them of the flaw but
get this in the recall notice chrysler
said in a statement that no defect has
been found sopa massive security hole
that lets people access the brakes over
the internet isn't a defect well then
gosh what do you call it a plan feature
you know what how about we just build
cars that keep the entertainment system
on a separate computer from the vital
systems like the engine and brakes what
a concept there's a bill now in the
Senate that asks for regulators to set
some requirements to better protect
consumers from car cyber attacks as cars
become more connected we're opening
ourselves up to more risk in other news
YouTube is updating its mobile app and
announced plans to support 360 degree
video for virtual reality later this
year mobile is making up more than half
of the site's views and it updated the
Android app with a more stream
look and more tools for editing and
uploading right from your phone the
Android app also shows a vertical video
now in full screen mode vertically
instead of forcing you to hold it
horizontally with bars on the side
meanwhile facebook wants to take a piece
of the video business away from YouTube
by encouraging video creators to upload
their stuff directly on facebook
facebook has added several tools for
page owners to manage their video
uploads but unlike youtube facebook
doesn't have a set plan to give video
creators a piece of the advertising
revenue to make money and the experience
of watching video is just different on
facebook people go to youtube to watch
your video on facebook you may just
stumble on it in your feed that's it for
this tech news update there's more at
cnet com from our studios in New York
