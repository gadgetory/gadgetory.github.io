2013 as the year of the great console
wars or the unleashing of google glass
but for me I think of 2013 as the Battle
of the smartphone cameras now the phone
wars used to be waged in number of
processors or screen size but lately
it's all been about megapixels and
designer lenses Donal Bell and in this
top 5 I'll be counting down the best
smartphone cameras ranked by cnet senior
editor Jessica dole court cameras so
good you'll want to smudge them up just
a little bit just to keep your selfies
from frightening people starting off at
number 5 the iphone 5 now Apple was one
of the first companies to really put a
lot of effort into photo quality and
they didn't do it with a lot of BS about
megapixels you know they let the photos
do the talking for everyone else caught
up to apples image processing you used
to be able to pick out the photo taken
by an iphone just by looking at it now
the iphone still is a great camera but
the phone itself is about a year old now
it's one of the oldest ones on this list
we have some catching up to do but if
the rumors around the next iPhone or any
indication camera improvements are at
the top of the list at number four the
HTC One one of my personal favorite
phones of the year and definitely a
phone that puts its camera features up
front you want megapixels how about
ultrapixels how about an image processor
that drinks up light like David
Hasselhoff drinks cheeseburgers plus
they're a bunch of extra shooting modes
you can stitch together action shots
shooting a paparazzi burst mode and even
shoot video and photos simultaneously
great phone great camera and one of the
only reasons anyone is still really
talking about HTC next up at number 3
the samsung galaxy s4 now if we were
just talking about the best overall
smartphones the list would end here this
is one of our favorite phones at the
moment it's an editor's choice and it's
an unqualified recommendation to anyone
who just wants a great phone but it also
happens to have a beautiful 13 megapixel
camera on board along with the suite of
photo features and modes that rival the
HTC One and let's not forget about that
screen one reason people like shooting
on a smartphone so much
these big screens make it so easy to
show off pictures the 5-inch HD AMOLED
screen on the s4 can add pop to even the
most boring brunch photo so how do you
improve on that well at number two the
Nokia Lumia 1020 now here's a phone that
is truly reaching out to stab the point
and shoot camera in the back this is a
beautiful freak of a phone with a giant
sensor capable of shooting up to 41
megapixels now this isn't just another
meaningless battle of pixels nokia is
smart they take those extra pixels and
use the information to intelligently
process it down to a more manageable 5
megapixel image that will knock your
socks off that i mention that it's a
windows phone seriously if you want
something that's as quirky as your
tumblr blog the Nokia Lumia 1020 is your
phone but our number one smartphone
camera goes to the newest kid on the
block the samsung galaxy s4 zoom not to
be confused with the s4 mini or the s4
active or the s4 Google edition the s4
zoom slaps a real point and shoot camera
system on the back of your phone with a
10 times optical zoom is it skinny no
but you've got a 16 megapixel backside
illuminated CMOS sensor on the back and
the optics and the settings of a real
camera the rest of it is an Android 4.2
lovefest you are looking at the
successful mating of a phone and a
camera it's not the prettiest thing in
the world let us enough to keep it out
of the Freak Show so there you go 5
smartphones that are spelling the end
for the pocket camera for more
