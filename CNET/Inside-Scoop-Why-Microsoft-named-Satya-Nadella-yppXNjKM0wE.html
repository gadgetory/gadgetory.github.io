editor of news calm thanks for joining
us Charlie
Microsoft has just named its brand new
CEO to replace Steve Ballmer Satya
Nadella
tell us a little bit about the man well
he's a up-and-comer he's a 22 year
veteran of Microsoft a very technical
and accomplished executive a bit of the
Bill Gates more of the Bill Gates mold
and Steve Ballmer and his appointment is
being welcomed by the rank and file as
well as by the outsiders who've been
waiting after nearly six months of this
ongoing endless search to replace Steve
Ballmer let's break that down a little
bit
first of all 22-year veteran why do you
think Microsoft looked inside versus
looking outside of the company well we
did both okay there were over the last
several months instances they at one
time attempted to to lure in the CEO of
Ford Alan Mulally that went nowhere
the CEO of Ericsson was also mentioned
as a candidate but Microsoft is very
much like the New York Yankees in 1927
they've got an excellent bench and such
and Adella was one of the many people
that they were looking at what would
recommend him for this job is that he's
an insider he knows where the skeletons
are buried he doesn't need to be
reintroduced to a culture corporate
culture that is not familiar with people
know what to expect and he knows where
the problems are and presumably he can
lead them to that Nirvana that they're
hoping to arrive at and you mentioned
that he's a technical guy a little
closer to gates than Ballmer explained
some of his technical background and why
that is such an asset sure well he made
his chops by doing a very accomplished
job as the head of the server and tools
business more recently helping to push
them into the cloud where Microsoft now
even though they got off to a uncertain
start they now compete against Amazon
that's a big business he understands
that Microsoft can't keep doing what it
had been doing up until recently with
Windows being the franchise
he needs to move the company in a way so
that it can navigate successfully in
this increasing world of mobility and he
understands that very well moving
forward where do you see Nadella moving
this company as far as like products and
you know consumer facing businesses well
he has to make some decisions sooner
rather than later primarily what to do
with the Xbox business and what to do
with being the search business several
months ago you started to see this
drumbeat from the investor community and
from outside shareholders looking to
increase shareholder value
you're a publicly traded company there
have been calls concentrate on what you
do best which is the enterprise get rid
of this consumer stuff they're probably
any number of potential buyers I'm not
sure that he's going to come in to break
it up Bill Gates who had a big hand in
this selection didn't want to choose a
new CEO who was going to deconstruct his
handicraft so remains to be seen and
speaking of Bill Gates he's going to
even play a bigger role with the company
now that Satya is CEO is that correct
one third of his time he says will be
spent with Microsoft it's a good thing
for Nadella because he won't Gates will
no longer be on the board so Nadella
will not be in this potentially
uncomfortable position where they
convene a board meeting and staring
Amethi of at him from the other end is
the legend himself but who better to
bounce technical ideas off than the
co-founder of the company so to bring
back a baseball metaphor would you say
that this is a homerun selection I would
say right now it's a three bagger but
TBD we'll see all right thank you so
much executive editor news.com Charlie
