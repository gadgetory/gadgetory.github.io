idea you know that can't be just
contained by two movies thirty four
thirty years ago like especially now
with all the stuff we could do with
special effects and all that
it just felt remiss to not play with it
again and to bring it to a new
generation to give them their own
ghostbusters
we are huge fans of the original and it
really wanted what would we be bummed if
we didn't see yeah and it was that kind
of easily kind of tells you like what I
liked along my god we gotta have proton
packs and ghost traps and slime and
slime or you know and then you just kind
of take it from there
I wanted to make it our own but I wanted
to keep the feel of the original one so
I've always loved that era of Cadillac
and those lines or mines me the cars my
dad had and it just felt right it felt
right they think we had a bunch of cars
and they sent and I was like that's the
one it's that just spoke to me yeah at
first I was very surprised just cuz I
thought people were gonna be so happy
just to have another ghostbusters coming
and I didn't expect sort of the level of
shock from certain part of the
population that just had a problem with
women but then also just another part of
the population it just kind of went uh
why are you remaking this movie which I
understand I understand the passion
because I think if I wasn't doing if I
hadn't done it myself I would have been
nervous if somebody else was doing it
what's so fun with working with funny
women is that it does make every genre
you look at kind of take a different
turn because do they just haven't been
done with with women and just selfishly
I love working with funny
oh gosh that's oh that's that's a tough
one you know I've always and I think
they're actually doing it now I always
thought Logan's run with just prime to
be to be rebooted just because it's such
a great story so but I think somebody's
doing it do it well don't ruin my
childhood</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
