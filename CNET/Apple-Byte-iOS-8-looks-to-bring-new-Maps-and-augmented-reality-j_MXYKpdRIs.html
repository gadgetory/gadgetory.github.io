welcome to the apple buy for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
iOS 7.1 is officially out and brings a
whole bunch of improvements in tweaks
now if you've updated to it already
you'll notice iOS 7's animations are
snappier and things like the slide to
power off or the buttons in the phone
app have been revamped Siri now allows
you to manually control it by holding
down the home button when you speak and
releasing it when you're done the
calendar has an option to display events
in the month view finally there's also
an auto HDR setting for the iPhone 5s
camera that only takes an HDR version of
the picture went into text that it's
optimal to do that now iOS 7.1 also
improves touch ID recognition and
there's plenty of other smaller tweaks
so far I'd say this is definitely worth
the update but the most annoying feature
is how they change the coloring of the
caps locks button and I might be stupid
but it's actually just more confusing
try typing a sentence that has
alternating words with capitalization
and you'll see what I mean and that's a
bad apple unless I'm actually stupid but
come on iOS 7.1 is old news already
after being out for a few days in a new
report by 9to5 mac says that app will
bring a more polished Maps app in iOS 8
their sources say apples database for
iOS maps will be upgraded with enhanced
data so it's significantly more reliable
thanks to acquisitions of several
companies like broad map embark and
Hopstop new points of interest and new
labels will make places like airports
parks and bus stops easier to find and
the biggest change will be bringing back
public transit directions that will be
deeply integrated into the new maps
application now the report also says the
Bega has begun work on augmented reality
functionality that uses the iPhones
compass hardware to visually see nearby
points of interest this feature is
likely to surface down the road and not
anytime soon and we shouldn't forget
that Apple received a patent for this
functionality in 2011 now in more iOS 8
News 9 fi mac also reports that Apple's
can
sidering making iTunes radio its own
standalone application to boost usage
and compete against standalone apps the
concern is that since it's just a tab in
the music app it doesn't have a promoted
presence in iOS 7 and that's hurt its
growth for the service because they're
not getting enough advertising revenue
now the number one reason why I use it
over pandora is because it's integrated
with my music collection yeah dum-dums
now Apple can complain all they want but
a report from Edison research shows that
in less than six months after its
release iTunes radio has become the
third most popular music streaming
service in the u.s. trailing behind
Pandora and just behind I Heart Radio
but still beating out Spotify they're
nowhere close to the top swap but it's a
good bet they'll take over the number
two spot in the next six months with or
without a standalone app I'll write new
job listings from Apple's could be
setting up future generations of the new
Apple TV to include cameras for
gesture-based motion controls according
to Apple Insider available positions for
Apple's camera software team revealed
that alongside the products like the
iPhone and the iPad they also included
the currently camera list Apple TV
remember now apple acquired primeSense
in late 2013 and there the company
responsible for the tech behind
Microsoft's first generation Kinect
motion controls on the xbox 360 the
multiple reports still say a new Apple
TV could be revealed as soon as April
with the launch in the fall but we'll
find out soon enough if motion controls
are part of this upcoming generation of
the Apple TV all right to the quick
bytes carplay was all the buzz with its
integrated systems for almost all the
major car manufacturers but according to
a macrumors article pioneer is looking
at the possibility of implementing
carplay compatibility with both its
existing and future aftermarket
navigation and audio systems there's
been no official statement from pioneer
but it would save a lot of headache for
people who have wanted to do a custom
ipad installation on their car and I'd
be one of those people also Apple has
received its final approval for its
massive forty four foot tall sliding
glass door Union Square apple store in
San Francisco Apple can now begin
construction just three blocks away from
their existing San Francisco store
and in a Wall Street Journal interview
at South by Southwest the big geek we
call Shaquille O'Neal told them that he
spends about one thousand dollars on
apps every week a week now this week it
was deer hunter games and he really
wants an iWatch as well but I've got
nothing but love for You Shaq daddy he
was the first verified user on Twitter
but he recently launched an indiegogo
campaign to make a sequel to the
original shaq fu' game called shaq fu' a
legend reborn he's trying to raise four
hundred fifty thousand dollars to make
that happen but you know the man has
enough money to do it himself especially
if he's spending over 50 G's a year on
apps come on Shaq that's a bad apple ah
but please don't do this to my face
all right let's get to the winners of
our Steve Jobs figure giveaways we asked
you who are the two WrestleMania seven
wrestlers from a couple episodes back
and the correct answers were two of my
all-time favs Hulk Hogan and yes the
ultimate warrior now lots of ladies got
in on this one so congrats to our email
winners autumn will hide and Dimitri who
says after a long day he will cuddle
with Steve and watch the apple byte
Dimitri you have serious issues and our
Twitter winners Wilson gell and Jacob
ziga loose key who says he will dress
Steve like a Barbie doll and replace it
with one of his sister's Barbie dolls
which means you actually want a Barbie
doll all right congrats to all of you
and we will be in touch that's going to
do for this week's show email us at the
Apple by to cnet com or tweet me and
I'll do my best to get back to as many
as I can i'm brian Tong thanks so much
for watching and we'll catch you guys
