for the company in a very tight battle
of minivans and for 2014 against a
number of tech and engineering upgrades
sums of won some ridiculous let's drive
this 2014 Odyssey Touring elite top of
the stack and check the tech now
identifying a 14 Odysseys not too hard
because they've done a mid cycle
revision aluminum hood different lines
around the face
quite a few different feature lines on
the body what happened here and there's
a vast gutter back here for the slider
hinge more visually than you normally
see on minivans and then it all kind of
comes to this unpleasant end so if you
do like this it's kind of an attractive
minivan now inside the Odyssey it feels
like a minivan should it's spacious it's
got my favorite thing about minivans
armrest I love these and you've got the
full stack head unit in this car because
it's a Touring elite that means we have
navigation standard for example they've
made some improvements in the look of
the map the logic of using it hasn't
changed but the look is at least a
little more on par with a 2014 model
year car see my video on the fit evie to
see how I feel about the previous
generation this is getting a little
better what I also like is they seem to
have cleaned up some of the logic here
where when you do an address on this
vehicle it shows up only in one place on
some previous Honda's with this
split-screen duo you had keyboards on
both still gets a man that's going on
with things like radio that don't really
sync up they're not on the same screen
of selections and as you move one around
the other one doesn't track this is an
excessively complicated system that
looks good I like the idea of a local
touch control panel but they've got to
simplify I'll point this out this is one
of the very few Honda's that has HD
radio and it's included standard because
it's high trim lots of Honda's are
missing that if you care now as you can
here we've got rear camera and sonar
standard in this vehicle and I've got a
multi angle on that camera I can get an
extreme down view a wide view and a mid
view and you've got distance bars as
well that's important in a big vehicle
like this that is typically owned by
someone who has children
Aires and the neighbors kids running
around in the driveway in the front
yards that's a big deal in terms of more
interesting audio sources you've got
some hard drive space 16 gigabytes
you'll never use and you've also got
Pandora and AHA as you're streaming apps
that's it for connected car in this
vehicle now back here is a wonderland of
entertainment technology standard on the
touring elite is this Giganta super wide
drop-down LCD screen and this wireless
remote that goes with it you can split
this guy to have one screen or two you
can choose an HDMI for example on the
other side DVD from the deck up there on
one side and of course you get nothing
on one side because nothing ever works
that well does it for some reason the
HDMI port is way back in the third row
hooked up to that and then I came in
through Apple's adapter to an iPad but I
get nothing and your kids are gonna be
really mad when this doesn't work so if
you're really counting on this being
your solution to long road trips bring
your mobile and your cable and make sure
this is gonna work for you real buggy
for us now minivans I don't need them
good if you can't carry lots of stuff in
it right so let's see what this Odyssey
does in that respect we have power doors
everywhere as you probably noticed too
on the side on this big old tailgate
back here here's a big old storage well
when you've got it in three row
configuration lots of you have asked how
easy is it to move seats on these
minivans well here's how they do it on
this guy you pull this strap pull the
whole seat down you can lift those seats
forward and remove them in the second
row and if when you get these down there
cover with all kinds of filth that your
kids didn't tell you they were putting
back there you're in luck because the
Touring elite comes with if you heard
about it the vacuum cleaner
now under the hood is pretty
garden-variety Honda stuff and that's
not a bad thing three and a half liter
v6 sitting sidesaddle no tricky stuff no
direct injection no turbo something like
that obviously the numbers 248 horse 250
foot-pounds of torque this vehicle
weighs something around 4,600 pounds in
this trim yet it gets 260 and a little
over seven and a half seconds that's
pretty good while still delivering 1928
mpg which is also pretty good a lot of
quieting and noise vibration and
harshness technologies here for example
this engine sits on active engine mounts
it sort of intelligently counteract the
engine's own weird harmonics to cancel
them out before they get transferred
into the body shell inside the car
you've got active noise cancellation as
well as I mentioned front-wheel drive
only on this guy 6-speed automatic
that's also new this year you want
all-wheel drive go shop somewhere else
now under way you've got a variety of
technologies helping you drive this big
ol thing there's lane departure warning
tech you've also got a collision
mitigation warning again it's passive
but it's gonna blink this big old brake
light right there on the dash if you're
closing on someone in front and about to
hit them and on this Touring elite top
model only you've got passive blind spot
tech from some lately the bitty little
warning lights over in the mirror that I
don't find it very useful The Odyssey
drives better than a whole bunch of
smaller sedan and coupe cars that we get
in here it's got a responsive powertrain
the suspension is firm enough without
being hard I found this vehicle
perfectly Pleasant if not nice to drive
if I have any grave since that the
steering is over assisted especially at
freeway levels it actually makes it a
little more laborious to drive not less
okay pricing our Odyssey is pretty easy
because we have a touring elite just
about everything's included at about 45
3 delivered now on top of that the only
option will get you further seen that
style is remote start for 400 more
installed it the dealer by the way so I
wear it somewhere a little shy of 46,000
dollars you buy an odyssey because it's
perhaps the best driving of its class
and has handsome looks to my eye the
technology is good if not great I've
still got some issues of that navigation
system that split screen interface and
as you can see we had to fight with that
rear screen and didn't get what we
wanted out of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
