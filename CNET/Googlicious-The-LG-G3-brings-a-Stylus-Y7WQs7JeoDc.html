google issues for all the Google
goodness that we can pack inside of a
show now there's not a lot of big big
news but enough to keep you going this
week so what's going to be the big phone
feature pushed by carriers in 2015 well
it's Wi-Fi calling now you might be
thinking isn't it already here and kind
of now t-mobile recently announced their
push to let all their customers make
calls and texts over Wi-Fi as new
smartphones supporting the feature
continue to roll out now this includes
making free Wi-Fi calls to the United
States from anywhere outside the country
Sprint is also offering something
similar with an over-the-air update
currently available to galaxy s4 users
that will support new devices throughout
the year and according to reports AT&amp;amp;T
will be rolling out Wi-Fi calling
support for android phones in 2015 some
phones already support the feature but
it also requires carrier support all
right in the phone world the LG g3 is
arguably the top Android handset on the
market right now but if you're looking
for an alternative to the Galaxy Note
line then you should be paying attention
to the g3 stylus yep it's a g3 with a
pen now the phone will release globally
and debut in Brazil this week followed
by Latin America and Asia but no us love
just yet also Motorola will be opening
up their pre-orders for the new Moto X
this Tuesday September the 16th with a
pure edition of the device being made
available that same day and if you
weren't able to get your hands on a moto
360 pre-order the first time around
sadface Tuesday's the day to try again
also a cc is looking at product
categories beyond just smartphones now
according to Bloomberg they're working
on an Android compatible GoPro like
waterproof camera that can be used to
shoot extreme sports and other
activities instead to feature a wide
angle lens with a 16 megapixel sensor
the design is said to be tube-shaped it
will be equipped with Bluetooth and
Wi-Fi capabilities and will work with
both Android and Apple now based on an
artist's rendering right now it may look
like this but we might even see it as
early as october the 8th where ACC is
expected to hold an event called double
exposure and no that's not the name of a
new jean-claude van damme flick I'm
sorry there have been plenty of
rumblings at ACC is doing a SmartWatch
but then it might be scrapping it but
Cena reports that the Taiwanese
smartphone maker is indeed planning to
unveil their entry into the wearables
market in early 2015 with all the fierce
competition for a product category that
still no one has asked for I'll write a
couple of Google stories the googs
recently announced the first batch of
Android apps that will be available for
Chromebook users now the language
learning app duolingo the note-taking
Evernote app sight words a way to help
improve your child's reading skills and
find the six-second video clip maker are
all available to download in the Chrome
Web Store right now and it's one of my
favorite tools and apps if you haven't
heard of polar the team from Los Gatos
California with a really slick and clean
interface for making custom poles was
recently acquired by Google and they
will be bringing their talents to the
Google+ team the app will be available
until the end of 2014 and Samsung
continues to go on the offensive with a
batch of ads aimed right at Apple
hitting them hard with topics ranging
from the fact that they've always had a
bigger screen phone a bigger screen

getting a little better a little needs
to be alive I need a faster charging
