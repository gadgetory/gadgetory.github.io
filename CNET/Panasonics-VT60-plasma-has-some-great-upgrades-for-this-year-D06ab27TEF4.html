the CES floor taking a first look at the
Panasonic VT series classroom which is
the successor to last year's VT 50
plasma but this year panasonic has
upgraded it with better blacks you're
also getting richer color and a faster
driver so you're going to get a little
snippy or graphics here it has three USB
ports and three HDMI those USB ports can
be used to connect a harddrive USB thumb
drive and can also be accessed from
Panasonic swipe and share application
for Android and iOS so what you can do
is actually swipe photos and videos from
your phone or tablet directly to the TV
and back the speakers are here on either
side it is a 1 sheet of glass design but
unlike the ZG series there is a slight
gap between the glass and the panel like
most of Panasonic's plasmas it does have
3d and comes with active glasses it also
has a whole suite of apps from VIERA
Connect like Pandora Netflix and Skype
plus there's a Skype camera built into
the TV that pops up with your remote
this TV also comes with Panasonic's new
remote control that includes voice
interaction so you can actually tell
your television to go to a channel or
search for something on the web like
most things at CES we don't yet have
firm availability but Panasonic does say
it will come out April or May at the
latest we also don't have pricing but we
are hoping it stays in the range of last
year's BT series for cnet.com I'm Sharon
