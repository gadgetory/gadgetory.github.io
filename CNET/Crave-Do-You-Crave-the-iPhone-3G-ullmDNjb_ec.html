make-out robot Plus miss natali del
conte in the studio say what's up hello
all that and more on crave what's up
guys are watching crave everything
that's cool quirky and check and
everything that you find here you can
find on our blog at crave dot cnet.com
we've got miss Natali del Conte our East
Coast import hello thanks for joining us
and Natalie you brought something for us
I brought the Sony Rowley
I've been coveting this for a long time
we saw it at CES and then we I just saw
Jasmine Franz do her review of it and I
love it it's a little mp3 player with
speakers and I just haven't had a good
luck with mp3 speakers and this one
dances it's eccentric or eccentric she
said eccentric eggcentric get it should
be here all night ladies and gentlemen
what I got is a concept car from BMW
what they did is they're taking this
idea of a metal frame and then
stretching this textile fabric over the
whole car so it's a lighter car uh-huh
but it's also you know sex I don't know
it's kind of weird though so how do you
watch that I don't know what if a bird
poops on it yeah exactly stains all over
the front I don't know you're gonna have
to do some modeling shots on this I
don't like that yeah exactly
good like lowrider magazine all right
now we all know about the whole iPhone
3G buzz and craze and since we're on
crave we also want to talk about you
know what do we crave or what are we
still craving the new iPhone thoughts I
wanted the camera to get better because
I almost never use the iPhone camera if
I take a picture the quality is just so
crappy that I just feel like I almost
would rather not have that picture no I
want I definitely want the landscape
mode thing yeah I mean you use it it's
it would be so nice to just use that in
emails or text messages and then the one
other thing is like I talked to AT&amp;amp;T but
like every time I call you go straight
to voicemail so I hope it fixes that
feature so maybe I'll pick up my calls
that's a privacy feature that I haven't
stated so for you right now you guys
we're bringing back the trivia for you
all and you've seen that we've done
nicknames for myself and Bonnie on the
show so we got to initiate anatta Lee
and we want you guys to send your
submissions if we get to that we really
like we're gonna put them on air and you
guys have a chance to win these cool hot
cases from guilty couture it's like a
silver stainless steel case we have them
for the touch
and for the first an iPhone so you guys
would be able to get those things right
yeah keep it PG you if you do this you
know now it's time for what you guys all
know in love I'm not gonna do this week
miss Natali del Conte what you got for
do not praise women have it hard enough
these days airbrushing in Photoshop are
the worst things that could possibly
happen to the female image that makes us
real gals feel perpetually inadequate
that's why I was especially disheartened
to hear about Sega's new kissing robot
called the EMA which stands for eternal
maiden actualization this is a feminist
nightmare at 38 centimeters tall the EMA
is known for her glamorous body and high
level of interactivity she hands out
business cards sings dances and walks
like a lady what is that supposed to
mean oh and gets you close and she'll
plant one on you that's right when the
robot detects proximity she waxes
romantic and plants a smooch my female
competition will only launch in Japan
and will cost a hundred and seventy five
dollars but I just don't like the
direction of all this what if the next
generation model can not only sing a
dance but also clean cook and say
flattering things that men need to hear
to inflate their sensitive egos don't we
single girls have it hard enough without
having to compete with robots for that
reason I just got to say not crazy Wow
I want to get one of those like up
immediately
sounds like my best friend no you don't
want that did you did you say the word
single just to like advertise your
status tall but no I'm just saying you
know it's hard for a woman girl now
everyone knows hey hey hey
okay now you did do not crave and I we
wanted to bring kind of something on the
set to find out you know on the spot if
you crave or not crave okay so I'm gonna
stand up you need to stand up with me
okay all right okay so I have this cool
shirt uh-huh it's like these blinds and
it has this like butt string on it but
I'm wondering like what happens if you
pull this string just pull on it and
pull on it pull on it oh so uh what you
crave or do not crave this shirt I'm
going to take do not cry guys
