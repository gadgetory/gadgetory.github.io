make-out robot plus miss natali del
conte in the studio say what's up hello
all that and more on craze what's up
guys are watching crave everything
that's cool quirky and check and
everything that you find here you can
find on our blog at crave cnet com we've
got miss natali del conte our East Coast
import hello thanks for joining us and
Natalie you brought something for us I
brought the sony Rolly I've been
coveting miss for a long time we saw it
at CES and then we I just saw Jasmine
France do her review of it and I love it
it's a little mp3 player with speakers
and I just haven't had a good luck with
mp3 speakers and this one dances it's
eccentric or big centric she said
eccentric eccentric get it should be
here all night ladies and gentlemen what
I got is a concept car from BMW what
they did is they're taking this idea of
a metal frame and then stretching this
textile fabric over the whole car so
it's a lighter car a half but it's also
you know sex I don't know it's kind of
weird though so how do you wash that I
don't know what if a bird poops on it
yeah exactly stains all over the front
it'll work I don't know you're gonna
have to do some modeling shots on this I
don't shop okay looks like that yeah
exactly good like lowrider magazine I
wanna see all right now we all know
about the whole iphone 3g buzz and
crazed and since we're on crave we also
want to talk about you know what do we
crave or what are we still craving the
new iphones thoughts I wanted the camera
to get better because I almost never use
the iphone camera if I take a picture
the quality is just so crappy that I
just feel like I almost would rather not
have that picture no I want I definitely
want the landscape mode thing yeah I
mean you use it it's it would be so nice
to just use that in emails or text
messages and then the one other thing is
like I talked to 80 but like every time
I call you go straight to voicemail so I
hope it fixes that feature so maybe I'll
pick up my calls that's a privacy
feature that I haven't stated so for you
only right now you guys we're bringing
back the trivia for you all and you've
seen that we've done nicknames for
myself and Bonnie on the show so we got
initiated Natalie and we want you guys
to send your submissions if we get to
that we really like we're going to put
them on air and you guys have a chance
to win these cool hot cases from guilty
Couture it's like a silver stainless
steel case we mav them for the touch
and for the first gen iphone so you guys
will be able to get those things right
that's kind of yeah keep it PG keep it
PG this you know yes you clean now it's
time for what you guys all know love i'm
not going to do this week miss natali
del conte what you got for do not praise
women have it hard enough these days
airbrushing and photoshop are the worst
things that could possibly happen to the
female image that makes us real gals
feel perpetually inadequate that's why I
was especially disheartened to hear
about Sega's new kissing robot called
the EMA which stands for eternal made an
actualization this is a feminist
nightmare at 38 centimeters tall the EMA
is known for her glamorous body and high
level of interactivity she hands out
business cards sings dances and walks
like a lady what is that supposed to
mean oh and gets you close and she'll
plant one on you that's right when the
robot detects proximity she waxes
romantic and plants a smooch my female
competition will only launched in japan
and will cost 175 dollars but i just
don't like the direction of all this
what if the next generation model can
not only sing a dance but also clean
cook and say flattering things that men
need to hear to inflate their sensitive
egos don't we single girls have it hard
enough without having to compete with
robots for that reason I just got to say
I'm not crazy wow I want to get one of
those like immediately sounds like my
best friend no you don't want that did
you did you say the word single just to
like advertise your status tall but no
I'm just saying you know it's hard for a
woman yeah I got that for a girl now
everyone knows hey hey come okay now you
did do not crave and I we wanted to
bring kind of something on the set to
find out you know on the spot if you
crave or not crave okay so I'm gonna
stand up you need to stand up with me
okay all right okay so I have this cool
shirt uh-huh it's like these blinds and
it has this like but string on it but
I'm wondering like what happens if you
pull the string just pull on it as a
full-on it's pull on it Oh so uh what
you crave or do not crave this show i'm
going to take do not curse oh sorry
we'll see you guys thank you thanks for
