finds it in an instant a whole slew of
ipods are coming your way a sony vaio
desktop that's a real stinker and the
best free games for the palm pre yes the
palm pre it's all coming up right now
hi everyone in Mollywood and welcome to
the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's that in the
world of tech and offer some
life-changing tech wisdom in the form of
the bottom line let's get started with
the good on wednesday google announced a
new search feature that they're calling
Google Instant Tom crozet from cnet news
was on hand to get a demo of the newer
faster google in action so Google
Instant actually gets queries and get
your search results as you type and
brings them to you and streams those
results right to your computer so the
search is entirely interactive the whole
time you're typing so the great thing
about Google Instant is that it as you
are typing the query results start
updating immediately so I want to kind
of paint a situation where perhaps after
this launch I want to go on a vacation
I'm not quite sure where I want to go so
I can type in a query like flights to
and what you'll see here is that we have
our top five predictions for what you
might complete you for flights to hawaii
Vegas Mexico or India and what i can do
is i can just arrow down and see these
results update immediately so I can kind
of browse around I decided I want to go
to London and one thing I've always
wanted to check out in London is this
neighborhood called notting hill so i
type in something like Notting Hill and
you'll see here that again results
update immediately but it becomes very
apparent to me that Notting Hill as i
would type it actually the number one
hit for that would be the reference to
the movie Notting Hill with you grant so
all I need to do to is do a space el to
immediately get to the universal result
for notting hill london well why
wouldn't I have just typed in another
query for long
what advantage does is give me over that
well so you don't actually like well one
you don't have to type these extra
letters um also what we notice is that
sometimes people when it takes an extra
time to go back up to the query box to
complete another or type another search
sometimes you know people get exhausted
you're like well this is what I'm
looking for and so we hope that by kind
of reducing the barrier to perform
another search by making it all up that
dynamically that people will actually be
more interactive with their queries and
and the things that are looking for to
get the result that they want do you
think people will find this distracting
at all um so we've run a lot of teaser
tests and actually it turns out that
very many users actually well when you
first started didn't even notice they're
just like all of us unlike wow those
results that were there really fast and
we really tried to optimize the design
so it wasn't distracting google claims
that their new instant search feature
can save users to 25 seconds per query
happy what am I gonna do with all that
time I'm saving perhaps enjoy my new
ipod all right I don't actually have a
new ipod yet but there are certainly a
lot of them to choose from luckily
Donald Bell has reviewed them all we'll
save the ipod touch for a little later
but here's a look at the new nano the
shuffle and brian tongs overview of the
new iOS 4.1 update hey I'm Donald Bell
and today we're taking a first look at
the 6th generation apple ipod nano comes
in seven colors and two capacities an
eight gigabyte model for $149 and a 16
gig version for 179 compared to the
previous model they've chopped off the
click wheel shrunk the screen and oddly
they've ditched the video camera that
they made such a big deal about last
year they've also put a clip on the back
similar to the ipod shuffle and on the
top iya buttons for volume and a screen
lock now to make up for the missing
click wheel Apple is using a tiny touch
screen that measures about 1 inch square
you get little icons similar to the
iphone that control music playback
photos radio a pedometer and even a
clock the screen lets you browse your
music collection by flicking up and down
and you can also back out of menus by
flicking back
you can even reorient the screen by
pinching two fingers together and
twisting it around it's fun to play
around with such a unique in small
touchscreen but I gotta say for all its
novelty the new interface isn't much
better than the click wheel in any
practical way if anything is more
difficult to operate by feel which is
kind of important if you're actually
using this while driving or exercising
I'll hand it to Apple though for finding
a way to make the smallest nano yet but
i also have a hard time believing that
anyone really thought the last version
of the nano was too big plus at half the
size you're also getting half the
features there's no video playback no
camcorder games calendar notes contacts
or alarm clock that said i have to admit
the features you do get are fairly
incredible for such a small size the
main focus here is music and you should
get around 24 hours of music playback
from a single charge you get icons for
your music library playlists genius
mixes as well as shortcuts for artists
album songs genres composers audiobooks
and podcasts you can customize the
arrangement by pressing and holding any
icon and shifting it around there's also
a shake to shuffle feature that you can
turn on or off in the settings menu that
can play a random selection of songs
when you give the player a shake beyond
that you also get a built-in radio which
has the unique ability of pausing live
broadcasts for up to 15 minutes you can
also rewind anything you hear on the
radio which is pretty cool photos on
such a small screen are really just for
fun and you can't set your own image as
a wallpaper under settings though you
can go back and swap out the wallpaper
from one of apple's own designs there's
a fitness app that includes a pedometer
and there's also support for the nike+
fitness system but you'll need to plug
in the nike receiver into the 30-pin
dock connection or to make that work
another hidden features voice memos
which you'll only see if you plug in a
compatible headset with a microphone the
same goes for Apple's voiceover feature
which will announce track information
for you if you have a pair of headphones
with a compatible remote control the
headphones bundled with an a notice your
plain old Apple earbuds which we
strongly recommend upgrading from for
the sake of sound quality but also for
the sake of extra features a remote also
gives you the ability to skip and
songs without looking at the screen
which is really useful if you're using
this for exercising last but not least
there's the clock it's an analog clock
face and we have to believe that
manufacturers are going to find some
creative way to turn this thing into a
watch by flicking on the screen you also
get access to a stopwatch and a timer so
that's the sixth generation apple ipod
nano the smallest nano yet but
definitely a step backwards in terms of
ipod features if you're not sold on the
small size the cool little touch screen
or the unmistakable apple design you can
stretch your dollar a lot further with
an older model or going with an ipod
alternative for CNN com on Donald bell
hey there guys and gals brian song here
with sina com an iOS 4.1 will be
available shortly but we have it here so
we wanted to show you the new goodies
that you guys can look forward to now
the most popular one that you'll
probably be using is taking high dynamic
range photos if you go into your camera
app in iOS 4.1 you'll see a button that
says HDR off to use the feature turn it
on take a picture and we'll take a high
dynamic range photo but it will also
save a version of the picture without
the effect HDR photography combines a
series of photographs shot at different
exposures one is underexposed where
everything is darker and one is
overexposed where everything is lighter
so it takes the best parts of these
photos they're put together into one
that brings out the details in both the
shadows and highlights now I took
several shots to show you the feature in
action but some photo purists don't like
the effect because it can feel fake to
them and it sometimes even appears
grainier now if you only want to save
the HDR version of the photo jump into
your settings then go to photos and
there's an option you can set to keep
normal photo so you can turn that on or
off you'll also get Game Center in iOS
4.1 which is a social gaming network it
has game invites leaderboards and
achievements so you guys can think of it
like xbox live on your idevice for free
you can tell this hasn't been released
to the public yet because Apple is still
using it Street lingo and there are no
game center games available at the
moment but this is another feature that
I can't wait fo now in the itunes app
Apple's music social network called ping
is fully integrated into the experience
so I can follow artists or friends at
the moment I can't search for people to
follow on the mobile app I can
people already following me or I can
follow the few artists that are featured
but I'm not really desperate enough to
add yo-yo ma just yet so it looks like
you'll need to use itunes on your
computer to really get the full
experience another new feature in the
itunes app is having the ability to now
rent TV shows directly from your iOS
devices with the update and one feature
that I've been waiting for is getting
the ability to now upload HD videos that
you've taken to youtube and mobileme
over Wi-Fi I'm Brian song for cnet com
and there's your first look at iOS 4.1
before releases hey I'm Donald Bell and
say we're taking a first look at the
fourth generation apple ipod shuffle
this is Apple smallest most basic ipod
offered with two gigabytes of storage
and priced at forty-nine dollars it
comes in five colors and includes a pair
of basic earbuds and the USB headphone
jack adapter for syncing and charging
with your computer this is a return to
form for the shuffle made a detour last
year with this buttonless design but now
it looks very similar to the popular
second-generation model aside from the
obvious play pause skipping volume
controls on the front all the other
controls are located on the top of the
player there's the power switch that
also works to set the mode between
shuffled and sequential song playback
there's a headphone jack which is also
used for charging and syncing music
there's a tee tiny battery indicator
light and finally there's a new button
which triggered as a voiceover feature
now voiceover is a very cool feature and
it's a carryover from last year shuffle
it gives you the ability to figure out
what song is currently playing and more
importantly it allows you to navigate
between playlists genius mixes podcasts
and audiobooks you just press the button
wants to hear the artisan song info'
neighborhood number 1 tunnels the arcade
fire or hold it down to access the menu
and use the buttons on the front to
navigate through the playlist
Paul songs all pop mix electronica mix
hip hop rap mix this feature is a big
advantage over the first and second
generation shuffles which were basically
only good for playing a random selection
of songs you can now have separate mixes
for your workouts or your morning
commute or use this to play audio books
without worrying that all the chapters
are going to get mixed up the voice-over
feature is also improved from the third
generation model since the button is now
right on the player instead of the
special headphone cable so you can use
any pair of headphones you want finally
let's talk about the clip the clip on
the back feels sturdy and is made out of
the same anodized aluminum as the rest
of the player one complaint we have is
that the smaller square design no longer
leaves room on the front for where the
clip gets pinched as a result when you
clip this on you're probably going to
wind up squeezing the back button by
accident overall it's a surprisingly
decent little audio player with better
sound quality than the second-generation
model it resembles battery life is rated
at 15 hours which for something the size
of a coke button is pretty amazing so
that's it that's the fourth generation
Apple iPod shuffle an incredibly tiny
affordable audio player perfect for
anyone who goes to the gym we like to
travel light for cnet com on Donald Bell
oh the shuffle I'm so glad the buttons
are back all right moving right along if
you're a palm pre owner and you were
kind enough to remind us about the lack
of webos software featured on tap that
app we hear you loud and clear take it
away Brian
oh the sprinkler oh hey guys welcome to
tap that app i am brian Tong and this is
the show recover the hottest apps in the
mobile space then we've heard your cries
to show some love for the webOS so we're
giving it to you with a few of the best
free games on the palm pre and palm pixi
now remember these are free you won't
find many 99-cent games on palms App
Store and you probably aren't looking to
pay over five dollars for any games so
these are a few time wasters that we
found for you now first up if you like
zombies you'll like zombies fury run
around to avoid zombies and tap tap tap
on their heads to shoot them but
whatever you do do not run out of ammo
because if they catch you you're dead
now topple ball mini is also free and
includes 11 levels and has you directing
a ball into a goal using the
accelerometer the full version with 200
levels is 99 cents if you like classic
games check out destroid it pays homage
to asteroids and probably has some of
the best replay value out of all the
free webOS games now this game may not
have the best graphics and it's the
helicopter game it's pretty simple just
hold your finger on the screen to go up
and release it to drop down and see who
can get the furthest and get the highest
score and if you like flying check out
air traffic light a full version will be
released later but here you can direct
planes and helicopters to the proper
landing zones and be the best air
traffic controller you can be so there
are some free games for the palm pre and
pixi that we'd love to tap because
they're absolutely free and if you guys
have any other show ideas apps or dance
moves you'd like to see the other
editors do then send us along an email
to tap that app at cnet com I'm Brian
song thanks for watching and we'll see
you guys next time sprinkler
there you go palm folks don't say we
never gave you anything although you
know if those are the best free games
available you can kind of see why poor
palm isn't on the show much I'm just
saying let's go ahead and take a quick
break but stick around we'll be back
with a whole lot more tech review right
after this and it's about to get ugly
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly digest of all things good and bad
we've seen here at cnet TV and guess
what you are just in time for the bad
this week in the bad we've got not one
but two new products that have earned a
great big thumbs down first up there's
the arrow Dells attempt to re-enter the
smartphone market now it's rare for
Bonnie cha to really tee off on a phone
but this you've got to see hey everyone
I'm Bonnie toss senior editor at cnet
com and I'm here with your first look of
the dell aero for AT&amp;amp;T this android
phone was announced back at the spring
ctia show and it's tells first
smartphone in the US so far I've got to
say I'm not too impressed um I was
hopeful when I first saw the phone's
design it's one of the slimmest and
lightest Android phones I've seen the
date and even though it has a mostly
plastic construction they think it still
feels pretty solid because of the
smaller size of the screen measures just
3.5 inches diagonally but I found that
it was fine for most task and it's also
pretty sharp but navigation is where
things start to go downhill as you can
see the arrow doesn't have the standard
and Android controls below the screen
instead the back button is located here
on the left side and it doubles as the
HOME key when you do a long press on the
right side you get a button that acts
like the menu option on other Android
devices with time I could maybe get used
to it but overall I think it just makes
using the phone harder than it needs to
be I like having quick one touch access
to these shortcuts and I really missed
having a dedicated search key and Dells
custom UI doesn't really add much either
you can have up to ten home screen
panels but there's a very limited number
of widgets also that one screen portrait
keyboard is pretty horrible
unfortunately the news doesn't get any
better when you move on to the phone's
features first of all the arrows ships
running Android 1.5 which is already bad
enough but to make matters worse some of
the basic functions are pretty limited
for example the phone won't pull contact
information from your various counts
like facebook and dima
I could only get my exchange content
synchronized with the phone phone is
also pretty sluggish with just a 624
megahertz processor there were slight
delays when opening apps and it even
gets slower when you're working with
multiple programs open I really wanted
to like the phone and see dill back in
the mobile space but compared to other
smartphones out there the arrow just
doesn't compare even though it's pretty
affordable a hundred dollars with
contract I think it's worth spending
thirty dollars more to get the HTC aria
give you more features and better
performance or if you want to stay
within the hundred dollar price range
you get more out of the palm pre plus or
the older iphone 3gs I'm Bonnie chanting
has been your first look at the dell
aero for 18t the on-screen keyboard is
pretty horrible ouch and that's not all
for the bad next up an all-in-one
desktop from Sony that I'm just gonna
let rich tell you for himself hi my name
is rich brown senior editor for cnet com
today we're going to take a look at the
sony vaio j11 for FX so this is a 699
all-in-one desktop it comes with a 21.5
inch screen blu ray player and it also
has a touch interface that said while
this might seem like a pretty decent
home entertainment pc it's really a
pretty poor value for the dollar there
are a number of other systems in this
price range that have 23 inch displays
and in general the system is very slow
it has a budget cpu and it's the slowest
in its price class so it's definitely
not meant for productivity we also found
that in general it's really under
featured it has a small hard drive poor
connectivity and generally speaking this
is not a very good PC we would
definitely suggest you keep shopping so
starting with the screen this is
actually a 1080p display despite the
fact that is 21.5 inches you can andle
blu-ray disc with no problem the problem
is when you get online we tested with
the number of different video sources
online we went to Netflix we've tried
iTunes the problem though is with
YouTube when we tried to play 1080p
video content it wasn't able to handle
it very smoothly we even updated the
flash player make sure everything was
nice and current and still the system
couldn't quite hack it we mentioned that
this is a touch screen and you can see
there's a little drop-down menu here
give
you a nice big icon dock so you can open
the various apps there's a browser a
couple other sony made media players
nothing to outstanding though and it's
all just pretty easy to ignore or use as
you want the system also comes with a
wireless mouse and keyboard then the
keyboard is pretty obviously based on
Apple's Chiclets key design that's it
that's an attractive design so you
wouldn't really have a problem putting
this system and if keyboard on display
anywhere in your home now look in the
side of this vaio it actually maybe
looks like it has some interesting
features you've got a couple SD card
slots up here you've got analog audio
down here a couple USB ports as well as
a firewire 400 Jack unfortunate that's
about as far as the connectivity options
go you get two USB ports on the back as
well as an Ethernet port but that is it
the system has Wi-Fi built in of course
but there's no TV tuner there's no
e-sata no digital audio outputs and
worse there's no HDMI in HDMI n is great
for an all-in-one because it lets you
connect all kinds of other devices like
a game console or a cable box and it
lets you create a sort of a
self-contained home entertainment unit
now we forgive the system slow
performance if it had an HDMI in because
that would really let you make the
system a pretty powerful home
entertainment setup without that the
system is basically a small screen with
a blu-ray player in a web browser
there's really not a lot here to justify
its high price so overall this is a
definite do not buy recommendation from
us I'm rich brown this is the sony vaio
j11 for FX definites do not buy
recommendation ouch again our guys are
tough that's why they're good but maybe
we should move along to this week's
bottom line before somebody gets hurt
last week Steve Jobs told us the ipod
touch is the most popular iPod well
here's da Nobel once again to show us
why the latest model will probably
continue that trend and onil Bell and
today we're taking a first look at the
fourth generation apple ipod touch a
cnet editors choice for three years in a
row this isn't a radical departure from
the ipod touch we know and love but
there are some noticeable improvements
in terms of price you're looking at
three different models and a gigabyte 32
gig and 64 gig version price at 229 299
and 399 all of the hardware features
from the previous versions have been
preserved you still have a 3.5 inch
capacitive touchscreen only now it's
using Apple's higher resolution retina
display there's a home button on the
bottom a screen lock at the top though
now the button is shifted from the left
to the right and you have controls for
volume on the side here but there are
now two different distinct buttons
instead of one single rocker switch on
the bottom of you have a headphone jack
a dock connection and a teeny tiny
speaker grille if you take a look at the
back you'll notice two things first the
chrome steel doesn't bulge out quite as
much as the previous version giving a
slightly thinner profile a lighter feel
and the ability to lay flat on the table
without wobbling but the really big
change is the camera lens up here at the
top along with this little
omnidirectional microphone this is an HD
video camera that can capture 720p
footage at 30 frames per second just
like the iphone you can use the built-in
editor to trim your video clips or spend
an extra 499 on iMovie app with more
advanced features the camera takes still
frames too but the camera quality isn't
nearly as good as the iphone 4 now if
that weren't enough Apple is also giving
you another video camera on the front
with a lower resolution you can use this
same camera for snapping self-portraits
but its main purpose is for making video
calls using apple's facetime app by
using email addresses instead of phone
numbers you can make free video calls
over Wi-Fi to other compatible iphones
or ipod touches it's a cool feature
it works well an apple puts the new app
right here at the top of the menu under
the hood you have a few significant
improvements which have trickled over
from the iphone 4 including an a4
processor and a gyroscope sensor for
detailed three axis motion control in
games and other apps you also have
support for 802 11 and Wi-Fi and
existing support for bluetooth 2.1
compare it against the iphone 4 you
don't get the phone the five megapixel
camera gps or a 3g data connection but
you also don't have to deal with
contracts the rest of the ipod touch is
just as you'd expect the core apps for
email web browsing music photos and
video are all better than ever under iOS
for you now the new ability to rent TV
shows games look and perform better than
ever with the internal mic you no longer
need a microphone headset or an adapter
to take advantage of audio recording or
the voice memo app and some third-party
camera and video apps now work as well
so that's the 4th generation apple ipod
touch if you've been waiting to make an
upgrade i really feel that the two
cameras the facetime calling and all the
little performance tweaks really makes
this year's model worthwhile for cnet
com I'm Donal Bell the bottom line this
week an iphone without a contract that's
what Steve Jobs called the ipod touch so
now you can do all the same cool stuff
your friends do with iphones for a lot
less money and that's our show join us
again next week for a brand new cnet
tech review until then there are tons of
great videos available every day at Cena
TV com see you next time and thank you
