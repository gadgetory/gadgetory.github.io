phone you're getting grime and grease
and maybe even bacteria all over it this
is a problem than any owner of a
smartphone or a tablet notes very well
I'm Jessica belcourt from cnet here at
CES 2014 where we just learned about
antimicrobial corning gorilla glass this
is a brand-new product it's nothing you
can really see but what they've done is
they've taken that chemically
strengthened blast they've added silver
ions and the wound care industry in
hospitals silver is often used to handle
microbes other bacteria that get in and
cause a lot of problems so using this in
a phone or a tablet or on other things
that you touch all the time with glass
is really a pretty good idea now to
demonstrate how it works we're going to
take an ordinary smartphone with
ordinary glass on it maybe even corning
gorilla glass and we're going to wipe it
down with some water and use a machine
that measures all sorts of contaminants
in it it could be bacteria that it could
also just be food and other kinds of
grease next we'll do the same test with
the antimicrobial corning gorilla glass
on a device that is often put in
communal areas in this instance it is a
scheduler now this device hasn't been
touched very much only by us so you're
not going to get the real feel of what
it would be like day to day now we've
tested both devices with the
antimicrobial glass and with the regular
corning gorilla glass and the results
were very similar that's probably just
because my fingers touched both of us
but you can't necessarily top from the
test is how much of the gunk is just
priests from my fingers and how much
contains bacteria that can get you and
other people's 6 i'm just a good ball
court christina has been your first look
at antimicrobial corning gorilla glass
you can check out this and other news
