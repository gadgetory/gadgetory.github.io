to count down five reasons you shouldn't
we'll also give you some reasons to take
the plunge just be aware this list could
change after the full review of the iPad
pro let's start with a negative side and
number five is the newish iOS if you're
coming from the previous generation of
iPad pros you might have to do some
learning the iPhone 10 assured in the
era of a gesture-based iOS yes swipey
gestures came to iPads as well but if
you kept using your home button for
things there will be an adjustment
period it doesn't matter how powerful or
fast
the new iPad pros are if you're
struggling to interact with a new
interface at number four is courageous
omissions for whatever reason Apple
ditched is proprietary lightning port
from the new powerful iPad pros if
you've invested in lightning adapters or
lightning cables to charge your previous
iPad both are not directly usable USBC
is now the darling of Apple's I in the
future USBC will be all that's left but
right now it's the present what about
the headphone jack Apple spent a great
deal of time trying to blur the line
between its tablets and more traditional
pcs that seems to be odd since Apple has
kept the headphone jack on its Mac line
of laptops if you want to quietly edit
your creative masterpieces on the new
iPad pro enjoy getting a dongle or using
that pair of bluetooth headphones
because the standard headphone jack is
gone coming in at number three is future
apps Apple had Adobe come onstage and
show off what was called real Photoshop
on an iPad pro that means lots of
control layers and Adobe's wealth of
tools that could be really great
eventually in the future if you pick up
an iPad pro immediately you're not going
to get real Photoshop until next year
it'll probably take other developers
some time to take full advantage of the
new iPad pros so if you're looking to
use the new iPad pro to its fullest
maybe wait a little bit and number two
you got burned did you buy into the
dream of a pro level iPad in the past
and get a keyboard and a pencil I've got
some bad news the smart connector
placement has changed meaning you'll
need a new smart connector keyboard for
the latest iPad pros the older pencil
accessory is not compatible with the new
iPad pro according to Apple site the
original pencil works with the older
iPad pro models oh and that new magnetic
Apple pencil is compatible only with the
redesigned iPad pros before we get to
number one let's talk about reasons to
pick up the new iPad pro that redesign
is sleek and modern the new iPad pro
fits large screens into smaller bodies
making the biggest iPads more portable
Apple also packed in what it called
advanced face ID into the iPad pro this
should make it easier to log into the
device without having to rotate it too
much the move to USBC could be a great
sign for the iPad pro can you imagine
using standard cables maybe hooking up
gadgets easily to the iPad pro we'll
have to see what Apple allows to work
with that port and the best reason to
pick up the newest iPad pro has to be
the internal horsepower the demos at
Apple's events like games Photoshop and
augmented reality looked really slick
Apple packed lots of power into its
latest tablet
there's also Gigabit LTE inside if you
opt for the cell version and now let us
return to the dark side and the number
one reason to stay away from the new
iPad pro is price creep the iPad pro
starts at $7.99 for the base config if
you want more storage than 64 gigabytes
that's gonna cost you if you max out all
the specs on the iPad pro you're looking
at a price tag of one thousand eight
hundred and ninety nine dollars if you
want to use an iPad pro more like a
traditional laptop enjoy shelling out up
to one hundred and ninety nine dollars
for the new smart keyboard folio plus
that new pencil is extra with that kind
of money you can pick up a new MacBook
Air or MacBook Pro so choose wisely
now you can decide whether to plunk down
your hard-earned cash or not Amaya Zach
