upon us but how many more seasons of
Game of Thrones do we have to look
forward to you probably know the game of
thrones TV show is based on a series of
books the Song of Ice and Fire series
and while there are plenty of
differences the crucial plot points of
the TV show closely followed the action
in the books author of the novel's
george RR martin has said that there
will be seven books in total of which
five have already been published broadly
speaking the first two seasons adhere
closely to the first two books a Game of
Thrones and A Clash of Kings but then
things get more complex the seasons
three and four of the show draw most of
their material from book three a Storm
of Swords
so why the departure were the makers of
the TV show just trying to squeeze out
as many seasons as possible not quite
book three is actually a lot longer than
its two predecessors in fact in the UK
it was released in two parts so there
was a lot more for the creators of the
show to work through look for a feast
for crows is shorter although because by
this point there are so many active
characters this novel and part of book 5
covered the same span of fictional time
so expect season 5 to plow straight into
events from a dance with dragons which
is another long book in fact some of the
things teased in season 5 trailers
suggest we'll see events that
narratively
come quite close to the end of a dance
with dragons so these two books could
become one season we don't know when
exactly book 6 and 7 will be released
although we do know they're working
titles and george RR martin has hinted
that each is going to be quite long
which will make them possibly deserving
of two seasons each taking everything we
know into account it seems as if the TV
show is now it's a little under half way
through the Song of Ice and Fire
narrative that Martin wants to weave
suggesting that TVs greatest fantasy
series could reach it's gripping
conclusion in season 9 or maybe 10 of
course there are loads of things that
could throw that estimate off the show
could depart from the narrative
structure of the books something we've
already seen happen in season for HBO
could slow things down to drag the show
out or it could cap things off early
after all
of the network's most iconic shows have
ever run for that many years
whatever happens Game of Thrones has
already been renewed for a sixth season
so the world of Westeros isn't going
anywhere soon thank goodness</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
