microsoft office and picture-perfect
passwords oh you have so unlocked the
secret Oprah to the cube
hey there what's going on I'm rich
demuro with CNN TV and you have stumbled
onto the web's most entertaining tech
lifestyle show hosted by yours truly
let's get you started with your must
click moment I got a bunch of friends
who study in Chicago so I need a network
that works where I live place called
phila where praga cago ATT hoping to
score a viral hit with six spots
directed by Hollywood hotshot director
West Anderson known for Rushmore and the
royal tenenbaums Anderson's AT&amp;amp;T spots
sports some interesting sets along with
wild camera moves that have the
blogosphere a buzz att's new tagline a
network that works where you work guess
I need a network that works in ya
kasturi willis moving through the queue
get it while it's hot obviously feeling
pressure from google docs Open Office
and notepad Microsoft nearly giving away
the latest office software for just 60
bucks the ultimate steal promotion open
to any university student that's defined
as having a valid edu email address and
an active course load of at least wait
for it half a credit for 60 bucks you'll
get a perpetual license to unlock office
ultimate 2007 it has all the goodies
like Outlook PowerPoint Word and Excel
passwords are pretty much the bane of
the online experience and no one was
able to put it into better terms than
the Today Show and their expert sources
a good password has a large amount of
characters combination of numbers
uppercase and lowercase characters and
some sort of little special symbol that
you throw in there as well but what if
you didn't need a password to log in
that's the idea behind b'doop you choose
a few secret picture categories then it
log in you're given a grid with a bunch
of pictures just type in the letters
corresponding to your secret categories
and voila you're in unless someone can
steal your brain they can't get your
passport now the success of this is
going to depend on the support of some
major websites I say good luck now on to
a power play energizer juicing up the
ipod we all know how frustrating it can
be to run out of power on a long plane
ride or a hike so instead of pulling out
a book or getting all chatty with your
friends just plug in your pod to the
energy to go and you're golden the $30
device runs on two double A batteries
and has
course finally the beta how tough has it
gotten to set up a dentist or doctor's
appointment you say a day they come back
at you with the time you're probably at
work or not available and you repeat
this until you found a working time six
months from now not so with zocdoc the
site lets you easily find in book
appointments online and turn your zip
code to get going then refine your
search by selecting your insurance
provider and a date a list of docs and
available times lets you choose with
ease you'd even learn more about a
doctor and rate them it's kind of like
OpenTable for your medical needs now if
they'd only team up with priceline you
can name your own price for a procedure
how cool is that I'm rich Demuro would
see that TV in New York City don't say
it in tell you so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
