painter based here in San Francisco
Facebook invited me to join them on
their recent AR project that Mark
Zuckerberg presented at f8 you know this
is actually this is at least at Facebook
headquarters and you know without I went
to reality this actually just looks like
a blank wall I think the coolest part
was actually thinking about how I can
approach painting differently and how
it's really about space and negative
space and it's rather architectural it
did a lot of sketches where I tried to
think about how the painting could come
off the wall and that was the hardest
part I kept wanting the paint to go on
to the wall and realizing that it could
actually happen right in front of me or
be around me or it could be standing in
it so we basically made kind of a
digital AR painting but the difference
of what you see on camera there is it
wasn't like an animated movie we were
actually making all of the marks you see
there they were physically painted and
then kind of collage into an ARP
I think this project was a really big
stepping-stone for art it could
potentially provide tools for artists in
the future to make something like this
on their own if we could keep pushing
her further and it also kind of changes
the idea of how we experience our you
know we use our phones all the time why
don't we take advantage of that and give
artwork a different component and view
it differently through it through
different lens</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
