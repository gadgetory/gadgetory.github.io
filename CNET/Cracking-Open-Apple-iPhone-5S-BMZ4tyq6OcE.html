hardware upgrades but Apple didn't
change the phone's overall design and
although it isn't the easiest phone to
repair with the right tools and a little
patience it is possible I'm Bill
Detweiler and this is cracking open if
it wasn't for the redesigned fingerprint
scanning home button and larger flash
you'd be hard-pressed to tell the
difference between the iPhone 5 and the
new 5s unless of course you got one with
the new gold finish or the gold finger
addition is I decided to call it and
like the iPhone 5 cracking open the
phone begins by using a special
pentalobe screwdriver to remove the
screws along the bottom edge then using
a suction cup lift up on the front panel
and display assembly from the bottom now
you may also need to use a few thin
tools to pop loose the panel I did also
be extremely careful when removing the
panel not to damage the thin ribbon
cable that connects the home button to
the lower connector assembly you'll need
to disconnect it before detaching the
connectors located along the top edge
and finally removing the panel the
overall hardware layout is the same as
on the iPhone 5 there's a speaker and
docking connector assembly at the bottom
battery along the left side motherboard
along the right and the rear camera and
flash at the top now attached to the
front panel are the display the front
camera and sensors earpiece speaker and
the home button now despite the new home
button being able to scan finger and toe
prints if that's really necessary it can
still be removed and replaced while I
would usually begin our teardown by
removing the battery I'm going to do
something a little different this time
as its glued to the frame I'm going to
leave it in place as I remove the other
components the first component to come
out is the new rear facing camera which
has a new 5 element lens larger pixels
larger sensor and an F 2.2 aperture
after removing a few screws and
standoffs and detaching the remaining
connectors we can lift out the
motherboard now
fortunately the EMI RFI shields that
cover the iPhone 5s s motherboard are
soldered in place obscuring our view of
the new a7 processor and the m7 motion
tracking chip as I want to put this
phone back together in working order I'm
going to leave the shields in place the
last component to come out is the
speaker assembly turning our attention
back to the case we find the battery
along the side the vibration motor at
the top the headphone and lightning
connector assembly at the bottom front
panel clips along the sides and
connector wires just running all over
the place most of these components are
held to the case with both screws and
adhesive if any of these components were
damaged moving them and replacing them
wouldn't be that difficult but I don't
want to risk damaging them during
removal so I'm going to leave them alone
with its new 64-bit processor improved
camera and fingerprint reading
home-button the iPhone 5s is a solid
upgrade to the line and I'm glad Apple
didn't make the phone any more difficult
to crack open than its predecessor I
only wish they would settle on at least
one size screw inside and stop gluing
everything in place those two simple
changes would make repairs much easier
