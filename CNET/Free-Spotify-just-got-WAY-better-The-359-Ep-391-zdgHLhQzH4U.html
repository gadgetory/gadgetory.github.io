dr. J I'm Alfred Eng if you use the free
version of Spotify then your music
listening experience just got better the
music streaming company said Tuesday
it's letting all its users listen on
demand 215 of Spotify's most popular
playlists previously non paying users
could only listen to playlists on
shuffle the app also got a nice refresh
what do you guys think I'm really glad
that they're doing this I'm my only
regret is that they didn't introduce us
before I started paying for Spotify
because a lot of the playlists that
they're letting people listen to for
free like including like discover weekly
you know that's mostly what I listen to
anyway on spots are like the top most
popular songs yeah yeah no no discover
weeklies like they update it every week
based on an algorithm that like oh we
think that you would like this song
based on other stuff oh god is from John
Salzmann story today discover weekly
represents about 750 tracks or 40 hours
of music wow so you can spend a lot of
time just listening to that and be able
to pick and choose and actually put
music on demand right that's that's the
big difference here yeah yeah so you can
also download it if you have premium I
don't know if that'll be available on
the free I don't I don't think to upload
or download yep but songs or what yeah
the old way that the app was done were
like you could only listen to music on
shuffle it was it was terrible was like
a big reason why I decided that I was
just gonna pay for it I mean it was it
was okay for me it was tolerable I mean
I have a list of maybe 20 30 songs I put
a rotation and I just keep refresh but
you're not finding new songs that way
I'm not but I'm also not spending enough
that's like to do that it's like a big
reason why I use Spotify that I use it's
mostly for like new music right real
quick though why do you think they would
want to do this wouldn't it potentially
harm its paying user base well you have
to remember this the the free service is
like I think it's the it's the one
differentiating factor from all the
other streaming music services it's like
the gateway drug to get you into spot to
pay for Spotify and so if they can make
this service more tractors they get more
users and they're doing this at a time
when Apple music is starting to ramp up
its competition it's starting to grow
fast too I think it's really smart to do
discover weekly because in that scenario
I could see you know they find this new
song and then it's like oh I want to
listen
more of this artist oh I can't unless I
have a premium yeah good point next up
Amazon introduced a new delivery service
in which it ships packages right into
your car it's called Amazon key in car
hey it's Ben would you guys use this I
can't wait to get a car for this yeah I
mean I I have a car but it's parked in
the garage now so it'll be kind of
worthless to have them yeah the garage
it also requires like very specific
types of cars yeah and yeah which I
don't have all right it's on so you
basically need that OnStar service for
this on a star or Volvo's version of
OnStar and it looks like a lot of people
have OnStar it's nice to see that OnStar
is actually useful for something because
OnStar existed for a long time and I
didn't really know what people had used
it for I do appreciate that I think
Amazon understands that there's still a
lot of discomfort with Amazon key in the
home and the car at least being you know
parked outside or whatever like this is
one step removed from that you know
you're a little bit more willing to let
someone into your trunk you're not gonna
worry about this you're not gonna be
worried about your dog running out of
your car exactly and if you are you're a
bad pet owner yeah that being said it
seemed that a lot of people were still
complaining about this on Twitter saying
Amazon's asking too much of customers
because this came after the in-home
service yeah folks are just wondering
okay what's next and what else are you
gonna ask I can get in your mailbox yeah
which would be horrible much last as
part of our ongoing follow the money
package our own Abrar al Hebe wrote
about many of the apps and services
available to manage your money those
include daily budget which helps you
calculate how much you can spend each
day based on your income and recurring
expenses I should definitely try to use
some of those yeah I feel like I'm
definitely in need of more fun I do
cement for a while I have to but I was
really into mid for a while then I just
stopped using it yeah like I need
something that actually will keep
motivating me to to continually use
these apps and services to be more
financially responsible cuz I'm not yeah
well check out our story there are a
bunch of different options available if
you want to read more about these
stories check us out on CNET I'm Ben Fox
Ruben I'm Rob J I'm Alfred Inge thanks
for listening I missed that chime and
that concludes the recording of the
audio podcast
thanks everybody for joining us go ahead
and submit questions and comments in the
chat below if you're on youtube if
you're on periscope or live stream I'm
too lazy to check all of those and can
you check the YouTube ones that's what
yeah just saying if you're on periscope
yeah periscope
so until then let's go ahead and farm
out the question the elephant in the
room you already brought it up briefly
but with this Amazon in-car delivery
service you know it's it's a little more
restrictive it's a little more exclusive
being that there are much more tight
regulations on like you said OnStar and
the other services need to be in play if
anyone's out there we're curious to see
are you more in tune to get onboard with
Amazon having access to your car
then you'd be for them having access to
your home and what are the mitigating
factors that would stipulate that for
you I'm just more worried about the
packaging because like when I did drive
around like if I if I park somewhere I
would put like expensive things like in
the club Department sure yeah you can
tell I don't drive that much but the
point is like you know I tried to keep
valuable things out of sight but like if
I'm ordering something and if it says
like you know Apple on the box or
something like that no one wants that in
the trunk you can't see it not only that
but it's in an Amazon box too so it
wouldn't say Apple on it yeah I mean no
but there's been some times I've ordered
things from Amazon and they'll have the
branding like right there on the side of
the box like a fancy watch yeah and it's
like Amazon and it's like on like my
stairs or something like that
yeah I feel like that's that's a lot
less secure than being in the trunk it
depends on what car I mean yeah if you
have an SUV I guess there's a windowed
bag yeah yeah I'm like it's your point
is exactly right that the likelihood
that somebody would just grab it from
your porch that seems to be much more
likely for yeah it's a crime of
opportunity where they see like an Apple
package just sitting there whereas they
would have to actively break open the
car so that's probably a big reason why
Amazon wants to do this that's the same
reason with the individual big question
this the service is it cost more money
no it's completely free and it doesn't
include any hardware the thing is is
that you need a specific type of car
yeah I mean that's the thing like if I
had this car if I had this type car or I
lived in the 37 city
I lived in these cities which there's a
lot of this here I would be interested I
would totally be into and and I also use
my car to commute and like parked in the
you know parked in my company's parking
lot or whatever I would definitely be
more interested in using this obviously
now I don't I don't try to work every
day so it's kind of irrelevant to me but
I can imagine a lot of people would be
more keen on this than Amazon keys
traditional answers I mean I'm also
interested in like what security aspects
like he in-car has come so like with
Amazon he like for the home like they
you you get like a specific smart lock
for that right you got a specific smart
lock for it and also a security camera
yeah actually watch the delivery person
yeah delivering the package because
they're opening your door so you not get
the camera is OnStar security yeah I'm
curious about like how like robust that
is now that you know people know that
they can use like OnStar stuff like
leave packages and cars and things like
that you to make that easier for people
you get notifications throughout the
process like it's step by step
notifications which apparently is
supposed to make people a little bit
more comfortable especially if it's not
including a live video camera and if you
if someone breaks into your car or opens
a trunk OnStar would know right I don't
OnStar customers so I know you know it's
our expert it's I mean that makes sense
but I don't know off the top of my head
okay I'm glad you brought that up about
the cameras because user give a good to
figured if it forgot to well nice yeah
yeah he's asking does it have security
cameras so if nobody I mean can you
apply that in your own means if you got
really MacGyver II if you had a bus I
mean like I remember back in middle
school they had a bus security camera
but I'm pretty sure if you wanted that
in their regular video I don't think
you'd like a reverse dashcam well yeah
there there are dash cams but yeah that
doesn't really I guess you turn it
around like you said okay see that's the
thing is that I feel like Amazon is
still trying to convince people that
this is a service they would want to use
to get people to pay for additional
hardware and say hey we're gonna we're
gonna be able to access this camera that
you're gonna
put in your car I then I wonder if
people would balk and not really be that
into it
no coming into the chat to take some
questions from Matthew dacha right out
the gate I worry about how Amazon will
interface with OnStar to make that work
how can we be sure that the permission
won't be used nefariously good vocab
word yeah it's a going back to what I
said before you get notifications
throughout the process you can cancel
the order to your car up to the point
that they open up the trunk so they are
trying to make people more comfortable
with this service again the service is
run by the same delivery men that are
employed for it for Amazon key right
these are like the trusted Amazon
delivery third-party delivery services
so presumably they're trustworthy
again that's I think that's the the big
hurdle of consumers know that get over
is the idea that they have to trust them
these people that they don't really know
we're right with right yeah III go back
to the point that this this to me feels
a lot less invasive than the in-home
delivery
definitely is so the problem is is that
it does have all these limitations and
do you expect more makes and models to
come in the future so look out for that
although there's only a home store
that's that's really niche like our they
don't starve Volvo and there are other
connected cars out there so so it's
gonna it's gonna tap into cars to have
like a built-in LTE connection right I
think they'd have to I'm doing right now
making one right possibilities right now
it's just OnStar and so OnStar hat is a
managed service connected cars with an
LTE connection they're not managed they
just happen to have a connection so
there's a lot less security there
there's not like a person behind it
running the the process running the
delivery process so that's why I'm a
little raises a lot of questions if it's
just a connected car and just what
happens they're worth who's dealing with
liability there I don't know those are
good questions for sure and if you're
uncomfortable with it obviously first
we'd love to hear from you but also you
don't have to use this service this is
it's okay Amazon's making me buy a Buick
what if your Amazon delivery service
person gets like a crush on you and
search leaving you love notes another
weird admirer like like a high school or
like jr. oh that's sweet I don't know
like you'd be all shucks about it now a
delivery in like the trunk of your car
being that viable though because there's
not that much space in the trunk of your
car like you'd have to move the body you
have to use all right says the guy who
doesn't own a car come on right course
you could fit a body and a package
entirely too suspect
all right more questions from the chat
from APEC I have OnStar and would they
be open to giving a discount on OnStar
pricing through Amazon that's they did
not mention anything like that I
wouldn't think so you pay more right you
need an active yeah one cigar account
like give us a discount for using this
additional service right and by the way
old I like it as you can tell we're not
on star experts so I'd love to hear from
this person as far as what you use
aren't star for the best thing that I
know it doesn't matter does it Batman
uses one star oh my god your star and
that terrible Batman and Robin movie I
remember that I block that out banks
it's just a bunch of batarangs being
delivered to but in an episode box so
you don't know the batarangs
that's right otherwise they get stolen
that's right from Christopher Osborn is
car delivery really better at least in
your home you can set up cameras to make
sure they don't steal dash cams don't
really have the storage to constantly
record to catch theft and I'm talking
about theft by the person delivering the
package yeah they already have the
package though and after they deliver
the package it would be safer than on a
porch but in a trunk what's stopping
anyone from taking something out of my
trunk what stop wait wait taking your
car anyway what's I mean if they want to
steal something what's in your trunk
that's so valuable like I don't know
stuff that a lot my god if the delivery
person wants to steal your package why
would they go to your truck no they
wouldn't steal the package they would
steal whatever like it's other valuables
like you know my diamond collection
story to my truck and this was
a problem that a lot of people had with
the in home delivery service like if I
give a delivery person access to my
front door they're just gonna waltz in
and steal my laptop so I mean I think
it's look I don't mean to make light of
your comment but I think the idea is if
you're expecting a delivery into your
trunk you clear out the trunk of any
valuables or like just leave the I have
crap in mind like there's a stroller in
my trunk like you can take it you can
take the stole that really heavy makes
my windshield washer fluid yeah yeah I
got rolls of like paper towels I mean I
guess you can take go but I don't know
how many people store their valuables in
the trunk it's definitely a matter of
trust I mean that's definitely what
we're talking about and if you don't
trust Amazon you don't trust the
delivery drivers this is very clearly
not a service for you Chris apparently
has a crossbow in his trouble you're
right I will not cross that but look if
you're and if you're expecting a package
to your trunk you take the crossbow out
for the day put it back later it's fine
that could happen all the time
I would love to hold on I would love to
hear that phone call it was on customer
service excuse me somebody stole a
crossbow how much depends on what state
you're living and maybe that's illegal
in the first okay though because I
ordered another one that was what was
delivered all right here's a good
question from Josh what if you need to
go to the grocery store or something in
Amazon delivery shows up what if your
car isn't there I mean they just kind of
backtrack doesn't OnStar have like GPS
or is that like - will they chase you
know they know a city you have to be
within a two-block radius of your
regular delivery area so if that's your
o your office okay yeah if it's your
home or your office the car has to be
located in that two block radius and
they do show you a map specifically to
let you know where you're supposed to
park okay just like par get some random
like shopping no they're not gonna find
you this is not in anywhere type of
situation that would be kind of amazing
if it were yeah they don't they don't
want to do that and primarily the reason
is is that if they are having a hard
time opening up the trunk for whatever
reason or there's some sort of snag then
the delivery person doesn't have to
drive all the way across all right right
every they can just deliver to your
regular ad
drop it off in the porch and move on to
the next delivery yeah and good luck
curse went on to clarify a little bit
and I actually think this is a good
thing to kind of mall over a different
vehicle types have different trunk
access a pickup truck is wide open and
an SUV gains access to the rest of the
cab that's true as opposed to a standard
sedan trunk which usually has a locked
backseat which is not impossible to
break through but I mean then you're
really trying and if you see those legs
coming out the back of a trunk right
somebody's gonna see something it's a
really bad way so how do how do they is
there any regulation or any kind of
restrictions on what kind of vehicle
type can participate in this outside of
the after mentioned OnStar technology no
they in the videos they even
specifically showed that you deliver to
a hatchback SUV a regular sedan so and
sometimes the deliveries would go in the
trunk sometimes they would go in the
backseat so okay alright once they
unlock the car they have access to the
car ah so it is full access Oh car now
they're just not um I thought like the
OnStar would just pop the trunk and that
would be it no yes unlock the cars
unlocked oh you know the backseat if
they want to
I want changes things a little bit now
well well that's a little less
comfortable that now yeah it's good to
have that clarification because I was
confused by the original concept - I
thought it was just trunk so if I knew
that they had access to my car I'm not
comfortable with that but the trunk idea
is not bad in my opinion I don't think
Chris oh good point about the car type
definitely if there's a separate trunk I
mean I have I have an SUV so if you
opened up the back door or the trunk
door its you've access the entire car
but yeah I don't really keep valuables
I'll take my CDs yeah yeah CDs I got
like Disney CDs if they want on I've had
CD stolen out of my car twice and I
watched it happen what from my balcony
and my Akali shout out like hey yeah and
I chased the guy and you just slide of
the woods yeah I took a very interesting
my CD a limited edition Kidz Bop 21 I
have one more quick question what about
sizes of packages you can order lots of
crazy stuff on Amazon what if you get a
giant big-screen TV that's not gonna fit
your car well that automatically stop
you will restrict you from using that
car delivery services imagine there's a
size limit right there
sighs limit and also a value limit a
high-value items that need a signature
they won't let you deliver those to your
car yeah and also there's a you know big
packages there's a size limit to those
as well yeah they're not gonna don't
even let the guilt of liability at that
yeah an Amazon executive that I talked
to also mentioned that like yes you can
deliver chocolates to your trunk in the
dead of the summer in Arizona if you
wanted to but really short before I do
yeah what it's up to you to decide
whether it's good break I guess yes you
do it you deliver stuff like your
friends like on stuff that would be
awesome just boxes of chocolate filled
up in the truck that's a great idea but
I don't think it's just a ton of minutes
away here's here's a segue into that we
got to move on to Spotify shortly
there's lots of requests for Spotify but
APEC pointed out another thing about
card delivery is the heat can damage a
lot of items so is there a like a
judgment call left to the delivery
person and how can you embrace that as a
prank as mega and leaving chocolate in
the car and lo the interior so you can
order frozen like live crickets on
Amazon to flight feed your lizard or an
insurance carrier lizard so you can
order that and then they'll melt like to
come alive in the car and then you open
up the box and boom yeah God cricket oh
that's that's that's very good yeah I've
never that's not something that I've
done before to anybody sure it's a
latest like prank trend instead of like
planking its cricketing there's also
like glitter bombing yeah that's true
little bomb it's when you stuff an
envelope with glitters so evil amazon
said that it's kind of up to the
purchaser to decide if they want to get
it delivered to their car or not and
going back to the chocolate situation if
if you do something like that they're
not going to try to protect you or say
hey you're delivering chocolate to
Arizona have you made and you have a
credit card you can make bad decisions
so let's move on to Spotify because
we've all got to three minutes yeah yeah
we got to move along rehash real quick
what is going on in Spotify it's an
increased listen ability for the free
customers on the mobile
basically you're able to listen to their
designated playlists but instead that
that shuffle mode where you didn't have
control over the the songs you can pick
and choose one you want to play whatever
songs all that playlists it's basically
like as if you had premium but only for
the playlist that they chose which is
still pretty awesome deal yeah I mean
it's better yeah honestly like I said
like if I if I didn't have a really
sweet deal with Spotify now like I
probably would have just kept with a
Fremont would it make you would have
convinced you to to drop your premium
plan to go back to them no cuz there's
like several aspects of it that like I
do like but now that now that I do have
premium was like oh yeah these features
are great in my life I don't know I had
premium the first you know there in the
trial P like I had like a three months
of it or a month of it it was great but
then once I went back to the free tier I
was like this is do ya yeah this I think
for me it's because like Spotify was
like pretty much next to free for me
like that's not like the fifteen dollars
that like most people pay and that's
saying a lot considering you don't pay
anything for anything I know you're
super cheap all right well just to
specify Josh Moyer was asking will
Spotify allow people to search for songs
or play or is it only restricted to the
place you can search for them to play if
they're on those playlists fair enough
yes like the new Frank Ocean song
happens to be undiscovered weekly for
you like you can search and play like as
many times as you want
oh so there is no limit on playback
there's no quota I don't think no it's
just but it's just if it's not all this
designated place or the the designated
playlists multiple yeah you you have the
same restrictions as before yeah I think
that clarify is it pretty well we are
just about out of time we will be back
what is it Tuesday it's Tuesday right
only to pletely Lawson right got
tomorrow I'm will be back tomorrow
theoretically thanks everybody for
