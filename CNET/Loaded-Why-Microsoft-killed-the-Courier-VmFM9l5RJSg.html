Bridget Carey of cnet.com and it's time
to get loaded some light has been shed
on what happened to the courier the
tablet project Microsoft trashed in 2010
it was going to be a two screen device
that would use a pen
according to stop interviews woven
together by CNET the team behind the
courier didn't want to have a typical
Windows experience and it focused more
on content creation than having the
classic programs like Outlook it wasn't
to replace a PC but rather be a
companion problem was that didn't sit
well with management like chairman Bill
Gates after all Microsoft Office was a
massive money maker so why not have it
in the tablet the conflict caused the
project to be scrapped but fast forward
to today and the Windows 8 tablet which
won't probably come out until the end of
next year isn't exactly your typical
Windows experience
funny how that happens now Microsoft has
to play catch-up with Apple Amazon and a
slew of android models 18 teased first
LTE 4G smartphones are arriving Sunday
the HTC vivid and Samsung Galaxy s2 sky
rocket will work on 18 T's HSPA+ and LTE
networks and both will have the Android
Gingerbread operating system on Sunday
18 T will also expand its LTE network to
Boston Washington d.c Baltimore and
Athens Georgia it already was in five
markets in September and the goal is to
reach 15 markets by the end of the year
next week Barnes and Noble will unveil
its next-generation Android color tablet
to face off against the Amazon Kindle
Fire the name and details behind the
second installment of the Nook Color
will be not on Monday at a new york
press conference the announcement comes
just one week before the Kindle Fire
ships with a $200 price tag so we'll
just wait to see what price and features
the note can offer to trump that cheap
fire Google Reader has a new look today
the application that pulls in website
fees and search terms has been revamped
to integrate more with the Google Plus
social network but if you poke around
and absolutely hate the change google it
to export your feeds into another feed
reader the creator of Second Life has
launched a new e-commerce website for
people to buy and sell small
jobs from each other it goes by the
quirky name of coffee and power a
similar concept to sites like Zaarly or
TaskRabbit except coffee and power has a
twist taken from Second Life the credits
or cost of the services their virtual
currency you can receive payment in C
dollars and use that money to buy other
services or you could spend one
real-world dollar to get one C dollar
but if you want to cash out you only
make 85 cents for every C dollar in your
account those are your headlines for
today I'm Bridget Carey for cnet.com and
