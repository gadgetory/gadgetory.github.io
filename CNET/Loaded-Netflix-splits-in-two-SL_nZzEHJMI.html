eleven i'm wilson tang on cnet com and
it's time to get loaded if you get DVDs
by mail from netflix dead red envelope
will soon have the name Qwikster printed
on it Netflix is splitting both its DVD
by mail and streaming services into two
separate entities two different names to
different websites with two different
user accounts needed in a few weeks
quicks there will be the name of the
company that does dvd-by-mail and the
service will also add video game rentals
the online streaming service will keep
the netflix name if you're confused and
annoyed from the changes Netflix is well
aware the company co-founder and CEO
Reed Hastings is responding to thousands
of angry comments on the netflix blog
after writing an apology and explanation
about the decision saying this is a move
to help strengthen the selection of
shows on the streaming service eighties
new LTE 4g network went live in five
areas this weekend but you won't be able
to tap into the faster network with any
of the occurrence smartphones however
there are a few devices that can access
the faster LTE 4G including the HTC
jetstream Android tablet and the
elevat-- 4G mobile hotspot ATT will
expand LTE to 15 markets by the end of
the year compared that to verizon which
has 4g LTE in 143 markets and has
several smartphones that can tap into
the faster network if you're thinking
hey I bought an ATT 4g phone well that
only works on a slightly less fast speed
of 4g called hspa+ facebook is expected
to launch a new platform to make it
easier to share what media you're
currently listening to or watching
facebook will make the announcement on
thursday at its f8 developers conference
in San Francisco according to the New
York Times the new development will
supposedly connect with music services
like Spotify and Rhapsody and video
services like VEVO you might want to
watch your head this week NASA is
expecting a 6-ton dead satellite to
crash into Earth about 26 pieces will
likely hit Friday give or take a day
although no one has been hit by a
satellite before odds are one in 3200
that someone will get hit today Google
Wallet has gone live sort of
documentation of partner says September
19th is a launch day
and tech website giga ohm reported on a
Google Wallet pay station at a San
Francisco coffee shop but the Google
Wallet website still doesn't say much at
least that was the case when this video
was taped so if you see a Google Wallet
pay station it can right now only be
used with a sprint Nexus S android phone
and users will also need a citi
mastercard account those are your
headlines for today I'm Wilson tank for
