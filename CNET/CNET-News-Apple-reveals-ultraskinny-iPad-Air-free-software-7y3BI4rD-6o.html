announced its newest technologies at a
well-timed invitation-only event in San
Francisco Tuesday morning these amazing
products are great examples of the type
of innovation that only Apple can
deliver headlining the event a
full-sized iPad with not only a new look
but a new name iPad you can see the
bezel is forty-three percent thinner
than the previous version making it more
comfortable to hold in your hand they
were talking about how the iPad needs an
evolution and this is more of a fine a
small evolutionary step not a big leap
in rewriting what the ipad is to people
a 16 gig ipad air runs five hundred
dollars and is available november first
as for the ipad mini its dimensions
remain the same but it now sports a
crisper Retina display and of course a
higher price four hundred dollars for 16
gigs it hit stores in late November
Apple will still sell the original iPad
Mini though at a lower price of three
hundred dollars in addition to updated
13 and 15 inch macbooks with faster
processors and longer lasting battery
life Apple revealed the specs of its new
Mac Pro its professional desktop machine
the three thousand dollar black cylinder
is a dramatic departure from previous
models it is our vision the future of
the pro desktop and today we'd like to
tell you even more about it so inside
this new generation Mac Pro is the
fastest processor we've ever put in a
Mac a new generation intel xeon e5 comes
in 4 6 8 or 12 chord designs
software updates took center stage for
part of the event in an unexpected move
Apple announced that customers could
download Mavericks its latest mac
operating system free of charge yeah the
idea might be that it's more worth it
for everybody to be up to date than it
is to try to collect money for that I
think that's probably the strategy and a
smart one so you don't have people going
oh it doesn't work on my Mac what am I
going to do Apple CEO Tim Cook seemed
confident as he left the event but will
ipads and macs be the go-to gift of the
season that's for customers to decide in
San Francisco I'm Sumi das cnet for CBS
