car by a country mile the backbone of
their crossover and SUV business let's
find out why and check the tech quick
refresher course on where the rogue sits
in the Nissan lineup it's the second
smallest of their crossovers the
smallest being the Juke with the crazy
frog eyes this one has more of a
conventional look it's still on its
first generation but on the market since
2008 it's a 2 row crossover on a car
based platform now let's get inside now
the first thing you notice when you get
into 2013 rogue SV what is that oh it's
a navigation system isn't that cute I
thought it was a bug when I first got in
five inch LCD touchscreen but in spite
of its small size which does make it
hard to get a lot of detail on there
they've done a good job of getting
touchscreen buttons on there here's the
map mode for example when you hit menu
look how nice and big those buttons are
of course it obliterates the map at the
time that you're doing input but at
least they give you a good finger
landing space same thing goes for
entering a destination look how fast
this goes this is pretty good stuff now
you get a little bit of a delay when
it's reading intensively from the SD
card that's where the navigation system
lives but don't be fooled this isn't
like a forward system where you can
decide to get the SD card or not it all
comes in the package with this
navigation head unit so why they even
expose that thing I don't know it's just
really for updates later but it'd be
nice to see that thing hidden because
some kids going to play with it and lose
it or stick it in their nose you know
and once you do zoom in on something or
start getting navigation guidance it
optimizes the screen pretty well to show
you just what you want but I can't get
past the claustrophobic feeling of that
little dinky display that Bluetooth
system by the way is only for hands-free
calling you don't have that streaming
among your audio options which are am/fm
no HD radio Sat radio as well three
months included that's also when your
traffic for the nav rig comes from I
have an iPod USB connector in here as
well which will take thumb drives or any
Apple device here's your menu for the
iPod it's clean and sim
response is pretty quick and I
appreciate the large typeface which does
wonders when you're driving I want to
grok something quickly and get your eyes
back on the road now we've got a
rear-view camera it also comes in our
SLE package it comes in other lower trim
rogues as well but not standard now you
can see I'm looking at the back and I'm
also looking out of a mirror camera
which should tip you off that we have
something else here that we have an
around view monitor front back and
mirror cam stitched together in a Nissan
Infiniti Manor to show me a bird's-eye
view of my own car the only problem is
the resolutions crap and here's where
that small screen really starts to
punish me that's not a useful overview
I'm sorry it's just too much real estate
in too small a piece of real estate the
transmission on this car is one choice
only across all rogues and that is
Nissan's CVT continuously variable
transmission there's no shifting gate
there are no cogs that's why no paddles
either we're going to check this one out
on the road in just a few moments but
let's go see what puts power into it now
all rogues have the same motor a two and
a half litre side saddle four with no
particularly novel technology in there
but it's a good old durable Nissan mill
from who knows how long ago you're going
to get 170 horsepower 175 foot-pounds of
torque out of this vehicle so it's
clearly tuned for grunt and not maximum
speed which makes sense in a vehicle
like this it has to get through the air
with kind of a biggest profile front
wheel drive what we have here all wheel
drives available as well still the same
gearbox no matter what you do your zero
to 60 on the front wheel drives about
eight and a half seconds those beam
demon butt
as they might say mpg 23:28 if you have
front-wheel drive you drop down to 20 to
26 with all-wheel drive now the road
drives like you think it would drive
it's kind of small and easy and light
and nothing about it is laborious pretty
good visibility I always like to check
that out in cars these days because it
usually is crap but in this case they've
carved out some rather useful rear
quarter windows they give you a little
more not much but a little more
indication of what you're about to steer
into and generally speaking the
greenhouse is kind of high and flat the
screen is not only small but it's also
very low most car makers are pushing
those up to be closer to your eyeline at
least your gauge eyeline this one's not
even close which is another nag I've got
about it now in terms of driving this
vehicle one thing that annoys me is the
steering wheel it does go up and down it
doesn't telescope though so it sticks
out here like the end of a broom handle
and that just never allowed me to get
really comfortable but the biggest issue
I've got is with the engine transmission
relationship of this vehicle normally I
like Nissan's cvts they're the only
company I think that really gets them
right or they don't feel vague and
slippery all the time except in this car
this one's starting to feel vague and
slippery when you really get on it
there's an awful lot of kind of wind up
and what feels like slip but is really
continual gear ratio evolution as you're
driving it feels less like it has gears
and that's not really a good thing to
most drivers as a result like coming off
a stop here there's kind of muted engine
response and then once it does come on
it comes on too late and too much kind
of that rubber band a yo-yo effect it
sort of mutes the engine's
responsiveness and I know this is a good
motor 175 foot-pounds of torque I can do
a lot with that but not when it's going
through a slip box so I feel like Nissan
has slipped a little in their CVT
engineering or programming
okay let's price this 2013 rogue we have
an SV which is the better base and we've
added SL which is the C net tech lovers
package here's how the pricing looks
you're damn near $27,000 for an SV
front-wheel drive adds 1300 for
all-wheel drive
then add a chunky 3900 for the SL
package but you're going to want to do
that because that's where all the
goodies are for example that navigation
system the rear camera and a round view
monitor the Bose audio with the fancy
flat panel subwoofer all kinds of
heating and power leather seats all the
stuff you want it's a big buy-in but you
can't do much all a card on this vehicle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
