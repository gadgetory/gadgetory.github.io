lot of money and we put the iPhone 10s
through the ringer let's get to the core
of Apple news and rumors the new iPhone
10s is in the Apple watch series for are
out in the wild and apparently money is
not an issue for Apple fans initial
sales reports suggest that the more
expensive iPhone Tenace max has been the
bestseller this year in fact the 10s max
is outselling the smaller tennis by
three to four times according to
analysts in fact demand in general is up
from last year the more popular of the
models is the 256 gig version which
costs one thousand two hundred and forty
nine dollars now if that's not
impressive enough let's take a look at
how much Apple is supposed to be making
from each one of these units according
to tech insights it only cost Apple
about four hundred and fifty dollars to
make an iPhone Tenace max with 256 gigs
of storage now to get this price
estimate the company took apart one of
these phones and calculated the price
per component researcher IHS market also
came up with a similar estimate of 390
dollars for the 64 gig version of the
10s max Tim Cook has gone on the record
before saying that these estimates
usually don't even come close to the
actual costs now whether intentional or
because of production delays it seems
like the move to delay the cheaper
iPhone 10 R is literally paying off for
Apple and that's the next one
rumor has it Apple could still be having
production issues with the cheaper
iPhone 10 alternative according to a
report by digit times Apple has had to
increase the iPhone 10 orders from
manufacturer Foxconn after their main
supplier for this phone Pegatron has
experienced more production delays and
with the iPhone 10 are going on presale
October 19th the clock is ticking for
Apple meanwhile the Apple watch series
for production is running at full steam
according to another digit times report
cited in Mac rumors
Apple has had to hire a secondary watch
assembler to make more units of the
series for
us to keep up with demand delivery dates
for the series for on the Apple Store
have already started to creep in to the
end of October which I guess if your
Apple is a good problem to have
it looks like the entire internet
including CNET has been busy conducting
tests on the new iPhones and the results
are kind of a mixed bag now let's start
with the bad news which is the battery
now thanks to I fix its teardown we know
the actual size of the battery on the
tennis and the tennis max which could
play a part in how much it lasts a Tom
sky report says the tennis and the
tennis max have a shorter battery life
than the 10 hours and 49 minutes of
their predecessors now in the case of
the tennis max the difference is not
that significant it's only about 10
minutes but in the case of an iPhone 10
s the difference is an hour of battery
life in the meantime we're running our
own battery test to see if these results
check out so stay tuned for that
now if the battery is your main concern
you may want to take that into
consideration before you buy a 10 s but
if like me the camera is your main
priority there's good news and that's
that you're getting a better camera
despite it having the same amount of
pixels as last year's iPhone 10 Lexie's
camera test proves that the smart HDR on
the new 10 SS really makes a difference
at evening out highlights and lowlights
especially if you're shooting in direct
sunlight or in low-light with high
contrast and portrait mode shots look a
lot more natural thanks to that
adjustable blur the other bit of good
news is you may also be getting a
tougher phone I conducted my own
informal drop test where I dropped a
brand new iPhone Tenace twice from hip
height and twice from eye level and the
phone survived with minimal damage now
that's a far stretch from last year when
our iPhone 10 cracked at the first drop
from hip level and it looks like I
wasn't the only one with these results
tech smart conducted a similar drop test
but this time with the Mac's the 10s and
last year's 10 and the 10s came out
victorious
while the 10 suffered the worst blows
I can't say for certain that it does
have tougher glass but the results
definitely speak for themselves and this
week we're doing a dunk test so stay
tuned for that camera test battery test
water test drop test what other kind of
testing do you want to see us do on that
iPhone 10s hit me up on the comments
section below or on Twitter and make
sure to catch us next week with more
