the chevy HHR here on this show even as
a rental car it's still a less full
version of a PT Cruiser but a new life
for the odd-shaped car might just stick
from a bad rap to plain old wrapped
Chevy's positioning its HHR panel as a
great way for small businesses to
advertise the panel has smooth sides
without windows and ditches the handles
on the rear cargo doors so you can get
your HHR all wrapped up and ready to
show I remember during the dot-com boom
