and this is Hoover's $179 Platinum
Collection links cordless stick vacuum
now stick vacuums are really designed as
a supplement to a regular upright or
canister vacuum they kind of do that
midweek maintenance if you just have a
little dirt and grime and want to kind
of get in there quickly and part of the
beauty of their design is that most of
them are cordless which I love and while
this Hoover doesn't have that quirky
futuristic design of the dyson dc50 9 it
is a fantastic performer it doesn't have
a bunch of attachments or other fancy
features it doesn't have a two and one
where it can be a dust buster and an
upright stick vacuum but it performed
great on all of our tests on the cereal
and pet hair tests it picked up 100% of
all the fruity Cheerios and pet hair
that we flung around the floor that's on
hardwood low pile and mid pile carpet I
think that's absolutely amazing on the
sand and sawdust test it came in third
behind the dyson dc50 9 and the
Electrolux agro rapido but it still did
very well it picked up 98% of the sand
and sawdust on hardwood so I'd say if
you don't want to spend 499 dollars for
a dyson dc50 9 and you don't need all of
those other attachments that this is a
fantastic option I do kind of wish it
had a two-in-one detachable handheld
vacuum like the $229 Electrolux or go
rapido but this is $179 you really can't
beat that price so if you're looking for
a straightforward stick vacuum with no
fuss this is a great option for CNET I'm
