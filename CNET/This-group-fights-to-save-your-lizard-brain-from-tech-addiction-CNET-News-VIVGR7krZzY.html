Google and Facebook employees think so
and they are now on a mission to save
the world
from the tech addiction monster they
helped create this new alliance is
called the Center for Humane Technology
it is made up of former Silicon Valley
investors and employees the goal is to
lobby tech companies to not purposefully
manipulate our lizard brains to keep
clicking to the next video the next link
get another like scroll through someone
else's perfect Instagram life
segregating us into fragmented echo
chambers sucking our attention and
affecting our behaviors as a society
co-founder Tristan Harris spoke about it
on CBS this morning we talk about
addiction we tend to think oh this is
just happening by accident
culturally like what are the kids doing
these days but we miss it and as I know
but the truth behind the screen the
truth about what's happening on the
other side of the screen is that this is
happening by design there's a whole
bunch of techniques that are
deliberately used to keep the autoplay
watching on video on YouTube to keep you
watching the next video or streaks and
snapchat to keep kids hooked so they
feel like they have to keep this streak
going and all parents know about this
and so we have to raise a public
conversation the group has a few ideas
on how to change the world first and get
apples Samsung and Microsoft to make
gadgets that help minimize screen time
to protect us from constant distractions
second lobby the government to create
more protections for consumers and on
top of that it is launching an ad
campaign called the truth about tech
which is targeting 55,000 public schools
in the US the coalition is not the first
to speak up about the problems of social
media during a recent speech at a
university campus one former Facebook
vice-president so the network is eroding
the core foundations of how people
behave and one of Facebook's founder
Sean Parker he spoke about the way
Facebook is designed to exploit us
saying quote god only knows what it's
doing to our children's brains and in
January Apple investors have called upon
the iPhone maker to do more to protect
children from being addicted to devices
Facebook did address the concern in a
blog post promising to look more into
the issue but groups like the coalition
want to keep the conversation going
beyond just clicking a thumbs up on a
newsfeed post
I'm Bridget Carey you can read more
about the coalition at cnet.com and be
sure to chime in on the comments to
share your thoughts on tech addiction
and if you're doing anything to change
your habits</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
