fancier version of we Moe's original
Wi-Fi light switch that adds in a couple
of new tricks namely the ability to dial
the light up and down as you see fit the
switch itself uses a capacitive touch
dimmer complete with indicator lights
that show you the dimming level as you
use it if you power the switch off
they'll keep shining to show you what
level the light will return to when you
turn it on again there's also a
multicolor light at the bottom that
shines in the light changes the
different colors tell you what's causing
the light to change of course there are
a lot of other ways to control this
switch starting with the Wemo app itself
along with toggling the light on and off
or dimming it up and down right from
your phone you can schedule automated
lighting changes a light coming on at
sunset for instance you can also set a
custom action that will trigger whenever
you long press on the dimmer for more
than two seconds so in this case when I
long press on the dimmer it'll turn on
this lamp that's plugged into a Wemo
mini smart switch other features in the
app include the ability to set a quick
timer that will gradually fade the
lights out a nighttime mode that will
limit the maximum brightness during
evening hours so you don't get blinded
during a midnight run to the bathroom
and in a way mode that'll cycle your
lights on and off to make it look like
your home when you're actually not the
dimmer works with a ton of third-party
smart home products and services too you
can sync it up with the Nest Learning
Thermostat you can automate it on if and
you can also dim it up and down using
voice commands with Amazon's Alexa or
the Google assistants soon you'll be
able to control using Siri as well
though you'll need to add the apple
homekit compatible Wemo bridge and it
arrives later this year still it's not
perfect the biggest mess like the
original Wemo light switch the Wemo
dimmer won't work in three-way switch
setups where you have multiple switches
wired to the same light competitors like
Lutron GE and i devices all offer smart
switch solutions for 3-way setups but
Belkin doesn't but still an $80 smart
dimmer that works with just about
everything and doesn't need a special
hub is a pretty solid pitch it isn't
perfect but the Wemo dimmer gets most of
the little things right it's worth
