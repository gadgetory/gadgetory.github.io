flood sensor on sale at various
retailers for 60 bucks 60 bucks may seem
a bit pricey for a flood sensor like
this but this one earns its price tag
with some really clever design the
plastic body rests on three gold-plated
probes that sense whether or not water
is present the probes are telescopic
meaning that you can place it on any
kind of uneven surface and all three
probes still can be touching the ground
the coolest part about this device is
designed though is the inside
it's a streamlined interior with a
single button and a single LED light for
basic functions it also includes a row
of terminals that you can wire up to a
security camera a siren or even an
external power supply this balance means
that as a standalone product that Favaro
works well but also it's really high
potential and what it can do for smart
home security as a whole for anyone who
lives in the floodplain whose pipes are
prone to burst or whose basements flood
in the spring this is a really solid
product and especially if you're wanting
to build out your house and integrate
this product into a larger smart home
security system I would very highly
recommend it you can follow more of our
