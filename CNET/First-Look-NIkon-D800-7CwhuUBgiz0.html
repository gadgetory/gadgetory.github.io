model it's targeted at non-sports
professionals you know like wedding
landscape and architectural
photographers people whose subjects
generally don't sprint across the scene
the d800 actually comes in two versions
standard one in a more expensive d800e
the d800e incorporates a modified
low-pass filter system the results in
little to no anti-aliasing and therefore
produces generally sharper photos the
body design remains quite similar to
that of the d700 and uses the now
standard nikon conventions it's really
sturdy and comfortable to shoot with
despite being a bit heavy because if
it's magnesium alloy construction it's
got slightly improved Dustin weather
sealing over the previous model as well
the group has an inset for your fingers
that ensures extra stability one of the
big updates over the d700 is the
viewfinder now covers a hundred percent
of the scene still big and bright and
extremely comfortable to use you can
also now program these function buttons
for silent aperture operation during
video shooting with the exception of the
new 36 megapixel sensor the d800 uses a
lot of the same core components as the
d4 including the grape viewfinder the
updated autofocus and metering systems
and it also has new capabilities enabled
by the X speed 3 image processor things
like improved white balance face
detection boost for exposure and dynamic
range optimization as well as in-camera
HDR it also includes the same set of
enhanced and expanded set of video
capabilities for Nikon that is which
include uncompressed 422 hdmi out mic
and headphone jacks live aperture
adjustment while shooting and expanded
set of frame rates to me a couple of the
subtle standout features are support for
USB 3 0 which is essential if you shoot
tethered with those large files for
example and two card slots frankly I
wouldn't expect the photo quality in
this camera to be less than spectacular
and it delivers it's impossible to apply
a hard upper limit on the usability at
any particular ISO sensitivity because
unlike a lot of cameras the d800
no noise where it doesn't need it I'm
sure it's probably gaining up the sensor
uniformly but the photos simply don't
look it Plus at even slightly less than
a hundred percent view in a lot of cases
you won't see the noise at all and when
you scale down the higher resolution of
the sensor compensates for any loss of
sharpness due to noise reduction the
dynamic range is great as well while
JPEGs have expected clipping in the
highlights of high contrast photos
there's plenty of detail recoverable in
the raws I didn't see much in the way of
clipped shadows but there's plenty of
recoverable detail there too and it
handles bright saturated Reds pinks and
purples very well without blowing out
any detail all the exposures are dead on
the automatic white balance is just a
touch cooler than I like that's
eminently tweakable to your taste right
down to an option to preserve the warmth
of indoor lighting in full auto white
balance the video looks really good as
well though I can't yet say whether it's
better than any of the alternatives
while there some Waray there's no
rolling shutter to speak of videos
reasonably sharp in the tonal range in
both light and dark looks very smooth
and brought low light video is a noise
free at full size but I think most
commercial shooters will find it
acceptable if they need to shoot an
ambient light and even some independent
video pixel papers will be quite happy
with it my one complaint the battery
seems to drain faster than almost any
high-end DSLR I've used in recent memory
drops a few bars on the indicator every
shooting session and while the LCD is
larger it doesn't seem up to the high
resolution images for judging sharpness
and it's also difficult to use in direct
sunlight the d800 is an unsurprisingly
great camera that's worth every penny of
its higher price for its target market
of non-sports pro photographers and it
should definitely please those who've
been waiting patiently to replace their
older and icon equipment I'm Lori
Brennan and this is the Nikon d800</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
