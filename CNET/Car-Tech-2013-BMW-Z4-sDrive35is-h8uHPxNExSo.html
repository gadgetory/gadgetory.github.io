BMWs business but they are an important
one it's a whole DNA thing let's see how
strong the family chromosomes are doing
in this top of the stack 2013 z4 s drive
35 I guess and check the tech now an S
does not look dramatically different
from a 35 i but there are about seven or
eight key differences overall let's run
them down it's about 12% more powerful
comes with a DCT gearbox only is it mpg
or two thirstier has an active
suspension weighs about 50 pounds more
those about 0.3 seconds faster has fancy
leather and costs almost $9,000 more all
things being equal now in arguably the
best feature of a z4 is this the
retractable hardtop that is an absolute
wonder of engineering and it actually
does something that most convertibles
can't do gives you confidence I know
this thing's never gonna leak and then
I'm never gonna feel like I don't want
to put it down because it's gonna wear
out the plastic window or something none
of that going on here high-quality 20
seconds cycling one way to the other and
you can do it up to 35 miles an hour so
it can double as a speed break but look
what happens when the top is down
you know I'm gonna take a minute here to
gripe about something I'm sick and tired
of the organic era in interior design
what are these shapes of this - sure
it's beautifully done in materials but
what is this weird silver a sort of
waxed mustache shape and then you got
this odd organic shape here and this
slight tilt here and I miss symmetry am
I the only one now let's go to the
technology hit the iDrive button and
peekaboo here comes your little friend a
large though not BMWs largest LCD screen
I'm glad they have it powerbal down and
up like that because when you do park
the car with the top down you don't want
to leave that up I don't know why you
just don't connected drive brings you to
both BMWs apps which are pretty good and
BMW online which is a separate deal it
sets up the internet connection in the
car to go online 3G so it can be
painfully slow hm I mean painfully slow
okay here we go
news weather online search to me is the
most interesting I don't care about my
stock quotes while I'm driving anyone
who really is serious about money sure
as hell doesn't get their information
here the online search lets you do a
Google search and get results that are
very much sort of oriented toward
location and by the way BMWs when the
last car makers it lets you actually do
things while the car is moving you can
run this guy wall driving it's not
something to pull over for which may be
controversial but at least it gives you
the choice the main stuff you need in
terms of media sources is all here but
that doesn't mean everything radio is
put into one area with am/fm satellite
is optional the car has satellite prep
only under the hoary old title of CD
multimedia you've got your iPod I'm
doing that through USB down here my
phone is paired up for streaming VAT is
included as part of the Bluetooth
package you've got an aux Jack over here
and with Apple devices you can do a
plug-in echo to the screen which almost
nobody uses and a key thing that we
rarely see in these test cars but this
cradle here you see it's generic right
now that could be an iPhone or a
blackberry cradle if you have that you
dock your phone you're charging off of
power in the car and you're connected to
an external antenna on the vehicle
you're still doing Bluetooth for the
actual communication and streaming but
that is a really cool option for very
little money
I even loaded up with our tech package
look what happens when I go
reverse nothing no rear camera standard
or optional in this car ain't gonna
happen given the fact that when the tops
up the visibility is kind of crap and
it's got a great big old painted surface
waiting to be scuffed on the car behind
you I think that is a serious omission
now some drive controls you see this
shifter it's the only one you're going
to get and the transmission connected to
it to the one you're going to get it's a
7-speed dual-clutch automated manual no
automatic of the traditional sense and
no manual in this car not at this trim
level or power level next to it is your
drive control comfort is kind of normal
Sport tightens everything up including
transmission of the engine response
Sport Plus does that even more and turns
off traction control to hang out the
rear end rear wheel driver man I gotta
say for a little car it's got the
biggest hood in show business because
they move the cut lines for the hood
from the top along the fenders to the
outside of the fenders gives it this
great big expanse when it opens up until
he spaces deep careful of these now this
engine is your inline six with the twin
scroll turbo not twin turbos but a
two-stage single turbo tuned for various
parts of the RPM raise a very effective
unit in our past experience mounted
longitudinally driving the rear wheels
as I mentioned through that one choice
DCT 7-speed transmission the numbers 335
horse 232 foot-pounds of torque each of
those about 30 more than on the NA
NASCAR zero to 60 for this 3500 pound
ride is 4.8 about 0.3 faster than the
MGP 17 24 19 about two mpg worse on city
and highway than the non s car and of
course that transmission is all you get
on the S that dual-clutch I mentioned
earlier blessedly the efficiency
technology here is limited to brake
regeneration to lessen the alternator
drag but we do not have BMWs jerky
start/stop system thank you let's go for
a ride first of all this cars got a
great exhaust note you're gonna spend a
lot of time listening to that and
playing it with the accelerator pedal
when you open it up this car is a
tremendously responsive ride when you're
just driving in everyday traffic it
feels a little more flat-footed than the
AI model with just a basic basic ZF
automatic it's a great automatic makes
me think the 35i is the better overall
car and I'm not sure I need the extra
12% horsepower and torque the cars fast
but I think the margin of this over a 35
is a degree of frenetic not real ability
that said it is fun when you tap into
everything it's got I was also very
pleased how moving the shifter from the
traditional drive mode over to sport
mode transforms the car in one click not
having to fiddle with a bunch of
profiles and nonsense or even having to
get on the paddles and as with any z4
don't go out of the house with your hair
sticking up cuz you're gonna get a lot
of looks in this car
and what's an ass so pricey little thing
about 66 bass and right off the bat
you're gonna add to that 20 to 50 for
the tech package to get navigation with
voice traffic BMW apps and a few other
niceties Satellite Radio's 350 more
parking sensors no camera at 7:50
automatic high beams 250 and the steel
of the option list and they're very few
of those in BMW land is that I phone
cradle adapter for 125 bucks absolutely
all-in were pushing 70,000 my mind keeps
going to the possibility of the 35 I is
the better buy overall for the modest
improvement in performance you get here
if you really want to track car with
that last little bit ago you're not
gonna get something with a big little
heavy retractable hardtop now the other
thing to think about it's very hard to
make this your only car I mean it's
highly impractical in terms of storage
there are many times just in our week of
testing it where I had to leave stuff
behind and go back and get it the next
day when I'd emptied out the trunk of
the first amount of stuff I took home
that gets old pretty quick but all in
this is a very enjoyable car that
carries forward a limited but important
part of BMWs heritage
