and Sony but also from two unexpected
sources we have we've got blackberry and
Nokia two big blasts from the past
coming with their phones let's start
with the BlackBerry phone it's called
the key one guess what you make of it
it's got a keyboard and a 4.5 inch
screen this is definitely interesting
it's supposed to be best of both worlds
and there are some cool features on it
I found the keyboard to be a little bit
squashed typing was a little bit
difficult but I'm also so used to using
a virtual keyboard now that I don't know
if this is the phone or if I need to
relearn it I think it's definitely
interesting and something that old fans
will gravitate towards but I don't think
that this is gonna compete with the
Samsung and LG super phones that we're
gonna see of course and they are going
after the high-end with the key one I
think it's about $500
and then we've got Nokia on the other
side with the Nokia 3 5 and 6 and their
Android phones which are much more the
lower end of things and this is the
first time that Nokia has come out with
an Android phone yeah it is and I think
that's it says a lot about what where
they're aiming their brand right now in
the low-end with these phones they're
not doing a and all-singing all-dancing
phone which for me is a big
disappointment I wanted to see them
relaunch with a big fanfare and this
amazing phone but we've gone for low-end
and I do think it shows because the
designs they're not that exciting
they're a little bit kind of what we've
come to see from a lot of the lower end
brands from China and just kind of
playing metal designs perfectly nice
though so do you think that's enough to
really get people behind Nokia again I
don't know I mean I think that there are
a lot of people who always want an
inexpensive phone but the funny thing
for me also is that one of those phones
isn't even a smart phone yeah of course
but we've had a relaunch of Nokia 3310
this is a phone that we first saw 17
years ago and it's back again but it
hasn't really changed all that much
physically it looks basically the same
has got colourful designs bubbly buttons
and but and functionally it's not a
smart phone so you don't get whatsapp
Twitter Instagram on there you've just
got things like calendar contacts there
is a camera but it's very very basic so
this is not a phone for the smartphone
lovers yeah this doesn't sound like it's
gonna replace your phone it sounds like
it would maybe be an addition
phone something you could give to your
kids or take to a fest of all but you
know you're gonna lose all something
like that but it's going to be very very
affordable so I think Nokia's going
after emerging markets with this rather
than the people who love the smartphone
so I think it'll be interesting to see
how that does so basically we've got two
different approaches blackberry on the
high end
Nokia on the low end and I think that
they're going to meet in the middle
eventually we'll have BlackBerry's start
to release some cheaper lower end
products and hopefully we're gonna see
Nokia come out with that phone that you
want the super high-end device yeah I
think something very exciting to watch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
