it's back-to-school time the time some
parents look forward to and most kids
don't why not help out the enterprising
student in your life with something that
will help them get the most out of the
new school year here are the top 5 tech
gifts for students as picked by senior
editors and number 5 was a sony action
cam mini when you're young and you have
lots of energy there's a chance you
might do some friggin awesome stuff
you'll need documentation of that in
some way and the sony action cam Mini is
affordable at a bit over $200 and it's
tiny so it can be mounted to all kinds
of odd places it's also splash proof in
case things get a little crazy your
student gets video of cool stuff while
their phones stay safe and tucked away
number four is an AV gear for increased
productivity students need breaks what
will they do during their downtime relax
by putting something on TV but kids
aren't watching cable or live TV they're
streaming everything so how about a nice
new Roku 2 it's got a super-fast
interface and searches through lots of
apps to find something to watch plus it
pretty much runs every video streaming
service you can think of what's that
your student doesn't have a TV get him a
new TV then check out the Vizio e-series
they start around $400 for a 40 inch
screen tablets might be getting more and
more powerful but it's really hard to
beat a real computer at number three is
a laptop since this machine's gonna be
deluged from classroom to classroom it
should be lightweight on the windows
side check out the 2.8 pound Dell XPS 13
the screen is near bezel lists that
means you get 13 inch display in the
same body size as an 11 or 12 inch
laptop it starts at around $800 but if
you can swing it
we suggest pumping up the XPS 13 with
some upgrades like a touchscreen and an
Intel Core i5 processor Apple fans will
be pleased with a three-pound 13-inch
MacBook Air the last update brought
improved battery life in our tests this
thing ran 18 hours on a charge 18 hours
the most forgetful student will have a
hard time running into a dead laptop but
the MacBook Air at number two is a good
pair of headphones particularly the bose
soundtrue headphones they're light and
easy to travel with since they all fold
up seeing that David car noise says the
bose soundtrue headphones are ultra
comfortable and delivers smooth
generally well balanced fairly open
sound as a student I've always found the
headphones indispensable either they
help me drown on noisy roommates block
outside world or help me hear a lecture
online also who doesn't like listening
to music as a distraction from the
rigors of education at number one is a
new smartphone if you're looking to gift
an Apple iPhone you might want to hold
off and get an Apple gift card for now
because Apple has a tendency to rev
iPhones in September on the Android side
though seeing that to Jessica dull court
really likes the Samsung Galaxy s6
active it costs the same as the regular
Galaxy s6 but features a sturdier build
and it's water-resistant oh and it has a
3,500 milliamp hour battery which is
quite the improvement on the s6 is 25 50
milliamp hour battery however it is a
bit plasticky style-conscious students
might like the galaxy s6 or the HTC One
m9 better for all of our vex school pics
