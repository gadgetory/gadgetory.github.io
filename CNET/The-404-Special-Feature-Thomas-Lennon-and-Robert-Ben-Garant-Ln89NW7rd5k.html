music I appreciate that what's going on
everyone thanks for tuning in to a very
special edition of the 404 show today
I'm very lucky I've got two fantastic
comedians uh maybe tempered luckiness
quote-on-quote I admire you gentlemen a
great deal you may know them from their
work on the infamous MTV sketch show the
state or Comedy Central's Reno 911
mm-hmm which had six seasons of glory
mmm it's a five and then one that was
that the fans hated one that was a
divider almost beyond that line in the
sand
yeah or is the writers of the Night at
the Museum movie which I tell people
they're surprised by that they didn't
know that it's a fun fact we have a
pretty uh schizophrenic career I guess
yeah eclectic what you call a crazy dude
who's like wearing a tinfoil hat it's a
bus station schizophrenic sure yeah not
a not eclectic street dweller who say I
made you up kind of career that's not a
collective that's yeah yeah well there's
nothing wrong with you guys you seem
like very well-put-together dudes
you're here because your latest
collaboration is a film called hell baby
yes
which tells the ridiculous story of what
happens to a an expecting couple
expecting twins they move into a haunted
house in New Orleans yes the movie was
almost had a couple different titles yes
one of the titles is something that
keegan-michael key who plays for now and
yes at one point he says folks just call
it death boogie you all Hathaway and we
almost called the movie house on down
and everything the whole thing um but
then it seemed like a little long yeah
we almost know little baby - yes I'm
gonna go out on a limb actually like
hell baby - better than help hell baby -
is pretty funny to me it makes more
sense for we pitched it to folks and
people were other didn't like a fuse we
didn't really like hell baby how much
either
hell maybe two is growing on me baby
it's only a small sort of edit I feel
like yeah SEO wouldn't really kill ya
yeah well we figured out a whole
backstory that he'll maybe one was
unreleasable press junket we know there
was a he'll be well anyway I'd like to
introduce you fine gentlemen Thomas
Lennon robert ben garant thanks for
being here thank you this is a pleasure
I love your guys and stuff I've been
watching since I'm a wee lad this date
and all that special for me age that we
meet a lot of people who were raised on
the state yes you know yeah parents had
left them unattended no say yeah your
parents kind of left you unattended yeah
yeah you basically raised yourselves
yeah why are your cutters long dwellers
yes the basement we are the basement
tapes yes yeah I love it
we were kids too we were only like cuz
we were doing live by the time it was
done yeah over with this it was canceled
off CBS by the time we were 25 yes it's
kind of amazing because it's a different
it was it wasn't that long ago where in
the grand scheme of things and the era
of entertainment and what we have now
right think about when the state was on
there's no internet no the only and
cable was fairly 24-hour enable
HBO used to go off the air which kids
don't know ones like Native American
yeah but that's the thing if the state
were to exist now I don't think well the
birthday boys have a TV show yeah they
do but I don't I don't know that we
would have ever gotten into television
subsequently everything that we do yeah
if we hadn't been we we probably would
have done like Funny or Die videos and
stuff then that's the equivalent I mean
because it was on your dive videos and
and drugs and drugs sure yeah and it's
that around and playing Goldeneye
the state so I heard this where we were
talking briefly before we went on that
old and I double-oh-seven almost
destroyed the state we lost Jan first
heeda's and I was not Todd went off to
Joe Joe yeah we just closed you just
with the golden none of us had ever seen
a video game like Goldeneye well just
drop like flies
yeah he would spend all night playing it
and deafening stay playing it nobody
went outside their throat comedy jokes I
lived with like a really attractive like
twenty-two year old actress I didn't pay
any attention to her no those were the
days because I was literally just
sitting puffing on merit playing
Goldeneye yeah that's it I mean how do
you kill a guy in the wall zoom in so
you like throw a hat every now and then
call to each other on your landline to
ask how you kill people on the dam so
excited to slip your hands so it really
like it just destroyed it's just that
this rated product Goldeneye and missed
missed yeah the the year that mist came
out it put the whole group on hiatus for
about six months
yeah so they're all playing we're all
separate dwellings playing miss so
depressing and little did you know
you're like you have this amazing
opportunity you have youth it's a
beautiful oyster when you like okay when
you light the burner and you turn the
heat up and then you walk to the rocket
ship what is in the rocket ship code oh
yeah because you gotta remember to
switch for go play the piano first then
light the burner meanwhile there's
actual orgies happening in New York City
like largest store he's covered with
work and we're trying to figure out
missed that's amazing you guys I know
from there's a there's a telltale aspect
of my life which is right around the
time right after golden oh yeah I quit
videogames forever really yes forever I
never looked back like a drug
subsequently been and I've had 10 or 11
films that got made yeah yeah and I
can't help but notice that I feel like
there's n TV shows a correlation four or
five failed pilots yeah like there's a
correlation yeah between me not spending
like 14 hours at 16 hours a day
wondering how to wandering around trying
to have trying to kill the guy up on the
up on the dam you guys are really making
me question
happy no no I know it's just a we're not
even that entertaining anyway it's true
no we have a lot of yeah how's their
show going
exactly well how about that all right
well let's talk about what you guys have
been working on for a little while hell
baby no baby this is a genre that I
don't think I've seen from you guys yet
you guys have watching I could talk
about horror movies more like mom like
when you're moving comes out we get very
excited we tell there's oh you gotta see
the orphanage you got to see dumb more
than we get excited about like when a
comedy comes out what a comedy comes out
it's like oh yeah yeah work like work
yeah I mean if I really you know get
excited about it but horror movie feels
like work horror movies feel like a
vacation yeah it's really yeah so what's
your favorite our all-time uh either The
Changeling with Georgie Scott say what
you want
The Exorcist is very hard to top Thank
You sixes for a time - yeah it'll still
scare the balls yeah before anything
happens what's real quiet it's real
quiet the quiet ones orphanage is very
quiet directed he didn't but it's
beautiful creepy slow fantastic
two times in orphanage that you'll get
actual like the hair on your body will
stand up really good if you ever seen
the Exorcist three no was unaware of
it's also rare see Scott okay Red Dwarf
plays the Scorpio killer it's great I'll
tell you right now if you don't gasp out
loud and clench your butt super hard
yeah it's got two great scares they're
two of the best years in movies are in
really weird your hand they make you
wait for it wait you wait wait wait wait
so long to leave you more than two but
two of them are bonafide
you can see the movie hundred times mama
actually has a moment did you see mama
now
mom is terrific mama has a moment that
sort of inspired by that long as a long
hallway singing The Exorcist rewrite
that they just make you sit and wait and
you keep thinking something scary's
gonna happen but you can't you know it's
most on the book it's based on lead
Legion book okay Gary's book I read that
book and I got it out of the house I
like took it to a donation place and
gave it away because the fair enough and
the movies good our film hell maybe is
not as scary as that what was good for
it to be sometimes scaring sure Yelp's
rob corddry yells out I am so sick of
being startled is exactly right yes it's
not yeah
when they cast came together originally
we were gonna pepper it with some horror
movie guys like some serious actors okay
a head of the Vatican who sciences were
thinking should but then like that he
was the last best place and of maybe a
serious actor and as you I have seen it
thoroughly it's it's very silly it's
between Exorcist three and the cannibal
run - okay yes yes if you like if you'd
like those films you're like man I wish
somebody would mash up those two ideas
because three animals been a void yeah
must have been some weirdo who was
planning for that yes yeah maybe
and you so I I watched the film a couple
days ago if you like if you're a fan of
ghost dogs if you're a fan of zombie
blowjobs yes oh yeah that's pretty so
much better just goes dogs in zombie
budgets in fact and the time for their
like the release in Europe yeah let's
call it yeah
ghost dogs and zombie blowjob in Italian
that'll be great
yeah that's great all right well the
blow jobs correctly ladies smoking and
drinking no yeah whose letters a lot of
paint thinner actually she does vintage
porn which is I have you know it was a
big long fight to get the rights to we
magazine I didn't even know that was
though you I it was a very good class
will show when a young gentleman was
interested in some pornography sure it
was also thought-provoking yeah are you
using enough Kirschwasser in your fondue
sure who's that yeah and then they
ladies yeah yeah it was just a better
time it was a bush now we had to track
down the guy who owned the rights to it
when he picked up the photos just was
slippery all the time drop the phone
again it if you like all these things
and my personal favorite making fun of
Ashton Kutcher specific yeah we stopped
for a while to do that in this movie
long brachial where we we talk about
Kutcher's choice of the kinds of cameras
and printers that he endorses sure yes
that improv actually went on for about
15 quite a bit longer were the four of a
set around and talked about what camera
I think we use and what printers yes
sure no he's probably made more money
off Nikon Oh without a doubt and we have
in show business
yes easily I'm pretty sure I've seen
pictures of his house in a magazine yeah
yeah always working out great
yeah we give me all the problems we talk
about in the film we also talk for a
long time about making something called
pizza salad yes where you take a
Domino's Pizza toss it in a bowl with a
salad right also from Domino's yeah and
that's kind of not to spoil the movie
but it's kind of the climax of
and that wasn't product placement we had
to go to dominos information them your
permission about honey and we're like oh
yeah I'm like well we're making this
kind of gross horror movie okay already
we're not excited for a long time
they're changing their image you notice
they're going digital with the whole
like have you seen oh yeah you wouldn't
you wait there's a little low the dude
cooking yeah and he tells you to cracks
jokes and stuff yeah and you could pick
it could be like a minute oh well how
much of hell baby were you sort of
letting the actors because you guys you
guys produce this film you wrote it and
you directed it as well it's about 80
but we did a lot of improv the final cut
is probably about 80% scripted okay a
lot of the weird thing is some things
that don't seem scripted are yeah and
then something teaches salad big thing
first draft long speech about how flat
dr. pepper is still pretty good but the
whole movie ends with this wonderful
speech many of the characters know it's
a dramatic sort of song about race
relations that was that was totally as
you're walking down the street you don't
even get as much as hello right unless
he looks at them in the most
unbelievably early self-satisfied way
and says for now hello yeah and it's the
stupidest it ain't right it's out of
nowhere
and we're always like from like a cheesy
like Hallmark Hall face but it is really
the end of our movie yeah and that was
improv that was young they just said
that yeah I don't know why you would put
that in the script it seemed a little
very long yeah Riki Lindhome
has a seven minute full frontal oiled up
nude scene that is in no way trinsic to
the plot like yeah which my responses
and yes I need to show you my note and
why are you so mad at me
the notes that I almost verbatim it was
an interesting thing to pitch to her
yeah how did that work it went amazingly
well yeah well no convincing Ricky does
a podcast called making it okay which is
terrific podcast if you get a chance to
listen to man she asked people like how
you get into the industry and such and I
realized that she has such a great
she's like the sort of the live-action
Janis from the Electric Mayhem okay so
you're like that sexy there's gonna be
weird sexy
you're like a muppet that I want to take
all our clothes off yeah cover an oil
and make a film about how is that weird
to say out loud that's weird I just want
to say that's provocative yeah I'm gonna
go with you'll read about myself weird
yeah I don't feel good about myself
because I was picturing myself sort of
you know scenario did put it played out
verbatim like so I said to Ricky
um hey there's a scene in the movie a
very funny character but the
introduction scene is kind of weird just
as a nudity I said yeah yeah I think
when you're Ricky people creepy guys
with mustaches frequently say I got if
you want to be in a picture and she done
it because he's sitting it could be and
I don't know why I'm making fun of that
because that's exactly what it's gonna
be you know the pitch all right although
it's not a sexual scene it's just long
very long and they uh yeah you know and
that really that seems about one it's
about her being uninhibited it's also
just so that fernell can come in one
more time and say and it's perfect cuz
it's right off camera just yeah that's
really a lot of it's a you know it
doesn't get a lot of fun make yeah he's
your really good young I'm stressed
about making it make sense and right
following a bunch of like terrific
structure that would make it really
satisfying people really all got to be
funny and normally a couple of people in
the movie have to sort of play the
straight man and we well you can check
it out it's on demand right now and in
theaters September 6 yep excellent so
please do that I want to talk real quick
about you guys recently did an AMA on
reddit and you guys have never really
liked everything yeah yeah it was pretty
great like people have immediate
interaction like immediate feedback
great questions oh yeah Paul it was cool
you brought some truly genius questions
on the radio really funny yeah it took
the pressure off but the fans were fun
question if you google it is someone
sent in a question that was just
day-to-day - with a question mark and we
answered it at length yeah day two we
also answered at length
did you see the our piece about Gotham
City flippers no I did it might be a new
show that we do someone asked why my
character in memento was also in the
Dark Knight Rises right you played and I
said it's because I'm also I've moved
from California to Gotham to start
flipping apartments every time there's a
supervillain attack right yeah yeah you
buy up the properties near the bridge
Bane blue real cheap I mean the Martinus
name show blows up a ferry for people
yeah you can get some deal places around
our code on't yeah I've imagined that
ten block radius around or you gotta be
almost like the militarized almost
giving it away but then a vinyl record
stores come in hipsters move in the
Renaissance begins and then Arkham
there's a break and all the hipsters are
murdered by the Riddler yeah that's also
look out for I did I think red it's
amazing specifically for the AMAs
because John Malkovich did one a month
back only changes your life a little
bats pretty good you read that and the
the you know
to death oh yeah this dude and ever and
because you're because you're trained
and you're conditioned to read all of
his responses in his voice
yeah only your brandnew so far I need
this gun to kill the president yeah
exactly
it's just like this never we got to talk
about Reno we're almost out of time but
I have to talk about Reno no you know
that was a fantastic show on Comedy
Central
Tom you played lieutenant dangle who's
there like a sexually ambiguous always
ask what is whatever you find out about
lieutenant dangle dangle makes out with
a man sure in the pilot rolls like a
these guys maybe got so many Kazi we
don't know about there's no closet oh we
know about it there's no closet for a
GLAAD award we didn't win it but ah that
make out is the thing that kept us off
of Fox pretty much because we originally
did the pilot for the year they wanted
us all crazy time but we shot that show
for Fox you know the idea is it would be
a companion piece right after cops we
know yes oh really
to polar I got a sketch show that was
cancelled and we're like well what if
the slot would have been the right after
coppers I think 9:30 p.m. on Saturday
nights and we're like oh my god what if
we just do the show that was on right
before us but as a sketch show right Oh
another weird thing about it is in the
pilot of Reno we play the cops and all
of the play every okay yeah it's kind of
like a Little Britain yeah it really
does feel like a sketch show you pull up
to a house and walk in and we're also
the people in the house that are doing a
domestic dispute that's right like Harry
played throwing hooker yeah we ended up
phasing it out for the most part yeah
there was a big comedy central note
there like when they bought it three
it's out on the show for three years
right that's too stupid yeah cuz it was
like a muppet show yes literally it's
like the mullet show because we've
always been putting on like fake like
teeth and wigs and then we'd keep
catching ourselves and it was pretty
dumb yeah they have that power that we
should put it on the internet because I
think everyone would appreciate that we
good parts of it are good yeah the one
thing that stayed TT yeah
yeah I wanted with the big floppy that's
apparently good that good hair I've got
that but you know I've got a nice ease
but in my basement yes oh really those
button to move had a lot of Reno stuff
in my house just because it had to be
stored somewhere so one of the things is
a huge prosthetic behind mmm which I'm
sure it could come in handy masturbate
she did a spread and we yeah we're gonna
get a call from the Jim Henson people
being like sexualize Janice really may
have we're just gonna have our hands up
there that's right you means that's our
bad I'm curious how you guys feel about
the characters on that show we talked
about dangle for a bit and you played
deputy jr. who's clearly visually
impaired simpleton Jim well I'm from
Tennessee and all of my uncle's think
that's an impression of them oh do they
really it's not that's not nice yeah
they they think that I'm sort of do
uncle who I can't quite understand I was
in Vegas with Ben and his uncle was
coming round the corner yeah I'm
literally don't know what that was yeah
everybody all around in there all right
yeah we're going yet yeah yeah even that
doesn't make I tell just agree yeah
you're going on it don't do it
so just agree yeah who's your guys
favorite character outside of the
regular cast I just want to tell you
real quick sure Steve little oh the guy
from the future yeah come on yeah they
would not explain to me it was not
excited me not explained to me
he says like your mother did to me the
way that we do auditions yeah for Reno
is people come in and we just ask you in
solving problems do you call us or - or
did where we called about you and they
say hello somebody probably called you
guys about me and you say okay and then
you walk up and then Steve little turns
around and goes hey would not expect to
be judge and you have no idea what to do
like all I said is what if I don't have
any clothes on I have cocaine great
great it was not explained to me that's
how we measure oh yeah came in and
started trying to change her trying to
change panties while we were arresting
her for being drunk but she was like and
she kept pulling different things that
she wanted it was like she was really
high and she couldn't decide what she
wanted to be wearing and she was right
you didn't like anything she had on but
she also didn't like anything in the
back no we just started and then we
tried to pick her up and she we were
like she could kind of go to limp in yes
I grew up with one hand right uh so that
was that was always very impressive
keegan-michael key obviously was in hell
baby yeah because of his he would always
pretend to not know he stole things I'm
not saying I'm saying that white male 35
years old yeah that's a great character
the most it's so funny the most with
with yeah toby huss you said what if I
have like a do-rag in a packet he's
really accurate to cops yes Jackson
screams like always just screaming at
somebody I'm great you're come the cops
from Assam Big Mac yeah Nick swardson's
always a lot of love Nick Nick is no one
cracks himself up more than Nick you can
he laughs at his own style you head it
around but Nick it is funny and it's
like why that's why I just but I just
have you keep our camera mechanics to
kind of after nick says something funny
go to us yeah that's a good thing about
the moustache if you go like this you
can laugh in the moustache and it covers
your face
exelon nobody really knows what you're
doing yeah you know the icon Street man
right there Jim rash always made look
look look
jack plotnick esteem more mellow yes
this is a goof I am doing this as a goof
like even like Patton Oswald like like
he'd never got the opportunity he'd
always come in and he's like the LARP
guy right yeah he's the dungeons
dragster of escaping was the booze
hammer of Galen booze hammer of Galen
character and nobody ever got none of
these guys got to just come and be their
craziest you know come in just say
whatever came to their mind and have
like a 10-minute long insane scene right
my favorite one of you we said hey
Patton there's like could we will walk
up to you and let's say there was a D&amp;amp;D
game and somebody somebody got actually
shot with an arrow or as it got so he go
in the background there's a neck yeah
and we will we'll just we won't
interrupt you too much right so we ended
up I think Patton told like a 20 minute
story sure yes and you can see so what
happened and then he talks for 20
minutes about 100 s which is the longer
one for long I smoked an entire one yeah
in the shot then you see me finish it
start another one and then I finished
that one off and he just tells the story
and occasionally we ask him just to
clarify something but that's about it
yeah it wasn't an actual dragon or was
it was really fun because sometimes
sometimes we wouldn't even have a plan I
have a plan
no it just it seemed like it was a lot I
hope it's it is there any you know
hopefully it could come back through
like a thing like Netflix yeah they
offered us they have offered it and I
don't know if that offers still on the
table but at one point they offered it I
will say it was before everything on
Netflix exploded in the stratosphere
right so we didn't really know what it
that was it was Netflix was very early
auditor and they're like what if you do
more for these of like a Twin Peaks you
know dude to do one sort of like during
history that firewall episodes the only
thing we know about is it starts with
they find a body wrapped up in plastic
yeah and dangle is on a discount
cigarette like stop smoking chantix
medicine
it's like a knockoff from Canada yeah so
it's like a sort of a beautiful art film
version you might possibly alright it

here
