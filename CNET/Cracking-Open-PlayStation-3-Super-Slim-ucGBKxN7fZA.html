year away Sony wants to squeeze every
bit of profit it can out of the ps3 and
what better way to do that then release
a redesigned version that's slimmer and
probably cheaper to make I'm Bill
Detweiler and on this episode of
cracking open we're going inside the
PlayStation 3 super slim the super slim
is Sony's third ps3 version it's the
same width and roughly the same height
as the PlayStation 3 slim but its sides
are significantly shorter now like its
predecessor the super slim has two USB
ports and a hard drive activity light
along the front around the back you'll
find the same Ethernet HDMI optical
audio and ps3 AV ports found on the
previous model but from here on out
things are a bit different for starters
the new machines optical drive has a
manual sliding disc cover instead of a
motorized slot loading mechanism now
this design likely helped Sony cut both
costs and save space but it just feels
cheap and as seen it's Jeff Bakalar
wrote it's ultimately a step back now
another change is how you access the
hard drive the original ps3 hard drive
was accessed through a panel on the side
Sony moved that access point to the
front on the ps3 slim and now they've
gone right back to the side but on the
super slim you just remove the whole
side panel and not just a small cover
and this is where our teardown begins
after removing the hard drive I removed
three rubber feet that run along the
back and side of the unit's bottom and a
void if removed warranty sticker next I
remove the screws that were all
underneath next I removed the three
screws from the side of the case where
the hard drive is now two of the top
cover screws are accessible by opening
the drive door but to remove the other
ones you'll need to pop off the pieces
of shiny plastic molding that run along
the front and rear edges of the top
cover with all the external screws
removed we can pop off the top half of
the case and get our first look inside
the console
the super Slim's internal layout is very
similar to that of the ps3 slim the
optical drive is mounted in the front
right corner the cooling fan to the side
and the power supply along the back the
motherboard is under it all now both
interiors are a far cry from the
original ps3s the optical drive assembly
comes out next by incorporating the disk
enclosure into the super Slim's
actual case Sony definitely saved a
little space inside the unit
I suspect the new drive is also cheaper
now like the optical drive the new
machines power supply is smaller than
the ps3 Slim's it's also rated for fewer
amps so the new console appears to be
drawing less current than its
predecessors after removing a few more
screws I lifted out the motherboard and
shield assembly
unlike the ps3 slim you can't remove the
fan without removing the whole assembly
and then separating the shield from the
motherboard now given the super Slim's
more compact design it's not surprising
that the cooling fan is smaller than the
one in the larger slim now with the
shield assembly removed we get our first
look at the motherboard compared to the
ps3 Slim's board this one is smaller and
the chips are placed closer together
Sony also removed the heat spreader from
the reality synthesizer package swapped
Marvell's discrete Wireless board for a
newer marvel WLAN Bluetooth sock and
went with two one gigabit XDR DRAM chips
for the machines main memory instead of
the older versions for 512 mega bit
chips with our teardown complete it's
clear and a bit disappointing that Sony
wasn't trying to upgrade the ps3 line
with the super slim just refine it so
that begs the question why would they do
this well as I said in the beginning I
think it comes down to cost the new
optical drive redesigned motherboard and
all the other changes likely make the
console
cheaper to manufacture and given that
Sony hasn't lowered the price at least
not at launch they're making more on
each unit sold and if they do lower the
price later this year or definitely once
the PlayStation 4 comes out the lower
production cost lets them keep making
money on the ps3
now if you're thinking about buying one
of the new ps3 super Slim's check out
Jeff Bakalar full CNET review for
real-world tests and pricing information
