doesn't do you any good if you can't see
what's on it thankfully Mac OS has a
number of settings to help you see more
clearly what's on your Mac screen here
are seven things to tweak to see your
Mac better for Mac's with Retina
displays Apple offers what it calls
scaled resolutions to bump the size of
text and icons on the screen to change
this setting open system preferences and
go to displays there you'll see two
options at the top of the window for
resolution default for display and
scaled choose scaled and depending on
the size of your Retina display you'll
have four or five options choose one of
the two options on the larger text side
to make it easier to read what's on your
display if you don't have a Retina
display you can still make text bigger
on an app by app basis and the messages
app for example go to messages
preferences than general and move the
slider at the bottom for text size and
many other apps including Chrome and
Safari you can increase text size along
with everything else by hitting command
+ you can then lower it by hitting
command - if your desktop icons are too
small to be useful you can increase
their size along with the text of their
descriptions right-click on the desktop
and choose show view options there
you'll get settings for increasing icon
size and text size choose the ones that
fit your needs the best if you keep
losing track of your Mac's tiny cursor
you can also increase the size of that
or you can just make it so that it's
easier to find when you do lose track of
it to do this go to System Preferences
accessibility and then display then move
the slider to the right for cursor size
to make it larger you can also check the
box for Shake mouse pointer to locate
then all you need to do is wiggle your
mouse very quickly or slide your finger
back and forth on the trackpad to
temporarily increase the size of the
pointer so you can find where it is on
the screen you can also let Mac OS
automatically adjust the brightness of
your display based on the ambient
lighting around you to do this go to
System Preferences and then displays and
in the display tab check the box for
automatically adjust brightness when
there's less ambient light it will
actually dim the screen of your display
and when it's brighter outside or around
you your screen will increase brightness
there are actually two settings within
accessibility in System Preferences
worth checking out
one is called increased contrast and the
other is
called reduce transparency click display
from the left panel and then check the
box for increased contrast this reduces
transparency of windows and makes the
borders of buttons tabs and other items
more visible if the increase in contrast
is too stark of a change for you than
try checking the box for the setting
directly beneath it called reduce
transparency
this makes the semi-transparent headers
of windows a solid gray staring at a
blue screen before you go to bed can
affect your body's natural circadian
rhythm and make it difficult to get a
good night's rest
fortunately Apple has a setting for that
as well with Apple's a night shift
feature the colors of your display are
shifted away from harsh blues to the
warmer end of the spectrum during the
evening hours to enable and schedule it
head to system preferences than displays
and click the night shift tab there you
can set it to come on automatically
between sunset and sunrise or manually
set a time period for it to be activated
you can then use the slider below to
adjust a color temperature of the effect
between less warm and more for more tips
and tricks and other how to's be sure to
