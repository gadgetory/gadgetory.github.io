for all the world looks like a baby BMW
x6 they'll go all the way up to a 577
horsepower twin-turbo v8 AMG version but
for most people maybe the 350d diesel
makes a little more sense and around
April or so we'll get a more
conventional non coupe version of this
same vehicle without the rakish roofline
but in either case gles now replace the
old ml and they'll be hitting the
streets summer of 2015
board was all about performance at
Detroit this year the shelby gt350 r
elevates the new Mustang to its most
track sharp level it's got a 5.2 liter
v8 but no turbos no superchargers still
gets around 500 horse on about 400 pound
feet of torque and uses something called
a flat plane crank shaft real
performance tech that along with very
exotic carbon fiber wheels and no air
conditioning or radio unless you insist
make this a very rarefied beast and the
new Ford GT stole the show in many ways
it's the latest version of Ford's
classic 1960s race car and its really
got some serious power 600 horsepower
from just a 3.5 liter EcoBoost engine in
the middle is a carbon fibre tub with
aluminum subframes around it an active
pushrod suspension it's basically a race
car you can register the new Chevy Volt
revises the look of that car for the
first time and it's substantially
cleaner and more subtle it's now up to
50 miles of range in pure EV mode and
volt buyers really pay attention to that
that's a gain of around a dozen miles
before it kicks into a hybrid mode and
it can seat five finally thanks to the
fact that the battery hump in the back
seat is now submerged and just to make
for some phonetic fun Chevy also showed
the new concept called the bolt it's
their pure electric car project with 200
miles of range and a look and color than
a rather reminiscent of a BMW i3 they
say you'll be able to get one for about
thirty thousand dollars after government
credits but the bigger cloud over its
horizon is the specter of continued
really cheap gas
this Buick a venir concept was vying for
what may be the best-looking shape on
the floor this year now it's all styling
exercise but you can see they've really
pulled in a Buick classic that line
across the top side of the body it's a
Buick spear if you will I don't know if
this is going to come to market in any
shape remotely like this but I can hope
and Buick hasn't sold a convertible
since the riata went away in 1991 but
that's about to change here is a
reworked version of a European GM car
that's going to be called the cascada
here convertibles tend to do well in
rising economic times and this one's
tidy and trim so should be relatively
economical on both purchase and
operation but a quick look at the rear
seat and trunk space may make it a bit
of a tough sell or at least a second car
and the acura nsx wasn't literally new
at detroit but to see it in final
production trim was this is it still
mid-engine like the original but now
with three electric motors tossed in one
between the engine and the transaxle in
the back and another pair detailed to
run the front wheels for wickedly fast
and intuitive all-wheel drive they say
custom orders will start in the summer
around 150,000 dollars and you may be
lucky enough to see one pull up to you
next to a stoplight by fall of 2015</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
