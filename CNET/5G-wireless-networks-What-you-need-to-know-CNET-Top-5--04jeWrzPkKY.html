to know about 5g right now a lot of us
are using 4G LTE networks on our phones
5g is the next generation mobile network
and it's coming soon so will it make
everything super amazing kind of let's
get to it
at number five it's coming soon AT&amp;amp;T
says it will have mobile 5g up and
running in 12 cities by the end of 2018
Waco Atlanta and Dallas are three of the
cities that have been named AT&amp;amp;T is also
a special case and has branded some of
its services 5g evolution that is not
the same thing as true 5g the standard
AT&amp;amp;T claims the 5g evolution is the
foundation for 5g every major US carrier
has said they will have 5g up and
running in 2019 and number four
increased capacity 4G networks can still
get overloaded the 5g network can handle
a lot more everything it can pump out a
lot of data Verizon will be offering
in-home 5g connections to three to five
US markets in 2018 so far Sacramento and
Los Angeles have been confirmed to be
two of those and there won't be data
caps 5g can handle more devices to
expect a lot more connected devices
since the network is built to handle it
number three low latency and that's a
good thing
that means there's less of a lag between
you requesting data and you getting data
when you're using a 5g device this
should allow for crazier experiences
like watching a basketball game live in
virtual reality it can also allow for
vehicles to get incredibly important
information about its surroundings from
other connected devices to avoid
crashing into other objects and number
two the pucks the first mobile devices
on the 5g network are not likely to be
phones or tablets AT&amp;amp;T CEO says expect
pucks that work like mobile hotspots to
be the first to use a mobile connection
to 5g why is this chip makers say a 5g
compatible radio that can fit into a
phone will not be likely to appear until
early 2019 AT&amp;amp;T has said he wants 5g
deployed in 2018
and the number one thing you need to
know about 5g is the speed there is a
difference between theoretical speeds
and what you'll actually see the average
mobile speed in the US was around 20
megabits per second according to okla
the people behind speedtest.net a
Verizon senior VP said a user on 5g
should be getting around one gigabit for
a second that's 50 times faster than the
average mobile speed thanks to Roger
Cheng for his help on this episode are
you thinking about getting 5g in your
home let me know am i as act tired I'll
see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
