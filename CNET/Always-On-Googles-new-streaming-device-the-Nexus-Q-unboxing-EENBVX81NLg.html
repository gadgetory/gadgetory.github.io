q or as i like to call it the google
what the it is an android streaming
media device and we're going to unbox it
for the first time right here by the way
this thing is heavy all of the
comparisons to bowling balls seem pretty
accurate it's cut the other sign here I
mean look at this thing it is heavy like
a bowling ball the weird top does
actually turn and then when you plug it
in there's these like menacing lights
that go around the end ok I'll stop
making fun of the bowling ball thing and
give you the specs the Nexus Q is
basically an android based media hub
it's like a competitor to the apple TV
it can stream music movies and TV shows
to external speakers it runs a version
of Android 4.1 talks to your other
Android devices the Nexus Q only streams
Google Play content like music Google
Play Movies TV and YouTube so that
limited selection problem is definitely
huge here it does have a built in amp so
you can use it to power a set of
speakers which google sells separately
there's 16 gigabytes of onboard flash
memory and one gig of ram it has a micro
HDMI output for hooking up to a TV or
cable box there's an optical audio port
there's an Ethernet jack and a micro USB
port for what google calls general hack
ability whatever that means it also has
built-in Wi-Fi Bluetooth and NFC so it
can talk to your NFC enabled phone or
tablet now you control the Nexus Q with
your Android phone or tablet and google
also says that it's a social streaming
media player so I guess a bunch of
people with Android phones could kind of
collaborate on a playlist that kind of
thing now the headline of this thing
when all other Google TV devices and
Apple TV costs $99 this one is 299 and
it looks like a weird little bowling
ball I mean I got to say I think it's a
little bit of a non-starter can you say
vanity project
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
