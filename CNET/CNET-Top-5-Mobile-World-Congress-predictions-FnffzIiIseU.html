about the next generation of smart
phones coming down the pipe there's no
better place than Mobile World Congress
which kicks off at the end of februari
in Barcelona but for an early peek at
what's in store i quiz seen that senior
editors Jessica dole court and Brian
Bennett on the products and trends they
expect to see so here you go cnet's top
5 predictions for the 2013 Mobile World
Congress as predicted by the editors who
will be there starting off at number 5
quad-core smartphones with 1080p screens
nvidia Qualcomm and Samsung all involved
on a full encore war right now so
quad-core will be the norm at this show
and of course the other battlefront to
screen quality and nothing says that
better than 1080p in your pocket both of
these specs will be all the buzz in
Barcelona at number four windows phone 8
now that the Windows 8 desktop OS is out
the door it's time from Microsoft to
show how the latest Windows Phone
devices will seamlessly tie it all in
we'll be looking for some new flagship
Windows smart phones but there's also a
chance we'll see a few tablets running
Windows Phone 8 i'm not sure if the
world needs another windows tablet OS
but maybe the third time's a charm
coming in at number three a new Nokia
phone now Nokia took some hard knocks
over the past few years but phones like
the Lumia 920 have shown that they can
still crank out an exciting phone or two
and now that Microsoft has their back
you've got to underdogs with a chip on
their shoulder and something to prove
hopefully that's a recipe for awesome at
number two a new Samsung Galaxy Note now
if you're looking for an Android
smartphone or tablet with an integrated
stylus samsung has you covered this year
the rumors are pointing to an eight inch
version of the note but maybe you also
get a peek at something smaller or maybe
a giant 20 inch version or a helicopter
or sea cow as long as there isn't an
apple patent on it I think Samsung will
try anything but there is one thing that
they won't try at Mobile World Congress
a launch of the galaxy s4 now according
to our editors Samsung's flagship
smartphone is a big enough deal to
warrant a special party all its own
later this year the good news is your
brand new galaxy s3 won't feel outdated
for at least a few more months
alright and now the number one thing our
cnet editors predict for the 2013 Mobile
World Congress a new flagship phone from
HTC Samsung dominated Android phones
last year and now it's time for HTC to
come back swinging in fact they've
already had some rumors here bubbling up
let's say it's going to be a quad-core
phone with a 1080p display who could
have guessed whatever it is let's hope
it puts HTC back in the game so those
are the predictions for Mobile World
Congress which kicks off in Barcelona on
Monday februari 25th our editors will be
covering that show from top to bottom so
