Bridget Carey this is your CNET update
Google is making a bigger push to become
the leader of smart home gadgetry
through nest a company it purchased last
year that makes smart home thermostats
smoke detectors and it also owns the
Dropcam home monitoring cameras wellness
just announced a few upgrades to its
product line it's ditching the Dropcam
brand for a new name it's now the nest
cam and it's upgraded with 1080p
resolution so you can monitor your pets
in high-def clarity this indoor camera
costs $200 and it brings night vision
and motion and sound alert monitoring if
you want to archive your video footage
that's gonna be an extra service you
have to buy called nest aware it starts
at $10 a month an upgraded nest
Protect's smoke detector is coming out
next month for $100 if it detects smoke
it can tell your nest thermostat to turn
off and then send your phone and alert
also getting an upgrade is Amazon's
Kindle paperwhite e-reader it does all
the same things as before but now it has
a better high resolution display it's
actually the same screen as the more
expensive top-of-the-line model Kindle
voyage the voyage is $200 and this new
paperwhite is 120 and it's available for
pre-order now shipping on June 30th
there are some changes going on in the
social media world this week Facebook
came out with a new app it's called
moments and it's on a mission to make it
easier to share photos among friends
often we never get around to sending
photos to our friends because uploading
can be a hassle but Facebook's app can
scan all the photos who took on your
phone lump them together based on faces
and the time they were taken and then
you can give select friends access to
the groups of photos they are in now
Facebook recommends who to share a photo
with by using facial recognition
technology this is the same system that
is used to suggest who to tag in a photo
and you can turn that off in settings
it's a bit unnerving
to give Facebook access to your entire
camera roll but it's not posted online
unless you tell it to post it on Twitter
you're gonna now notice videos will now
begin to autoplay
just like Facebook does not only is it
annoying but it's a huge data drain on
your phone so be sure to go into
settings and either turn it off or
change it so it only auto please when
you're on Wi-Fi and YouTube is hoping to
draw in more of the gaming community
with a new hub just for watching other
people's video game streams it's called
YouTube gaming and it's Google's way of
competing with twitch a popular video
game live streaming site owned by Amazon
now this hub is going to pull in all of
YouTube's gaming videos and it will go
live in a few weeks that's it for this
tech news update there's always more at
cnet.com from our studios in New York
