ideally we're not just talking about a
home that responds to button pushes or
voice commands we're talking about a
home that reacts when you act today
we're taking a look at Garage EO Garage
IO is basically a retrofit device that
attaches to your already existing garage
door controller and from there it turns
it into an app connected fully
integrated smart home piece of
technology now if it were just app
connected it really wouldn't be that
impressive the simple garage EO app
really only offers the same
functionality that you get out of the
controller that's already attached to
the Sun Visor in your car where garage
really stands out against the
competition is its integration
possibilities with platforms like IFFT
and Amazon echo my favorite integration
using if was the geofencing option
basically when I would drive up to the
home if would send a message to garage
EO which would automatically open my
garage door finally gracio works with
Amazon echo well I do like the idea of
voice control for my garage I don't
really like the way that it works with
Amazon echo at this point because the
garage EO still isn't native to echo you
actually have to kind of treat it like
an app on your mobile device
or if you want to just give one simple
command you have to say Alexa tell
garage EO to open your garage at the end
of the day I really like what garage EO
is doing with IFFT but I'm not a huge
fan of how it works with Alexa and until
that gets sharpened I really can't make
a strong recommendation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
