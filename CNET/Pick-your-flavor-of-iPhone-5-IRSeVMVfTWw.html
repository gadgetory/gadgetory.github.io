welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
will announce our giveaway winners at
the end but first to the stories Mobile
World Congress that the largest mobile
trade show in the world has wrapped up
and even though Apple didn't show up at
all it still walked away with the mobile
device of the Year award for the iphone
4 it was given the award by judges for
its great screen sharp design fantastic
materials and phenomenal ecosystem for
app developers so what could they be
working on next to top that well
Taiwanese website Apple proclaims the
big a is working on three hardware
prototypes for the next-gen iphone they
say one model has a sliding cover that
reveals a keyboard another similar to
the current iphone 4 with improved
battery life and a better camera and
digitize is reporting that the iphone 5
will use a four-inch screen to better
compete with android phones then the
wall street journal reported that a
smaller less pricey iphone that would be
about half the size of the iphone 4 and
would target the mass market with a
lower price point kind of like the
iPhone nano would be released
potentially as well now you can choose
to believe all this or none of it but as
we get closer to June this story will
clear up Apple is also looking to revamp
its mobile me service according to cult
of mac it will not only include a
digital Locker to stream music and
movies something we've been waiting for
since there are Lala acquisition but
it's looking to include a video
streaming service like you stream a
location-based check-in system like
Foursquare and a geo-tagging service
called tokens the centerpiece of it all
will be a dynamic web page that is a
mash-up of all these elements that's
your mobile life or your mobile me Oh
Apple you little clever us I see what
you did there mobile me
in macbook news AppleInsider has been
told that the next gen macbook pro is
currently in production and can be
expected sometime around March which is
about a year since their last revamp in
april 2010 and we're sure it will take
some design cues and features from the
macbook air now seen its own Brook
brother says the next MacBook Air
refresh be sometime in June according to
his sources and if you curious what
features we might see Apple gave us a
hint with a survey they sent out to
select MacBook Air owners some of the
questions focus on wireless 3g
connectivity web-based file storage and
syncing and processing power sparking
hope that a more powerful macbook air
with built-in 3g could be on its way and
with all that news I'm feeling like a
mag daddy
need a mack daddy cuz I'm gonna make the
morning meeting me in matte but what
what wait what would Jamie's are you all
right all right let's get door how to
tip to give 18 to users more rollover
minutes what's up Apple biters if you're
an iPhone user on AT&amp;amp;T and you haven't
switched over to verizon yet here's a
way to get 1,000 bonus rollover minutes
for free now all you have to do is send
a text message with the word yes to 11
1130 20 and you'll get a response
confirming that this is not an
infomercial this will not extend your
contract it takes approximately four
weeks to be added and this is good for
all AT&amp;amp;T iphone customers until March
31st 2011 use it wisely my friends see
now I have more minutes than I can use
to talk to you miss Jamie all right
whatever you know I'm a 1000 minute man
now yeah now to the quick bites
according to display search if you
include iPads as pcs which seems pretty
logical now Apple has surpassed HP as
the number one mobile pc vendor in the
world with over a seventeen percent
market share or 10.2 million units
there's also some fallout from the
verizon iphone 4 launch after sales
appear to have fallen below expectations
analysts were predicting 1 million sold
in the first three days while boy genius
reports only five hundred fifty thousand
units were actually pre-ordered opening
day lines were short and sales at
multiple stores are solid but it means
you listen to us to wait for the next
iphone and steve jobs will be meeting
with President Obama and other tech
luminaries which is another good sign
that he's doing all right after the
constant media scrutiny of his health

giveaway for the mophie workbook for
iPad congratulations to Justin Charlie
