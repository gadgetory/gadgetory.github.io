Jeff Bakalar and I'm Wilson tang and
this is the show where all you got to do
is call Randall to get on the show
that's it that's all you get are gonna
do really coming up on the show today
lots of fun fun stuff Wilson is not
gonna get cancer will tell you why Plus
Chuck Klosterman is kind of cool he's a
guy who writes Rolling Stone everyone
liked him it's a Esquire he writes
writing no no he writes for everyone
please do I for Rolling Stone noise he's
an Esquire talking about why business
crashing and jefra that's a hard one
bluster a talking about AMD some
software you might not have heard of
that's kind of interesting is if you're
rocking the AMD processor behind the
scenes called Andy live and to do that
we have Wesley Faulkner from AMD how are
you doing man well duh good all right
Wesley Falkner has the dubious
distinction of being the first 40 for
the center outside my immediate like
group of people I think I remember I
remember this you you ran into him at
the CES we're trying to well would you
remember what event you rat Wesley well
we met initially with showstoppers you
me and Tom Mariner and I came to the
live vol taping and that's where i met
you everyone yeah so has the 44 grown it
all on you or you're still kind of just
like you know what the weirdest show
ever let's be on I actually started
listening to it more regularly than I
thought I would yeah all right that's
what the fact that is it's bad or
anything it's just that I have so many
podcast I weapons but it did stick with
me it's a like a break between my series
podcasts we so we're surprisingly good
right as I yeah we're out of a lot of it
we're totally under promise over deliver
and we're hoping that's how you gotta
roll tally that's how we roll so you're
a showstopper showing off this thing
called AMD live you're like itself from
that right i coordinate with love
developers I did the QA 42 and I'm kind
of like the technical representative
first at some shows like showstoppers
des and I was out in South by also no
word
did you get enough party we tried to
like hook that up did you get in no we
have no clouds ran I need to call
earlier out invitations there I never
got an invitation there's something I
didn't have time anyway so it worked out
alright well I talked to Brenda she's
supposed to set it up but we'll talk to
her getting figure out for next time so
Andy live what is AMD live exactly well
MB live is a platform like it's a pc
you'll see a little label on there
saying a be live and it's also a
software suite to help enhance your
media experience like watching videos
and movies and your vision and your
showing off that uh there's some actual
software you're showing off can you tell
us like yeah Amy live explore it's a 3d
browser for your music your videos and
your pictures yeah allows you to just in
a new 3d interface because most people
who buy mid-level pcs who don't play
games don't know why they need to buy a
high score high an officer so for people
that don't know any better than just by
the high end system then they say well I
can surf the web faster nothing else II
use it for now definitely the interface
is actually pretty cool you're showing
think you should have like six videos in
a circle and basically to like navigate
instead of having to wait for each one
to load or whatever you could just like
see which one is playing that you wanted
and liked click on it so anyway yeah if
you get a real high-end system you can
get up to nine videos playing at the
same time oh cool it's written and you
can rotate them in like a it's like a 3d
carousel just really use so if you have
like let's say 20 videos of seinfeld or
south park yeah and you don't know which
one is which by just the title you can
see them all play at the same time
seeing find which one you want to play
no no oh that's like what is a good porn
it's cell demo right cell that had like
the 50 MPEG two streams oh yeah that was
old school that was like 2005 yeah that
was when they were like this is gonna be
so amazing and this one down it wasn't
so let's talk about some other stuff I'm
gonna defer this story to Jeff Bakalar
because I don't really know how to talk
about it without um cuz you why you
forgot how to speak yeah basically it's
just a sermon no no I talked about the
other thing yeah the Wilson 100 well I
didn't realize
and I just I stumbled across this
headline and uh it may just maybe think
a Wilson yeah what why me because uh
this is actually an older report I think
but it comes from the BBC News and what
does it had to do a study or new ish
study it's actually from 2003 comes out
that says masturbation can actually
reduce your risk of getting prostate
cancer right breaking minutes so Wilson
Wilson so you sir are in good shape yeah
you're set you sir do we really look no
hands guys pretty funny do we really
have anything to talk about with this or
crew just kind of agree you should be
business show knows it's kind of funny
yeah I mean the more you clean your
pipes like what has it work you'll be
better no it's Australian researchers
maybe it goes something different down
down they have different plumbing maybe
I don't know but no Chuck Klosterman
those let's talk about this nice this is
an interesting article because he
basically comes out and says something
about the you know the reason why the
record industry has has fallen so so
hard in the past year and passed the
black eight years yeah is because they
don't claim any good music well no they
make a music back when that recognized
she's doing great yeah dad my Britney
Spears oops I did it again so hey come
on bought that out so dude that's sold
it sold 1.3 million copies in a week yep
and last year high school musical was
considered a success by selling just
under 3 million an entire year yes oh
look at it like that right cloister man
claims the reason he simplifies it all
this is the reason this is happening is
because music downloading music file
sharing that came easiest to people yep
in terms of how do you know people want
to save money people want to you know
not have to go into a store and buy
physical CD this is the this technology
file-sharing lended itself so easily to
younger generation younger kids picked
up on it so easily that it was just like
second nature them it wasn't yeah it
wasn't like music sucks it wasn't
anything like that it was just strange
so I was to say that that
sounds true of almost everything though
like I I've never mailed in a bill ever
okay ever it rarely but i rarely mail
every now and then I like some some
bills I have to pay they don't offer
online baby no I've I i have personally
never mailed in a bill I never got a
real person yes you're a robot you never
went but it's also the same thing is
that I've never I've I don't buy CDs
anymore because I just if I like a song
by the single right and that's and
that's what he makes that point to he's
like why am i buying an entire album
when I could just grab the track I want
to listen to over and over and over for
99 cent so Wesley what's your do you buy
music online or I mean when's last time
you bought a CD I can't remember five
years ago maybe yeah probably maybe I'd
it's like why'd you got married and we
went on amazon and got the music we
wanted uh to play because do your
wedding you can you can browse like an
endless supply online as opposed to go
in a store and they may have it they may
not have it like why take the risk no
Tony what is attentive what about
Wilson's online billpay Singh do you pay
all your bills online are you kind of
still have to do both actually I use
this service called paid rest what is it
called date paid rest they take all your
paper bills and all your electronic
bills and you pay them all on one
website so you don't have to go like the
t mobile's website or att's website or
whatever that's been to them and use
that to pay them do their for luring
right now that must means they got 40
Ford buy us all of our listeners just
went to their side at once do that
pretty awesome pay trust calm does not
load but that's okay that's comforting
I've been doing that I've been doing the
ING direct bill pay for a while so you
know I'll do like it's I've I paper bill
to pay i'll just send it in through ing
direction they just send mail and a bill
basically so I don't write I don't write
checks ever I mean I've got bank of
america so if it's not in bank of
america bill pay then basically i'm a
real bitch not a bill moving patriots
you get you get like a whole peel box
and you tell them whenever you get a
bill you say send it to the steel box
and they'll scan it in then we million
oh that's what's the business structure
on that I mean do you pay a monthly fee
for that away how you do that yeah I got
grandfather father then they've been
like by like two different companies and
I've had him since 97 Wow nice and i
paid 1095 a month that's wrong so that's
pretty cool though still that you don't
know that no but and if you move you
have to work a good idea like it's a
good idea they still get to you and
everything for sure that's pretty cool
really good idea and no junk mail oh
just posted i feel sorry dude i would
pay that just for the junkman dude
that's a really good idea so that's pay
trust com i'll write that down to put it
in the show show so so real quick also
so another thing he brings up in this
article closer man he says that everyone
who he's so the title of the article is
where did my 4.2 billion dollars go
because that's the amount of money
missing in the record industry that
would have been spent on that's not
being spent any more I hope so he claims
that it's just in the pockets of all the
kids who were in college in the late 90s
and early 2000s because they can't of
you know and and in some weird kind of
way it does make sense because you know
there is this money that its
wholly-owned about their music I don't I
gotta say I spend far less money now
than I ever did on music and of course
yeah for sure but what about economy of
scale I mean what music was one of the
things that just never dropped in price
no matter how long a CD was sitting on
the shelf it never went down and I think
people anymore right so just out of that
such a good point let's see a thing of
C's right like 20 bucks yeah they vote
no but I was gonna say the the thing
about records and whatnot though is that
in every other industry the more people
buy it the the price goes down the
record industry it's like the more
people buy it the price goes up the
price goes up in a second that's what
they wanted to do with itunes that's the
whole like a variable pricing dilemma
yeah was it things like that site with
the mp3 sick Amy yeah Amy but it caps at
a dollar they wanted to charge you like
two dollars yes music issues like wool
if a singles popular let's charge two
dollars for
unfortunately jobs in stand for it right
so its own go Steve Jobs baby yeah I
mean I'm not really see Joe's family
standing up to consumer for once so
there you go uh we're gonna take a break
when we come back we're gonna have some
more stuff with Wes the Hulk nerve from
AMD I said slowly but execution so we'll
be right back after this mess Rican
break
hear our music interviews and exclusive
live performances from our favorite rock
hip-hop country and R&amp;amp;B artists recorded
right here in our cnet studios by
listening and subscribing to our music
sessions from Studio C podcasts check
out podcast cnet com for this and all
other cnet com podcast hey guys it's
james from alaska you're listening to
the 404 three guys one donut and an
eclair no one wants to touch oh whoa I
was nice ok I'd in a nail thanks for the
thanks for the visual ID I saw also
adding a nail for our new listeners we
have an inside joke about where a donuts
can go yeah it's the very old joke so
not really it's on the inside joke yeah
anyone can pick up go find it and the
old hotness enjoyment episode oh so
Randall's trying to find his nail right
now got it was in Bryan Bushwick this is
in his nose yesterday I encourage
everybody to go and watch this episode
I'm art our post pages on the YouTube
page yeah and it freaked you out yeah
it's amazing how much Randall's touching
touching the non nose and he's right
there no no nose in the center Wow
looking long at the Judy's face face
alright calls from the public time
oh that's the first memory of advanced
on camera size a4 for watching
blockbuster circuit city merge together
if I walk you to old people house there
it's kind of nasty but mostly it's just
really pathetic love the show now look
he could take parlayed that into a
better punch line because there's
nothing wrong with old people having sex
I don't want to watch it I don't want to
watch whatever you do and not provide so
here was not pathetic do when I'm 70 I
hope I'm still so this is my rice is my
analogy that I would take it would be
it's like watching all people have sex
if you see it in public it's really
gross more like it's gonna be we're like
mom no matter how much you do it no one
wants to but you're a good one I would
say almost anybody home sex in public
almost anybody no I don't think and I
think everybody base I don't think I
want to have anyone I want to see
anyone's junk in public I'm sure you're
near different breed man am i yeah you
want to see people have sex in public if
I didn't want to do it good for them
Jeff I don't want to sell one way I see
it I'm gonna look almond I'm gonna look
away did you try that mr. your nail
let's talk about that oh no I was uh I
was watching the devil's game last night

so did you see anything cool South by
Southwest I was stuck in the blockhouse
for most of the time because that's
where we're having a little AMD live
demo thing cool
went to one I went to one uh conference
their show whatever aware the black bra
bloggers all those I heard about that
panel warnings yeah what I was in the
block out that I met Lauren Freeman you
you know I guy Lauren yes Friedman the
guy from 1938 yeah oh yeah that guy's
he's crazy yeah he's funny though he did
a couple questionable things but yeah
keep god dude like showing off his three
year old daughter's ass he just for
example he's just really jacked he did
that anyway he did what he's like he hit
him in a whole bunch of dude that's what
got kicked off pod show I thought it was
not tech I thought it was when he did
that tasteless uh black that was the
others that was the other part of it he
didn't advocate well that whole
conference was because of that video and
I never heard of it and I met him and he
said hey there's this business uh
there's just whatever conference on were
the black bloggers based on his videos
like you want to come nothing yeah let's
go let's do it and so I went with him
and that was very interesting when they
talk about know what they say that like
it was I mean oh they're just talking
about well we're all the black bloggers
and some people really pissed off at him
for being so stereotypical do they have
it they have any like remedy like why
there's evidence of this or is it just
like we're here yeah you're like wes is
like dude hello be a bubble talk
actually like there's like you can't say
that you can't say the inward and stuff
like that and then there's and then some
guy comes up and it's like yeah we're
all the black bloggers old reason why is
because they can't do any work and
something like that and why right you
can even look at something and tells me
by black person Wow like I said that oh
I was like yep yep that's so true and
what's very very like a lot of
doublespeak double-talk and it was very
controversial but I mean some good stuff
came out of it a lot of it was just the
Yellin and screamin oh wow I mean the
good thing is the panel existed the
sucky thing is the panel existed yeah oh
just a dub
ledge sword or sure well let's talk
about the other stuff on the rundown
subway cars turning into reefs what so
people are dropping basically people are
taking retired subway cars dropping them
off into the river and they're turning
the reefs I guess you know about this I
you put it on the show right I shot cuz
it looked interesting and they had a
photo of it happening I got the photo up
here let's flip to me I mean I don't
understand how this doesn't pollute the
water because of the metal and all the
crap they do this in Florida all the
time they say potato chips all bosses
this will confuse this shit out of
people thousands yeah they're gonna be
like one understand the daily is this a
sacrificial rituals in action very weird
but yet look it's on tree hugger so you
can like it's gotta be a shame it maybe
they're saying it's like recycling like
you're yeah they're putting in at the
coast of Delaware um and look it's it's
supposedly beneficial to the ocean
ecosystems I gotta know maybe we can
help like the environment by like
putting old for four episodes and into
the goalies take like all the USB some
guys building a reef come on doesn't
survive probably oh man it'll be fun so
