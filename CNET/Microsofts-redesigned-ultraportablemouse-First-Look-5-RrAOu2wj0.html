around the corner and a whole bunch of
crazy Windows 8 touch devices coming
with it
you're gonna need accessories right well
Microsoft is ready for that and in
addition to announcing a new keyboard
there's the wedge touch mouse this
little tiny thing is a mouse and it's
$70 which is not cheap at all and what
it is is it's a mouse not much more than
that even though it does have the word
touch in the name the amount of touch
functionality that's in this is not
multi-touch even though you may think it
by looking at the surface it's single
touch and it has four way touch
scrolling so it has inertia scrolling if
you want to scroll through web pages and
also side to side that's cool except
there are a lot of other mice out there
that do that and for a lot less money
what you're getting here is all design
this is about 0.14 pounds of the battery
inside it feels really lightweight it's
super small and it's actually economic
or I feel like it is I mean in terms of
the fact that it looks like it would not
be comfortable at all to use but when
you put it down in a table with a thick
part facing you and move it around it's
pretty comfortable to use although your
hand is making a lot of contact with
your desk surface and your fingers are
at the top the motions are not much
different than with a regular Mouse but
you will be squeezing these two sides
with your fingers and using the other
finger to navigate this is strictly for
the executive setter those who actually
want a mouse I mean I use an iPad and I
admit I would like to use a mouse
sometimes along with the keyboard to
create a perfect computer feel and
that's why you would sell a mouse to go
with the tablet is to provide a more
complete computer field to go along with
that multi-touch environment but that's
what it is don't expect anything more
despite the name and hey Microsoft
should get kudos for a really cool
design and an interesting pop out
battery that comes out the side by 70
dollars too high for most people I think
I'm Scott Stein that's a look at the
Microsoft wedge touch Mouse
that'll be available soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
