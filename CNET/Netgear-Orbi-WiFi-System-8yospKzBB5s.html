because I'm very under a bunch of or be
Wi-Fi system here that's right there
three of them with the same name but
they do have a different model number
this one right here is the rbk 30 this
is on our BK 40 and this is the original
orbit I with you last year our BK 50
these two on you now all of this he
actually very similar they both come in
to unit one of them is a router unit you
connect this to Internet and then you
take this second unit here the satellite
unit and you places some 40 50 feet away
and it will extend the Wi-Fi network
automatically they all have a backhaul
BAM meaning that I have a third band
using just for the job of linking two
unit together and then they all have a
two 2x2
front-hall bands for Wi-Fi devices to
connect to and finally they all share
the same easy set of process and the
same set of feature which is the same as
any single Netgear router oh one more
thing they also shared the same web
interface we can be annoying to use some
time because it's very sluggish taking a
long time to transition from one section
to another
okay now the difference is the rbk 50s
bike hole is a four by four top-tier
band that has the top speed of 1733
megabit per second on the other hand
this to his bike hole is a 2x2 bandwidth
the top speed of just 867 megabit per
second and that means these two would
have a lesser coverage and maybe slow
performance compared to the other one
okay between these two they share the
exact same router unit but the satellite
unit here you can see they are different
the one of the are BK 30 you have to
find a wall socket to plug it in and
it's quite bulky and this also means it
would have a less option in terms of
where you can place it in your home and
you cannot plug any device to it either
there's no network port now in testing
these two system here share almost
exactly same performance basically Wi-Fi
device is connected to the router unit
has the top Wi-Fi speed up some 4
megabit per second and that was
connected to the satellite unit here at
the top scripts I'm 250 megabits per
second
those are actually very fast compared to
other Wi-Fi system even though it's
slower than the arbic 850 now it's a lab
range any of this system here can easily
give you the coverage of some 3,000 to
5,000 square feet depending on how you
place the 2 unit away from each other
but obviously the more expensive one
will give you faster Wi-Fi speed at the
same coverage the question is how
expensive are these well the RPK is 30
here which is the most affordable one
goes for $300 the rbk 40 $350 and of
course the abrogate 50 has always been
going for $400 you can also get extra
satellite unit here for $150 and 200
easy of them will work with any existing
organ system you know these always a
great Wi-Fi system which one it should
get depends on your budget and how large
your home is and if you happen to have a
humongous ego here's my secret get them
all and maybe another extra set just for
kicks and that's because I'm dumb low
and these are the new or B Wi-Fi system
from Netgear
God you've got a huge ego dong you have
no idea do you know that these boxes
here they are not empty let me show you
I take this one for example here this is
you know another set completely another
brand-new set in here you see okay this
one too they're not empty
there you go another brand new setting
okay we talked another to get about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
