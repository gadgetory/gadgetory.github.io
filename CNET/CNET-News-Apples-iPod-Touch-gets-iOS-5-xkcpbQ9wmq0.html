ipod touch is now our most popular ipod
and it's no surprise that it's so
incredible it's amazingly thin to get
that beautiful Retina display does
facetime video calling you do HD video
with the built-in camera does a gyros
all those great apps and games you
download have amazing gameplay in fact
not only is it the most popular music
player in the world we're just so proud
that it's now become the most popular
portable game player as well so it is a
great device and of course it's going to
now run iOS 5 and all those great things
that Scott talked to you about the ipod
ipod touch does those as well but some
of them make amazing sense on an ipod
touch so if you think about it for
example I message our ipod touch isn't a
phone it doesn't have text messaging but
now if I message you can communicate
with your friends and family who are
also using I message you can text you
can send photos you can take videos and
send them along you can send your
location and parents like it because on
Wi-Fi it's free and unlimited so it's
really neat and we said it's the most
popular portable gaming device so of
course the things Scott talk to you
about about Game Center make perfect
sense now you can discover new friends
you can find new games to play and
download them and challenge each other
it is perfect for this great mobile
gaming device so iOS 5 is a tremendous
upgrade for the ipod touch in so's
iCloud think of all those things Scott
that that Eddie talk to you about iCloud
they're even more powerful when you
think about an ipod touch so now
wherever you are this amazingly thin
ipod can have access to all of your
music all of your books all of your
documents all the TV shows you want to
watch you can get access to all of them
right from your ipod touch so the ipod
touch now comes with iOS 5 and iCloud
huge things in their own right the
Edition comes in both black and now
white as well a brand-new white version
and it's gorgeous the ipod touch has
been priced at 229 dollars for an 8
gigabyte version well now it's going to
be 199 a key price point for a 32
gigabyte version it's 299 for 64
gigabyte version 3 99 and this will be
available when iOS 5 ships on October 12</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
