that monitor nearby lanes and determine
when other vehicles approach or enter a
vehicle's blind spot blind spot check is
getting pretty common in fact about
three-quarters of all new cars in the
2014 model year at least offered it
blind spot technology typically uses
radar in the 24 gigahertz or 76
gigahertz bands then they report back to
you with either upbeat or a buzz or or
some kind of a chime or a light going
off somewhere any number of manners to
tell you don't go there but a bit of
buzzkill has arisen as groups like the
triple-a and highway loss data Institute
have found that blind spot tech is good
but certainly not perfect sometimes
warnings come too late
fast closing vehicles may be missed and
all those buzzes dings and lights it
generates are starting to all sound like
other systems so here are some
technologies coming to get us to Blind
Spot 2.0 Infiniti and Mercedes are among
pioneers in active blind spot technology
it guides your car back from a misguided
lane change that would put you into a
car in your blind spot and likely does
so faster than you could even sort out
what's flashing and pinging and why
Blind Spot Assist can take active
measures by applying the brakes on the
wheels on the opposite side of the
vehicle the vehicle is steered out of
the danger zone Subarus lane change
assist is a derivative of blind spot
tech that warns you if a car is coming
up from the rear side at a rate that
would result in both of you being in the
same place at the same time as you
change lanes
if you switch lanes or signal to change
lanes and lane change assist senses that
the approaching vehicle is still there
it gives you a flashing warning to
further alert you to the vehicles
presence further out Jaguar Land Rover
is working on a concept of putting
display technology in a car's b-pillars
making them virtually transparent so you
can see over there where a car alongside
might otherwise hide
to all car makers by their blind-spot
equipment the hardware they put in their
cars from one of the same handful of
suppliers so it's not different at that
level but the car maker customizes how
sensitive it is and how it alerts you
all right so three things to look for in
that respect how visible are the lights
or how audible are the indicators how
they choose to alert you big lights or
little eyes you have little tiny
indicators on this Volkswagen virtually
useless some other cars put huge ones
here in the a-pillar others will give
you tones or beeps others will actually
vibrate the wheel
where are those lights position are they
in a place that naturally makes you
think blind spot issue you want to find
one that you feel is going to be
effective for you and how is the blind
spot tech calibrated on the given make
and model of car it varies test-drive
the car and does it seem to pick up a
car that you really miss or is it
warning you about cars that you would
obviously see I've seen both out there
interesting sidenote a paper published
by the Society of Automotive Engineers
back in 1995 said that if you adjust
your side mirrors out further so they're
pitched out or you actually would
eliminate the blind spot have them this
paper says just barely overlap the view
you have in your rear-view mirror most
of us tilt in our side mirrors a lot so
we can see our own car this paper says
don't worry about that kick them out and
you'll actually see everything and on
many late-model cars you probably notice
the increasing prevalence of these
wide-angle regions out toward the far
ends of the mirror glass that's also
aimed at helping to eliminate the blind
spot wherever you've got the mirror
point or car tech demystified right now
