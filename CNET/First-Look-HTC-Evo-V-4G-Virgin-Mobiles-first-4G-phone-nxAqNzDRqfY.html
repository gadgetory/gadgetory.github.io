CTIA 2012 in New Orleans this is your
first look at the HTC EVO v 4g it's a
little bit of a mouthful it is for
Virgin Mobile and it'll be a new phone
arriving on May 31st for two $99.99 what
you're looking at here is pretty much a
repackaged version of the evo 3d that
originally debuted on Sprint one of the
major differences though is that this
time it's running Android 4.0 Ice Cream
Sandwich it also has the HTC Sense 3.6
interface not the 4.0 interface that
you'll see on other HTC phones like the
One X however it is really nice and easy
to use here scrolling through the
different options in the app tray there
is a 4.3 inch qHD Super LCD display it's
also got a front-facing camera and the
famous rear-facing dual 5 megapixel
camera is here on the back and that
creates the 3d images if you want them
so you can also switch from 2d mode to
3d mode on the camera the whole thing is
running by a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core
processor to keep everything nice and
speedy also keeping things nice and
speedy is the addition of 4G for Virgin
Mobile this is in fact one of their
first 4G phones and it is using the
WiMAX network this is phone that I'm
really excited to see for Virgin Mobile
because not only does it introduce 4G
but it's also bringing some really nice
specs to the no-contract carrier I'm
Jessica's all court foreseen it you're
watching CNET at CTIA
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
