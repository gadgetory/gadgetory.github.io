televisions have gotten really large of
late there is still a dedicated set of
people who would still opt for a
projector for a big screen experience
and one of the biggest names in home
projection is Epson and today I'm
looking at its mid-level offering the
power light 30 20 there are two versions
of this projector one with a wireless
hdmi dongle for $18.99
and one without for $15.99 as far as
design is concerned most projectors look
like a hovercraft or a spaceship the
power light 3020 with its distinctive
fins certainly wouldn't look out of
place in a movie about blue cat people
aside from wireless hdmi the projector
also offers 3d onboard speakers to HDMI
inputs and an extensive set up menu
image quality is pretty good and
certainly better than the LCD projectors
of a few years ago colors are close to
reference quality and shadow detail is
as good as you can get without spending
over $2000 3d quality is also quite good
and better than you'll get from most LCD
TVs the problem is that black levels
aren't all that great and the motor that
operates the RS makes a loud grinding
sound in comparison the competing Bank
UW 1070 is under a grand has similar
levels contrast and doesn't make
anywhere near as much noise if you're
looking to buy this Epson projector
though don't get the wireless option it
needs light of site to work and can be
interrupted if you move in front of it
save yourself a few hundred bucks and
get a really good long HDMI cable
instead if you want a better projector
though opt for either the Ben Q or
Mitsubishi HC 7900 this has been type
Pendlebury for Cena</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
