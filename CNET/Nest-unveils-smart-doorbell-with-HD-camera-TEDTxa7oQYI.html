of a doorbell and combines it with all
the great technology of a nest camp it
is the product that our customers have
been asking us most about in fact it is
our number one most requested product
let me show it to you
nestled OH is small but it is powerful
it's packed with technology it has all
the things that you'd expect camera
microphone speaker LEDs a button but the
real game-changer in this product is
that everything in this device was
designed specifically to create a great
experience at your front door we have a
huge number of our customers today that
are using nest cams pointed out their
entryway so we understand the challenges
with having a camera in that location
all of this means is that when someone
comes to my door they're gonna get a
clear picture not a warped fisheye view
but what happens if the person doesn't
ring the Dell what if you get one of
those same day deliveries that shows up
at 11:59 p.m. and the delivery guy it
tosses the package on your doorstep and
it sits there overnight and maybe if
you're lucky it's still there in the
morning well we have taken this amazing
camera and we've added the intelligence
from nest cam IQ this is the first video
doorbell that can do both person
detection and facial recognition it's
great like if you're in a meeting and
that package you've been waiting for all
week you can you obviously didn't get a
notification that it's being delivered
but you can't be disturbed
you can just kind of discreetly tap on
your quick response and it'll tell the
driver what to do and for those times
that you do have time to talk Ness hello
comes with full duplex audio with HD
talk and listen and echo and noise
cancellation so you're always gonna have
a crystal-clear conversation for those
times when you might not have your phone
and you miss something sightline allows
you to go back into the app and scan
through literally days worth of footage
and Jeff
seconds so you can easily find the clip
that you're looking for but this may be
my favorite feature about nest hello so
when I work late which is often and my
kids forget to turn on the porch light
for me which is always Nestle Oh lights
up the doorstep to welcome me home and
that's just kind of 'some ness hello
coming to a door near you and q1 of 2018</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
