interesting on Google+ there's a
gorgeous new layout a ton of new photo
features and an unexpected change to
hang out there are over 41 new features
so let's dig right in and check out some
of my favorites right off the bat you'll
notice that this stream of posts looks
entirely different you might even say it
looks like Pinterest posts are tiled and
the design is responsive so as your
browser window grows more columns are
added if that layouts too cluttered for
you though you can always switch back to
one column up here also new is super
sized photos and videos so here if I
click the photo it goes full screen with
the media on the left and comments over
here Google+ is also auto adding
hashtags to posts including yours so
that you can surf around related content
click on a hashtag and the card will
flip around so you can browse and
comment on related posts this is awesome
for finding new people to follow and
killing endless time when you're done
browsing around hit the X and you'll be
taken back to the original post photos
got a massive overhaul turning Google+
into an all-in-one photo storage and
editing suite to start everyone gets
unlimited storage for standard size
pictures which is 2048 pixels unlike any
other social network though you can
upload full sized photos but they will
count against your 15 gigabyte storage
which is also shared with Gmail and
drive once you upload photos Google
wants to make the process of editing and
sharing them as fast as possible this is
where Google's expertise really shines
once your photos are in there auto
highlight automatically chooses the best
from the bunch with a smart algorithm
blurry images duplicates and other black
sheep will be removed and only the best
will be shared useful for saving time
but maybe not so great if you're a
control freak other new auto editing
features include auto enhance for
improving the overall look of the photo
and a tool that takes a handful of
similar photos and uses them to create
one new awesome photo and of course
Google is calling it auto awesome
finally Google Hangouts isn't just for
video chats anymore the new feature
replaces google talk and is even a
standalone app for iOS and Android in
Google+ you'll find hang outs here in
the upper corner from this pop-out list
you can start a one-on-one or group
conversation that can be text only or a
video conference some of the new
features for chat include fun emoji like
cute little Smiley's or even creative
ones like symbols and farm animals and
as you're chatting these faint avatars
will show you how far that person's read
best of all and this is huge for
hangouts chat notifications will be
synced across all your devices so those
are some of the highlights of the new
Google+ but of course there are many
more features for you to check out on
your own and in typical Google fashion
we do expect more features to roll out
for instance we're already hearing that
SMS will be incorporated with hangouts
