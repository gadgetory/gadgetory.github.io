TS coffee maker why it's compact easy to
use n is an Editors Choice winner recent
grads will appreciate having some good
coffee in the morning to get them going
before heading out to their new job or
writing up resumes this coffee maker
features one button an on/off button
Sophia grad is in desperate need of
coffee they'll still be able to figure
out how to use this machine and number
for this insane router it's the d-link
AC 3200 alter Wi-Fi dir 89 blr catch
your name routers are the brains of your
home network so they should be awesome
this one promises insane speeds and it's
so pretty your grad won't even want to
hide it away look at it the bit of a
splurge at over three hundred dollars
but doesn't your grad deserve it they'll
think of you every time they connect the
internet at home the Logitech Harmony
home control is our pick at number three
when a recent grad gets down time they
shouldn't be wasting their time juggling
remote to switch inputs just so they can
relax and watching TV the Harmony home
control is the best universal remote you
can get for the money it's actually a
multi-part system so you can use the
included remote or that gets misplaced a
free app turns a phone or tablet into a
remote number to a Roku device either
the two or the three now roku just
updated in streaming boxes the roku 2 is
now as fast as a Roku 3 the only
difference between the two is the remote
control the roku 3 remote lets you
listen to roku audio by attacking
headphones and can also be used for
voice searches the roku is our favorite
set-top box since it supports so many
different services without being too
pushy amazon google we're looking at you
so unless your grad is in the apple
universe they'll be able to watch
whatever video content they want what's
it number one a laptop a tablet tablet
it turns into a laptop a tab top no no
number one is a smart phone it's the
device a recent
read or any human being actually will
interact with the most on a daily basis
on top of that the big guys all refresh
their flagship phones there's the iphone
6 the six plus the HTC One m9 and
samsung's new galaxy s6 and the s6 edge
