and this is an mp3 punch-out between the
top two clip-on mp3 players it's a
takedown shakedown between the sixth
generation iPod Nano and the sansa clip+
our judges for this fight are senior
editor Donald Saved by the Bell
senior associate editor jasmine knock
him in the pants France and you know who
bring the a big column now we'll take
all three judges blind scores and
average them out to the nearest tenth
each round the final prizefight score
will be an average of all rounds using
the same decimal system we all know
looks matter round one is design the
redesigned nano looks sleek and it's
screen pops but being pretty is only
part of it the small touchscreen makes
it a pain to navigate
it's clip is awkward to use and when one
of the judges gives it a one you know it
has issues it's pretty much like a
shuffle with the screen and that's not a
good thing the clip Plus is no sexy
beast but its tactile controls for a
clip-on player make it more functional
than the Nano its clip is easier to use
but the monochrome screen needs an
upgrade the bottom line
Sansa knows what an mp3 player this size
needs and it's buttons the clip plus get
the three point three and the nano gets
a two point seven round two is features
the new nano has lost features like
video playback and audio recording but
still brings an FM tuner that pauses
live radio a fitness pedometer Nike Plus
compatibility and genius mixes that I
actually use you can view pictures and
album art but having multi-touch to
rotate the screen isn't really all that
special
the sansa clip brings an FM tuner with
presets for gym TVs a voice recorder and
microSD card slot for expansion donald
misses the album art but these are
features that are practical difference
makers Sansa takes us around with a 4.3
that'll get a 3.7 so after averaging two
routes the clip+ leads by six tenths of
a point next round compatibility not all
of us are fans of being locked into
iTunes to use the Nano the dock
connector allows the Nano to be
compatible with the entire iPod
accessory ecosystem
it supports most common audio files but
it doesn't support higher-end formats
the clip plus supports almost every file
type including flack and OGG but there's
no AAC compatibility for iTunes it also
syncs with rhapsodies music subscription
service and if you don't want to use any
software tool just drag and drop your
tracks onto the device on a Windows and
Mac tends to take the third round in a
row with the three point seventh and the
iPod Nano gets a three next round is
sound and science apple's ipod nano is a
solid sounding player and has improved
from the past but it's limited to the
standard iPod EQ settings the difference
in this round is the clip Plus that has
a fuller and richer sound compared to
the Nano and you can even hear it with
players this small it also includes a 5
band custom EQ if you like to dabble
with that dance it takes around four
widths 3.7 and the Nano gets a 3.3 dr.
averaging four routes the clip plus
still holds the lead by six tenths of a
point the final round that decides it
all is value
the nano starts at 149 for eight gigs
and if you really value it for its size
then that's pretty much what you're
paying for the clip plus starts at $49
retail for the floor gig model and $69
for the 8 gig model and it's by far the
best value and portable audio when you
stack up its features you guys guess who
takes around 5 its Sansa with a perfect
5 and the nano gets a 2 point 3 so let's
average out all 5 rounds and this was a
clean sweep by Sansa with no surprises
the clip plus takes this battle 4 to 3
and is your prize fight winner none of
us expected it to be a landslide victory
for Sansa but it looks like Apple really
needs to go back to the drawing board
and figure out the identity of its
clip-on nano i'm brian tom thanks for
watching I will catch you guys next time
on another prized types</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
