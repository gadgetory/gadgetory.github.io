Motorola Droid Maxx - promises a usage
time of up to two days that means you
can check your email browse the web and
basically you get to do whatever you
usually do on your phone without having
to charge it until tomorrow night during
my time with it the handset had a solid
battery life after I ran a bunch of
benchmark tests took the camera out for
a spin and browse the Internet it
survived a workday and into the evening
without a charge in our testing labs the
phone continuously loop video for twelve
and a half hours that's a great time to
clock in and longer than the nearly nine
hours Motorola's current flagship the
Moto X pure edition took the max twos
non-removable battery features quick
charge 2.0 technology from Qualcomm as
for its other hardware the device
features a 5.5 inch 1080p display a 1.7
gigahertz Snapdragon 615 octa-core
processor and 16 gigs of internal memory
with the option to expand up to 128 gigs
on the back is a 21 megapixel camera
that can shoot high-definition and
slow-mo videos for your selfies and web
chatting aids there's a five megapixel
shooter on the front the handset is also
water resistant but not fully
submersible so while it won't survive a
full-on dunk in the pool a few drops and
splashes of water shouldn't hurt in
addition the phone is basically the US
is or more specifically Verizon Wireless
version of the International Moto X play
for the most part everything is the same
it runs android 5.1 lollipop and you'll
get features like moto display and moto
voice but you'll also get bloatware from
the carrier that means you'll see a
bunch of apps from Verizon Amazon and
others that you can't uninstall if
you're interested the handset is
currently priced at 384 dollars or $16 a
month for 24 months for more about the
