across the room but the new Fitbit Alta
is different its slim has a nice big
display and you can even swap out the
rubber strap with a leather option and a
metal one the Alta does all the basics
you can track your steps distance
calories burned active minutes and your
sleep automatically there's no heart
rate sensor like on the charge HR and
you still can't wear it in the shower
but the Alta can display incoming calls
text messages and calendar alerts from
your smart phone but I found it hard to
read text messages which would slowly
just scroll across the screen speaking
of the screen it can be difficult to see
outdoors and after wearing the tracker
for only a month I did notice a small
scratch but one of my favorite features
is the new move alerts the Alta
encourages you to meet a mini step goal
of 250 steps each hour if the goal
hasn't been reached 10 minutes prior to
the top of the hour the band will remind
you with a gentle vibration I find it a
lot more motivating than the basic
standards on the Apple watch as for
battery life I've been pleasantly
surprised the Alta consistently lasted a
full week which is pretty good of course
one of the benefits of using Fitbit is
the app here you can view all of your
activity data and connect with friends
and challenge them to various
competitions the Alta would be my
favorite Fitbit or quite possibly my
favorite tracker overall if it was a bit
cheaper it cost $130 but for $20 more
you can get the charge HR which has a
heart rate sensor and the same caller ID
feature as the Alta the accessory bands
also feel overpriced the rubber straps
cost $30 while the leather one goes for
60 and the metal one for a hundred that
would bring the total price of the Alta
to $230 which is kind of absurd for that
price you might as well buy an Apple
watch or a Fitbit blaze but for those
who want a Fitbit that isn't an eyesore
the Alta is worth a look especially if
you can find it on sale
