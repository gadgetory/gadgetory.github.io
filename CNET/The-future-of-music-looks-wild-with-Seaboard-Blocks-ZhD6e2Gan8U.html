or how about like this or maybe this
creating fun electronic beats can be a
snap
with the Rollie block suite of
customizable touch pads and the company
just added a new miniature keyboard to
the mix well okay this isn't actually a
keyboard although it resembles one it's
called a sea board instead of individual
keys there's a continuous smooth silicon
surface that responds to the force of
your touch in multiple ways glide your
finger to create different effects
bending notes or blurring instruments
together the $300 sea board block works
as a standalone instrument it comes with
desktop software to change settings and
save and edit your work there's also a
free phone app but if you're ready to
take your performance up a notch snap on
some light pad blocks and control pads
everything connects magnetically to any
side light pads cost one hundred and
eighty dollars and they can be set to
play hundreds of different sounds with
the surface touch area you can even use
it to layer beads together with playback
loops smaller control pad blocks they're
$80 each and they're for making quick
settings adjustments during a
performance but you don't need a setup
like this to jam out you could create
music with just one light pad block or
just the Seaboard block Rolly made
several versions of the Seaboard since
its creation nearly four years ago but
this Seaboard block is the cheapest and
smallest yet making it easier for
newcomers to justify buying one to
experiment with new ways of creating
music</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
