incorporates a new two-thirds inch
version of the company's high-end
x-trans sensor will be it at the same 12
megapixel resolution as its predecessor
the x10 but while image quality is much
better than the x10 it's still only
about the same as its competitors on the
other hand enhancements to the design
and interface including a settings
overlay in the viewfinder and a quick
control panel deliver a more enjoyable
streamlined shooting experience with
several important differences the design
of the x20 is identical to that of the
x10 and those change it make it even
more enjoyable to shoot with them before
the body has the same magnesium alloy
chassis in an aluminum front and the
black and silver version shares the
aesthetic with its sibling the x100s in
addition to delivering a readout with
the mode shutter speed and aperture it
provides an auto focus area display and
a focus lock indicator though it's not a
through the lens viewfinder the focus
area really helps when framing the scene
another change which greatly enhances
the cameras appeal is the addition of
manual focus peaking the highlighting of
InFocus edges as a result of using this
I found myself trusting the manual focus
a lot more and using it a lot more with
the x20 than with the x10 the x20 also
gains the same shooting quick menu as
fujifilm's other cameras also thanks to
ditching the EXR sensor of the x10
there's no more confusing choices about
choosing the correct auto or reduced
resolution mode in order to get the
optimal photo quality that was one of
the things I really disliked about the
x10 in fact the only thing left that I
really dislike is the twist the lens to
power on in conjunction with its clunky
lens cap it really slows down that time
from pocket to shot the X 20s advanced
shooting modes at a very basic double
exposure mode and a typical set of
special-effects filters the cameras
photos are far better than the x 10's
but even so at best they match
competitors like the p 7700 or the g15
both of which are a bit cheaper and it's
also not quite as good as the larger
censored sony RX
100 plus the videos subject to various
artifacts it's a pretty fast camera
though with zippy shooting and autofocus
there's a lot to recommend it especially
if you're looking for a more old school
shooting experience in a digital compact
or you want an optical viewfinder it
delivers very good performance a nice
feel and a streamlined interface but its
image quality while very good just
doesn't stand out from the competition
and it's video disappoints I'm Lori
grinning and this is the fujifilm x20</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
