Bridget Carey on sina com and it's time
to get loaded sony is dealing with
another security mess today it locked
down 93,000 accounts on the playstation
and sony entertainment networks after
seeing a large amount of attempts to
break into user accounts the hacking
began friday but sony says no credit
card information was at risk sony sent
emails to customers who were affected
but that's only one-tenth of one percent
of its users the blackberry service
outage that has crippled customers
across Europe has now spread into the US
and Canada this morning research in
motion has said the problems with email
web browsing and blackberry messenger
all stem from a course switch failure
and that in turn caused a traffic jam of
data that they have to clear up this
marks the third day of data disruptions
for blackberry users today Apple is
releasing the iOS 5 update for owners of
iPhones iPads and iPods improvements to
the operating system include photo
editing tools reminders a notification
banner pulldown menu Twitter integration
and I message for messaging between
other iOS 5 users but the most notable
the updates is the ability to sync files
between devices over your home Wi-Fi
users can sign up for iCloud which not
only gives 5 gigabytes of free data
storage but also lets users view add or
change contacts and calendar events or
find a lost iPhone from iCloud com a
messaging app is finding popularity with
wall street protesters it's called vibe
and it's so much of the concept of
Twitter except users can post
anonymously and they don't have to
create an account to share messages the
apps creator told the New York Times
that it grew from 1,000 to 12,000 users
in the past week and there are about a
thousand messages a day posted on vibe
available on iOS and Android the app
uses GPS to share messages across
specific locations and if you own a sony
bravia television ya better check if
it's melting sony recalled 1.6 million
bravia flat panel TVs sold worldwide
since 2007 this is after 11 reported
cases of the TV's melting or catching
fire turns out there's a faulty
component in the backlight system that
might be causing the overheating first
hacking now a melt
is just not a good day for Sony those
are your headlines for today I'm Bridget
Carey for cnet com and you just been
loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
