week we got our first glimpse at
detective Pikachu
now if you've been living under a rock
or you somehow missed it this is a movie
about famous Pokemon Pikachu as shocker
I know a detective when we here at
stream economy first heard of detective
Pikachu being made into a movie we were
skeptical a s but this trailer is super
charming and I laughed a lot and I'm
also looking forward to more weird stuff
like this what is happening here
regardless of your feelings about the
trailer whether you love it or hate it
we thought it might be fun to take a
look at the current state of the Pokemon
universe as a whole and what could
happen if detective Pikachu is a hit so
here's what we already know detective
Pikachu drops on May 10th 2019 a week
after a little indie film called
Avengers 4 and speaking of the MCU
detective Pikachu was co-written by none
other than Nicole Pearlman who also
happens to have written the original
guardians of the galaxy script quite a
pedigree in addition there are some news
reports pointing to Pokemon attractions
being developed in tandem with the
Nintendo Super Mario World themed lands
that Universal Studios around the world
are gonna get starting in 2020 and of
course we can't possibly forget about
the medium that kicked things off video
games
mobile game Pokemon go crossed the 2
billion dollar revenue mark back in
September so that's going pretty well
and Nintendo just released Pokemon let's
go Pikachu and let's go Eevee
which takes us all back to the Kanto
region where it all began and last but
certainly not least Nintendo has
promised Pokemon fans a full-blown
Pokemon RPG due on the switch in late
2019 as long as it doesn't get delayed
fingers crossed so where can the Pokemon
company go at this point what is the
goal here
well let's speculate a little bit shall
we I mean if detective Pikachu is a
monster success we could be looking at a
Pokemon Cinematic Universe before you
all roll your eyes
once and cause a singularity because
nobody needs another cinematic universe
hear me out here Pokemon fans are one of
the most rabid fan bases around and
there are tons of Easter eggs in the
detective Pikachu trailer it's not a
stretch to think we might see a
mid-credits scene directly setting up
another Pokemon movie or an illusion to
ash Professor Oak Team Rocket or any of
the other og Pokemon gang I don't think
that the Pokemon Cinematic Universe
would compete directly at all with
something like the Marvel or DC
Cinematic Universe it would be sort of a
parallel programming if you will that we
can all enjoy while still enjoying those
other major cinematic universes so what
would it include I've thought a lot
about this and obviously you'd have to
have an ash Ketcham trilogy
he's the Captain America of Pokemon I
also really loved the idea of a Team
Rocket spin-off sort of the lovable bad
guys movie that I always wanted with
Loki then when we've all settled into
and accepted the idea of a Pokemon
Cinematic Universe we could get super
weird
we could have Pokemon origin stories
looking at you Mew and Mewtwo there are
21 animated films in the Pokemon
universe already so it's not like
they're looking for lore I mean we could
really turn this franchise up all the
way and go for the full Pokemon
Cinematic Universe or the P see you it
all depends on one thing though and
that's you detective Pikachu I trust you
hey Saros do you choose Pikachu when
does it end
I'm exhausted when they just wind is a
madness in that's just a movie about
Pokemon and those real weak Pokemon and
then like we dogs and I run now but no
like are my baking talk throwing it
people are upset about Pokemon detective
Pikachu film has gone too far
causing controversy best person is mine
because of Pokemon he looks like a
stressed car he looks like a tired Elvis
Tribute
Akane it's just a Pokemon it's just
happy
real problems in this world man and
friend dying fascism break sir this
morning my kid woke up and he turned on
Google home he says Google home make
fart noise and the Machine started
Parton those machines in this world to
make fart noises I can t live link in a
world where Pikachu loo look at how are
you dog it's in same problem same level
of problem is a face cups milk big guy
Connie that's Connie deal wit magic
thanks so much for choosing us this week

the Thanksgiving holiday but if you want
