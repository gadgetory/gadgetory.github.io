that offers both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
streaming along with Apple AirPlay
support in a compact classy package that
should fit in well with most of course
hi I'm David Carnot and I'm going to
give you a quick tour of this model
which sits in between the bluetooth only
srs x5 $81 speaker and the flagship srs
x9 which retails for a whopping $700 as
you can see it's sleek looking in a
minimalist way and has some nice heft to
it
weighing in at just over 4 pounds
there's a bit of brushed aluminum on the
sides and on the top where you'll find a
set of touch sensitive buttons there's
an almost mirrored finish that will
track some fingerprints and need to be
wiped down from time to time overall I
like the speaker and think it sounds
good for its size but it does have some
potential shortcomings while I was able
to connect using bluetooth without a
hitch
some people may find the Wi-Fi setup a
bit challenging and I think Sony's
companion song pal app could use some
polishing streaming over Wi-Fi offers
better range and additional flexibility
but the boost in sound quality is only
slight in a Bluetooth speaker this size
around back there's a retractable
wireless antenna which is supposed to
improve Wi-Fi performance and a nice set
of connectivity options that includes an
Ethernet port audio input and a USB
charging port for smartphones and
tablets once you do get the Wi-Fi
streaming set up you can do a few things
one option is to airplay your music to
the speaker from your PC using iTunes or
your iOS device the other is to set up
your PC as a DLNA server and stream your
music to the speaker that way using the
song pal app as a quote unquote remote
this SRS x7 is one of those speakers
that can sound excellent for its size
with certain tracks but falls off a bit
with others particularly at higher
volumes with less demanding materials
such as Norah Jones's come away with me
and John Legend's all of me
it sounds clean and vibrant and will
certainly impress but play complicated
tracks where lots of instruments are
playing at the same time and it doesn't
handle them as well the speaker did play
loud for its size and should fill a
small to medium-sized room with sound
however it doesn't play
as loud as the Bose Soundlink Bluetooth
speaker 3 sound quite as smooth it also
doesn't have as good battery life it's
rated at 6 hours compared to the Bose is
at 14 in the end as I said I like this
speaker but I think the step-down SRX x5
which leaves off the Wi-Fi streaming may
be the better choice for people who want
a simpler speaker to use for less money
I'm David Carr joy thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
