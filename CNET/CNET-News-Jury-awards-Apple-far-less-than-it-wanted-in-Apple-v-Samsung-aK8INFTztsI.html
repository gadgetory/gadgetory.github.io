behind popular mobile features like
slide to unlock autocorrect and FaceTime
a San Jose jury has come up with a split
verdict it was a mixed bag for Apple and
Samsung this time around in the patent
trial in this second patent infringement
trial Apple and Samsung accused each
other of copying features on some other
newer devices like the iPhone 5 and
galaxy note the verdict is likely not to
change anything about the hardware on
the phone since these are all software
features there would not be a major
recall you may see a software update in
closing arguments Samsung argued it
didn't copy apples patents because it
was google that first created the
disputed technology for its Android
operating system which runs on samsung
smartphones we did find during the
course of the trial that Google is in
fact helping pay for Samsung's defense
against Apple so it clearly has a horse
in the race in this case in the 2012
trial Sampson was ordered to pay apple
nearly 1 billion dollars in damages this
time the jury awarded Apple about 120
million dollars far less than the 2.2
billion Apple wanted from Samsung the
jury also found that Apple infringed on
one of Samsung's patents and awarded
samsung 158 thousand dollars you know
they're battling over users and over
dominance in this market and Apple truly
feels like it was copied Android feels
android and samsung you know feel that
they're just competing so this is
definitely about more than money but the
trial isn't quite over apple says it
found an error in the verdict form that
may result in higher damages the jury
will return next week to deliberate in
San Francisco I'm Kara Tsuboi cnet.com
