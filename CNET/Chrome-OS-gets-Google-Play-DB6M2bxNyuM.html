the mantra of many a tech project and
Google's Chrome OS is no different I am
Seth Rosenblatt Christina and today
we're taking a first look at Chrome OS
23 it's integration with Google Play and
other new features new apps are used to
call out many Google services including
from Android Google Play for music books
and movies chrome remote desktop for
remoting into Windows and Max is still a
bit pokey but it does give you access to
other computers the OS does come with
Google Plus hangouts so you can do video
chat in Chrome OS apps live on the
bottom you can right click to pin or
customize the background it also comes
with some defaults the OS updates every
six weeks to improve legacy hardware
performance over time Chrome OS is
really meant for those who love their
Google accounts Google Sync carries apps
settings extensions bookmarks history
tabs and passwords across computers if
you're worried about security you can
use Google's two-factor authentication
there's also Cloud Print so you can
remotely print from any Chrome OS device
it supports PDF zip rar PowerPoint and
other file formats and the built-in
native client under the hood helps power
robust apps and games Google Drive
integration provides instant file sync
and backup as well as offline support
the ongoing development of Chrome OS
means that over time it does get better
and better still it's really meant as a
laptop for home use on the couch or for
students in schools it can be used as a
backup machine but it's really hard to
use in situations where you want to do
deep edits of photos or if you need
something more powerful than Google Docs
if you are a Google fan though and you
love your Google Account you're going to
love using Chrome OS because it's meant
for people really deep in the ecosystem
