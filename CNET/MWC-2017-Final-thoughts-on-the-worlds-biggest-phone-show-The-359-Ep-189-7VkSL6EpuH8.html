from the cnet studios in New York's
today it's time trips of 189 of the 359
podcast starring Ben Fox Rubin and Roger
Cheng horny guys thank you for that
intro morning gotta bring the energy up
cuz got a very gonna be a rough week
gonna be the worst week ever I'm glad to
be back in New York I'm back yeah spent
the week in barcelona barcelona still
missing the the tapas and sangria and
the gem own and the jamon jamon and did
you bring us any phones I did not bring
any phones I brought impressions of
phones that we try it out but they
wouldn't let us keep anything of course
that's okay we'll get them later yeah
yeah that's what that's what we're gonna
be talking about today basically a
post-mortem or final thoughts about mwc
2017 with our man on the ground yeah and
then we'll wrap up with a great story
from stephen shankland about quantum
computing and what it's going to mean
for future devices sexy stuff man
quantum computing it is a Hannegan of it
it's actually you know it's actually
awesome it's downright back it's a
little wonky but it's also very awesome
and can have a huge impact on all of our
lives so yeah yeah man so let's get to
the show send in your questions and
comments and we'll get to as many as we
can at the end and without further ado
alright let's get this recording
underway and here we go in three two
welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Rubin I'm
Roger Jane okay Roger welcome back from
Barcelona and Mobile World Congress
overall what was the most memorable
thing that you saw at the show the most
vulnerable thing obviously had to be the
Nokia 3310 and just the history over
this is a 17 year old phone slightly
updated looks a little bit nicer I had a
chance to try it out you know the
biggest feature is as a what is one
month withstand high time of course you
can't do much on it besides play snake
you can text you can call but you know
it's obviously not a smartphone like an
iPhone or galaxy s hey why the hysteria
I mean we were excited over here talking
about it but it sounds like at the show
it was just getting frothy like people
were really getting almost too excited
about this thing you know there's a it's
a it's a potent mix right there's a lot
of nostalgia involved a lot of folks who
had that phone originally really loved
it it's also the fact that you know
there wasn't anything that really blew
us away some kind of luster and then
with Samsung out of it really had the
sort of vacuum there and then okay kind
of filled that back and really well with
this phone that just you know deserve
you it tugged at our heartstrings right
and for a lot of these lot of these
industry folks who are they're all phone
geeks we're all phone geeks we really
got into it much of the detriment to his
other phones actually no cash md global
to start a building this nokia phones
actually introduced three other android
phones actual smartphones no one care
about him so when you are holding the
Nokia what was it like I mean it was
like holding a candy bar phone like from
back to the old days so you were not
impressed it was just yah was it kind of
heavy no it was light you know it's
compact fit in my vest pocket it was you
know a nice phone but it's a feature
phone I can't do much with it I can't
text I can't use GPS that I can't pull
up maps yikes you know I'm sorry I can
text but I can't I can't pull up games I
can't you pull up app so just it's
fairly limited yeah let's talk about the
samsung factor so Samsung was the s8 was
at some point expected to come to the
show but then it wasn't so was it kind
of looming over the show yeah I mean the
fact that the essay wasn't around again
kind of created this vacuum but also
sort the worse the other way right
everyone's talking about the 3310 you
know LG g 6 came out there there were a
bunch of phone
I came out everyone sort of the overall
thinking was well these are all nice
phones but let's let's wait a little
while it's like Khloe's cuz Sam
Cunningham is gonna come out with
something it's gonna come up with
something big later this month right
later this month so really that was the
kind of the factor that was looming
over the entire show was just like these
phones are nice but we'll see what
Samsung has cuz I'm willing to bet
they're gonna blow us away yeah what
about moto mods talk to me a bit about
that yeah motor mudded the Moto Z and
was kind of a stealth popular product
there Motorola had a very small intimate
press conference where they they talked
about the future of motor mods you know
this is the idea like these modular
gimmicks like they snap onto the back of
the phone to add your capabilities
motorola introduced a whole bunch of new
ones and really sort of a commitment to
to keep this whole modular gimmick going
which is really interesting because
everyone else are dropped at google's
dropped in LG dropped it now Motorola's
really the only one embracing the idea
of a modular phone yeah next up our
colleague stephen shankland wrote about
how quantum computing could one day
superpower your iphone quantum computing
allows a computer to store bits of data
not just as zeros and ones but as both
at the same time which kind of hurts my
head to think about so I mean this is a
huge impact on moore's law which if you
don't know is sort of idea that
computing processor gets faster and
smaller after what for two years or so
yeah it's remote every two years problem
is that we kind of hit our physical
limit computers aren't getting faster
and faster smaller and so they're saying
Quan computing will have an impact on
this yeah it could potentially really
amp up computing power to you know
potentially crazy degrees but we're
nowhere near that's actually happening
so that wait for it but you might have
to wait a long time quantum computing
plus AI means for me we're finished
we're screwed it was nice being part of
the human race but I look forward to our
future robot overlords if you want to
read more about our story read more
about these stories check us out on cnet
I'm Ben Fox Rubin I'm Roger Cheng thanks
for listening
so in the chat already somebody was
really excited Ahmed was really excited
about the blackberry key 10 interesting
it's it's like you know your blackberry
it was almost an afterthought because
they were the very first press
conference at the show they kicked it
off Saturday night with the key one and
then all the other press conferences
came and I think it got lost in the
shuffle like no one was talking about it
everyone's talking with 33 can I think
the g6 kind of took the the kind of
consolation prize like it was like the
best smartphone of the show and then
after that it kind of was a steep
drop-off in terms of interest level like
no one's talking about Samsung tablets
there was some talk about the motorola
stuff but blackberry khanna got kind of
got a lovely we kind of forgot about it
it's like I'm so shocked right I was a
little frankly I was a little shocked by
the interest level I thought that would
be at least some if nothing else morbid
curiosity about whether or not a company
could bring back the blackberry brand
but it kind of got lost in the shuffle
we've had so many come back efforts with
blackberry yeah this doesn't seem don't
call it a Mac yeah he come yeah right in
the ditch forever jay was always races
right all along LL Cool J a great great
man uh full disclaimer yes we do work
for CBS technically and by the way not
technically we actually were for see
women are actually obligated to Pat LL
Cool J's back by the way les Moonves if
you're watching we really like you did
you say Fuehrer Fuehrer if your or if
your wife you are jeez care all right
seriously I almost gone off the rails so
quickly welcome back Roger welcome back
Roger pervy ghoul says talk about the ex
zs + XZ premium Exies and XE premio the
sony phone yes you know what there is I
mean they were impressive looking phones
there they're not coming out to like the
middle of this year they I think they
were announced so expressly sol sana can
say we've got the first phones with
Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processes
processors which are Qualcomm's newest
flagship chip that's supposed to debut
on the s8 first and actually hit the
market for us but I think Sony oh I
wanted just get out
they're like we've got it we've got it
and the songs not coming up for a while
so yeah but still we're talking about
Sony here so like they don't have a lot
of market share and it's not as bad as
blackberry but there's still struggling
here's the thing sony because they do
make premium phones and they've been
trying to cut trim down their portfolio
so they really only focus on premium
phones that still hasn't sold well and
their biggest gimmick for a while or
feature was water resistance okay guess
what everyone else decided to do too
whoa but also what I'm interested in is
you mentioned that LG g 6 got the
consolation prize after the nokia
candybar phone were you at all excited
about that phone which could you see
yourself using the g six or buying it
you know what it was it was a nice phone
it it does packing a screen that's
larger than my iphone 7 plus into a body
that is much much smaller which is kind
of a neat trick the only thing is that i
think samsung is gonna do it even better
in a few weeks and potentially than I
will do it Apple was probably do the
same thing and they're they're basically
I think they were listening the reading
the tea leaves looking the trend of
smaller bezels and i think that's that's
sort of what everyone else was trying to
do I think LG probably did it best at
the show yeah so they got it out of the
gate first you got it doesn't seem like
they're gonna gain too much momentum off
of that no and plus sir I mean they also
use a dual camera system it was like a
Apple but instead of a zoom lens ease a
wide angle lens which I'm not the
biggest fan of like I'd rather have the
zoom than that wide angle vs. like wide
angle minute normal angle lens yeah we
have a lot of great comments in the chat
but before that I want to say that I'm
calling it in ten years come back at the
bezel Wow oh and then out there were
many people are crazy for it oh my god
the bezel free web oh the home button so
wonderful to get the home button back
alright so josh wants to know what are
your thoughts about the one plus four uh
1 plus 4 didn't show up at the show
wasn't at the show than I don't know so
I don't really have we haven't really
happened we haven't we definitely a van
in office so yeah so sorry sorry I'm
let's see do you think the mobile skies
wants to know do you think the Nokia
3310 is aimed at a non-techie market I
think that kind of goes to that saying
yeah absolutely so I think it's two more
it's going for they're gonna go to the
emerging markets countries where people
not everyone uses a smartphone yet where
it's sort of a pretty competitive
looking feature phone I mean again it's
a month standby time and 22 hours of
talk time so if that's all you care
about that's great they also said this
might be a good sort of alternate
alternate digital detox phone for you if
you want to get away for the weekend
mm-hmm slap your SIM card into that
phone and you have a legitimate excuse
for not being able to be reached via
email because your phone doesn't have
email right but then you have
emergencies in vent other ways to get
off the grid yeah how we are now yeah
all right uh Vijay wants to know what
are your thoughts on the huawei phones
and the huawei watch to the huawei phone
the p10 was I mean it's very competitive
phone that's a you know the epic Carl
Zeiss lens they were very proud of
trying to get people to use that camera
it's competitive own it's not coming to
the US so it's not as much of an issue
for us or it's not it's not a factor for
us but you know I got a sense from the
sort of looking at it from talking to
people that it was a nice phone but it
was sort of like in the pack of device
it didn't really stand out from anything
else as well and so for the watch I
thought the watch was ugly that's it I
think we've kind of come to that
conclusion on a lot of the watches
though yeah it's a I mean no the thing
of it is is the original Huawei watch
was actually pretty decent lookin I
think one of my favorite Android wear
devices and it kind of a nice mix of
kind of classy and it looked like a
watch without being overly bulky then
the new ones kind of met the watch first
gadget second you gotta flip the flip
the grid on that one yeah going back to
the key one George wants to know what
about TCL from China how would they
affect key one any thoughts on that I
mean they've already so they've affected
the the way these blackberry phones work
the tech for in the d tech 50 which came
out last year were both made by TCL
mostly designed by TCL so you imagine
that you're gonna start to see the same
contine eighth flow throughout the next
couple phones and I did report
exclusively at the show that like that
they are committed to as many as three
phones three new blackberry phones this
year sure what did you hear from them
directly as far as how committed they
are to this to the blackberry brand you
know well into the future right I mean
they're absolutely committed I think
they're really excited to actually have
a brand that people recognize right
because they've been selling phones
through alcatel their TV assaulted TCL
neither these brands are like household
name so to have the blackberry name in
the stable I think they're really
excited about that it's granted it's a
it's a tainted name right yeah but it is
a well-known it's interesting that one
of your stories mentioned that they also
own the palm name yes there's no plan to
bring back but they bought the palm name
in really the middle of CES 2015 and
they've done nothing with it I've talked
to their CEO who hinted that there there
still are some plans but you know
they're focused on the black bear named
for now all right we got a double team
here from bossom and Ahmed what about
the note 8 i'm still unable to put up in
my replacement s7 edge to create the
phone but I'm emotionally hurt and
waiting for no 8 and then the follow-up
from ahmed is do you guys think that
samsung can earn their customers trust
back great question right questions
considering you didn't really see much
of them at the the old conference there
yeah i mean they did have a big press
conference at the end of sunday night
where they've released to two tablets
that no one's going to buy but i think
the the essay will I mean look at the
essay blows you out of the water I think
that does a lot to earn your trust back
I mean it's still one of the top two
phone makers and it's not losing that
position to anybody anytime seriously
there is such a gap between you know
Samsung Apple and everyone else writes
not yeah they're not a huge jeopardy yet
now the s8 start starts exploding that's
a whole nother matter if that would be
right what's up just right now this is
sort of a wone office is kind of a freak
bizarre incident if the essay kind of
launches without a hitch I mean that's
that kind of gets them rolling again and
the know date they have confirmed the
note 8 will come later this year so you
can expect that if you're big note fan
when does it usually come out what one
in the fault okay you're gonna have to
sit tight and wait for that yeah so
we've grazed on this rumor before but
the dot wants to know is Samsung
releasing note 7 as a refurbish no
absolutely not really tell you for sure
that's all happening that makes sense I
mean I mean I asked multiple Samsung
people that the show
got a lot of laughs and chuckles and
like the rumor I think it was just ahead
of mwc that rumor started percolated and
that you know they're gonna refurbish it
and bring it out again and under
scratching our heads on the podcast
being like well the decision was to
handle these extra parts what are we
gonna do with all these extra parts it
was ok there's to argue different phone
yeah that's that's it like those parts
actually propriety I have to say the
most interesting thing that happened at
the Samsung press conference was a
greenpeace protesters actually broke in
and like made a huge stir they actually
repelled off the roof of the building
that way that was held dropped his giant
sign one guy one really well-dressed
protester actually like got up on the
stage people didn't even notice who he
was because he was so well dressing like
a pass on yeah he looked like blow but
he'll sign who's asking basically
they're asking Samsung disclose how
they're getting rid of these batteries
that they've recalled right and there's
also an environmental way it did
environmentally isn't a landfill
somewhere exactly yeah and like no one
really noticed until the speaker like
sort of gently politely asked the
protester to like get off the stage like
wait what this is that a we all thought
this was some sort of like big stunt you
know like Greenpeace is gonna make a
thing will make their their statement
samsung was gonna come into being a like
yes we believe you know we believe in
environmentally responsibly getting that
was all part of it Harlan like the
speaker went on scripted it was like
what what's going on it was a fairly
crowded room so it's hard to make out
what's going on the front thanks yaks on
bikes we only got a couple minutes left
cnet do you think the 18 by nine screen
ratio would affect the smartphone world
in a positive way I hope so it's
basically by the way it's not 18 by nine
it's to buy one I know they were saying
18 by nine I asked LG instead of 16 by
nine right that's a later basically yeah
basically it's like yeah the easy way
for idiots understand 16 x I'm an idiot
I wanted I mean by nine I know I think
it's a good thing I the whole like the
idea of having like two squares
especially your big Instagrammer that's
kind of cool right having Instagram you
have this grant photo there and you'll
have kind of like that that equals
square underneath the show that the
options I kind of like that I know it's
a buzz a buzzy thing around here from
the production scope of things and the
videos that we may coming out of seen it
so we might see something
coming down the pipeline I can't
guarantee anything but I know it's been
discussed nice as far as embracing that
for our content as far as 18 by nine I
still don't think that it's important
enough as a differentiator to get you to
buy a specific phone one or the other I
think it's a nice feature to have if you
have to be buying that phone already but
you're right it's not it's not gonna
sell you on a device which is about the
people who live their career as social
media aggregates and content producers
and you know that that could be
beneficial to them I think I know a guy
who pretty much his entire life is
running social media for a number of
agencies so if he could embrace a new
avenue Khanna but as far as like
changing the industry I think it's still
kind of in a gimmick line I would
certainly my hope is that that 18 by
nine ratio to buy one ratio inspires
other handset makers the kind of fall
that same ratio as well to kind of get
in bad mode because it does look nice
simson cinematic wise I have to say this
seems really incremental to me I mean
like you're talking about the difference
between 16 by 9 and 18 by nine these are
not huge changes in the phone market and
it goes back to the fact of like that's
why the Nokia 3310 was the biggest phone
at mwc which is supposed to be the
latest and greatest phone so I would
like to see you at the standby time man
I would love to see what this s8 has to
show us at the end of the at the end of
the month and I wanted to bet the essay
you know might embrace some sort of
aspect ratio that's similar like the
whole the rumors are it's gonna be
packing in a much larger display into a
smaller body so maybe it follows that
same aspect ratio sure all right so to
end it on we got a great question from
Yash what would you rate this year's
Mobile World Congress 2017 in terms of
rumors related and the excitement ooh in
terms of number numeric scores ezzz
actually asking like what was the actual
payout here right but we don't get a
bonus end of the scale do you know on a
scale from one to seven I'll just say
for me that this was a more enjoyable
show than years past because the last
couple years it's been a foregone
conclusion that samsung will dominate
the show with their galaxy s phone this
year it was far less predictable right
who would have guessed at the onset of
the show that the 3310 was going to
dominate everything you know it's just I
like the fact
it's competitive that there's actually
kind of a it was a kind of wide open
world where anyone could really take
that spotlight and it was it was
unpredictable you know that that's for
me made it a much more enjoyable show
but regardless we'll see how Samsung
responds in a few weeks got today's
going here stick around a CNN will have
plenty more as a thing's actually
materialized and I think that's a
perfect place yeah those enough of the
day thanks everybody all right get us
get us out of here all right well go go
for the clothes welcome back thank you
if you liked anything you saw or heard
here check us out on cnet we're also
available on itunes tuna and stitcher
SoundCloud feedburner and google play
music see y'all tomorrow thanks everyone
later
