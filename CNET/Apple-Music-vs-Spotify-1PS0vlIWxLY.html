streaming service is music to your ears
we're comparing two of the biggest names
to see which one comes out on top this
is Apple music versus Spotify if you're
listening on mobile both services work
on Android and iOS Spotify has a free
ad-supported tier but for most albums
and playlists you have to listen on
shuffle you only get six skips per hour
and no access to the radio stations
Apple music only offers streaming four
beats 1 radio for free or you can listen
to songs in your iTunes library both
cost ten dollars a month
five dollars for students or $15 for
family plans in the US and if your paid
subscriber both let you save and listen
to songs offline each streaming service
has a big catalog though Apple music has
45 million songs versus Spotify 35
million you don't always have to listen
through the app the Spotify web
interface lets you stream from a browser
while Apple music has a web widget while
it's not technically a full player you
can still strain from a browser from
tools Apple music com you can stream
audio from both services to a Bluetooth
speaker spot if I connect lets you use
the Spotify app to cast and control
playback on compatible devices that are
on the same Wi-Fi network and you can
also use your voice to control Spotify
on the Amazon echo or Google home
so let's start with smart speaker you
feel someone like me when I was doing a
lot of testing with Apple music who has
a chromecast enabled device in my case
it's an old speaker with chromecast
Audio try to costume it from Apple music
I'm out of luck but if you have a home
pod then you probably will want Apple
music because you can control with Siri
and I think for a lot of people series
important because if you're have an
iPhone and you're in a car for example
the being able to summon music
hands-free it's a pretty big deal in a
car the other advantage of Apple music
is an Apple watch if you do have an
Apple watch and you go for a run it's
great to be able to stream music
directly from the watch and not have to
take a phone can I just say spot if I
had this amazing feature called running
and it used to actually detect the tempo
at which you were running and then she's
songs at a particular BPM that would
match that they got rid of it I don't
know why it was such a cool feature
Apple music like pick this feature up
use it run with it why not you know
really run literally run with it one of
the big advantages with Apple music is
the integration with the iCloud music
library so you can store a hundred
thousand of your own songs and have them
accessible in the cloud to any device
that's signed in with your Apple ID so
that's the UPC a Mac or even the iPhone
Spotify streams in OGG Vorbis format if
you're listening on the desktop or your
phone and you can choose the bitrate up
to 320 kilobit per second
Apple music streams as 256 kilobits per
second AAC files both services try to
expose you to new music you haven't
heard of before based on music you
already like and both ask you for some
of your favorite genres and artists when
you first open an account and have
playlists that update based on your
listening habits another way you can
discover new music is through radio
stations all right Lexi so I know that
your music selection is a very big part
of your identity so which one of these
two services is best able to match your
personality or get it right so the clear
winner really for me is Spotify it just
seems to get me on a level that's way
deeper than Apple music so Spotify has
discover weekly
it has release radar I really like how
to discover weekly playlist surfaces a
lot of stuff that's very similar to what
I already listened to you but it's just
oddest that I've never heard before and
I actually genuinely enjoy it I mean
there's a few weeks when it's kind of
turning off but I'd say nine times out
of ten it's really spot-on and I found a
lot of great music from it do you take
me for example I don't necessarily build
my whole identity it's election time so
sporadic about my music choices that I
like being able to just search for my
own stuff and and just kind of have
similar songs play after that but
neither one really gets it right for me
because I'm all over the place I have my
classical music and then I have my
Disney music and then I have my Broadway
music and then I want to listen to pop
and then I want to listen to jazz and
and there's a lot of Spanish stuff too
in there and it's so sporadic that it
really doesn't matter both are able to
kind of surface what I want to hear and
neither one is really able to keep up
with my crazy music selection right and
that's a really good point you bring up
about non-english-speaking music so if
you're listening to a lot of Latin you
think I'm really intrigued like which
service do you think is better for kind
of finding new stuff I think Apple music
has a great selection of the classics
okay
there's I can usually find most of the
songs that I want to listen to if I want
to listen to more obscure up-and-coming
stuff from south of the border then I
think Spotify is a little bit better at
featuring these less known artists as
for radio Apple music has the option of
also listening to beats 1 radio do you
listen to beats one at all no I do I got
a radio person I guess I don't spend a
lot of time in the car and I feel like
the only times what I did listen to
radio was because it was available in
the car I really want to love beats 1
radio and it's all about finding that
like radio personality that you really
gel with right you find someone that has
the same taste as you that's gonna make
you listen to music that is outside of
your comfort zone as well I haven't
really found that with the beats one
DJ's but I maybe I maybe I just haven't
listened to it enough
you can also follow your favorite
artists in both apps to keep up to date
with posts and their latest releases so
these services have a lot of social
sharing features do you use them at all
so I don't necessarily share my own
music selection because as we've
discussed it's mostly embarrassing so
I'd rather die to be judged by music
connoisseurs like yourself I kind of
keep my own selections on private but I
do sometimes peek in to see what my
friends and else out are listening to
just because I know I'm probably not
gonna discover that music on my own so
it's kind of nice to see what they're
what they're checking out back home
Apple music is the obvious choice if you
have a range of Apple devices while
Spotify is your best choice across a
range of platforms and if you don't want
to pay for music and they're not the
only players in the music game Amazon
music title and YouTube music are just
some of the other names out there all
right moment of truth what would you
pick Spotify or Apple music this one's
pretty clear-cut for me it is Spotify it
just gets me like it understands what
music I like it gives me good playlists
and surfaces songs that I probably
wouldn't find otherwise but what about
years I think I would go with the
freeway and music doesn't offer a free
version but if I really had to pay maybe
I would pay for Apple music because of
the ability to stream on the Apple watch
Series 3 and use it on a run without
having to take my phone and the ability
to be able to summon Siri as well but we
asked you guys the same question on
Twitter and Instagram stories and
actually most of you preferred Spotify
but maybe that's not the case for you
maybe it's totally the reverse let us
know in the comments below and of course
let us know what you would like us to
compare next
of where they run up where they stay all
day in the Sun wanderin free wish I
could be part of your world Hey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
