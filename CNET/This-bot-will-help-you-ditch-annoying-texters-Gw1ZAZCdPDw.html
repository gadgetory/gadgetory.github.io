the makers of the burner are introducing
a new feature called ghost box it aims
to solve the problem of annoying and
unwanted text messages here's how it
works first you'll have to download the
burner app Berner gives you a disposable
phone number then you head over to the
ghost bot website and register your
phone add whatever contacts you no
longer want to chat with when one of
those contacts tries to text your burner
line go spot will reply the app makers
say ghost bot can determine when a tax
is a let's do something invitation a
booty call
a pickup line a proclamation or a lewd
comment among others so of course we
tested it out we followed Berners
instructions and waited and go spot
didn't respond to several texts until
about an hour
the company says go spot will reply at
random intervals the folks at the burner
app also told me that the delay for go
spot respond is variable up to three
hours currently the reason is to
simulate someone who wasn't being super
responsive thankfully we were able to
test out burners test line which
responds immediately the bot did a
decent job deflecting messages and
shutting things down
for example texting Netflix and chill a
phrase I've never texted before received
maybe another time I'm down with the flu
I will say a conversation with go spot
is pretty irritating responses weren't
exactly consistent the bot will say
things like it is swamped and it has a
flu and it's out of town when I asked
about the inconsistencies it said no one
cares what you think
game set and match to go spot that's it
