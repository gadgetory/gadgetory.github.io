here at CES 2012 nintendo is at the show
we're actually getting a chance to see
what in HD version of a sale the game
might look and play like now this is not
a playable version of zelda by any means
but it does give us a really good idea
as to how the interface might work so
for example this gives us our heads up
display on the tablet controller so if
all those items were at your thumbs
disposal it probably will create a much
more seamless gaming experience so to
show this isn't a pre-rendered video we
do have the ability to control the
camera angles and the actual camera
positioning and for example turning the
light on and off really nice coming
through the stained glass over there so
the game we're going to be playing is
called battle me allows you to use the
old nintendo wii controllers with the
wii u everything's backwards compatible
i'm going to have the tablet controller
scott and eric are going to be trying to
shoot me down while we battle in this
arena so what's happening now is I'm
controlling the flying spaceship and I'm
looking for the two contenders in this
little arena and the aiming is all based
on the tilt motion so the game is a lot
of fun it's a really cool concept gives
you a great idea about how you can
incorporate different types of play with
the tablet and the controllers combined
so the plan with Wii U is to innovate
all over again and while this isn't a
game it's a really cool and impressive
proof of concept it's almost like we're
checking out google maps in real time
probably what the Google car sees while
it drives down the road and in my hands
I have the ability to move around and
look around I can look down I can look
up at the sky all while floating along
this road so that wraps it up for
Nintendo at CES 2012 some very cool
stuff including how Zelda might be
looking and playing in HD but for now
I'm going to go back to just levitating
down this road
