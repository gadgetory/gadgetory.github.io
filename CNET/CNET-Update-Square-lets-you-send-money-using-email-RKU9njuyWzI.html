is your first time doing this to send or
receive cash square then send you a
follow-up email asking for your debit
card and then wawa Square will use that
account for the transaction and future
emails sent this way we'll use the same
debit account the most you can send is
2500 dollars a week and the money should
arrive in a day or two so why is this
