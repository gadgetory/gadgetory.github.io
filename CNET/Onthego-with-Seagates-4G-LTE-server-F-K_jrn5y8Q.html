have a couple of thing here to show you
the first thing is the Seagate go flake
still alive this is the mobile storage
device I can connect your iPad or your
tablet to and stream media firm it but
it's not new and the second thing here
is a verizon 4g LTE mobile hotspot that
give you the access to internet anywhere
you go it's not new either if you come
by the two together there was something
else that is completely new this is the
new device from seagate called the
personal 4G LTE server this one about
the same size as the Gulf Lake center
line and are inside have a hard drive of
500 gigabyte and on the top here have a
USB port that you can connect the
computer and put data on it but note
here you have a Wi-Fi connection and
also a 4G connection which connect to
the internet basically this device bring
you both the internet and the data on
the go so you can access with your
tablet we have you ate the samsung gassy
tab which is already connected to this
device by the Wi-Fi network and we now
we have a 4G connection and we can
actually access content from this drive
right now and you see we have the movie
playing back and this is the Wi-Fi
connection between the two now let's try
to browse the internet with the tablet
so this device then under development
with verizon and my guess is going to be
available for you to purchase this year
even though does not confirm it will be
price probably the same as the price for
the goflex satellite and it would also
have to pay for a subscription for the
4g LTE mobile plant once again my name
is don't go and this is the personal 4G
LTE server from seagate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
