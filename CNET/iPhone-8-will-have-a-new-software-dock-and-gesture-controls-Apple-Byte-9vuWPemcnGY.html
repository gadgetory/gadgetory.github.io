to the Apple buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple and before
we start the show I just wanted to take
a moment to call out our support and
love and prayers to all the people in
Houston and other surrounding Texas
communities please make a donation where
you can you can even do it directly
through iTunes or the Apple Store so
thank you for that moment let's get to
the show and come on just how lucky are
we to just talk about tech right now and
what is a show without iPhone 8 news a
new report from Bloomberg Smart gurmann
with tons of juicy stuff says with the
removal of the home button on the iPhone
8 Apple will introduce new gesture
controls to replace it across the bottom
of the screen there will be a thin
software bar in place of the home button
that can be dragged to the middle of the
screen to open the phone it will
reportedly be a new iPhone dock that is
similar to the dock in iOS 11 on the
iPad now users can flick upwards to
close an app and go to the home screen
and there will be other multitasking
gestures as well the OLED screen iPhone
will have rounded corners and the power
button on the right side is longer so
that it's easier to press while holding
the device in one hand according to the
report and like we've expected Apple has
also decided not to hide the notch at
the top of the screen with all the
sensors now the status bar will be split
into left and right sides that Apple
internally calls ears the left side will
display time while the right side shows
Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity the deep
blacks of the OLED screen will allow it
to blend together with the ears at times
and the ears can change depending on the
app so we'll wait and see how it all
comes together also in a rumour story
that got people worried a post by Mac o
Takara claims Apple use an older slower
wireless charging platform for the
iPhone 8 despite faster options being
available now Apple would use wireless
charging tech that caps speeds at 7.5
watts while the latest Qi version 2.1
standard offers fast charging at up to
15 watts and has been available on other
android high-end phones now this could
have to do with preserving the longevity
of the batteries or other reasons we
still don't know it is a rumor so you
know calm down because if other rumors
are true most of you won't even be able
to get a wireless charging pad for the
iPhone when they launch it anyways
because you know short supplies alright
multiple outlets are reporting that set
Timber the 12th will be the date for
apples next big product launch
TechCrunch is saying that's nearly
locked in but hinges on if Apple is able
to complete the Steve Jobs theater in
time at the new Apple Park campus and
did I say theater right for you this
time because I got hammered by you all
in the comments we're saying theater
last week so to make you feel good about
yourselves I get a bad apple are you
happy now now Apple hopes that
inaugurate the theater with the launch
of the 10th anniversary iPhone invites
typically go out a week before the event
so we should see something around
September the 5th now we also plan on
seeing the new 4k Apple TV at the
keynote and according to The Wall Street
Journal the Cupertino kids are
scrambling right now to strike a deal
with movie studios for the exact pricing
of 4k movies in the iTunes Store Apple
wants to charge $19.99 for a 4k movie
the same price it charges for newly
released HD films now Hollywood studios
are pushing back and want to charge a
premium of 25 to 30 dollars for 4k movie
and iTunes the best quote from this
story comes from an unnamed studio exec
in talks with Apple saying I wouldn't
tell Apple how to price their iPads see
that's pretty funny but it also
underlines the issue for Apple here
Apple is not the dominant player in
digital media like they used to be we
saw how studios wouldn't cave in to
Apple's pricey demands for a TV
subscription bundle and instead they
made it work with every other partner
like it was one of the big fails for
Apple TV in 2016 for me new data from
market research companies parts
associates found that out of all media
streaming devices in the first quarter
of 2017 Roku was the leader with 37% of
the market Amazon's fire TV came in
second at 24 Google's chromecast made up
18% and Apple was fourth at just 15
percent so when Apple wants its way with
pricing this time for 4k movies the
studio's don't need Apple to survive
like it did back when the music industry
needed them if Apple wants to promote a
new 4k streaming box they better have 4k
content ready to roll out with its lunch
and being stubborn isn't gonna help them
here
Apple also teased the Amazon Prime video
app would finally be coming to the Apple
TV at WWDC back in June so logically you
know we thought it would be ready with
the launch of the new Apple TV according
to recode there
sources say the Amazon app may not be
live in time for its debut at the iPhone
event as well and this is true that
would be another source of 4k content
that won't be available for the new
Apple TV's lunch come on guys get it
together well let's give Apple some
props they took home an award at the
69th annual technology and engineering
Emmy Awards for contextual voice
navigation for discovering and
interacting with TV content translation
Siri voice integration built into the
fortune Apple TV Comcast's also received
an award for their voice search as well
so Apple congratulations we salute you
with a good Apple all right new
revelations from the iOS 11 pre-release
beta software thanks to I held Br that
shows the new Apple watch has references
for different kinds of workouts like
dancing bowling skating and others like
curling equestrian and basketball
because I want to play a dude in a
basketball game wearing a freakin Apple
watch but for my friends that are asking
eating food or rapidly moving your arm
and wrist up and down have not been
discovered yet ok Apple invited a
limited group of reporters to check out
a handful of some of the first AR kid
applications thanks to Apple's new AR
kit platform I've been waiting for the
IKEA one it looks great with more
furniture pieces getting support over
time and how can you not love shooting
zombies with a crossbow with a Walking
Dead app and they're bringing a
childhood favorite of mine The Very
Hungry Caterpillar 2 AR kit oh my gosh
he looks so cute ah yeah it's said to
show the potential for the technology
for children's education and you know
maybe some adults but the coolest one
right now is jiffy world I don't care
how you say it giffy or jiffy where you
can place gifts in 3d space and then
share the videos you made look it's like
really crazy cool so these are just some
of the first apps out there and
developers are only going to make them
better in fact things have been looking
so good
Android decided to launch their own era
platform to the public to compete called
aerocorp so you know the battle for
augmented reality is on and we close
with a story that blew up Twitter after
last week's show when Tim Cook posted a
picture during his visit to Cincinnati
now it looks normal but let's take a
closer look directly in cooks general
crotch
area is that in iPhone 8 because it's
clearly longer than an iPhone 7 and
skinnier than a seven plus and there's
no way that's an S eight plus so Tim I'm
asking is that an iPhone in your pocket
are you just alright yeah it's probably
an iPhone eight all right that's gonna
do it for this week's show you can email
us at the Apple by de escena comm or
tweet me at Brian's home base once for
watching we'll catch y'all next time
another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
