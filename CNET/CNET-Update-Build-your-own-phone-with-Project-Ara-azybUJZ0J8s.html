smartphone I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your CNET update motorola is working on
a smartphone that's customizable in a
whole new way leading owners switch out
blocks of hardware as if they were Lego
bricks the Google owned company
announced project ara in which one core
structural frame can be attached to
different modules of the owners choosing
and that makes it easy to upgrade by
just swapping out one of the parts maybe
you rather have less memory to make room
for a larger battery or if you want to
swap out a standard camera for something
better snap on the part you need and
when it breaks or if technology improves
snap on a new one motorola is working
with the creator of foam blocks it's a
project that had nearly a million people
signed up to support it and 17 million
people watched a youtube video about it
there could be an early test model of
this out this winter Google glass is
getting a slight design update Google is
adding support to work with prescription
glasses as well as the option to connect
to one earbud I can tell you from
experience the earbud should really
improve the quality of audio from a
Google hangout call in the current early
Explorer model the speaker just rests
above the ear and it's hard to hear
anything if you're in a place with noise
such as a mall or if you're walking down
the street
those with the early glass models will
be able to swap them out soon so I'll be
sure to keep you updated when I get the
new version Facebook is doing more to
track your actions
Facebook's head of analytics told the
Wall Street Journal that it's testing
ways to track your mouse movement to see
if your cursor hovers over an
advertisement and to track how you're
reading the news feed on your smartphone
AT&amp;amp;T has a unique promotion going on now
if you're thinking of getting a new
Samsung smartphone anyone who buys a
samsung galaxy s4 s4 active or the
larger Galaxy Note 3 or Note 2 will get
a free seven-inch tablet the Galaxy Tab
3 but it does require a new service
agreement and you have to add a tablet
to the family share plan which is $10 a
month the promotion ends on
ix if you're hunting for an e-ink reader
this holiday Barnes &amp;amp; Noble just
launched a new version of the Nook is
called the Nook glow light it's the same
shape as the previous model but now this
is an off-white color with a rubber
grade trim that offers a good grip it's
also lighter weighing 15% less than
amazon's kindle paperwhite and for the
same price as the paperwhite which
starts at $120 it has twice as much
storage and no advertisements that's
your tech news update but you can find
more details on the show blog cnet.com
