phone but it's not for everyone
fortunately there are a ton of
smartphone competitors out there who are
eager to turn the iPhones off year to
their advantage
I'm Donnell Bell and then this top five
we're counting down the best smartphone
alternatives to the iPhone 5s picked by
CNET senior editor Jessica dull court
starting things off at number five the
LG g2 released in September on AT&amp;amp;T and
t-mobile the g2 delivers a whopping 5.2
inch screen and runs the latest flavor
of android jelly bean
behind it all you have a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 800 processor which received
high marks from CNET labs on the
downside the volume buttons are oddly
located on the back of the phone and LG
didn't include a memory card slot but if
you want something big and speedy the g2
is a great choice coming in at number
four the HTC One oh man do we love this
phone in my humble opinion this is the
best-looking smartphone on the market
including the iPhone if you're a sucker
for Apple's knack for design and
materials the HTC One carries that
spirit through to a bigger Android
powered phone but you also get Beats
Audio some killer camera features and a
skinning of Android that actually gets
it right and unlike that LG g2 there's a
version of this phone on every carrier
now the only real downside here is that
like the iphone the case is sealed so
that means no memory expansion and no
replaceable battery but if you want the
beauty of the iPhone but without all the
Apple baggage that's the HTC One or
maybe you want this one at number three
the samsung galaxy s4 and maybe in the
middle of this list but when it comes to
Android phones nothing gets out
unqualified recommendation more than the
galaxy s4 you get a 5-inch screen 13
megapixel camera a replaceable battery
and something that none of the other
phones so far I've included a micro SD
card slot for extra storage now it's not
the sexiest phone or the fastest or the
biggest I'm not personally thrilled with
the way that Samsung handles Android but
this is a very popular phone that is
easy to recommend
but why dish the iPhone just to go with
something obvious for maximum Android
smugness go with number two the Droid
Maxx you want to stop an Apple fanboy in
their tracks show them a phone that can
handle 48 hours of use without a
recharge even under our most stressful
HD video playback test the Droid Maxx HD
flew in at nearly 16 hours on top of
that we've got a fast processor a
separate dedicated graphics chip two
gigs of RAM and 32 gigs of storage now
the downside is it's not cheap at around
$300 on contracts and that contract
belongs to Verizon since this phone is
exclusive but that battery life might be
worth it now before we get to our number
one iPhone 5s alternative I should take
a moment to acknowledge that the iPhone
5s is a great phone it's a 4 star review
from us it has some truly groundbreaking
features such as that 64-bit processor
and the touch ID fingerprint sensor so
for all of you Android fans that have
found your way here out of some
knee-jerk reaction for Apple bashing do
yourself a favor and just check out our
iPhone 5s review to see what all the
fuss is about
alright and now the number-one iPhone 5s
alternative for smartphone fans truly
looking for something powerful and
different the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 now
here's a phone that will get you noticed
a 5.7 inch screen backed by a 2.3
gigahertz processor and three gigs of
RAM this isn't a smart phone this is a
computer for your pocket it even comes
with a built-in stylus hence the whole
note thing is it for everyone
hell no half of you can't even hold this
thing but if you're looking for speed
and power and something very different
from what Apple is offering the note 3
takes you to the extreme so there you
have it 5 phones that will help you
scratch the itch for something new and
interesting and a year where Apple is
basically serving iPhone leftovers for
all the latest phone reviews head over

5s from me
