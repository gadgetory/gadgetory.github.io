systems cube another 3d printer this one

wrist space meaningful again and
place for a watch it does more than just
telling time in the winter and the
always exciting emerging category you go
to the 3d 3d home through the at home
aisle where you'll see both of those

every year of course they include from
dish the hoppers EDR with multi tuners 2
terabytes of capacity media apps and the
Joey which is Molly thought was a real
kangaroo for a couple days we've also
got the simple TV box which is taking a
purist feeding approach to a DVR no
video output Jack's everything goes out
streams to have some different platforms
Samsung's Dae 750 a high quality very
elegant iOS and Android audio duck with
a tube preamp in it to go a little bit
retro and finally the Roku streaming
stick putting everything of a roku box
on a simple almost USB sized device that
goes into a jack on the television all
right
Oh see Bridget get your award get your
notice get your love this we described I
think is the next way to cut the cord
the possible yeah the cable cutters
dream box you've got it coming in as
interactive you got it going out on a
modern platform as well apps instead of
cable and everywhere you go all right
the next category in our best of CES is
personal computers the PC one of the
oldest categories and personal
technology of course but looking really
fresh this year our nominees include
HP's NV Spectre this one of course the
only product on the list today that has
the name of a James Bond villain
organization in it we've got the Acer
Aspire ass - I was going to go
very cleverly hiding a lot of great
expansion ports in a flip-down door on
the back no compromises there the Dell
XPS 13 13 inch screen but it feels like
a 12 inch ultra compact when you've got
it in your hands and also the samsung
series 9 this is a desktop all-in-one
but writing a whole different page not
taking from the PlayBook of Apple and
the iMac very impressive products there
the winner in the category is put it
over but the glass lid is also a pretty
big selling point I expect you to win
mr. Hulett
good stop moving right along next gotta
go hurry that will Awards us here that's
right both software we because I'm
having such a hardware show but software
is more important than ever so what the
hardware does has become the core focus
in many ways are dominating the software
category looks like this
we've got bling goes virtual assistant
for television that lets you browse
discover and can pull content on your TV
through their software app BlueStacks
App Player for running Android apps on a
Windows computer we start running here
those apps on Windows 8 and doing a nice
job of it Aurasma for Android and iOS
virtual reality now with 3d technology
on those mobile devices and we also like
BitTorrent on televisions the next stage
of moving BitTorrent into a whole
different space than its historical
roots that's right and the winner in the
software category is bringing Android
apps to Windows 8 so you could you'll
have those Android app icons right there
in your Metro interface and it's another
part of the complication I and or the
answer to whether you decide to go with
a ultrabook or a tablet it's one more
way to bridge the behavior if not the
devices and maybe just carry one
definitely all right the next category
will award this year is a lot of
interesting infrastructural equipment
going on here they're starting to build
some very cool usage cases we've got the
nominees looking like this from d-link
their HD media router dir 9:57 USB 3 for
fast access to external media HD
streaming priority so things don't break
up when you're streaming off it as well
we're also liking the Netgear media
storage unit the WNPR 4700 it's got dual
450 raid
two terabytes a million storage and
support for Apple's time machines we
also see the Seagate personal server as
early support Elte personal hotspot it
also has big storage built into it
alright the winner in the storage and
networking category all right the next
category our nominees whatever category
include from Lenovo the IdeaPad yoga a
laptop tablet hybrid that can fold in
any possible direction you can imagine

stunning in person I suspect you have
you been on the floor let's take a look
at them from Panasonic we've got the TCP
VT 50 series plasma technology one of

moved ahead with better specs this year
and a very slick touchpad remote we also
love Samsung's
super OLED TV bringing a full-size OLED
into production or near production to
get this into the next wave of what
people will have in their homes and be
stunned by right up against it head to
head LG's 55 e/m 9600 OLED what a parent
will be the first 55 OLED to go into
actual sale in the market place and
finally Samsung's PNA
8000 plasma television another
outstanding televisions now adding Skype

the winner in the television category is
LG yeah the production looks to a very
solid four third quarter is the word
they're giving us on those and pricing

those but the technology it's going to
take this place right alongside plasma
and LED LCD all right those are our main
categories

interface to get immersed in the game

award now remaining for the best of CES
2012 that's a show signifying the most
impressive product from any of our

editors at Scenic's that's right in fact
with no delay that most sought after
honor at CES
20:44 it's the L selfies
with you about this
Tim Alessi LG tell us the big challenge
that your company had to face to bring
this technology into fruition as the
coretex been around for a while but now
we're seeing reality for quite some time
but getting it into a relevant screen
size for the home theater market 55-inch
oh it's a big challenge to be able to do
it so that we could get it out there so
everybody can enjoy you pretty solid on
the q3 release date yeah absolutely
okay when we gonna have pricing on this
guy probably a couple months before
release can you give us any insight on
the kind of consumer who's going to most
embrace this technology first it's a new
technology you're looking for high scale
but where do you think of prints best
immediately well for the home theater
enthusiast obviously is gonna really
appreciate the spectacular color
reproduction the deep black levels and
all with all of the great picture
quality attributes and this is one of
the first types of TVs that people buy
as much looking at the side of it as at
the front of it
absolutely only about three credit cards
that four millimeters it's it's amazing
they can get that much technology in
that small of a package I don't know how
you're gonna find a way to ship it to be
honest without it getting broken in the
box thanks a lot Tim and here is your
award for best to show all the winners
and while we do that you get all of our
winners here on stage that's it it's a
wrap for the 25th best of CES awards
