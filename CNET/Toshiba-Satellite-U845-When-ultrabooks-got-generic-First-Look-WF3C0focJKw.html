satellite you 8 45 s 406 all right Honda
seconds you know what these are pretty
boring right these are boring laptops
I'm not going to hide it and you
shouldn't hide it because this holiday
season let's face it we're seeing a lot
of ultrabooks and a lot of budget
ultrabooks it's getting numbing even for
us here that review laptops it's kind of
crazy for about 700 800 dollars which by
the way is not cheap for a laptop but
it's cheap for an ultrabook you can get
these 13 14 inch laptops with hard
drives as opposed to SSDs 500 gigabytes
for gigs of RAM you go down the numbers
they all kind of have about the same
processor inside until core i5 and they
perform pretty similarly so what's the
difference well very very fine points
and details it's kind of netbooks where
a couple of years ago you basically have
to play with them see if you like the
keyboard see if you like the trackpad
see if the weight feels right when it
comes to this toshiba satellite you a
four or five it's in the gray zone it's
kind of neither here nor there the price
879 is the MSRP you might find it for
lower hopefully you can because I think
a laptop like this probably deserves to
be more in the seminars or 52 7 99 range
879 feels pretty high and what you get
is a core i5 processor 4 gigs of ram 500
gigabyte hard drive on falling asleep
here as I talk about this because you've
seen this over and over and over again
and it does not have an optical drive
because ultrabooks don't have optical
drives that was a great idea when
ultrabooks were really thin but this
laptop it's thin her it's not really
thin what does that mean who knows what
that means for you it probably means
it's going to feel like a regular laptop
but sort of a thinner one but it's not
going to feel razor thin like a macbook
air because it isn't three point seven
pounds is lighter than a 13-inch macbook
pro for instance or one of those laptops
these laptops kind of pissed me off
because and they might piss you off
because you are paying up for something
that's no longer quite in the super thin
ultrabook spec but you're going to see a
lot of these this holiday does it
perform well it performs well you know
it's
the performance is actually pretty
similar to all the others with the core
i5 processor that this one has battery
life is five and a half hours which is
good you know there are others that are
better seven hours the screen quality
not so good the keyboard quality mm I
didn't like it that much but it's
backlit the trackpad seemed a little bit
finicky and a little bit sticky to click
for something like this i really want
all that stuff to be aces if i'm going
to be buying into this sort of middle
range laptop if you're desperate and you
find that this is the laptop that's
available for you to purchase it will do
you find it will work like a regular old
laptop except you won't be able to put
dvds inside and it's only got integrated
graphics so there you go this is the
distrib of satellite you 8 45 s 406 you
can get one for Less that has a core i3
processor which we didn't review and
perform a little bit more slowly i'm
scott stein and forgive me for not being
tremendously excited about thee toshiba
satellite you ate four or five s 406</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
