live from the event with blogs and
videos Nokia's new CEO Stephen elip has
only been on the job for a few months
but he's ready to shake things up at the
once leading cell phone maker in a
strikingly blunt email to his employees
mr. elip says nokia is years behind its
competitors he notes the first iPhone
shipped in 2007 and we still don't have
a product that is close to their
experience and joy came on the scene
just over two years ago and this week
they took our leadership position in
smartphone volumes Nokia which reported
profits down twenty one percent in the
fourth quarter of 2010 has declined to
comment according to a Wall Street
Journal report production has already
begun on the iPad to the article goes on
to say that the next iPad will indeed
have at least one camera a faster
processor and possibly more memory all
of which we've already expected Apple
has sold close to 15 million iPads with
analysts predicting sales in 2011 at
around the 30 million mark verizon says
the company will offer high definition
voice quality on its 4G LTE network
sometime next year the new protocol
called Vau LTE allows for voice and data
transmission at the same time a big
criticism of its current cdma network
verizon will demo these technologies at
the Mobile World Congress trade show in
Barcelona and as always a scene it will
be there on hand last year we reported
on an NYU professor who surgically
implanted a camera into his head as a
new media experiment well it turns out
his experiment isn't going too well his
body is rejecting the camera and he's
had to remove the device though the
professor remains undeterred he will
continue the expense
tournament with the camera strapped to
his head google has released a new
iPhone app for google translate the app
has all the features of the existing web
app but now it includes a speak to
translate function and you can now also
listen to your new translations Apple
has finally made the verizon iphone 4
available for ordering on its online
store today there's still no white
version yet and the first phones are
scheduled to arrive around February 18th

tomorrow for the latest coverage of the
iphone launch here in New York City that
is your news for the day I'm Jeff
