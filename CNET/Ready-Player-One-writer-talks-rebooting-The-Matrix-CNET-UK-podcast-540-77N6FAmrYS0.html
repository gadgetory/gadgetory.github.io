podcast this week we're not talking
about phones and shiny gadgets as usual
but instead we have got a great
interview with a particular film man
it's not rich but rich you weren't going
to tell us all about this interview on
you yes that's right I didn't interview
with a film man and that film man or the
screenwriters Zac pen so he has made a
career out of writing movies based on
comic books such as the x-men and the
Avengers I heard of those that you've
heard of those Goods good they're pretty
big I hear ya so that's made him the
kind of go-to guy for big-budget effects
driven blockbusters like he also worked
on Pacific Rim uprising and ready player
one so that's all we're gonna talk a
little bit a little bit about today cool
and I do know a ready player one I
actually haven't seen it but I really
like culture and gaming culture thing is
that right absolutely yes so directed by
Steven Spielberg it's based on a novel
by Ernest Cline and the idea of the
novel based on a book it's based on a
book and it's about it's about this the
future dystopia where people in this
kind of like nightmarish world they they
live out their fantasies in this virtual
reality world called the Oasis where
they can be anyone they want to be
including their favorite comic book TV
movie characters they can drive the car
from ghostbusters or the car from Back
to the Future they can they can have
where the skin of videogame characters
sort of Batman or highway no whoever
they want to be and that's a girl that's
a virtual skip you've made it seem like
you've just gone and skinned Batman put
it on the skin of Batman that's weird I
wonder if the cape is attached but yes
so so I had a chapter to Zach pen who
who wrote the movie adapted the movie
and we talked a little bit about whether
we're gonna get bored of superheroes
anytime soon with all the superior moves
we've got we talked a little bit about
where the toxic fandom is poisoning the
blockbuster franchises that we all love
so much and and what his plans are for
rebooting The Matrix
sacrilege but first I asked him to take
us behind the scenes and talk about how
a big-budget blockbuster like ready
player one gets made yes so ready player
one and it must have been incredible to
work on a movie that's kind of like so
unlimited in
dopers like everything in the kitchen
sink is in there that must have been
yeah this a lot of fun to do right it
was a tremendous amount of fun I mean
it's it's a sometimes daunting when you
can do anything you're kind of narrowing
it down but in this case we you know we
had enough guidance and there was enough
specificity so that it was kind of like
okay we have to generally stick to this
but we can use all sorts of different
things and it was particularly fun just
you know because you don't want the
movie to be about the references but it
is fun to kind of populate an action
scene with all sorts of weapons and
characters from other movies and TV
shows and comic books just as background
noise it's just it's kind of a fun thing
to do no it seemed like there were a lot
of voices involved does that is climb
the Spielberg those kind of the VFX
things with that all were those
conversations all times happening
concurrently with you writing the script
like what was the actual kind of the
process for you and yeah you know Allen
page me Adam and a group of the physical
production people as well as people from
ILM and Digital Domain we're all at the
Emlyn offices in uh in the valley in Los
Angeles so we were all working together
literally on the same hall for quite a
long time for you know close to a year I
think so
and we had a giant you know board in our
hallway that showed us everything that
cleared as it cleared so we kind of knew
okay well we need a robot who we can eat
is we walk out in the hall and take a
look at it so video is great that was
the best part of it I mean normally you
don't the writer doesn't get to
collaborate a you know and vice versa
that you know that affects people and
the production designer don't normally
have the writer sitting there at their
beck and call so for all of us it was
kind of an ideal way to work and that's
really due to Steven he kind of Foster's
that he's like no you d in every meeting
go to everything anything we can get you
to go to you got to go to in terms of
the actual like your process you
sort of collecting this information you
should go away and write a full draft or
use of the flopping around doing scenes
here and there or how does have that -
what kind of getting well you know it
starts with a full draft that you know
you first there's a new draft that went
to Stephen to get him on board the movie
and then after he signed on he and I sat
down and for about six months you know
we would be looking at sporadic stuff
coming in from people but also just
rejiggering the story and you know
getting notes back and forth etcetera it
sounds like a sort of almost a
logistical challenge as well as a
creative one it's some of this new stuff
is coming in you then have to kind of
keep track of like how does this sort of
you know send ripple through the rest of
the story you don't have to click I can
say these other things or that kind of
thing well the truth is on most movies
it is a huge logistical mess because
nobody's really talking to each other so
you get a sequence back that has all
these changes in it and you then have to
you know what I mean there's a lot of
back-and-forth where it's like oh I
worked on this for two weeks and then
you worked on for two weeks because
you're all in the same room you know the
logistical challenges are completely
inside the story you know inside the
movie and very little outside you know
we would all agree in the room hmm
this is what we're doing and then go off
to do you know the next morning we'd see
everyone again this is the traditional
idea of kind of a writer is someone sort
of hunched over a typewriter on their
own but it sounds like a very
collaborative thing is that the way that
modern blockbusters are made now and has
that changed in those sort of 30 years
you've been working as a writer most of
them do run this way and I think that's
a good thing because you're dealing with
creative you're dealing with artists you
know and practicalities you're dealing
with you know they'll tell you this is
something we can't do well so it's so
much better when you change the sequence
you know it used to be they couldn't do
hair well you know like I was a hair and
water were a big problem and so you
could be stubborn and just not care or
you could try to write to that and not
have your characters be really Airy
if that was our Savior is bull then is
that one that is
yeah no no although there might be some
old you know that's a funny thing is a
lot of the things that influence comic
books in terms of like why all their
costumes or the colors they were it has
to do with drawing and printing you know
generally does so I wouldn't be
surprised if Xavier it was good to have
involved because it was easier to draw
yeah
yeah they were just doing I don't want
to speak for anyone I don't want to
speak for Jack Kirby or whoever drew
near the first x-men talking about about
comic book movies and superheroes so
when you've got a movie like ready
player one which just has like all the
heroes in it and they're all side by
side from across all different kind of
franchises and properties and stuff if
that like the the end point of comic
book adaptations like is what the comic
book stations need to do to keep to keep
going the way they are now I remember we
would get some people asking how are you
going to do all these cameos and I kept
saying they're not cameos you know
they're just background stuff so so it
actually was nowhere near as difficult
as some of the x-men movies or some of
the Marvel movies in terms of the number
of characters but but I think your
question is valid for other reasons
ruches what do you do when there's 40
Marvel characters and they're all played
by actors and they're all you know it's
you know I know the guys who wrote them
it's hard to give everyone screen time
and ready player one it's pretty easy
you know because they just have to run
past camera right so and they don't have
to be true to themselves they're not
treated you know what I mean it's like
it's like comic-con the movie you know
was a bunch of people dressed up like
you know Batman and Superman they don't
all have to fly none of them should fly
you know because gay can't flies I don't
so do you think this dummy has been
people people like Terry Gilliam and
Sousa talked about the chögyam with
James Cameron or James Cameron said
about you know people might be getting
superhero fatigue is that something that
you think is going to happen with the
genre kind of going to stay fresh well I
think you know it's a little bit of a of
a generational thing like when they say
I do think people might get sick of
superheroes but I don't think they're
going to get sick of as comic book
adaptations that what people forget is a
lot of comic books I mean the
is not a superhero you don't you don't
structure his story like a superhero
story you know the x-men aren't
superheroes I mean it's much more like a
straight science-fiction movie about a
persecuted group of unusual people you
know they don't like literally go out
and fight crime
the you know the characters that are
like that you know Spider Man Captain
America etc and a lot of the DC
characters I mean there's a lot of them
obviously those stories are getting
harder to tell like where someone gets
some powers you tell their origin they
go out and fight crime
of some sort and do the right thing yes
it's going to get harder and harder to
tell those because there's been too many
but you know Marvel I mean you know
guardians the galaxy is not a superhero
movies just happens to be based on a
comic book you know okay
I mean it's Star Wars a superhero movie
I don't think anyone would define it
that way Joe but so that's one of the
crucial things is like will people stop
making movies based will people get sick
of movies that have the Marvel or DC you
know logo in front of them I don't think
so
I think people really underestimate how
much material is in that you know I know
that when I got to Hollywood and I would
tell people it's not just people in
tights fighting crime you know this is
you know there was a sense of like what
do you you know they're just cartoons I
was like I think you're thinking of
comic books that were different than the
ones I grew up on you know right no yeah
yeah I like announcements and mom's a
comedy and then you got cybergun galaxy
like there's all these different genres
right within that one
so Marvel thing right I mean what's thor
ragnarok that's definitely not a
superhero movie it's a crazy
mythological you know comedy yeah I'm
sorry but but look do I I also think
there's some just general blockbuster
fatigue among some people I mean not
among young people because they don't
even know about the first round I have
some you know I get a little tired of
seeing you know of movies where I can
predict where the ending is going you
know
but not if they do something different I
I think it just forces people you have
to do something different right I really
can't just give them the same old same
old and I think everybody I know the
people at Marvel and DC are acutely
aware of that know that's really
interesting I loved that he was so
involved in the process because my
understanding of a lot of Hollywood
movies is that the writers of you know
reels off this this this concept this
idea hands it to a producer and then the
writer just goes on holiday or and and
then has no more parts in the thing
that's what I normally I see yeah
absolutely you got this vision of a
screenwriter kind of hunched over a
typewriter and then they have yeah but
but it it seems like especially these
days with these kind of movies I think
one of things you sort of touched on was
the fact that the visual effects people
are involved so early on partly out of
time I didn't have a lot of time to make
these movies I know I didn't interview
with Stephen tonight who wrote and
directed Pacific Rim uprising and that
which that pen also did something on and
he talked about how he had very very
little time to do it and so the visual
effects people brought in very early
partly to do pre-visualization which is
kind of like a digital storyboard yeah
they kind of plan out the story but
partly to give ideas and partly just to
so they can get started on doing the
work it's much more collaborative
process yeah exactly and it makes sense
to have that collaboration because you
what's the point in having the right to
come up with something that can't really
be done but when everyone is creative in
their own section like it makes sense to
bring everyone together to to brainstorm
these ideas although I suppose you've
run the risk of having this one writer's
glorious vision you know being destroyed
by you know too many team involved yeah
yeah well it's I mean it I think that's
when you need like a strong hand until
that's where your director or your
producer comes into if you've got
someone like for example Marvel has
Kevin five years who's kind of in the
Overlord of all all the Marvel movies
and there's Jon Favreau he's obviously
like a big voice in Marvel movies ready
player one obviously had Steven
Spielberg and yes Steven Spielberg says
go so exactly yeah so I think it's great
that I mean it's really cool actually
the Steven Spielberg was in charge of
ready player one and he had this kind of
collaborative atmosphere where that
everyone the writer the production
designers the effects people were all
putting ideas in but there was still
this kind of like defining
so it's good it's interesting and I
think it's interesting as well the term
that you know talking about Marvel as
well at maja Marvel and DC acutely aware
of of how they have to keep superheroes
fresh because we've had so many
superhero movies yeah I mean this year
alone Avengers Black Panther ant-man
that's just for Marvel and then you can
have Aquaman later from from DC and so
so start rebooting ones that they've
already done you know so we've had like
multiple spider-man's yeah and I I don't
know I mean I I don't see a lot of them
I just see these constant flow of
different movies and then it seems like
they're sort of plumbing the depths of
oh let's find a some superhero that we
haven't really touched on that much and
let's give them a story well then let's
give them a backstory and then let's
give them a collaboration where one
superhero meets another one and suddenly
their universes colliding ailed it you
could you could be in charge of this if
you like this you're gonna love another
project that's like parents working on
it's called ROM space night which is a
comic book character and toy that very
few people have probably heard of
outside of the comic fans but and so so
yes so there there is a lot of them a
lot them coming up but and one of the
interesting things about especially
looking like DC and Marvel is is the you
know the this idea of like fans getting
so so engaged and invested in it that it
becomes almost like an online online war
so I think it's interesting that that
ready player one addresses that directly
like it's it's actually a story about
fans of stuff yeah and you know you see
the last Jedi as well that was a movie
that was quite divisive among Star Wars
fans because it's in a way it's a movie
about being a fan of Star Wars yeah and
with the character of kylo Ren who is
obsessed with the past and with the
legends of the past and the whole movie
is about you know setting that aside and
moving on and ready player one is it's
very similar and there's so it doesn't
have that kind of meta message which I
think it really improves over the book
actually so and the book is is very much
about these guys who love all this stuff
that they see you know in the Oasis now
obsessed with Monty Python and with with
you know the movie war games and and
it's and and you know all the stuff
they're kind of pop-culture ephemera of
their childhoods they're just obsessed
they've been a very kind of like trivia
level and it's interesting that the
movie kind of moves that on a little bit
and talks a bit about kind of more than
just reciting the words but actually
kind of learning from them and in fact
actually so well it was one of a big
scene from the big changes that's in the
movie
is the in the book there's a scene where
the character has to like reenact the
movie wargames but in the in the movie
they change it to the shining and I'm
not sure I entirely how I feel about
kind of recreating such a classic movie
but they do do something interesting
where it's not about re-enacting the
movie it's about learning from the movie
and sort of moving on from what you've
learned from that I don't want to spoil
it too much if you haven't seen the
movie but yeah it's it's an interesting
adaptation so we also they don't just
sort of try to interrupt you know they
don't just recreate the whole shining
there's the characters from the ready
play want to go into the the Overlook
Hotel in the shining and it's kind of
like lovingly recreated but like I say
there is kind of an extra twist on it
how do you feel about you know this this
this this kind of desecration of a
classic is isn't up to you but it's it's
interesting change they made over the
book certainly and but the one thing is
that there were various candidates it
wasn't the shining was one of the many
candidates and so I talked a little bit
to Zack penn about what happened there
one of the highlights is the shining
sequence I was wondering I mean that's
changed from from the book I was
wondering was it always going to be the
shining or whether other options and
what were the kind of considerations for
what film that was going to be no no
though it was there was many
considerations and in fact briefly it
was going to be I think I wrote a
version of Blade Runner in and there's a
variety of reasons why we couldn't do it
um one of which was they're making a new
Blade Runner movie um which actually in
retrospect is good because it would have
been really weird to have it come out
like right on the heels of the other
Blade Runner movie but also because we
got to do the shining I mean Ernie and I
that was not something we collaborated
on and you know what he had from the
very beginning of when I started writing
on it I talked about trying to do a more
you know more action-oriented getting
sucked into a movie like Last Action
Hero which he's a big fan of you know my
first script he liked a lot more than I
do but but we all I had always wanted to
write it as something where you would it
wasn't like the movie okie that it was
in the book that it was more like a
adventure experience and we wrote up a
list of
their options you know that we're all
relevant you know that would have been
right which would have been some movie
from the 80s we really thought Steven
would never go for the shining so when
he did and said oh my god I love it
we were so thrilled because it's kind of
the perfect movie for this because it's
so unusual you know it's not it's such a
weird movie in so many great ways that
and and has so much power to it that
it's not just you know just walking into
it is a thrill you know in terms of the
sort of the the advancing the character
through that that set piece what was it
somatically that you were looking for
that you were looking for in the movies
that you you know you considered well
you know one thing that we really wanted
was something that could cut away at the
notion or undercut the notion that it
was all about knowing trivia you know
that that I you know I always felt that
like holiday wouldn't just want someone
who could match his knowledge of trivia
that's not enough to prove and in fact
he'd want one of the challenges to show
that the person doing it could be
flexible you know you don't want some
troll ish fanboy being you know the
person who can only who's never learned
anything outside of the ASUS that's what
he's trying to get away from so I think
the idea is what the movie which has
some sort of extra power to the idea of
violating the Canon of the movie itself
and you know there's a lines he's like
there's no zombies in the shining and
she says maybe that's the point
you know Artemis is like maybe that's
the point we're supposed to be like if
we just stuck with it's got to be what's
in the shining they would have been dead
but it's they were at that point fluid
enough to realize okay maybe that's what
holiday is trying to say and it's
perfect with the shining because it's
based you know the movies nothing like
the book and Stephen King hated the
movie and you know it's kind of the
perfect you know analog for what we were
trying to do right so like the argument
about how faithful it is becomes
literally what the difference in life
and death you know we're earlier in the
movie they're sequences where it's
how well you know trivia might help you
get through a sequence this is one where
that's actually unhelpful hmm a few
reviewers noted this you know like I was
excited when people actually caught that
it was that's something we worked very
hard to put in there is if it weren't
for his friends telling him if it
weren't for one friend not knowing the
movie at all and another friend telling
him to stop focusing on exactly what the
details of the movie were we wouldn't
have gotten through this challenge right
so those kind of meta messages is quite
interesting I mean I know you're a
you're a you you use Twitter and do you
think that that kind of message of like
to to sort of people who think of
themselves as fans but in a very kind of
slavishly devoted way you know do you
think that's the important thing for
sort of fandom to take on I I do I mean
you know it's funny Ernie said Here I am
the author of this book that's very
different from the movie writing a
sequence with my character complaining
about how different the book is from the
movie you know um I do think it's
important because I think people on the
one hand I think the number of people
who are actually trolls are probably
overestimated because I've been dealing
with them for many many years before the
Twitter and before the internet was
popular there's always like a very loud
group of people you know always joke
like you wouldn't these are people who
wouldn't be satisfied unless we
literally filmed the book and the pages
turning you know that's what they want
well that's what they think they want
and then they get furious that you you
know does create the book but um I think
it's important for people to realize the
difference between someone not caring at
all about the fans and just putting out
product to get money from them which I
understand that provoking a negative
reaction and somebody trying to you know
interpret the material where you know it
doesn't burn up your comic book or your
book or your you know the old TV shows I
don't disappear when someone makes a new
version of them you know and yeah it
gets pretty toxic but I also try to but
I you know I think it's a larger
cultural point it's just in general the
idea of
like you can you can love things I mean
I'm quoting movie but you can love
things but if it doesn't bring you
together with other people who love them
what value does to have whereas if it
brings you together with people then it
inherently has value you know if you you
make your friends nobody would say what
are you kids doing a bunch of you
playing chess together and then getting
together to play chess on the weekends
this is terrible you can't like never
say that the kids about chess well
there's nothing wrong with people
becoming fans of something you know
together and not bonding them but if it
just turns into something to like keep
lists of like statistics and sports yeah
and you I think you've missed the point
absolutely yeah yeah I think that's an
important message to get out there I
mean we I think we're fairly overt so
finally then rich he is we have already
touched on working on something else
isn't on the space night yes and also
the matrix yeah
I had no idea this is a thing is that
matrices one of the films I have seen
I've seen all three of them although
only one of them's worth talking about
this this is it I mean they they vary so
wildly in quality that the idea of
rebooting the matrix is it feels like
sacrilege but then also the idea of
having another crack at the sequels I
and I know it's well I'll tell you what
why don't we ask the man himself to
explain his plans in his own words
speaking of films that you're that
you're working on as well what's where
you up to with the matrix can you say
anything about that at all uh in the
middle of working on it and literally
I'm sitting here at my computer after we
talk I'll get back to it okay calm yeah
I mean there's there's lots of
interesting things surrounding it but
they're all everybody's waiting for me
to hand in this draft so right um but
but it's no longer just a fantasy you
know like at one point I didn't have a
draft that you know I hadn't even
started writing and now I'm right in the
middle of it so okay um so I'm excited
though at Webster yeah I mean I know
there's a little kind of a lot of people
asking you like whether it's a reboot or
not but what was what it was kind of
more interested in is like what are the
elements of the first film that you
think that you want to continue that
still kind of still hold up in
in in sort of you know years down the
line with different effects and a
different world that we live in one of
the kind of elements that you want to
that that you want to continue well I
would say it's more what I don't think I
can do is I think the matrix still holds
up you know I think when you watch the
first movie again it has the same power
it did and that to just try to be you
can't ape it
you know you can't try to one-up it or a
bit because I don't know if that's
doable you know I would say the same
like you couldn't do well there's a lot
of movies there's like that but that's a
pretty I guess a lot of them also you
can know the the key for me is I just
think it's a great mythology and going
back into the mythology that they
already established that the Wachowski
is established there's all these great
stories that are you know in in the
Canon if you will that have never even
been touched on they you know they
created all this ancillary material you
know the comic books and the and the
Animatrix and there's so much in there
and you know I just happen to have a
take on one part of that world and how
we would get through it but I'm not
going to I'm not going to pitch you you
know it you'll have to read it or see it
you know because if I told you how I
think it's such a tough you know to say
oh yeah I'll just do better than the
matrix in terms of the effects in action
is a pretty hard claim to make so yeah
yeah always I've actually delivered
sounds cool so when are we gonna see it
well it's gonna be a little while before
