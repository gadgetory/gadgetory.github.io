I'm Bridget Carey and this is your CNET
update the Ford SYNC in-car system has
been around for almost eight years now
but in the latest update Ford is
dropping Microsoft and rebuilding it
completely with BlackBerry's Q and X
software now you can relax it'll still
work with your iPhone and Android it's
just that the interface is different
sync 3 isn't coming out until late next
year but Ford is offering an early peek
now and in our first impression we found
it's noticeably faster and easier to
navigate
it also has better voice recognition and
supports Wi-Fi connectivity so when
you're parked at home at night you can
hook it up to your home network to
automatically update the software it'll
also be updated to work with apple
carplay and android auto now Ford may
have dropped Microsoft from Sync but
there's still plenty in store for
Microsoft next year the company
announced its ready to show off Windows
10 at an event on January 21st
Windows 10 promises to save us all from
the nightmare of Windows 8 by bringing
back the Start menu and other familiar
navigation from Windows 7 we still will
have to wait until the fall for the
official release this is really just a
big tease but there is something new
Microsoft is offering right now you can
pay for apps and games using Bitcoin if
you're adding credit to your Microsoft
account to pay for media on windows or
on the Xbox
you know how the option to add money
from your Bitcoin wallet if you own
bitcoins you just have to scan a code on
the screen with a Bitcoin wallet app to
make the transfer in other news the
Google Search app has been redesigned
and updated for iOS devices
Google's hope is that you'll use this
app for all your searching replacing the
Safari browser now if you're unfamiliar
with the Google app it always has some
interesting perks beyond search it gives
you notifications about the weather and
upcoming sports games and you can track
flights or incoming packages set
reminders even in this update you can
use the magic words
okay Google to start a voice search at
any time during your browsing before you
had to be on the home screen to do that
it also folded in maps
to the search and you can review your
recent search history quickly with the
tap of an icon the past searches show up
as a stack of cards that you can scroll
through also on the topic of voice
commands and the elusive Amazon echo
smart speaker now has an app for iPhones
so you can sync with the speaker to
answer your questions and it tells you
news and weather updates it also can be
set to stream music you need an invite
from Amazon to even buy the echo we have
a review now up at CNET if you want to
check it out
that's your tech news update stay
