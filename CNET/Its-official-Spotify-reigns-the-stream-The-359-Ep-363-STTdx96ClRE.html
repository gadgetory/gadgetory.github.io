in 2018 it is episode 363 at the 359
podcast and your team today consists of
but may not be restricted to Ben Jonah
and Alfred what's up everybody hey what
if you may not be restricted to music
that's just legal mumbo-jumbo I got a
coverall everybody jumping out of it
someone's popping out a table isn't it's
just covering yeah it's Roger all right
let's get to the lineup today we're
gonna we got joan here to talk about the
spotify IPO they filed yesterday Joan
wrote all about it so we'll be quizzing
her on all sorts of Spotify and Apple
music and streaming stuff Alfred is also
here to talk about various things
relating to the cyber and the internets
and pipes thanks for thanks for reducing
might be to that ok whatever in the
internet and the pipe so there's more
information about the Equifax leak
apparently even more people were
affected I don't know how much this
could possibly matter because literally
everybody was already affected and then
alfred is also gonna be talking about
samsung's new intelligent scan which is
a multi-tiered biometric yes and it's
not as secure as they say it is and and
that's on the galaxy samsung s 9 and s 9
plus anyway send in your questions and
comments BVG we'll get to as many as you
can at the end of the show let's get to
the podcast and we'll see you soon all
right here we go for the recording of
the audio podcast we'll be back to take
your question comments in the chats in 3
minutes and 59 seconds from 3 to welcome
to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Joni
salzman I'm alfred hang spotify filed
its long-awaited IPO yesterday it's
apparently like this is a placeholder
but apparently it's gonna be like a
billion dollar IPO everybody's really
excited about this Joan you wrote all
about it and apparently they released
some numbers for the first time tell us
a little bit about that right so we've
always had outside numbers about how big
Spotify is relative to competitors like
Apple music and title and and others but
by nature of having to go public Spotify
has to really show its cards and say not
only how many subscribers it has which
is
71 million but also how many monthly
active users it has which is like 149
million people visit every single month
in addition to how many subscribers and
you can have a million yeah in every
region and say how big they are compared
to their competitors which makes them
they said we believe we're twice as big
as Apple music okay the next closest
competitor which means Spotify is very
much here to stay they seem like they
like Netflix also really became like
huge as the video streaming player
it seems that Spotify is very well
positioned to do basically the same
thing in music streaming right yeah in
terms of their adoption they're doing
great still growing it's their finances
that are just a wreck and that's not
just them it's everybody that has
streaming music because royalties just
they eat up so much of your money
Spotify is argument has always been the
bigger we get the only way to make
streaming money and make the finances
work is just to have just to have that
scale and it seems like it is working
but even as they get bigger their losses
get bigger too so really quick what are
they hoping to get out of this IPO why
are they going public well they're doing
it in a really weird way normally an IPO
like a company is trying to raise a
bunch of money and they have banks go on
a thing called a roadshow and they pitch
it to people and people get to kick the
tires and figure out what the company is
all about and then they put in these
safety things they buy some shares in
advance to make sure the shares don't go
crazy Spotify is just basically like
here's here's our ticker symbol anyone
who has our shares can trade them now
they letter they're just like flipping a
switch to let them be public and they
have to thing they're doing that they're
not raising any money they're just
making it liquid to be able to trade
publicly because of some terms and some
debt and investment that they have they
need to they need to go public they just
don't want to do it in a way that is
normal it sounds pretty grunge and edgy
I suppose also the we've got some more
news about Equifax the massive data
breach that compromised personal data of
143 million Equifax users last year also
impacted in an additional 2.4
million users the credit reporting
agency revealed this morning right yep
so Spotify likes to talk about how to
has 159 million users right that's about
as many people that were affected by the
Equifax breach so ouch
it started with one hundred and forty
five million Americans that were
affected by it
143 million sorry and then a month later
decide oops sorry oh is actually one
hundred forty five million
so with this breach today with this
announcement it's not a new breach they
just found more additional 2.4 million
it brings the number up to 147 million
Americans affected by it they're
catching up to Spotify but the idea is
the best way vasa the reason why this
wasn't announced originally is because
they were only looking for stolen social
security numbers this additional 2.4
million is only names and driver's
license but only partially so it doesn't
have like your home address that you
know all that info on your driver's
license but it does have like other info
that would be on your driver's license
on there I'm so relieved we also really
quick wanted to get to Alfred you and
sharra tip c'n wrote about Samsung's new
intelligence can tell us a bit about so
they announced that Mobile World
Congress on Sunday this is a combination
of IRIScan and facial recognition
IRIScan is much more secure than facial
recognition is just because you can put
a photo up - we've written stories about
this before with face face scan you put
a photo up to it and it gets tricked by
so they're saying oh why don't we do
iris scan so that you know you can just
scan your eyes on it and then it works
better yeah but the problem of that is
that even though it's more secure it's
not as convenient as facial recognition
because it's hard to like track a lot so
like oh why don't we combine it the
issue of that there was like when you
combine it you're adding a less secure
element to it so you're essentially like
kind of like poisoning the water here
where it's like oh now we have this less
security measure kind of like dragging
down like IRIScan - so eventually
they'll figure out something I guess
yeah anyway if you want to read more
about these stories check us out on CNN
I'm Ben Fox Ruben Jeni Salzman malphur
ding thanks for listening thank you for
that offer we were missing that yeah you
said you missed it yes yeah totally
threw me off my game I had no rhythm
left over
I like the rhetoric of this being
all the intelligence scan as if it's
like well if you're a dum-dum I'm not
gonna open my phone for you yeah but
it's I mean so so we didn't talk about
this on the podcast but is what's the
best thing to use just use a pin just
users it's like what about the pattern
thing that's what I yes I've talked to
you about this before
so the pattern thing is like
theoretically more like as secure as a
pin is because in the sense like a
government can't like tell you like put
your put your pattern in like because
it's like it's like knowledge that like
you contained it's not like your face or
your hands or anything like that the
issue with that though is that like and
it's it's very stupid so like if you
continue to do the pattern a bunch of
times it'll probably leave like a smudge
on your phone so if I like have your
phone and I don't know what your pattern
password is but it's like if I put in
like certain lighting or something and I
see like there's a smudge on there and
that if you see the Mark of Zorro yes
yeah what am i yeah so like if I just
see like a Z like like smudge on your
phone like that's probably is like
pin/password and like I can try that
alright you maybe I'll switch to a pen
good obscure reference by the way Ben I
appreciate that the Mark of Zorro yeah
of course
this is I'm kid of the nineties yeah so
a lot of security researchers usually
just recommend like biometrics aren't
really there as like a way to like be
the most secure thing possible they're
usually there like make it really
convenient for you like oh I can just
look at my owner what about what about
the fingerprint scan it's also like a
convenience thing no blame I thought
that was it it's no like they're all
secured to a degree but if we're saying
like what's the most secure it's like
most of the times it's a pin okay that
is that is useful information and also
you've mentioned this on the podcast
before the big difference is from a
legal perspective the government can
compel you to use a biometric they can
have you put your fingerprint down to
open your zone with Jesse so they can't
compel you to do passwords passwords are
protected by the Fifth Amendment like
you can't like self-incriminate yourself
on these things so passwords they
consider that self incriminating because
like you have to give up something that
you know like that's like knowledge
that's like not out there but like
biometrics like I scanned your face like
a thumbprint like police can already ask
you to do that with like oh you give
them your
prints anywhere I make ID you like mug
shots and things like that so they're
already capable of asking you that's so
that's not like self incriminating to
like give up like something like that to
unlock your devices sounds blame to me
but they kind of get it from a legal
perspective
I mean elephant in the room imagine
soggies asking you know whatever
happened to the fingerprint scanner why
is that never even part of the
conversation anymore all right it still
is I still use it for the s9 I think
it's not part of the conversation for
Apple anymore because I got rid of it
for the X 10 X 10 X 10 gonna give it to
you but is it but it's the same problem
as alfred was mentioning with all the
other biometrics is they could just
point your phone at your face and open
it up yeah I say I just went through
setting up a brand new phone myself the
last couple of days and I had to go
through the whole iris scan face scan
for the first one the first time in my
experience I have been working with some
Stone Age tech don't tell my bosses at
scene at that but finally I finally
joined the 21st century and yeah that
was a little bizarre and yeah it doesn't
work I did not like the way did you I've
actually never used it so is it better
like is the IRIScan like worse and like
the facial recognition or it's just
janky it's yeah that's the right before
and and I feel like yeah I have to take
my glasses off a lot of the time that's
if there's not enough light part of it
that's why they introduced intelligent
scan though that's like it's it's more
convenience than anything else so it
combines both of them so that like say
you're wearing a scarf because like it's
cold out or something like that so
facial recognition would not be able to
pick up your face but like because your
eyes are still there like you can pick
that up instead or like yeah if you want
to weigh our wear scarves but sure or if
you're wearing like sunglasses you know
but like the rest of your face is still
there it's like a combination of both of
them that does mean that like the the
threshold to get through it unlike
unlock your phone though is not that
great it's it's really weird that they
like that they like promote this so much
when it's like if you look at the fine
details you know that they don't trust
it that much themselves because like you
still can't use it for like Samsung pay
right we're secure folders or like
anything that contains their password
it's like you can't use that to unlock
that so it's like we'll let you do this
to unlock your phone but like all the
stuff that has to deal with money and
like actually important things
don't use this so this is also a good
conversation I have but just to to
convey how broad the spectrum is
sometimes I have a family member that I
know that doesn't lock their phone at
all oh it makes me nervous
your butt dials me I'm like hello hello
and it's just like this muffled you know
in in the pocket type of thing so lock
your phone it's usually better even if
it's biometrics than not locking it at
all the entire thought of somebody not
locking their phone just gives me the
inherit anxiety anymore I don't what to
even do with that information so let's
talk about music I love how anytime we
bring up Spotify Joan thank you for this
it instantly turns into a war in the
chat about what service is better than
Spotify is it Apple music and Google
Play and to bread and it's like okay
they're all kind of on par these days
it's also whatever floats your boat yeah
exactly yeah the distinctions and music
services are mostly product distinctions
because at this point almost with the
exception of Apple and title that
aggressively try to court exclusive you
know like a Frank Ocean release and you
know jay-z and Beyonce and all the
people that good musicians all the good
ones no that's um except for those like
exclusive basically they all have the
same catalog and so the reason that you
like one versus the other is if you
generally if you've already invested a
lot of time in building your own
playlist and one because you can't port
them to other ones that's a reason why
you'll of course together or if you just
like the product like if you like
discover weekly on Spotify that would be
for you if you like Radio beeps radio
one on Apple you know like it's really
all product distinction
yeah and the pricing is all well know
Spotify is like much cheaper for me
because I share it with the six members
of my family that I definitely live with
well that you know family memberships
it's like Apple has family memberships
title has family oh they do yeah yeah
that's not unique to look into that yeah
my six family I do think Spotify might
have done that first though yeah but you
know the the reason they can do that is
because of these deals and so they did
at first because they struck the deal
earlier than the
I don't I I I still stand by Spotify not
religiously or militantly only because I
do enjoy their interface I think it's a
very pleasant product presentation
overall but like you said the catalogs
are largely the same but once you get
invested in y balance around I will give
a nod to Google Play because I signed up
for that first because they let you
upload and I have obscure stuff that's
not catalogued
yeah there's yeah there are some
distinctions like Spotify has like the
Google Play Store ajay Ganic distinction
for Google Play and then Spotify it's
big distinction is that it has the ad
supported free tier which nobody else
has like nobody else has the opportunity
for you to go to the service play
whatever you want for free and then
decide later if you want to sign up
they're really the only ones that can do
that which has given them a huge
advantage they said and they're you know
one of the things I said in their
release I think yeah 60% of their paid
subscribers come like the the free tier
is their gateway right it's a premium
kind of thing so yeah but it's one that
nobody else has yeah I used I used
Spotify like free for like a really long
time until I got an echo actually
because you can only have like every
time I try to listen to songs on it
my girlfriend whose account is on that
like would tell me like I'm trying to
listen music can you stop so I had to
get my own Spotify account oh yeah I was
on their prime music what's the paid one
on Amazon Prime right but I think prime
music is included are they are they much
of a competitor in this whole set like
are they are they in the Mex like yeah
yeah and one likes to say that they're
because they they use their prime
subscriber base as they like to say that
the second biggest streaming site
because it's like look at all our Prime
members that we won't tell you how many
we have but trust us that's the same
thing that like Google started doing
when they like our voice assistant is
way bigger than Amazon's because it's on
a bunch of phones and it's like okay you
just put put it there and now it's in
400 million device right I remember I
tried using prime music for a bit
because I pay for prime so like oh
here's this cool new like music service
for me that I don't have to pay extra
for and it was just like really hard to
like search through their stuff yeah
and when I was echo that's pretty common
like yeah they're really bad at writing
stuff too like yeah like the worst Kanye
West song I don't I don't know any like
like much about this because mostly I
play music through an echo so the
interface is not actually that useful to
me and you know I'll just tell my echo
play XYZ on Spotify or I could even
default it on my echo you know that
actually that makes finding and
retrieving music a lot easier so what
you're considered is what the what they
call lean back
whereas off words more of really know
like you're just more of an advocate and
know what you want like when you're how
our user is a power user your lean back
I just want to listen it tygo stargazing
30 times in a row cool in its own ways
and that exactly how we describe been on
a regular daily basis in my own right
I want to give a shout out to do or do
not in the chat who is bringing up kind
of an evil elephant in the room about
some of the sticky wickets about Spotify
and their their lack of representation
and possible proper financial
distribution among their artists I don't
know if that's something we really want
to address but considering we are on the
topic of finances with Spotify right is
this something that's going to impact
them long term are they going to make
some business changes it's always it's
always hard to talk about how artists
are getting paid because I'm like does
he have a specific complaint or is he
just like is it just a generalized
artists don't get me it's very much the
that same generalized argument we've
heard several times now that like
Spotify cheats their artists ok well
then the artists most artists are
participating in Spotify through their
label and so the people that are
screwing over the artists are the label
because the label is the one that
strikes the deals and correct and
decides how much there are strikes deal
so the artist decides how much they're
gonna pay the artists and also strikes
the deal with Spotify to determine how
much Spotify how much they're telling
Spotify they have to pay it so when oh I
understand like there's definitely like
a as we have this shift in people moving
from buying music to streaming it with a
subscription and that's where most of
the money comes there's a lot of people
in
transition that are getting a short end
of a stick
artists are one of them but it's not
necessarily Spotify that's the bad act
Spotify doesn't want to screw over
artists they want them to make money
it's just they don't have that control
over how much they make unless you're an
artist that does that owns your own
master recordings you own your own
rights you don't have a label and you
deal directly as possible with Spotify
then you're in the most control which
sounds to be very rare right like there
aren't any did they change that that
system fairly recently about how you can
directly interact as I remember
used to be a real big uphill battle if
you were an independent artist to try to
get your content onto Spotify I don't
think it's as hard as it used to be it's
just a hard thing to do
being an artist's on you're out to
completely independent art it's just
hard to do because there's so much you
have to do not only have to be the
artist have to be your own PR you have
to be your own publicist you have to be
your own distribution you have to do
your own like song I mean it's just a
lot to do and so anything additional to
that's difficult
like getting onto Spotify is hard but
there's things like cobalt which is this
sort of pseudo label that lets you it's
like a white label thing that lets you
own your own master recordings and helps
you to get onto Spotify
even though you aren't having to seat
any of that sort of copywriter royalty
power thank you I'm really glad you
brought that up because people do forget
that it's not just like Spotify is
doling out checks there's a whole line
of bureaucracy in the way
yeah and artists do ultimately probably
get cheated a lot of times but you can't
just point one finger in this process
it's a whole system this the part of
Spotify that doesn't pay out
subscriptions on Spotify pay relatively
well compared to the ad-supported when
you're listening to a Kanye song with an
ad versus when you're listening as a
subscriber that listen ah with an ad
pays less to Kanye ultimately that I
know for Kanye but the thing that really
hurts
artists pockets is lots of masa
streaming on YouTube because that pays
like thousands and there have been very
vocal complaints about that industry has
been very vocal that they are
it's happy about yeah yeah but like who
is the industry going to what you were
talking about with Spotify is that also
related to the labels because the labels
don't like labels also don't know the
labels hate you
up until but YouTube is going to be
launching a new streaming service this
is their third attempt to have a Spotify
like Apple music like service and so in
the last six months they've been part of
the reason that the music engine has
been so vocal in the last six months
year about how much they hate you just
because they've been renegotiating with
YouTube to get better rates for the
third iteration of a subscription
service that they want to launch this
year do they name it yet anime music
videos 2014 this is a further
distinction from YouTube red yes Wow to
blue always blue always broke alright
more questions we just have a few
minutes left but loud we hit the throw
backs Yahoo music oh shout out to Scott
my at a man after my own heart is always
vinyl Google vinyl I want to see Google
vinyl and the radio so like besides
streaming music vinyl is the area of
most growth in the music industry
because collecting is fun collecting is
fun it's a retro like you know normal
human beings and our collectors I have
vinyl it's like a surgeon so it's
definitely like and like so much so that
there's not enough the production of
vinyl is completely like overbooked like
there's not enough people that can
actually press the vinyl um to keep up
with demand right now that's kind of
cool but it does make sense to me to a
certain extent the like and also sorry
and also EDM is I don't even know what
that is
electronic dance music oh man you're
cool in your own special you know back
in my day come to a rave all used to be
called electronica that's what I knew it
is and I would go to Paul Oakenfold
concerts and whatnot no you did did you
wear the big pants and it was a not a
great answer
would go to electronic and stuff and or
sorry well effects effects doing this
grill I mean like drop the face anyway
whatever
okay so just with a few minutes left we
have Huey yang do you think you will see
music streaming services turning the
waste video streaming did with more
services emerging trying to lure
customers with exclusive content
expanding on this and I thought this was
a very fascinating topic was Gopal who
says what if these music streaming
services became their own record label
right yeah so those are good questions
and this come up a lot in conversation
about where then she's gonna go so for
first question like moving in the
direction of a Netflix original content
yes like Spotify is already trying to do
that Apple music is already doing that
titles already doing it in the way that
it has like concert series and stuff but
but Spotify and Apple are both making
apples original television stuff
initially has been based out of Apple
music out of there streaming music
product and they're only just now
widening it to non music related content
but in terms of being a label pretty
much uniformly across definitely apples
like we're never gonna be a label cuz
they've been they've been asked that
over the course of like a decade ever so
high they say they're never gonna be in
they're never gonna be a label they're
not interested in that
Spotify I've never picked up any
interest in them and being a label but
it's and you know and it the reason is
because the economics of music are so
much different than the economics of
video and so for Netflix it was there
was an economic incentive for them to
own their own IP of all this stuff not
have to deal with licensing with other
people whereas with music you don't
really have that benefit because all you
get if you become a label is you own
master recordings and you have to get
more embroiled and that's ridiculous
insane for music is just the worst it's
just so complicated oh it is yeah it's
it's it's a nightmare and so that's the
like effort the labor you have to take a
lot for that it's like more risk than
reward if you were to become a label but
I could be wrong I mean they could be oh
it could be a way to actually change the
music industry so it can be more
functional as if there
somebody that came through is like we're
gonna be a gigantic lay ball and it's
not gonna have any other portion I never
never thought that deeply into it but
holy cow you kind of like opened a door
in my brain
this concept I just loved that Gopal was
saying like Netflix originals for music
right yeah I mean we've seen like
technically the BBC one that's an
original radio show that Apple owns yeah
in itself is an IP yeah why not original
concept albums fake and I think because
the marketing because not like different
with with video like music is more than
just producing a show putting it out in
the world and marketing it or producing
a movie putting out in the world market
like music also involves live
performance involves a lot more merch
that merch is crucial and it's just it's
just a lot more complex than as an owner
like the thing that you do as a label is
a lot more complex than what a
production company does or movie or a TV
show Ben do you like Kraftwerk serene
joy needs to know you can say yes why
not we don't is that does that relate to
like warcraft electronica legend no I
don't even know who those are my god
guys guys I'm a square in the New Jersey
suburbs and I don't need you guys to
think I'm cool or not anyway thanks for
you sound like you mean it
no no no it's cool I should go to a rave
3:59 rave Edition that would be awesome
milestone we'll just have a rave with
closed eggs still good questions coming
in on the chat but we are out of time
for today and for the week sorry guys
we'll definitely have to come back to
this I always have talking music with
you Jones that Roger will be back I'm
pretty sure on RAAM Monday just kidding

Mobile World Congress he'll be coming
back from that and we'll be back we'll
be back on Monday so Joan thanks very
much for telling us all about the music
industry and
me what EQ Emma's and EDM no really EVM
