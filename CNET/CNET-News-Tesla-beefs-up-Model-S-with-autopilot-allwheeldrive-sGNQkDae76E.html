special Tesla event where Tesla CEO Elon
Musk has announced two important new
features for the Model S one is an
all-wheel drive option they call d so
that be any model as a d appended to its
standard model name this all-wheel drive
option retains the rear motor and adds a
smaller motor up front now there's also
a whole new set of features that Elon
must cause auto pilot these are advanced
driver assistance features such as
adaptive cruise control and Lane Keeping
Assist must said that every model s it
has been built in the past two weeks has
come with a new set of sensors there's a
forward-looking radar camera and
ultrasonic sensors all around the car
this system can actually recognize speed
limit signs and adapt the speed of the
car to the current speed limit on the
road it can also follow lane lines and
automatically steer the car through the
lane along with adaptive cruise control
and Lane Keeping Assist must said you
can also summon your car but this
capability will only occur on private
property probably to avoid liability
issues with the all-wheel drive option
more than just an all-wheel drive system
that gives better traction front and
rear the car also has much more power
must said it'll get to 60 miles per hour
in 3.2 seconds I took a ride earlier in
one of these cars and the acceleration
is really astonishing it's definitely
faster than the p85 version the most
potent current version of the model s
I'm Wayne Cunningham here in Southern
California at the Tesla D event
