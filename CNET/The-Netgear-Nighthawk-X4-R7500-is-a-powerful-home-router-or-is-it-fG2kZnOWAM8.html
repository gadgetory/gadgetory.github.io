AC 2350 smart Wi-Fi router for Netgear
model are 7500 and let me puff a second
here and talk about the numbers
basically this one shared the same
quartz room 802 point 11 AC Wi-Fi
standard as the asus RT AC 87 you right
here basically on the fighting headband
they have the top speed of up to one
thousand seven hundred and thirty-three
megapixel secondary hood band up to 600
megabits per second let be a call this
one here the AC 2350 and ice was called
this one here IC 24 basically they try
and make my job harder having to explain
all that now first the Nepgear here is a
lot more powerful
it comes with a 1.4 gigahertz dual-core
processors and it also have not one but
two USB 3.0 port on this on here on the
other side i is a report you can use
this port to host a lot of short devices
as a 4x4 rather the are 7500 here come
with four it has more on tennis now
these antennae have to be attached to
the router and specific places look at
the numbers on and tear themselves and
the label right here on the top of the
router but if this plastic on top it
goes away you better have a good memory
on the back torero come with the usual
one gigabit lan port and for he beat
land port here another front it comes
with the usual array of LED status light
over here though these are also buttons
one of them is to turn on/off the Wi-Fi
networks and the other or the WPS
feature now the second big difference is
performance and is not a very good one
that because the Netgear here in my
testing despite all the powerful
hardware actually was a lot slower than
the asus it did have a very long Wi-Fi
range though up to some 300 feet away
that is the longest i've seen and very
stable Wi-Fi signal now to make up for
the kind of slow Wi-Fi speed the Netgear
here can work it's very robust nasa
when hosting a storage device you can
use it to share data to stream content
and to backup your computer in support
natively Time Machine is very impressive
now this new router here comes with all
the common feature foul in other
high-end routers but they also have one
new one that is dynamic QoS which
basically very smartly manage your
internet to make sure you have the best
online experience as any given time now
in my trial the dynamic POS feature work
actually pretty well but only with slow
or moderate connection if you have a
fast internet like this right here you
don't really need it from all this one
hey check out my full review etsy.com
if you're wondering if I get one for
myself well actually got to where in
this case was a mistake I have a very
fast internet at home but when I make a
mistake which I never do I admit it and
that's because I'm dumb no and this has
been the first look at the nighthawk x4
smart Wi-Fi router on net you actually
didn't buy them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
