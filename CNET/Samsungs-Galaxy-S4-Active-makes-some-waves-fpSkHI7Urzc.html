out there but very few of them try to
make water proofing a feature on the
camera I'm jessica's all court for cnet
this is the samsung galaxy s4 active so
this phone is rated ip67 that's for dust
and water it is waterproof to a depth of
1 meter that's only a little bit more
than 3 feet and for up to 30 minutes now
this isn't exactly a rugged phone and
it's not like some of the waterproof
phones that we've seen although the
headset jack is waterproof you do have
to make sure that the plug for the micro
USB port is completely sealed and you
have to make sure that the removable
back cover is also completely sealed
samsung recommends that you make sure
the cover is completely snapped on and
press down on the AT&amp;amp;T logo to complete
the seal if you do take off the back
cover you'll see that there is a
rubberized rim that goes around the
edges not supposed to keep out dust
water and other particles I mentioned
that the phone doesn't seem very rugged
that's because except for this sort of
stylized rubberized bumper on the top
and on the bottom it really does look a
lot like the samsung galaxy s4 the
buttons are a little bit thicker and
easier to press here for the volume and
also for the power/lock button it's a
little bit less glossy so it's a little
more grippy you don't see if thick
casing that the back cover and battery
are removable so you do have components
internally that you have to worry about
once the phone is completely sealed
that's when you'll be able to turn on
aqua mode what that does since you can't
actually use the touch screen to take a
picture means that you will use the
volume rocker to either take a still or
video all right I'm all sealed up and
ready to go
the s4 active costs 199 dollars at AT&amp;amp;T
I am not entirely sure that this is a
phone you should think of as a rugged
orderable device it would be very
cautious before taking it underwater
because if you do get water inside and
you might end up with a bricked phone
I'm jessica's all court for CNN you can
