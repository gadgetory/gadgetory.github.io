2014 interesting thing about this
vehicle unlike most things that are
called sport in the auto industry it's
not a trim level it is a separate model
just bear that in mind we related of
course closely to other are ours but a
unique model nonetheless here's the
first thing you should notice if you
check this guy out from the side the
whole vehicle is two and a half inches
longer not dramatic but the wheelbase
between the axle points is 7 inches
longer that's a big difference from one
generation to the next
should give you a lot less overhang as
you can see and tends to give you better
ride quality even at a vehicle like this
that has heavy-duty off-road ability
speak of that off-road ability if you
look at that terrain response knob that
is sort of their trademark for operating
the drivetrain and now has an automatic
setting which is kind of taking a knob
aimed at making things simple and making
it even simpler now of course these
vehicles are pretty serious off rotors
in spite of the wheels and the profile
of the tires that means you've got a
two-speed transfer case Torsen limited
slip differential and now two engine
choices a 510 horsepower supercharged v8
that you'd expect in this car the new
one is a 340 horsepower supercharged v6
a nod to buyers sensibilities today they
want to be a little less hoggish at the
pump now aside from the healthy power
output of both those power plants we've
also got a big weight story going on
here this vehicle has lost 800 pounds
over the outgoing model that's almost
unbelievable and makes an enormous
difference in so many vehicle dynamics
regardless what vehicle we're talking
about taking out weight makes everything
else about a vehicle better and this
should be a very different driver than
the outgoing model now cabin comforts
have always been a strong point of Land
Rovers and Range Rovers and this one's
no slouch although I don't see a
dramatic difference in the instrument
panel or the center console notice the
all LCD gauges on this guy they're one
of the first companies to do that there
is something else new in the very back
this sort of Abu Graib in the third row
seat
I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy but
it's there in a pinch and that's
something new on the sport as well it's
an option new tech features include that
space scrape warning system for tight
parking spots or maybe even for a nearby
brush active Park Assist that's the
first on this guy automatic high beams
also a traffic sign recognition tech
it'll read speed limits or road closure
signs display them on that LCD
instrument panel and even fade them out
as you get further away from the sign</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
