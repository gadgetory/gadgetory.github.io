straight out of Minority Report you'll
want this the leap motion controller
with it you can interact with your
computer midair to play games draw or
even unlock your computer sounds pretty
awesome but it does have some quirks so
let's talk about optimizing leap for
great performance placement matters you
can really put it anywhere you want but
don't stress about picking just one spot
move it around until you find a position
that works for you but put it too far
away and your arm will hurt trust me put
it too close and it could get in the way
of other things like your mouse and
keyboard on a desktop my recommendation
is to leave it between your keyboard and
screen when you're not actively using it
on a laptop you'll have to leave it off
to the side then bring it closer to the
front when it's your primary input
device it doesn't matter which way it's
facing another tip keep it smudge free
whenever you move it around take a
second to wipe it clean with a
microfiber cloth if there's a huge
smudge LEEP will let you know with a
little notification but those lighter
undetected fingerprints could also get
in the way of tracking beyond that there
are a few ways you can tweak the
software to improve the gesture tracking
when Sleeps installed you'll see a new
icon show up in the taskbar on windows
or the menu bar on a Mac click that icon
and you can launch Airspace to access
leap apps and a settings menu there's a
lot to check out in that menu so let's
dig in in this control panel you'll see
a bunch of settings to fine-tune
tracking you don't really need to tinker
with them but if you want to tailor leap
to your needs here are a few of the most
useful options over in the interaction
area you'll see that the interaction
height is already set to 20 centimeters
that means that the gesture zone starts
right around here if you want you can
use the slider to lower or raise that
zone you can also use the auto
interaction height tool
but it's kind of unreliable and better
left alone under the tracking tab take a
look at tracking priority by default
it's balanced so leap gives equal
attention to speed and accuracy of your
movements but if you're doing something
like drying and you want to see a boost
in precision choose that option same
goes for high speed just remember that
you'll see a drop in performance for the
other tracking element so use this tool
carefully now if you notice tracking is
kind of off you might need to
recalibrate using this troubleshooting
tool to use it pick up your leap
controller and tilt it around in
different directions to paint the screen
green until you get a score of 80 that's
it
recalibration is complete and you should
see better tracking if you've done all
of these things and you're still not
happy with leaps performance it might be
your computer specs
even though leaps minimum requirements
are relatively low its performance
seriously improves on better systems
clothes and programs or maybe consider
upgrading if you're going to be using it
often as always if you have any
questions hit me up on Twitter and check
out how to see Netcom for the written
version of this guide for CNET I'm
