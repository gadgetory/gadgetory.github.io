and this is the number one most
requested prize fight that you the
people have been asking for it's an epic
prize by battle royale between the
iphone 4 and the HTC EVO 4G now we've
given enough time for these phones to
show us what they're working with in the
real world so we're bringing the best
judging this prize fight our senior
editor Bonnie boom boom chop
senior editor Kent kg German and Brian's
boom Shakalaka Tom now we'll take all
three judges blind scores and average
them out to the nearest tenth each round
the final prize fight score will be an
average of all rounds using the same
decimal system this prize fight is as
big as it can get so let's get it out
round one is sexiness and durability the
iPhone 4 brings a whole new design with
a curved bezel but a flat back and
sharper edges its Retina display is
clearer than crystal clear but we're all
questioning how durable it's all glass
body really is the Evo 4G smooth things
out with a gorgeous 4.3 inch screen and
a slim figure to match its soft touch
backside is nice but this is still a
bigger phone and it might be a little
too big for some people the Evo 4G might
be more durable but the iPhone 4 still
has the sex appeal Apple takes this
round with a 4.7 and the Evo 4G gets a 4
next rounds controls and user interface
the iPhone 4 brings new features like
multitasking and dropping multiple apps
into folders with iOS 4 Android has
always had these but the new additions
don't subtract from the fact that
pinching and zooming swiping and double
tapping make this the easiest and most
accessible mobile interface on the
planet the Evo 4G featuring HTC Sense UI
is our favorite Android interface you
have seven home screens with a pinch
custom layouts depending on how you want
to use the phone and widget
customization that can't be matched but
there's a learning curve with Android
even if you get more control the iPhone
4 gets a perfect 5
and the Evo 4G gets a 4.3 so after
averaging two rounds Apple takes a
commanding lead sprinting 7/10 of a
point ahead of HTC the evo 4G we'll have
to make it up round three is features
both phones are packed with 3G Wi-Fi GPS
and Bluetooth but heavy hitters like
these guys have to bring more to the
table than that the iPhone has finally
caught up with multitasking folders and
email enhancements
even if Android users think they were so
last year the app store makes this
device more than a phone and it also
makes this the best gaming phone we've
ever seen we haven't even talked about
FaceTime it's one of the iPhone 4s
killer features it's integration is
seamless but the evo 4G can do that too
without forcing you to be on Wi-Fi only
now if you're talking features the evo
4G is the most feature packed phone on
the market with its 4G connectivity you
can use the phone as a mobile hotspot
let's just throw in some kickstand
action and it's Android Marketplace is
respectable as well plus don't forget
it's Android staples like the
notifications pull down turn by turn GPS
directions ask my stock its unmatched
voice search Thai restaurant and text
messages by voice let's crack in homie
the evo 4G is just a beast and it takes
around three with the perfect 5 and the
iPhone 4
get up for next round is web browsing to
multimedia Safari on the iPhone is still
considered to be the best mobile web
experience even without flash the iPhone
4 still has the best media player on a
mobile device and it's iTunes
integration get you access to loads of
music and video content that still looks
even better on its Retina display it's 5
megapixel camera with LED flash and 720p
video takes excellent pictures and if
you want to dabble with editing movies
directly on the device Apple's iMovie
will satisfy the iPhone 4 is the
definition of a multimedia phone now the
HTC EVO 4G s web browser is on par with
Safari with its smooth running
multi-touch flashlight support is here
with full flash coming soon Amazon's mp3
store and doubleTwist
will take care of your media syncing but
the lack of a video store hurts a little
the HTC Sense UI also gives us the best
Android media player plus its 8
megapixel camera with LED flash and 720p
video also takes great-looking pics
the larger screen really allows media to
shine and then you add in the kickstand
and an HDMI out port ACC has stepped up
its multimedia game both phones have
made media of focus and we're calling
this round a tie at four point seven
points a piece so after averaging out
four rounds the iPhone 4 leads by just
one tenth of a point HTC has closed the
gap and the final round that decides it
all is called quality and performance
the iPhone 4 features it's a floor
processor and the phone is snappy call
quality has improved and it's the best
sounding iPhone we've heard but it's
just a hair behind the Evo 4G but then
you get to the antenna issue in our test
audio quality completely disappeared or
became garbled when we covered the magic
spot and we know it doesn't affect
everyone but this is a big deal and a
$30 bumper or a software update isn't a
real fix to any of us the saving grace
is that Apple's improved battery life
makes up for it and we squeezed out
almost eight hours of talktime over 3G
and that's impressive
now HTC is Evo 4G one gigahertz
Snapdragon processor makes this a
smooth-running phone as long as you're
not running too many apps it also has
some of the
best call quality I've ever heard it was
crisp clean and clear for all three
judges with no drop calls running on 4G
just kills this battery and you're lucky
to get it through a day but running it
on 3G still drains a good amount because
of the screen the like Bonnie says at
least you can replace the battery we
were able to get five and a half hours
of talktime over 3G which is respectable
but one drawback is paying the
additional $10 premium even if you don't
have 4G coverage in your area in the
final round the evo 4G gets a 4.3 and
the iPhone 4 gets a three point three so
let's average out all five rounds and in
a battle where the iPhone 4 led from the
start the evo 4G cloud back to close the
gap and finish with a final round below
to take this epic battle four point five
to four point three and is your prize
fight winner both of these phones are
the cream of the crop but it was the Evo
4 G's features and some of the iPhone 4s
flaws that made all the difference
I'm Brian Tong thanks for watching we'll
catch you guys next time for another
prize bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
