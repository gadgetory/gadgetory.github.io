codes and what's the point of all this
advanced ninja tech anyway and where do
we go for our DIY car maintenance needs
we get to the bottom of these questions
and more on this week's episode of cnet
roadside assistance for january 19 2012
episode 41 and I'm antuan goodwin
alongside wayne cunningham and steven
Beecham joins us at the control today
production duties so let's just kind of
jump right into the what i think is the
most interesting email that we're going
to get all ever it's about the easter
egg and hyundai veloster in the hyundai
veloster color code now our veloster
that we tested in december and talked
about maybe on the last show maybe the
show before that uh it was a weird color
yellow 26.2 yellow and I've remarked
that was a vivid yellow I don't know the
hell that even means this is just like
26.2 yellow all right i'll buy that
hyundai we'll just call it I searing
yellow and didn't call it a draw is it
like a Pantone code or something I don't
know that blob familiar of hand turn
cones that I've never seen a 26.2 so we
get an email in from a listener who's
name i forgot to put down and he
basically states that 26.2 is the length
of a marathon in miles okay so that's it
said 'no CLE if you read it like that
it's it's marathon yellow that's the
classic marathon distance yeah marathon
yellow okay okay I get that that's smart
let's see it hyundai the makes a ton of
it and it's quite clever yeah you know
where the term marathon came from where
does that come from it comes from a
battle a battle in classical times the
Battle of Marathon where some two armies
quashing outside Athens and this was one
of the soldiers had to run and get more
reinforcements and he ran 26.2 miles I
think our kilometers that's loser
kilometers well then it was probably yep
totally cubits or something it's
actually 26.2 miles yeah yeah through
its 42 kilometers and they're using some
other term back then
some other measurement but the Kings
nose lengths or something yeah but so
yeah you had to run that 26.2 miles get
back to athens and say hey we need more
soldiers and then he died immediately
lungs bursting and they also day you ran
a marathon and yes i'm pretty sure Lee
the part of the story they don't tell is
like the the nipples bleeding pooping
yourself I will never run a marathon
look like I'm not pushing through that
I'll Drive 26.1 go home it's a 26.2
yellow marathon yah that's right I
wonder what other number word things you
could come up with I don't know yeah but
it's like it's interesting for me like
how how they pick these colors uh
they're specifically the names for the
color that's always just like you know
you should just be like brilliant white
and now it's just like whatever frost
more and white well in a former life I
used to actually work in a paint store
and we would every year the new deck of
colors would come out and we'd all go
through the different names because the
names are really goofy yeah that was a
good like you know our of laughter yeah
I'm waiting to start like catching like
sci-fi easter egg uh just like you know
enterprise gray or something like that
I'd be a good one no people will get it
and they'll buy that car because they're
nerds I'm a nerd too so I don't feel bad
about saying that you've got another
email coming in from Phil Phil says hey
guys I got an aftermarket stereo
question about the 2010 hyundai genesis
coupe have the version with the
automatic climate controls but without
nav or infinity sound and he basically
steals us a picture of what it looks
like we have already seen it he says the
head unit this car is horrible and i
want to replace it with an aftermarket
unit here are my priorities he wants it
to look as factory as possible most car
stereos are over designed monstrosities
and they either have a double din either
either he wants to double din touch
screen or something with a centered knob
that's about as much as he thinks he can
hope for and he also wants to know if
there's any way he can get the USB port
and auxiliary jack that are you know
basically at the base of the
probably nothing in the genesis coupe
there they're actually in the center
console to work with this car stereo if
Crutchfield says that it's impossible
but best buys and fri say they can do it
but only they can do it you want to know
anything you have any recommendations
for a stereo and and getting those those
connections to work yeah this should be
certainly be doable i guess the problem
is finding the one that looks factory
that's the big problem because I mean
yeah all these you know car sir is it to
have pretty outrageous looks usually
well if you're looking for something
that it looked as factory as possible
what the genesis is illuminations blue
though i would say alpine yeah that's
not bad and I mean they have some good
units they actually have some really
some new units that are coming out for
2012 that are pretty cool looking I
think the I na hang on for a second i
can actually look those up for you right
now lots of the head unit so you can
adjust the illumination to to the color
that might match your right yeah you can
do that with a be the pioneer avic unit
you can adjust the illumination on those
but i noticed before though sometimes
they have these big chrome knobs on
there you know plastic chrome and that
can clash or look a little gaudy and i'm
seeing a lot of now is that no knobs
okay just get like a big ol 7-inch
touchscreen and like eight buttons
across the bottom that don't really
attract a lot of attention that's not
bad that at all 11 stereo that I'm
testing right now and you'll have to
wait until after this show before you
can decide whether there's something
that you want or not I'm testing the the
parrot asteroid and I think that would
look right at home in the Hyundai
dashboard it's a single din unit I don't
know if it's something you'd be
interested in that is a nice
center-mounted knob and wide
illumination and it looks really kind of
OEM ish just it's got a nice mix of
glossy and matte so it kind of goes with
anything I think I'm testing it now so
when I write my review up tonight to go
live probably tomorrow on the car tech
blog you'll know if it's actually a good
radio
outside of that but also another thing
alpine has their there ix aw 300 305
that that we've that we've tested also
would probably look really good yeah car
we're just talking about what something
looks like have you looked at the
dashboard kits for the genesis coupe I
mean no I haven't looked at them but I
know they exist right so this is
something you'll need to do first to
replace that Center in stacking yeah and
if you've got automatic climate controls
it could be as simple as just making
sure you have the right module that
allows you to keep those climate control
that you already have intact or you may
end up having to replace them I'm very
seriously doubt rough to do that based
on the Genesis is dashboard orientation
you'll probably just need to find some
sort of a module breakout box or
something right now that car has a
standard it's stereo is basically a
single din it's about doubled in size
actually even when you don't have nav
that screamed except about a double din
space hmm so you should be pretty good
to go there the Alpine that I talked
about at the top of this email was the I
ve w 5 30 it's got like a little tiny
chrome knob and some buttons on it but I
think it's a pretty OEM looking unit I
definitely check that out right I do
like that parrot you're testing I had
got a kind of glance of it earlier and I
like the way it looks but the the knob
that you use for all your controls
because it's not a touchscreen is this
sort of clear plastic deal hmm and it's
a little sharp and it's also a little
smooth for me to be like quickly like
you know I like to yank the knob around
fitfully weird I looked very quickly
adjust the volume and it just you know
I've been testing it on my desk for the
first day and so without any sort of
like it's sliding around it doesn't
really the knob does it feel really
great in my hand maybe it'll feel better
when I get it in the dashboard and we
need to wrap rubber bands around the
outside of them yeah but then it just
making it ugly right well speaking of
the DIY side of this he actually I don't
think is gonna have a problem with
putting the USB port knocks jack in the
in the console I mean you may actually
may just be a simple case
you can the ones that are out and hot
gluing new ones in that's probably what
fries and Best Buy are going to do if
they don't do that they'll probably just
end up cutting the backs of them off and
splicing those connections manually yeah
actually didn't think about that but
yeah they're already those connectors in
the ya console I mean that's what I
would do but I mean that's probably not
the best best way to Maine if you ever
want for the car back to stock you run
into an issue there what i would do is
get a new panel from a junkyard
someone's erected genesis by now and
then just cut the back to those off and
then splice the new connections and I
mean the USB connection is what four
wires maybe six and the auxiliary
connection is too yeah a little easy
that you don't have to be pretty that's
going to be a in your center console and
be underneath the dashboard that's true
I just feel I'm not sure that you don't
really say exactly why you think the
head unit is horrible yeah that's the
other weird thing yeah I thought it's
fine I mean I I think it's one of my
favorite non premium interfaces I mean
well I mean the interface is simple
enough but I mean what you get with it
even their stripped-down r-spec genesis
coupe you get bluetooth audio streaming
you get both hands-free calling with
voice command with a really great sync
system but I sink I don't mean Ford SYNC
I mean like dress sink and it's not
really that difficult it's not pretty
but it's not ugly either it's just very
utilitarian I think it works i think the
interface is yeah this minimal because
you're just working about the radio
display but it's not bad you know i'm
different strokes for different folks
yeah he just doesn't like the way it
looks yeah it doesn't like the using the
knob to scroll through songs that could
be now if it is a question of sound if
it is a question of audio quality
probably attacking the head unit isn't
really the way to go right for that you
probably want to look at damp sand
speakers yeah they just said that the
hidden units horrible i don't really we
don't know what that means yeah if its
sound quality it's replacing the head
unit going to do it that's like saying
my car handles poorly and then upgrading
your engine yeah we're putting the new
steering wheel yeah you're not doing
anything where the rubber meets the road
there
but again I still thought the system
sounded pretty good anyway it's not
really a matter of my preference at that
point it yeah so Phil there's preference
there's a deathly options for you here
right we've got another Phil actually
this is a different bill different Phil
wrote to us from from Massachusetts Phil
says be interested to see if you have
anything to report about the new 2013
lincoln MKS at the detroit auto show
well i was just at the detroit auto show
and they had the MKS there but that
wasn't really the star of the show
because they had already shown them KS
in los angeles and we did a full
coverage of it there'd what dead did we
report on that cart though it's got a
new faith more streamlined that's right
it's their new sort of grill look I mean
it doesn't look dramatically different
from the old one but it just kind of
flows better into the headlights you
know basically a streamlined look and
they've they also discussed a couple of
different sort of packaging changes like
new features that they're going to add
to be frank though the last time I
thought about the MKS was in November so
i will put a link in the show notes for
you to go check out exactly what i
thought about it it's not an extremely
chits not a huge change it's it's a
visual refresh it's like the equivalent
of of like well you know we're not going
to change the underpinning platform or
really make too many huge changes but
will you know tweak the taillights tweak
the headlights add a couple of new
option packages but I mean I think
without seeing it side-by-side well it's
actually and we've got a picture up here
that actually shows the new grille and
for some reason it seems like
everybody's when they talk about the the
new MKS or their Lincoln's move for way
forward is they mainly talked about the
grill I really talked much about the
engines or anything else and this is all
you know Ford technology and powertrains
which is good stuff these days anything
you can say about the MKS you can just
basically transpose from a Ford Taurus
review right so I mean at that point it
just becomes a I don't want to drive a
car looks like a Ford Taurus I like my
car to have an epic stash yeah this is
definitely it's it's a dramatic look at
good looking car I think yeah personally
I really I really like the way it looks
I mean I joke around about the mustache
but when you see the car in person I
mean it prints really well in person is
just really sleek and streamlined and
yeah it looks you know like back in the
day cards were kind of designed to look
slick may not have been the most
aerodynamic but you know they were kind
of designed to look like liquid metal or
you know whatever that and it kind of
brings a little bit of that back to me
that I think the crowd that the
combination of like young and older
crowd and Lincoln's trying to target
will both appreciate yeah I'm just
looking at our story on there from from
LA there's a couple of things they
already had the EcoBoost engine which is
the 3.5 liter direct injection with
turbo charging so a lot of power there
and they also are going to an adaptive
crude active suspension which they
didn't have before and it's good to see
that that new technology coming from
Ford from Lincoln board yeah both
companies so what Lincoln Mercury the
whole thing no mercury there dude anyway
I just tossed a link i will put a link
on our show nuts for that two of the
coverage we did that so yes we have
covered that car very cool car but
moving on right we got another email
from not a fill this one is from from
Reuben sandwich I'm pretty sure that's
not his last name and it says if car
technologies are getting more advanced
then what is my kia optima with the
turbocharged direct-injection only use
regular gas versus premium gas and if i
use premium gas well I get more
horsepower and a faster 0 to 60 time
thanks guys love the show see when you
back from CES do you need a faster 0 to
60 with your optima i'm a cool car um
but I would posit that the reason that
your kia optima runs on regular gas is
because of all of the advanced
technology in your car ten years ago you
had a turbocharged engine and you put
cheap pump gas in it it would be a
knocking detonating mess like it would
not run smoothly you would not have a
good a good time and you would finally
you find yourself you know quoting The
Fast and the Furious
when you blow the Wills from your intake
manifold whatever that means um so the
fact that your your vehicle can handle a
forced induction and not destroy itself
is because you're taking advantage of
the advanced engine management that
we've seen growing over the last couple
of decades and direct injection which is
basically allows you to more accurately
meter the fuel as you get in it used to
be when you when you when you
turbocharged an engine you oftentimes
find yourself putting more air into the
engine than the car was smart enough to
handle and then what you would get a pre
detonation which basically means the
explosion that happens in the combustion
chamber would happen before the piston
with that top dead center and ready to
start coming down so basically you've
got the piston coming up and the
explosion kind of hits it and you
basically are shocking the crap out of
your your engine now that you know cars
are smarter they know everything that's
going on they can more accurately meter
that fuel and that's why you can run the
cheap gas and I would venture that if
you put premium gas in the car that says
put a cheap gas in it if you put if it
fits put regular octane in and then you
decide to go above and beyond and put
prima geffen you might see a performance
boost but you might not it might be so
small I think there I think there would
because I've seen situations where car
companies will say you can put regular
or premium gas in this car but you'll
get better mileage but I find those are
usually cars that are designed to run on
premium and then they say well you could
put the cheap gas in it if you want dad
won't hurt anything they come out of the
door saying put the cheap gas and that
means that when you put that premium gas
and that is basically higher octane and
more resistant to detonation then your
engine control systems will basically go
oh so I don't have to work so hard to
not detonate cool i'll just do what I
normally do right and you won't really
see a huge bump it that's my my my
theory I wouldn't know this without
actually doing some instrumented testing
right I mean you could test it if you
want to hurt but I don't think you're
going to notice a big difference you
don't mind paying
an extra like five bucks at the pump
every time sure go for it yeah I
personally I'd buy a hot dog with that
money the you know be interesting to do
this if you but I think it only notice a
difference if you really got down with
the instruments and did very controlled
testing said okay now I've got a full
tank of premium gas and I'm going to do
a zero to 60 and I'm going to measure my
fuel mileage over a certain amount of
time and then do the same thing with a
regular you know take a regular and you
were saying Wayne that you think that
you'll probably see if you see anything
you'll see a jump in fuel economy yeah I
think that's mostly what you'd get I
don't think you'd get I you know and I
think too if you threw in if you just
threw in premium and said am I do I feel
like I'm going faster you might feel to
get that placebo right I I love to use
the story of when I put hundred octane
gas into my like 2,000 mitsubishi galant
and I'm just like yeah it's faster I
guarantee you it wasn't I just needed to
feel like I was justified in paying five
dollars a gallon yeah yeah he's back 100
octane was five dollars a gallon ya know
it's late if you can find it so yeah
probably no real no no definitely no no
appreciable gain online premium here not
worth it really you're welcome to try it
out definitely will break your car by
treating it better than it needs to
what's a better way to get a faster 0 to
60 out of a kia optima than putting
premium guess in it better tires yeah
okay go turbo charging nothing like that
ah what's already got the tow this one
already has a tour bus equate we're
gonna do nobody's come out with that
chipping yet for this car you know if
they could ship it and you might get
more power out of it you might be able
to do that I mean you I mean you'll
probably cold air intakes I would just I
was about to say like you know just make
sure that you keep your air filter
change the oil change it's probably
gonna be I realize now that I found a
lot like my dad how do you do all that
just like change your oil and check your
filter yeah don't go crazy laws
performance your air pressure your tires
it right wasn't wasting your money on
that crap what was funny is like when I
was a teenager like I was so into like
suspension tuning and like cold air
intakes that I just would never check
the air pressure in my tires and it
would always be low and I would you know
be outside in the
Raj with my dad and we'd be talking
about like car stuff involve on he just
go like your tires look a little low and
I would just immediately feel stupid
HYFR have to do that like the most basic
thing ever it's it's like it's like like
giving it like a speech in front of a
large group of people on something
incredibly intelligent and then at the
end someone says your fly's unzipped how
I would feel when you would point out my
air pressure here's the easy thing yet
so moving on here next email we get from
Alan W who says can you talk about or
review the best online auto repair
websites or CD repair products like all
data DIY I have a 2004 cayenne s and
like to do my own repairs which ones do
you like so I think well we go back to
the paper manuals with those yeah again
when I was growing up every car that I
bought that will not been at fault in my
first couple cars or hand me downs but
you know the any car that I had within
like a month or two of owning it I had
like a hanes paper inaudible let me a
paper manual just like all right well
you know where is everything you need to
know what you need to take off before
you get to the CV you change a cv boot
or something like you need to have those
sort of things and the reason I like
paper manuals is like you can't drop it
and break it as you can drag it
underneath the car and spill oil on it
and never have to worry about you know
breaking your laptop okay you're looking
at a CD I've done the same thing with
Haynes or Chilton too yeah usually you
know get the new car you know used car
whatever and the first thing you do is
get that paper manual they have I have
done some reporting on in last year on
both of those companies Haynes and
chelten are bringing their their manuals
to to an online format and the way they
have it set up is they don't have all
the different vehicles they have their
starting off their most popular vehicles
or most popular manuals and you know I
think Haynes has going to be 20 to 30 of
them up now and you pay a subscription
price right you pay like got on 10 bucks
a year or something in or 15 bucks a
year and it's also how all day to DIY
that Ellen mentions it as email work you
pay like 19 bucks a year for your car
and I guess
all that talk about haines is for the
benefit of the rest of our readers
because they don't even offer a Porsche
Cayenne manual I think the only thing
they have is like a Porsche 944 and
that's out of print so they don't even
have a Porsche Cayenne manual sorry Alan
so it looks like your best bet would be
something like all day to DIY but it's
difficult for us to to kind of check
exactly what they have on exactly your
car because i'm not gonna pay 19 bucks
for every single car just to verify it
well I also you know I think we've got a
good point though about going paper over
an online version because because I mean
my manuals you know for my cars would
always you know the pages would have
grease smudges on them character yeah
you know the pages are leapt and stuff
like that and you know when you're
working on breaks or something that the
brakes section and it's got all these
said dirt smudges and grease much like
thumb prints of brake discs yeah and I
don't want to get those same smudges and
stuff on my computer on my laptop you
know the you like a second jinke laptop
for like a hundred bucks just to bring
out that kind of stuff yeah sure you
want to do is like Oh LPC's 400 bucks
right or get a little cover plastic
cover form like they have in the shops
yeah yeah so yes book or something yeah
you're not messing up any anything with
all that grease and stuff I don't know I
mean yeah it is convenient with the
online manual to be able to and
sometimes they'll let you print those
pages out yeah where I feel like all
right I just need to print a diagram of
the brake system or a printed diagram of
the the rear sway bar assembly you just
mean I think all data DIY does offer
printable printable resolutions for any
of their illustrations if you pay the
subscription and I actually went through
their their demo they like a demo work
for like a 2001 ford focus or something
and they have a lot of stuff that you
would kind of expect to see in a paper
shop manual but I just can't confirm
they have it for every vehicle yeah is
what has me a little worried so say that
it's 19 bucks it's not really that big
of a deal I mean that big of an expense
if you're if you want a Cayenne look
what I take the like stereotype force
your owners but if you own a Cayenne
like 19 bucks and check it out but what
I've seen with the Haynes in the
manuals online is they they actually
view color pictures which they usually
new black and white in the in the the
paper mandas which is nice and sometimes
they even have a little video that shows
although the video isn't specific to the
car the video is just sort of a general
thing was like how to change the oil in
a car and we're using this Chevy Malibu
here but you might be have something
different but it's yeah basically the
same usually yeah there's a I think
there's a lot of potential for these
things to do a lot of nice detailed
information online there's also being
able to hyperlink around is very
convenient I'll being able to search is
very convenient because as good as the
best index is isn't that nearly as good
as just searching so I'm actually going
to look and see if the Porsche Cayenne
is the 2004 Porsche Cayenne is available
in all day to DIY I assume since he gets
in there okay yeah you look it up before
the show it's in there um but it's just
you know all right now you gotta pay 19
bucks to look at it and union you can
only look at it for a year right uh yeah
I haven't seen the all day to DIY
manuals I just really know that the
hands of children ones Witcher yeah I
assume these are very similar if they're
gonna be competing only there's there's
a lot of stuff that you can get on all
day to DIY like you can look up part
numbers there's a thing a tool-less you
estimate what labor would be if you just
don't feel like paying for it um so it
you know it's like well this thing would
take about this long so here's about how
much you could expect to pay for labor
of your mechanic wants to charge you
this much per hour and if so it's like
it's an interesting tool for di wires
and you know when you get in over your
head effort for basically estimating
which you can expect to pay someone else
for for these sort of things and even
like cost estimates for like you know
how much is a tie rod end for an acura
RSX gonna cost me it should cost about
this then you have some sort of a way of
arming yourself when you go to buy those
parts for your DIY stuff that something
paper manuals just don't do it's also
something you could probably easily
accomplished with a basic Google search
once you have the part number but it's
kind of interesting that it's all there
yeah chilton had something similar that
too i wish a look at the Chilton site
right now for their their manuals their
online bit they don't seem to have
Porsche at all they don't know they
don't and I know changed event
already mentioned that yeah yeah it's
hard for me that their nether website
was this really difficult for me to
navigate value yeah there it doesn't
seem like it was their primary business
you know I started out with paper and so
yeah the transition to transition to the
web is a little rough on I think they're
also starting to kind of they may have
actually already been doing the kind of
just focusing on training mmm like oh
yeah you get like Chilton certified and
break work right or something like that
so a lot of their their online materials
are just kind of aimed at like getting
you into a class or something yeah that
makes sense alright we got another
listener who wants to put an aftermarket
stereo in his car this time it's a 2010
chevy camaro and I apologize if I
mispronounce your name Afiya me and it
basically basically just bought a 2010
chevrolet camaro hooray for him
unfortunately he's not very excited
about the tech in the car he's trying to
get in aftermarket double din head unit
and he wants to remove the factory radio
and he's only found two head unit kids
but both of those lose the the knobs for
the climate control he really likes the
knobs we just liked the look of them and
this question is are we aware of any
dash kits for the june five camaro that
retained those factory style knobs for
the AC controls the answer that is very
simply no because if you look at the if
you look at the dashboard of the the
camaro you see that it only really comes
with that single din opening for the
radio and then the knobs are just below
that the problem is if you get a double
din unit that's taller than that now
your screen starts to interfere with
where the knobs would normally go and
that's why you see all of these are
really good by the way aftermarket
Camaro dashboards switch over to button
interfaces so the the metra 9 930 10 s
that he actually already found basically
switches to a bank of buttons for your
climate controls and skosh actually has
a kit that also uses two banks of
buttons but it also has a small like
four inch color LCD so you'll be able to
like see
you know what temperature you're sitting
or what span speeds are setting or what
sort of like vent configuration that
you're setting it's kind of cool-looking
I think it's also 350 bucks mmm so 3 or
50 bucks for a dashboard kit on top of
what's already gonna be like 70 80 books
for a stereo you know it could get kind
of crazy I think a good suggestion here
might be too I don't know if he needs to
go with a double din since you can get a
lot of functionality in the singled in
units now well the problem with that is
nobody make single din openings anymore
like they don't make singled in kits
anymore they just make double din kids
and then they give you a little plastic
pocket alright I phone in or whatever it
just works out cheaper that way than
manufacturing two kids and you know it
basically allows them to keep the cost
down on their tooling and whatnot you
think there's any possibility of putting
a replacement single din into a Camaro
I've never seen a single Jane case so if
you do it's going to be something that
you have to do yourself and that when
things started getting funny-looking
unless you're like experienced in
working with fiberglass or something
about a fabricator that can do it for me
you know maybe not too much money
rightly but then you run into the issue
of well the the reason these kits are so
expensive is because they come with that
breakout box built into them that
basically your climate controls run
through your stereo system all of that
run into the same wiring harness so when
you when you yank out that stare even if
you just cut it out with a dremel and
pulled out whatever happens to be behind
there you'd be left with a bunch of
knobs that don't connect to anything so
that's why these kits replace those
knobs with buttons and that's why a kit
that basically only adds buttons ends up
costing you a couple hundred bucks so
like yeah the kids that were showing
right now our universal kits for a bunch
of different cars but in the Camaro's
case it's just right you won't be aware
those knobs are preserve that yeah so
either if he Emmy you're getting enough
to stick with the tech that lives in the
the Camaro I don't know if there's any
way of proving that except through I
think I think advices from if i had to
guess and i often make a lot of
assumptions about what people send in
their emails because
no it's not really easy to talk back and
forth but I'm guessing he wants true
navigation since he's talking about
getting aftermarket doubled in unit and
you can't get the camaro with anything
but on Starnet as far as like as far as
I know right that's true so hey if you
really want that navigation with the
locally stored maps in the dashboard and
all that you're going to have to give up
the knobs it's just kind of par for the
course yeah so we got one last question
here like anything going to hit kind of
quickly or as we get close to wrapping
up our show from JD w we only get
initials for JD w he says i watch all of
your video videos and find them so
helpful i am in the process researching
to purchase a new car I was looking at
2010 2 2012 vehicle lacrosse cxs as well
as the new 2012 audi a6 to point out
tfsi I haven't estro of the La Crosse
but I have driven the audi a6 a.m. a
previous 2007 lexus es350 owner I was
wondering in your opinion which vehicle
is better says I'm graduate student at
Harvard University and will soon be
graduating I also will be traveling to
and fro putting plenty of miles on my
next vehicle I need something that is
reliable and I desire something that is
comfortable to drive long distance as
well as fuel economical but also stylish
my budget is not extremely large but i
believe it is worthwhile investment to
get a vehicle that will endure four or
five to six years after purchase without
being obsolete in its technology and
tastefulness i guess he must have
graduated from the travelling salesman
program at Harvard right it sounds like
don't have that every day we all right
yet your your suitcase full of wares and
you'd knock on people's doors and go I
want to show you the new wow yeah that's
that's hard for program into the kitchen
in the future big important harvard
program so uh jdw uh you know the i was
i drove the Buick LaCrosse last year I
briefly we haven't got it in for a full
review the latest one but it is a really
nice car and one thing the cool that
they're doing with it is putting a
hybrid standard you won't be able to get
this car without a hybrid engine system
and it it's technically a mild hybrid
system but I was pretty impressed with
it I thought it worked really well and
for my brief drive it seemed to get good
fuel economy can't really tell until we
get it in for a longer run but it was uh
they did a great job
making a very affordable luxury feeling
car that'll actually feeling car
actually luxury car I mean Buick is a
premium brand yeah and they will have
good technology Annette so I certainly
like the La Crosse the a6 not a bad car
either I'll think you'll spend a lot
more on the a6 I think you're talking
about it twenty thousand dollar price
differential Wow yeah it's a that's a
lot of money that's a whole extra car
yeah because the liminal across is like
a thirty thousand dollar car yeah but I
mean Sosa robbed ran for it yeah you go
my stereotypes again come on depends on
what Commission's evasive that traveling
salesman's salary how many vacuum
cleaners you have to sell for twenty
thousand dollar price both of these cars
are gonna be a long way from your ES 350
which you know I think we've gotta
considered as sort of a glorified Toyota
it basically is a camera yeah i mean i'd
see that's got lexus luxury it's
comfortable that i don't think there's a
single thing you can get on the es the
2007 ES 350 that you can't get on a
premium camry yes probably not i mean
unless you did an ugly license woodgrain
interior yeah but alyssa lacrosse is I
think a good choice actually and an
affordable choice and has good
technology in it the one the ones I've
seen the ones i've tested they're
actually putting their whole at in
telling app system and all that so then
i'll have some really good modern
technology that the 2012 a6 also great
technology in that car and i'm a fan of
that they're two point O tfsi even
though they six is a fairly large car i
think it's a you know that that engine
is enough to give that car plenty of
power plus you get that you know this
google navigation system and the the
wired connection in this car which you
know we've liked here at car tech quite
a bit i'm tresh finding if there's
anything we haven't thought of for jdw
here actually when you know one other
car i would think to look at would be
the mercedes-benz c-class i thought you
were going to go infinity that really
did I thought you were going to go
infinity there yeah I guess we don't
have that Asian representative here as
far because I mean that's kind of where
I would go I'm infiniti g although you
know i would except
I would wait for infinity to we need a
new generation of their tech in the car
I wouldn't recommend the Infinity just
now it's you know the infiniti g has
been riding on its you know five year
old technology at this point so i
suppose i think it needs an ax I mean
it's a great-looking car it's it's a
nice solid reliable as I think the
reason I that I think so highly of
infinity is that it's the closest thing
that I can compare it to is an acura and
they're writing on 10-year old
technology above those are long do for
an update you know another car actually
in the lexus vein is the lexus is that's
a pretty nice set on your like i haven't
seen an eye aside by Federer and a six
early about the same size yeah yeah i
think the the diets might be a little
bit smaller yeah i think it may be
straddles the a46 line yeah but i'm from
it is you up to a GS i think the es I
think might even be actually between
those two cars in size but again we lost
custom downplayed this yes but the the
new Lexus GS is pretty sweet looking car
but oh yeah me than the one that just
came out with the new the new elf
finesse design yeah that's true they
good looking car like exactly if you get
the F Sport that's work package yeah is
uh I can't wait to drive that I I can't
believe I'm saying I'm excited about
driving a Lexus but I cannot wait to
drive that the GS with the f sport right
yet sometime in the LFA so you're you're
a little lexus bender right oh yeah yes
I did it I've been excited about driving
a Lexus before LFA doesn't count though
that's true that's not really Alexis
that's something entirely different yeah
I think well anyway I did respect to the
regional quest for sadies c-class it's
it's the c-class is a nice especially
the c300 I definitely prefer that over
the sea 350 even though the bigger and
generally give you more horsepower and
stuff you don't really need it and the
c300 is a nice comfortable car stylish
good you know solid technology in there
it's not super advanced at this point
but it's it's also car 35,000 you'd
probably spend total on him and that's
about you know the Buick might come on a
little bit under that they 6i think
would definitely be over that Audi why
would you go see in that II
yeah well I personally especially for
you not just graduating from Harvard
mm-hmm well he's a graduate student okay
that's a different thing graduate
student so me that's not he's not gonna
be graduate apartment with undergrad it
will soon be graduating yeah I'm not
gonna be coming out with slow there are
sisters yeah a second if you're younger
maybe the c-class I you know I like to
see class and per se I mean this is my
preference for slightly smaller cars you
know they seem more nimble more usable I
mean I guess if you want to carry around
business partners in the back seat you
might want the big limo style car but
yeah I like that I feel like the e coupe
is pretty small oh yeah uh it's not tiny
but I mean I think it's probably closer
in size to the Buick in the a6 and the
sea is yeah but did you to be stalking
sedans here yeah yeah yeah I think he
wants the rear doors otherwise i would
say go for the audi s5 because that's an
awesome car yeah a lot of different
choices there but i mean if you had
toss-up just between the Buick and the
Audi yeah I would you know I like the
driving and they've Audi better and I
like the tech in it better at this point
so i would go with audi but if i didn't
have the extra twenty thousand dollars
to spend on get with the Buick or a
cheaper audi there you go alright so
those are our emails for this week I'm
actually surprised that we get through
all of them and we don't have low cars
