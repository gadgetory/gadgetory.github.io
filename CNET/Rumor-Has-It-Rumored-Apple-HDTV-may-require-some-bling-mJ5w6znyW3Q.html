and welcome to rumor has it the show
where we round up the week's biggest
tech rumors and vote on what sounds
likely and what's probably bumped I
remember that you can vote on all of the
rumors too so keep your eye out for the
pole in the interactive player if you're
watching on Cena first up according to
reports from Paul Thurrott and the verge
Microsoft will unveil the next Xbox at a
small event am a 21st at the event
Microsoft will reportedly touch on many
of the consoles details including a
five-hundred-dollar price for the
regular version and three hundred
dollars for a subscription-based model
these reports come just days after
Microsoft creative director Adam orth
basically started trolling his Twitter
followers about the rumor that the new
xbox will require an internet connection
at all times yeah he just didn't
understand why people were making such a
big deal about it ending his tweet with
the hashtag deal with it then he
probably like put on stunner shades and
he was done yeah chastising your current
user base about something they're
anxious about historically not awesome
it will be like me trolling the comment
sections of every cnet review i wrote
telling people how wrong they were when
they disagree with me yeah but don't you
do that like every week quiet okay but i
was just i think that oh my god i
resisted what is wrong with you i have a
problem next we've got some google news
for you allegedly google wants to buy
whatsapp the super popular messaging
service that essentially allows for
cross-platform texting without having to
pay for SMS according to a report from
Digital Trends citing an anonymous
source whatsapp is playing hardball
getting its selling price up to 1
billion dollars which is just how much
Facebook paid for Instagram last year
now Instagram was huge when Facebook
bought it probably bigger than whatsapp
which makes me think that 1 billion
dollars is a little bit overpriced but
maybe Google is feeling the pressure to
boost its mobile chat capabilities
especially on the heels of facebook's
chat
heads yeah cuz you know chat heads in
any case all things D reported a whats
app exec completely denied this anyway
and won't comment any further probably
because all these obnoxious journalists
are probably calling them up being like
hey was that no nope next up remember
the ITV it's that fabled television that
Apple is probably building causing the
rumor mill to disrupt every couple
months when talking about it now Apple
analyst Brian White predicts the Apple
will introduce a 60-inch ITV later this
year for between 1500 and 2500 dollars
depending on the configuration and
accessories but then his prediction gets
all crazy he said it would include an
eye ring which is a small device placed
on the finger that serves as a
navigational pointer and takes over some
of the functionality of a traditional
remote control yes the eye ring also
powered by the willpower of the user
penny went on to say that the ITV would
come with iPad like mini TV screens and
that the rumored iWatch would also play
an integral part in controlling the TV
saying that the devices will increase
mobility around the home so he basically
just rolled every single Apple rumor
into one yeah so you watch your I TV
while wearing your i watch in addition
to your eye ring and there's second
screen action happening on your iPad
this all sounds I crazy I think I crazy
after all that what do you guys think is
an eye ring part of the equation don't
forget to vote and leave a comment and
we'll check in with the cnet council the
cnet council is composed of five editors
who cast their votes anonymously their
opinions are not an endorsement by cnet
or CBS interactive obviously because
these are rumors folks and the consul's
verdict is no 4 out of 5 editors do not
think that the ITV will come with an eye
ring thank God now that's our show
everybody please share your rumors that
rumor has it at cnet com or call us at 1
800 750 cnet and tweet us and thanks to
this week's guest host Eric thank you
and to the next week
for more tech rumors I went off-script I
don't know but it still is that also I
like spit in her face like sushi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
