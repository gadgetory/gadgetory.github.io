to the cnet mailbag the show where we
take your feedback and answer your
questions about the stuff we're doing
here at seen it I want to start off with
some of your snail mail first and this
is the kind of thing I always find
amazing we got a postcard from Steve in
the US Army who wrote in from Iraq may I
say first pretty awesome to get a
postcard from Iraq about its
archaeological wonders nice anyway steve
says he trudges down to the internet
cafe on his forward operating base early
in the morning to watch mailbag the buzz
report and however many shows i can
download in the 30 minutes i have on a
ridiculously slow connection he says
keep up the great job and I look forward
to when I can get home and see them in
HD and also he says you are not alone
when it comes to the belief that Google
will eventually lead to all technology
to become self-aware a lot of us think
that too Steve thanks for writing thanks
for using your internet time to watch
our shows and I sincerely hope that
Google is the scariest thing you have to
deal with today come home soon engineer
chick from the watch bol calm chatroom
sent a postcard from the Big Island her
fabulous vacation in Hawaii and pointed
out that on the podcast central page at
podcast cnet com under the description
for EIC squared it says the two
editor-in-chief's we please have someone
fix that oh yeah Thank You engineer
chick i talked to jason howell and it's
already fixed and speaking of that page
Jonathan rights in why do you hate us
moreover why are your web designer so
lazy it's been over a month since your
redesigned and you still still have an
updated podcast I cnet com no doubt you
guys would have heard about the mistake
you've had plenty of time to create a
new page and you've done nothing if you
really don't want to do what you were
hired for then I'll be happy to do it
myself my eyes and the eyes of thousands
of other visitors bleed redesign the
page already Wow Jonathan it's not you
okay you don't hate you we just have a
lot of pages on cnet but I can tell you
that we have a new design and it's
currently in production and if you want
it to get done faster maybe you can all
send me a bunch of emails and I'll
forward them to the engineers they love
that okay and other technical issues
I've been
getting a lot of email lately like this
one from Sean every time I watch videos
on cnet TV I have to refresh the page
because when moving from one video to
the other the flash player freezes don't
know why but it's really annoying and I
really like the videos but they're just
so darn hard to get at because of this
glitch and honestly I thought it was
just that normal thing where people have
an ad blocker on and it prevented the
playlist from continuing after an ad but
then it happened to me and we realized
it's an actual bug it happens when you
refresh the playlist like load up the
buzz report or a bunch of cell phone
videos while the ad is playing so now
that we know what's wrong we're hard at
work on a fix in fact it might be fixed
by the time you see this hurry and good
news for Linux users who have a problem
with our site because the flash menus
pull down under the video player version
10 of flash just came out and my Twitter
friend Carl benin burg reports that it
fixes the menu problem on cnet TV so go
get flash 10 Linux people array in other
important questions of the day are says
during the review of t-mobile g1 did
Bonnie toss a pretty effing good and
fast at around 2 45 in the video just
checking over the 3g network in is
pretty good and fast no are no she
didn't or did she and that'll do it for
this week everyone keep that feedback
coming mailbag at cnet com or send me a
postcard to 35 second street san
francisco california 94 105 see you next
