Cena this is the samsung gusto 2 and
this is a reboot of the original gussto
for Verizon and I have to say this phone
is much much better in fact I called the
original the disgusto because I liked it
that much this is a phone that I
actually do like the design is your
typical flip phone it's actually really
nice it's got this gunmetal color a soft
finish it feels really compact very good
in the hand
sturdy hinge here as it flips up it's
got a 2 inch screen right off the bat
I'm a little unhappy with the screen
resolution because it is aq qvg a 1/4
QVGA screen it's a resolution that is a
lot lower than other flip phones and it
shows but what is nice is the navigation
buttons are easy to press quite big
there are a lot of options here
including ice which is in case of
emergency so you'll be able to have
three people there plus a lot of
shortcuts to your text messages and some
buttons on the side that give you short
cuts to the 1.3 megapixel camera and to
speakerphone so that's pretty nice there
in addition to phone calls by the way
call quality is very good on this so in
addition to the phone calls text
messaging multimedia messaging you also
have little tidbits like Verizon
Navigator or some games like Tetris and
some mobile email options as well as
social networking tie-ins one of the big
things with this phone is that there are
a tremendous amount of accessibility
features so you can have voice menu
readout dial readouts when you're
dialing a number text message readouts
so a lot of audio that combined with the
in-case-of-emergency number makes this a
good selection for seniors and for other
people who just prefer to lean on audio
rather than visual or for anyone who
just wants a basic flip phone at $79.99
after a $50 mail-in rebate this is not
the absolute cheapest phone that you'll
ever find but it is well within range
for Verizon and for flip phones as well
so that's $80 excellent call quality a
bunch of other features on here and
overall reliability i'm jessica dual
court this is the Sam
some gusto - for Verizon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
