t-mobile has the 925 and risin has the
Nokia Lumia 928 I'm Jessica doll court
for cnet here's your first look now the
Nokia Lumia 928 is a Windows 8 Phone
like all of the rest it's got the live
tiles on the front and you can drag and
drop to rearrange what's interesting
about this phone and differentiates it
from the other ones is the design so
it's a little bit slimmer than the 920
thicker than the 925 it's got the sharp
flat sides 90 degree angles so it has a
more aggressive look than perhaps the
more bubbly 920 there is a slight curve
in the back so it's comfortable to hold
although it is a little bit slimmer than
the 920 it's still pretty heavy its
hefty I don't always mind that because
it tells me there's something
substantial in my hand but those looking
for a very lightweight phone will not
find it here there are no bright colors
with the 928 instead you get black or
white varieties like other Lumia phones
this one is completely sealed you've got
your micro sim card slot up at the top
there's no microSD card slot though but
internal storage is 32 gigabytes of
memory another Nokia claim to fame as
the camera or so they say they've got
Carl Zeiss technology the peer review
algorithms and what's interesting on
this 8.7 megapixel camera is the xenon
flash that accompanies the LED flash so
you've got still dual flash here but the
xenon is said to be much brighter I did
find that photo quality was really nice
and it's has shots that I took even the
low-light photos Nokia's proud of those
low-light pictures and they are very
good this Lumia 928 also has the typical
Nokia screen which is very nice this one
is an AMOLED unlike the 920 which uses
an LCD technology display 4.5 inches
it's got the clear black filter on top
which cuts down glare when you read it
outside really nice lush colors it's
very responsive in fact it is also a
super sensitive screen so you can use it
while wearing gloves like all other
nokia phones nokia suite of apps is on
here including maps driving directions
amuse
app and plenty of extra camera features
like all other high-end nokia lumia
devices this one comes with wireless
charging built right in so you will not
need to buy an extra back cover the
Nokia Lumia 928 goes on sale for a
hundred dollars with a new two-year
contract it is actually verizon's most
advanced Windows Phone so if you're
looking for a top-notch Windows Phone
this is it I'm just like a doll court
