both had battery life that didn't allow
me for my life I needed more juice to
get through the day
Apple's new answer to that problem a new
battery case made by Apple the smart
battery case is made just for the iPhone
6 and 6s it charges via lightning and if
you have an iPad 10 or 12 watt brick it
can charge both case and phone at once
it's made of the same soft material as
Apple's iPad and iPhone cases with a big
bulge in the back but an otherwise slim
design it has enough battery to keep an
iPhone 6s in the case running for 18
hours of LTE web browsing according to
Apple vs the 10 hours they estimate
otherwise I've used it over a weekend
including at a Jets game and it's enough
to last through a whole day with room to
spare the smart battery case isn't
anything new though there are plenty of
battery pack cases for iPhones or
separate batteries that you can buy -
it's about the same size as the Mophie
Juice Pack reserve which costs less but
uses microUSB to charge both cases end
up extending the headphone jack beyond
what most headphones can access however
requiring a pass-through adapter Apple's
doesn't come with one in the box
for $100 the smart battery case is on
the expensive side but many battery pack
cases like mo fees cost sixty to a
hundred dollars anyway it's smart timing
for frustrated iPhone power users like
myself but it really just shows how the
littlest iPhone should pack a bit larger
battery in the first place</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
