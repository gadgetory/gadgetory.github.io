report the show about the tech news that
everyone is talking about this week the
speed read version of all the WWDC news
who won III this year and embarrassing
facebook photo tagging in one easy step
but first it's the gadget of the week
the gadget of the week is the Nintendo
Wii U which maybe it's just me made me
think of sirens it's Nintendo's
next-generation console and even though
we don't know a lot about the actual
console the controller is where it's
really at its a 6.2 inch tablet like
Dealey it's got a touchscreen and
joystick and button controls a
front-facing camera a mic and then
motion control just like the original
wiimotes it can act like a secondary
display an actual controller a web
browser a mini version of the game
you're playing it looks basically pretty
freaking awesome except that minus any
other details or real time frame for
release other than 2012 generally
speaking it kind of smells like
vaporware up in here I mean we'll see
but stinky and now for the news alright
let's get it over with Apple held its
WWDC keynote this week which we covered
to death here at cnet if you missed any
single second of the two hour
announcement of new OS 10 features new
iOS 5 features and the iCloud push and
sync service please visit cnet news cnet
com or seen at TV for all the details in
a nutshell for me iOS 5 will be just
about exactly as awesome as Android when
it finally gets around to arriving this
fall OS 10 lion will look a lot more
like iOS but for just 30 bucks as an app
store download and Apple's iCloud will
be just about exactly as awesome as
Google Docs but slightly less awesome
than Spotify or lolla and way less
awesome than say flickr good good moving
on there was more than just Nintendo at
e3 in LA kind of this week Sony
announced the Vita which is not tasty
water but is a successor to the PSP it
was kind of pedestrian overall but great
if you like the PSP also Sony apologize
for its big data breach kind of they
really just apologized for your
inability to play its amazing game con
for that whole month but not for letting
your credit card data get into the wild
or for storing your passwords and clear
text on web sites around the world kind
of like other than that mrs. Lincoln how
was the play and Microsoft announced
some new cool looking Kinect games Bing
search using your voice and connect and
some kind of live TV thing involving
some partners they didn't name at a date
yet to be determined there's that
vaporware smell again basically Nintendo
1e3 again speaking of Nintendo it's time
for this week's hacker news blue plate
special those go-getter lowsec boys
apparently broke into Nintendo's servers
but didn't steal any data really a lil
SEC first PBS and now Nintendo yeah
you're really fighting the good fight
there what are you gonna do next pull a
kitten's tail catch a dolphin in a
fishing net push a nun down a stairwell
Club a baby seal really nice guys and
finally Facebook this week silently
rolled out facial recognition tagging to
all its users yes by default the feature
scans photos you upload and then
suggests tags based on who it thinks are
in the pictures like an easier way to
tag pictures except it's also a way
easier way to be identified in
potentially embarrassing photos and it's
not totally clear what happens with
public photos like what if you're in
Egypt or Libya or Syria maybe you go to
a protest you get photographed you get
identified and suddenly you get arrested
Plus not only did facebook optus all in
of course they didn't even announce they
were rolling the feature out or exactly
how it works at this point I can't tell
a facebook will never learn if Facebook
refuses to learn or a Facebook is trying
to learn us not to use Facebook anyway
as always there's a simple 39 step
process in your privacy settings to turn
it all off or control who sees your
photos anybody else interested in a
Friendster reunion tour and that's the
buzz report for this week everyone I'm
Mollywood and thank you for watching
this isn't the first time that have come
to the stage in an e3 press conference
with an elephant in the room and of
course I'm referring to the playstation
network outage my friends who are
reporters tell me that there's
absolutely nothing in the world that
makes their editors day like controversy
and bad news so to all our esteemed
members of the press I say you're
welcome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
