report and now for the gadget of the
week the gadget of the week is the Sony
Reader come October you'll be able to
load up to 80 books on your $350 Sony
Reader carry them around and read them
in digital rendering that looks like
real ink I mean some might argue that
you could just buy the books and use
your free hands to read the book in
which the real ink actually is real ink
but seriously where's the geekiness in
that we are forward-thinking
technologists here people we embrace
innovation here who can I give my money
to and now for the news Microsoft this
week issued a rare out of cycle security
patch to fix a major loophole in
Internet Explorer Microsoft pushed out
the patch two weeks early after several
porno sites were found to be infecting
visitors with keylogging software adware
and trojans that could take over their
pcs now Microsoft almost never puts out
patches ahead of their standard monthly
release schedule so that tells you how
serious this problem really is meanwhile
an anonymous source inside Microsoft
tells me that CEO Steve Ballmer specie
was recently infected with all kinds of
keylogging software adware and trojans
related you'd be the judge French and
Canadian researchers have made a
scientific breakthrough using advanced
infrared technology that will change the
viewpoints of millions of people the
scientists carried out the most in-depth
study ever conducted on the
centuries-old Mona Lisa painting their
discovery Mona Lisa had recently given
birth to a baby when the painting was
made reached for comment cancer
researchers said a little help over here
could we maybe use that infrared thingy
a couple of your researching guys got a
little epidemic here
anything anybody call me
Facebook today opened up its social
networking site to the masses previously
only college or high school students or
businesses could join Facebook but now
anyone with a valid email address can
join and that's got some people very
worried about their privacy and the
community that they've come to love to
discuss this hot-button issue with me I
went out and got the youngest person I
could find to explain her concerns
please welcome to the buzz report
everyone Veronica Belmont so Veronica I
hear that Facebook is now open to the
public can you give us some ideas about
what the major concerns are well you see
used to only be able to get in if you
had a dot edu address so that means that
you could be there and your friends
could see you but basically your profile
was protected but now anyone can get in
and pornographers and and perverts and
and spammers and and the kids just
aren't ready for that I mean it's like
the real world and and they're they're
just not ready well couldn't they just
hide their profiles what well I I guess
I mean you just don't get it you're too
old thanks for coming on the show
