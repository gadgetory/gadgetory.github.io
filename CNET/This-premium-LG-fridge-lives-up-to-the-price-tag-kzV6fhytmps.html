standing here beside the LGL mxs 307
eight success now this is basically the
same fridge we reviewed two months ago
the LG LM excess 307 seven success now
it's different with this model is that
there's no door in door function so you
can't open up the front panel here and
access those indoor shelves I'm actually
ok with that I think that's sort of a
superfluous feature if you like it fine
but for me doesn't add a whole lot to
the equation and taking it away you're
left with a lower price point of $3,700
compared to four thousand for that door
indoor model now all in all I like this
fridge quite a lot you open it up it's
got a lot of storage capacity it's got
17.1 cubic feet on the inside but you
also get 3.8 cubic feet in this custom
children here so they open this up and
you've got customizable settings with
things like wine and cheese and meat
whatever you want your little dividers
there you can separate things as you
need it's a handy feature you'll also
find storage minded features inside the
body of the fridge there's this folding
shelf here that makes room for tall
items there's a glide and access shelf
here at the bottom that makes it really
easy to get things that are kind of
touch away in the back there also these
easy reach bins here at the bottom where
you can store ingredients for quick
access I like that but the lids are a
little loose and they come out without
any connection to the fridge they're at
this kind of low kid tempting height so
I've got children I'd be worried that
they'd play with that and drop it on the
floor and shatter it another storage
minded feature is this slim space plus
ice system which translates from brand
speak to smaller icemaker that saves you
some room for more ingredients in the
door there but it also means you get
less ice out of the thing
performance-wise this fridge did well
holding steady temperatures that we're
all pretty close together and pretty
close to that target temperature the one
exception was the right door the shelves
in there were a little warmer than we'd
like you can see that orange on the heat
map there that's just above 40 just
above where you'd want it but that also
includes the butter bin which is
supposed to be above 40 so it's not the
worst result in the world all in all
this is a good-looking fridge with solid
features and steady performance so if
you're looking for a splurge that makes
sense I think this model fits the bill
for more check out my full review at
cnet.com for seen at appliances I'm
right
