the AEG booth which is the German brand
for Electrolux here at Aoife 2014 we're
here to take a look at the AEG let's
taste app which controls this new steam
oven right here next to me via what this
app is that yes it's a connected device
that controls an appliance we have a
whole hub here it's designed for iOS and
Android with all kinds of different
features some of which actually look
pretty useful which is sort of rare for
some of these appliance devices so the
app has a lot of features going on
there's one that lets you see what other
tastes go with a certain kind of food
you can of course control the
temperature and the cook time for the
oven remotely it actually has a social
feed built-in you know as much as you
may want to take advantage of that it
also has diagnostic features as well as
just the ability to kind of monitor your
oven to see what's going on so the let's
taste app is available to download now
in the US right now it only controls
something remotely though and the oven
itself is not going to come out into the
u.s. at least for a little while you
don't exactly know when that's gonna
happen one very cool feature in here is
a camera it's not even going to come out
to the German market for a little while
yet it's still a concept but it has a
pretty intuitive use and that you can
see what's going on inside your oven
remotely help you see if you're burning
that souffle or just generally keep an
eye on things
overall this is one of the cooler
appliance oriented apps we've seen it
has some pretty nice utility we're
excited to see if it comes out in the US
particularly with the camera so I'm rich
Brown here at the AEG booth and this is
the let's taste app
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
