show you how to upgrade to Windows 10
and still make it fresh like you install
it from scratch now generally a freshly
installed window performer is best but
first if they have already upgraded
don't worry you can still make window 10
completely new on your machine here's
how click on start to settings and then
click on update and security here choose
recovery and then under reset this PC
click on get started you can have two
options first is to keep your files
the system will erase all of your
application and settings but your data
will remain intact second remove
everything show this option if you want
to have a truly fresh Windows 10
afterwards make sure you backup your
data first though after making your
choice click on reset and voila the
computer will restart and the reset
process will begin depending on the
speed computer it takes between 10 and
30 minutes to finish and then you have
yourself a computer with window 10
completely new on it ok now move on to a
computer that still runs Windows 7 or 8
in this case you want to avoid upgrading
via Windows Update instead
you download the tool that enables you
to upgrade windows from a flash drive
now the process of turning a flash drive
into a Windows 10 installer is quite
straightforward
you run the tool choose to create a
media for another PC choose a language
the Edition and the architecture of
window 10 and pick flash drive as the
media to use why a flash drive and not a
DVD you may ask well because a flash
drive works everywhere including on
computer without an optical drive that's
my choice note that the flash drive
needs to be at least 3 gigabyte if you
wanted to hold 64-bit or 32-bit Windows
10 if you wanted to hold both it needs
to be at least sig giga after that the
tune will download Windows 10 and turn
the drive into the installer now insert
this flash drive into a computer that
still runs Windows 7 or 8 open it and
run the setup file the same process will
start there are a few step but the main
way
this ready to install dialog here click
on choose what to keep and then choose
to keep nothing or choose your personal
files
and that's it you go on with the rest of
the upgrade process and one is done you
will have a Windows 10 fresh on the
machine without the apps or the settings
of the old windows for more detail
instruction or all of the check out my
post sn.com by the way you can also boot
from this flash drive and install
Windows 10 that way but in that case it
will have to buy a new Windows 10
license so do that only or a new custom
build machine once again I'm don't know
and this has been a quick how-to on how
you can truly start a new without
carrying along any baggage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
