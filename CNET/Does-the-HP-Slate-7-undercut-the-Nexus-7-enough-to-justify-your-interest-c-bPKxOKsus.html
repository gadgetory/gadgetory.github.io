attempt to enter the small Android
tablet market the slate 7 has very Nexus
7 like physical dimensions however it
features is kind of soft rubbery back
and feels a bit denser than the nexus 7
there's a microUSB port dual speakers a
headphone jack a microSD port and low
quality front and back cameras software
wise you're getting a fairly pure
Android 4.1 point one experience however
I definitely miss a few of the interface
tweaks add it to Android 4.2 point2
there's also HP eprint which allows you
to print from the tablet to either a
locally connected printer or one from
the same network Beats Audio enhances
the base and diminishes the temenus of
music however this is really only
noticeable on bass heavy music and when
you're using earbuds or headphones the
screen resolution is a low 1024 x 600 so
most text looks jaggi however the HFS
panel provides wide viewing angles
navigation feels fast and the screen
usually responds quickly however large
apps definitely take their time to load
games performance was surprisingly good
in both 2d and 3d games but the lack of
a gyroscope hurts playability in some
games there's also no built-in GPS
hardware a bummer for those that like to
use such things on their tablets at 170
bucks the slate 7 doesn't cost much but
given what the two-hundred-dollar Nexus
7 offers in comparison you'd expect a
bit more for your money the slate 7 has
no GPS spat cameras slow app loads only
8 gigabytes of storage no gyroscopes a
slightly but significantly older version
of Android and a low resolution screen
so yes a lower price would have gone a
long way towards making the slate 7 more
desirable sure micro SD is a useful
option if you're planning to stock your
tablet lots of
apps or media also the beats audio
feature is good if you listen to lots of
bass heavy music through your earbuds or
headphones however neither is enough to
make you forget that the nexus 7 with
more storage faster uploads GPS and the
latest version of Android is only 30
bucks away more information check out my
full review i'm eric franklin and this
has been a first look at the HP Slate 7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
