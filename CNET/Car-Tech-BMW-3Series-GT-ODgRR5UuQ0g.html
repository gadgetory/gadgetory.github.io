Whitby Netcom on the floor of the 2013
Geneva Motor Show and we're taking a
look at the new BMW 3 Series Gran
Turismo now the 3 Series Gran Turismo is
another one of BMW sort of mashups it's
not quite a wagon not quite a crossover
sort of like the 5 Series GT that we've
seen before and sort of like the x6 that
kind of does this thing where they take
a perfectly good wagon mash the roof
down and give it more of a sort of a
coupe like profile now with the 3 Series
they actually haven't really compromised
that much space the vehicle is actually
a little bit longer from nose to tail
it's got a slightly longer wheelbase and
that means that versus the five theories
touring the standard wagon you get about
one more cubic foot of storage space
behind the feet that's not a ton but for
people who really just don't want to
ride around in a wagon I mean here's
another alternative and let's face it
BMW is pretty much done giving us
conventional wagons in the United States
under the hood of the 3 Series GT you'll
see pretty much these same engines as
the 3 Series Sedan
that means in 328i you've got a 2.0
liter turbocharged engine that puts out
240 horsepower and in the 335i you've
got an inline fix that puts out 306
horsepower that's all gonna go to the
rear wheels unless you get the optional
extra package and in fact you're going
to get the same I Drive Kevin technology
package that's going to have those
Google Maps with 3d terrain and 3d
buildings the connected web search
pretty much all the things that we've
sort of come to love or hate about BMWs
in - cabin technology package barring a
page out of Ford's book the 3 Series GT
also uses a hands-free liftgate just
kick your foot underneath the bumper and
up the trunk lid goes now we're
expecting this vehicle to go on sale
sometime in mid June of this year we
don't really have pricing yet but we
expect it to be just a little bit more
expensive
