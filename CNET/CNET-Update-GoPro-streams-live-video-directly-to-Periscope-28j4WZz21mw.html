your twitter feeds I'm Bridget Carey
this is your cnet update GoPro action
cameras can now send a live stream of
video to periscope which is owned by
Twitter that means in your Twitter feed
you may come across live video from
someone recording on their GoPro but
there are some restrictions anyone can
see it but to broadcast you do need to
have an iPhone and one of the newer
GoPros the hero4 black or silver camera
the periscope app lets you switch
between showing the iphone view or the
GoPro view and the footage is still
saved locally on the camera even while
broadcasting in real time a few X Games
athletes will be streaming live this
week from Aspen and buttermilk mountain
and you can catch it on GoPros Twitter
account but this also means you can
expect people to be streaming in real
time from their drones so do we call
these drone casts and speaking of
casting those of you with the new Apple
TV should now have a software update to
get the Apple podcast app so you'll be
able to stream your favorite video
podcasts from your living room likessee
net update of course it never made much
sense why you couldn't get podcasts
before when the older Apple TV models
already had it but it's there now and if
you are a Mac or iPhone user beware for
print going around that can crash your
browser if you go to the website crash
safaricom guess what it's going to crash
your Safari browser but the link isn't
always obvious right away if it's hidden
in a short URL so people are trying to
fool others to click on it the website
overloads the Safari browser and after a
few seconds it forces your phone to
reboot some may notice their phone will
get hot as it tries to process the page
there are reports it can also screw up
chrome on Android but a reboot should
fix things remember kids always practice
safe browsing but here's a new twist on
safe driving uber is starting to monitor
its drivers in the US to see if they are
speeding by looking at the phone's
accelerometer and other motion sensors
the idea is that if a passenger
complains but the driver accelerates too
fast and brakes too hard uber could
into a driver's phone sensors to see if
it's true in the long run it can also
gather data on the average speed of a
driver down a certain path and which
drivers are going faster than they
should the phone knows all that's it for
this tech news update being catch up on
