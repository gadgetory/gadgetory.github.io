cnet.com and i'm here with Pete Phillips
room-to-room speaker dock for the iPhone
5 and iPod Touch as well as the iPod
Nano this is a lightning equipped
speaker dock it also goes by the model
number ds3 205 this is the middle
lightning speaker dock in Phillips line
there's also a smaller speaker dock with
a clock as well as a portable unit that
looks more like a tabletop radio really
this model the highlight of this model
is that it sounds good for its size it's
an attractive unit this does sound
better than the entry-level speaker dock
from fellowes it has more bass it also
just plays louder and offers more
clarity there are only a few buttons on
the unit itself there's the power button
at the top as well as the vibe control
buttons just below the dock the
Lightning dock itself swivels a little
bit and a little bit of play in it what
is a little bit problematic is the
auxilary input there is an auxilary
input on the back so you could hook this
up and make this your computer speaker
the only problem is that when you dock a
device in the dock you don't get any
sound out of the speaker from that
axillary input I should also mention
that Phillips also has a 30 pin version
of the speaker dock and that has a USB
port on the back that allows you to sync
with your computer so it's a
pass-through USB port doesn't allow you
to charge a device but allows you to
sync this model doesn't have that
feature doesn't have any sort of USB
port and that older model actually costs
a lot less than this model this one cost
around $130 at launch so it's a little
bit expensive for what it is the final
feature worth pointing out on this unit
is there is a battery bay gives you
about eight hours of power from those
four double A batteries that's pretty
good so all in all I did like the
speaker lock although I do have a few
reservations particularly about that
lack of sound through the auxiliary
input when you have a device docked in
the speaker but it does deliver good
sound for size than it is in a tractive
looking unit I'm David Carnot and that's
the Philips room - room at docking
speaker the ds3 205 thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
