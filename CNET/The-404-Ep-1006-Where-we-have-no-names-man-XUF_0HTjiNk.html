tuned into the 44 show on Sina TV I'm
Jeff Bakalar I'm talk panel bring Lana
I'm Justin you and this is the show
where we have no names man no name we're
nameless we are essentially nameless
that's right because the big news of the
day or yesterday rather Apple goes ahead
and comes out with a new iPad and guess
what kids they're calling it the new
iPad I hear you hear that that's every
member of the AARP losing their minds
and confusion because I'm sorry I a good
farting noise I'm sorry correct me if
I'm wrong correct me if I'm wrong he's
simpleton you freaking kindergarten like
can you get over this because whatever
it's an incremental update it's not that
big of a deal in my opinion incremental
update I think a lot of people were
pissed off at the to my friends were it
not about the two can we get over the
name i mean the name is knowledgeable
know the name is the biggest deal about
this okay how do you do this how does
the most innovative and smartest company
arguably on earth just like self title
the ipad i mean i get it i think it's
because people would be confused about
the hardware versus the generation of
the ipad like this is technically the
third ipad but it has 4g sokol they
can't call it the 3g crazy people think
the G stands for a hole at the HD like
everyone thought it was going to be me
out every single person on the freaking
internet was wrong about this I
including Xena that's where I got my
information but it wasn't just seeing it
was everyone everyone said oh really
want to call it the HD though that by
dated in like 2004 i calling at the HD
DVD ipad space yeah dude you look at man
what's something like yeah totally right
and i was making fun of my coasters use
the HD suffix it's ridiculous it's
complete nonsense yeah but it's it's
still better than calling it the new
ipad that's the dumbest thing I've ever
what are they gonna call next year's I
don't care call it ever unique ID is
happening dude you left I don't care
what it is you need to just be able to
distinguish the dance they made like a
sandwich its iPad iPad to an ipad right
I don't understand I reckon next year
they're actually going to go well I
don't know what they're going to do next
year but but look at the macbook for
example they haven't changed that name
the macbook pro they don't have
different names it's just okay that's
this year's good point right so maybe
they're going for some more thing with
the ipad good point that makes sense and
then it eliminates a lot of confusion
that came out of the iphone 3g 3gs 4g
for like what is the S stand for in 40
speed obviously and it does it make
sense that they shouldn't call it
something look I'm just saying it's very
confusing yeah I mean I literally had
like a dozen people i am in the ashram
being like so what is it called okay but
just to play devil's advocate we've
complained on the show before earlier
this week actually about the
nomenclature of things like televisions
that have a million different suffixes
right and so you're saying that you want
somewhere in the middle where they don't
have a lot at the end but aren't just
the ipad you want somewhere no problem
just doing numbers I just have no
problem with right okay or call the ipad
2012 or whatever you know what i mean
like or the IP do like what Maddon
doesn't call it iPad 12 right and I've
had 13 it's fine it's just think about
like this is you know I know the
macbooks every Apple product basically
refreshes every year I get that yeah and
I understand that uh you know maybe with
something like the macbook that's how it
comes out though like when you like my
macbook pro is the macbook pro october
08 really mean uh you buy accessories
for these things it's going to get
confusing because it's like oh well i
have an ipad a new ipad it's the third
one but it's the little bigger than the
two where did you get it when right now
but it's not the first one sir you know
i mean it's a little silly yeah and i
kind of wish they got their crap
together in that department okay well
names aside ty what did you think about
the announcements yesterday were you
impressed or were you looking for
something else that didn't announce well
I got it wrong actually I predicted that
would be Seri
which they didn't have right what did I
also predict that there wasn't going to
be 4g which there was why did you
predict that why don't you think that
was I think the 4g it's it's different
in every country mmm obviously they want
to release a global device and they've
just found obviously I'm an Australian
we just found out that they're not going
to have a 4g device for Australia ah so
because you know I think the one that's
released he is operating on eight
hundred and twelve hundred megahertz
okay the one in Australia would need to
operate on two thousand megahertz to
actually be 4g in Australia so yeah I
thought that they wouldn't go ahead
usually they they get on they either
create their own interfaces or their own
sort of technologies like was it
Thunderbolt or whatever that right or
firewire they don't usually tack on to
nascent technologies there are someone
else's sure so I thought that they'd
wait a bit longer before they released a
4g device gotcha my opinion 4G is not
the biggest uh update to this thing what
do you mean I display I can get 4G on my
iPad 2 by using my Nexus as a hotspot so
that's moot as far as I'm concerned okay
any sort of wireless connectivity it's
like all right great you're spent if you
have a 4g cell phone you pay for that
anyway you might as well pay for that
hotspot feature and not worry about it
uh it's the screen for sure the screen
is the biggest deal that's ninety
percent of what the ipad is you're
looking at the thing constantly the
screens the biggest deal right and it's
a really big update I mean this is a
huge deal twice the resolution you have
almost official resolution it's
something crazy like 2048 or something
like that yeah it's really high so I
think that's pretty cool um then of
course you know I definitely have a
problem with when they came out and said
all right this thing's got more memory
and more resolution than an Xbox and a
ps3 in fact throw those consoles out the
window because you don't need that crap
anymore right you don't need to play
gears of war you don't need to play
metal gear solid you don't need to play
killzone or any of that crap play the
iPad the new iPad when does this thing
come out it comes out next week doesn't
it yeah we can actually pre-order it now
so it's actually a good time to pick up
all of these discarded consoles
yeah because everyone running all the
street yeah that is be at the landfill
yeah exactly everyone's gonna put you
know in their rubbish bin gonna throw it
out the window because no one cares
about consoles anymore because Apple
said that if you wanna console you're an
idiot right now then said I did I did
like how they were comparing the specs
of the ipad to the ex-boxer and we'd
write about this yesterday right when
the xbox is going on seven years old
right I mean is that not like make like
the Vita making fun of like the game boy
color you know being like you come on
CULTAN three colors you have you know
I'm a quad core with eight billion
colors Reza you know that that sort of
came off cheap and I wrote something
about yesterday how you know it's it's
it's a little bit to sort of jab at the
big home consoles when you're just a
tablet that put that plays angry birds I
mean they should really be comparing it
the specs to the two itself right
because there's been such big changes
since the first generation like I think
there was some rumors today that
although they didn't announce it uh the
new iPad has a gig of memory sure four
times the amount of memory that came out
with the first version and then
something that wasn't a big deal great
point but i think you know if you're
gonna compare to something talk about
how much better it is in the first one
but then that might make people feel
like garbage for still using the first
one yeah i mean uh but that's what they
should do instead of going after I mean
and they used to do this sort of you
know this like weird logic this sort of
like spin they put on their little
keynote not you know things when they
used to say like oh the App Store has 55
thousand times the games that the that
the 3ds and the power the d/s in the PSP
have yeah it's like well yeah they were
all made in a week and cost 99 cents
yeah and the vast majority of them are
trash but if you look at what's happened
with the Vedas store and you know
supposedly they're getting these smaller
games in right but they're charging too
much money for them I agree with that
what is it a plants vs zombies is still
10 to 20 bucks too much money for that
stuff and that's been up for what four
years now for a while a long time and
I'm not saying that Sony and Microsoft
have the answers and are correct in this
but would you agree in saying that it
was a little bit of a stretch for up
forget this phil schiller is that his
name comes out he's like he just run out
there he's like this this stuff's more
powerful than your stew
xbox but I mean you know before that all
I had to compare to was this this is
more powerful than the stuff that sent
people to the moon right and i still use
that lantronix says we used headsets on
the mood for 40 years ago 43 years ago
you a-holes okay you this freakin iPad
better be quicker than an Xbox in a
playstation 3 kidding me if it wasn't
I'd slap you know all these guys in the
face is ridiculous so you preorder one I
mean they're already rabbi bought for it
yep I bought all I bought no I'm not
gonna buy this yeah i'm just not it does
there's not in and look as much as it
sounds like i'm hating on it which i
definitely am and i'm just looking like
i reach a tipping point where it's like
okay you know I've I've the boiling
point is here because there's just so
much hype I have nothing to do but to
just rebel against it you know it's you
can't be that powerful and not face some
sort of scrutiny right arm up dude when
when the ipad 2 announcement here i was
like oh man i'm getting this thing
there's not that drive for the for this
new ipad i'm just not gonna lie i'm
gonna say what's on everyone's mind is
that the design did not impress me and
the improvements in the hardware just
weren't there it looks exactly the same
which I know is a really pedestrian way
of looking at it and we should be you
know like investigating more into the
inside sure the software is what's
really important and that's gonna get a
big upgrade sure it's just my
perspective I just want something new in
my hands you know that's a big deal yes
aim said they're treading water this
year you know the iphone 4s didn't
really deliver on any of its promises
the ipad new ipad whatever we're calling
it now has a bigger screen and that's
pretty much it so it either they're
going to come up with an iphone 5 in
what a couple of months they work unless
i guess like September or something so
you know they really i think a lot of
companies not just Apple but a lot of
company so they took this year and last
year off you know they didn't really
innovate as right sure you know whether
that's a global economy thing or you
know maybe they've got something saved
up maybe they didn't put Siri into
iPhone or the new iPad because it's
going to be in the next one it's going
to be even more amazing I just think
Siri is uh I mean I think series
overrated as it is you know maybe
tossing it in there
just uh no I think the dictation thing
is good because typing on iPads pretty
miserable right right and then I think I
iOS 5.1 got a japanese-language addition
to Siri which is a very minor detail
right but and I love how like that's
what they started off yeah exactly
brought you to sunny San Francisco yeah
to tell you that the thing on the
Japanese now right and we're speaking
English writer who would benefit from
the Japanese language edition could
understand what you saying no freaking
clue yet definitely weird are the iphoto
stuff is cool yeah I can't you can't
deny that it's cheap it works with every
ipad if i'm not mistaken um so yeah I
mean I think that's kind of awesome yeah
but yeah chat rooms just like pumping in
a xbox 360 specs now right and make the
comparison it's like it's like if Sony
and Microsoft came out and they were
like oh we just heard that the ipad 3 is
more powerful it's like them coming on
being like our controllers have 15 times
the button capability as I've you know
they mean it's like the same stupid re
i'm looking at this the original xbox
360 had dual cores 3.2 gigahertz 512
megabytes of ram i would think that the
jump seven years later which to the ipad
3 would be a lot bigger this thing
should have 40 gig yeah yeah exactly
kidding me it's just it's just the
freaking cheap hitman yeah you know it's
looking I don't like that speak now I'm
not saying Steve Jobs would have done it
any differently but you don't know you
don't know and I'm not going it's hard
not to think like somebody asked me
someone asked me this morning would it
be called the new iPad if Steve Jobs
still around I don't know no idea anyone
know that we don't know did he like have
the final stamp was like this is the
ipad 2 well it's tough cuz you don't
know where his influence ended and where
it's sort of true and i don't think it's
ended at all right you know but I had
that think tank I don't know we were
talking about maybe has like a huge
vault just full of ideas it's it it's
gonna be like to pack you know he's
gonna still be releasing 10 years time
that's ridiculous yeah yeah for sure new
turtle necks coming out thank you
you know please away for the suit we're
not making love steve jobs where we r
miss steve jobs as for sure um we got to
take a break when we come back more with
ty pendlebury and the ipad and calls and
all this good stuff stick around the 404
isn't going anywhere so I guess neither
should you we'll be back this is the 404
mr effers the show where we all sing
songs hey 404 crew this is rich in
lovely warm Cleveland and it's taken
some time to enjoy one of Cleveland's
many great non-flammable rivers here and
it's it's a beautiful sight after a long
day of work and you know just got me
thinking and really re-evaluate a lot of
ways how amazing this will look on the
iPads new Retina display just below this
nature crap under the water
hey this is greg from new orleans and
you're listening to the floor for will
proudly waving or panty Apple freak flag
yeah wherever you are crying in an apple
ditch somewhere I I'm not gonna lie
wonder what he thinks about all this no
you do you or do you not care i just
want to know how he would spin it
positively yeah yeah you know what i
mean i was up definitely he's definitely
thinking that what we just watched a
video a video voicemail from rich from
cleveland he's the guy that won our iPad
competition yeah I'm kind of was hoping
he was just gonna take it and just throw
it into the river yeah just like get rid
of it right yeah there no I don't need
this piece of crap anymore like a year
old now it just gives it like a lofty
love in two years lake there but it does
make a good point he's like the retina
display almost makes it look better than
real life yeah who needs nature when you
can just look at a screen right so yeah
I mean let's I want to talk more about
this like yeah yeah so like it's not
very clear to me at one point our people
just gonna be using the iPad to look at
things through the camera right like
that's not gonna be like boy that's not
gonna happen I'm pretty sure your eye is
better than that Raleigh wouldn't that
would a good point during yesterday's
live cast and that people are stick
because the cameras in this is quite
good now they're going to start taking
pictures no only the stupid ipad may
already be needs they do yeah and they
are teenagers are always pretty funny
when people are just holding up and I'm
gonna say that oh my god it's I feel
like only athletes do it at all-star
games that's things like the only
application for using an iPad as a
camera have you seen how ridiculous
somebody looks holding a book up and
taking it's like ready smile you need
basically the big we're looking at a
photo that a very attractive woman is
taking right I bed takes up an eighth of
the freaking screen ridiculous it's like
ready cheese say cheese
easy news like I don't sound weird yeah
I don't understand it you need sort of
like the flash and you need the big cape
yeah there you go they did 1885 like
that that's ridiculous uh taking photos
and videos with your fring and iPad I
don't know people will continue to not
do that I think I don't care how good
the cameras like an SLR right I look at
that and how much heavier that is in an
iPad that's what people take photos with
I get it you may be you know you're in
the situation where you need to do it
but if I have a mobile smartphone or an
iPhone or whatever it is and I have an
iPad why I want you know I'm just
obviously taking you with my phone it's
not even I'm gonna freakin if I'm
holding my iPad and my phones in my bag
I'm going into my bag and taking cuz
it's less cumbersome yeah maybe the
larger display though allows you to see
more of what a game viewfinder taking
one photo on my iPad 2 it is by accident
right cuz I was like what's this button
do yeah and that's it oops I'm sorry I
just I don't get it I don't get it here
it's a practical that's not practical
now there's a lot of heat on today's
show I'm just saying it's a great device
I'm actually going to buy the second one
instead probably instead of a laptop oh
you're gonna buy the ipad 2 yeah cuz I
don't you know I've got a work laptop
sure I don't really need one to take two
events or you know if I'm going
somewhere business all i need is
basically something i can browse on the
couch with and i think and ipads perfect
for that it is second ipad still just as
good i think they lowered it a hundred
bucks yesterday immediately following
the keynote so that's even better i
don't i wouldn't pay an extra hundred
for that's the big news man that yeah
that to me that's the big news if you
don't have an ipad man it's it's to me
it's tough convincing someone to spend
that extra hundred bucks when that ipad
2 is uh you know is a hundred bucks even
do you remember us having this
conversation about me buying the ipad
one when the two camera is the exact
same brain right I hate apple I'm
starting to really just like this come
people don't there's there's you know
the pots brewing a little bit yeah I
think so you know I mean it's just how
long can and we talk we act like they're
on their way down to react well they're
there you know against all the odds are
at the highest don't level they never
being ever bigger than any company
niggas cool reason
yeah yeah who would have thought they'd
be down in the gutter now yeah so
refurbished ipad 2 in on the apple store
right now Wi-Fi 16 gigs 350 bucks that's
not bad you should just get that just
get it by right now my click internet
pad there you go your internet pet has
been ordered it'll arrive in two to four
days it's pretty awesome I was thinking
the other day do we still need those
little red flags we did they come on you
know when the postman puts something in
your letterbox you need a little red
flag to come up yeah I'm waiting for
stuff this week and I wanted the little
red flag to show me that I had we're in
your actual mailbox yeah you know they
have a high or whatever I still get real
mouth not packages I waiting for I think
there's a cultural disparity here I
think in Australia that everyone has red
flag we do but our red flags mean are
telling the mailman that we have
outgoing mail in the box no that's not
really it sure it is I take it easy yes
it goes for both the mailman puts it up
when there's mail inside oh you put it
up when the mailman comes to notify him
of outgoing Richard pictures from Utah
I'm talking about there's mail America
ya know you pull the flag up to when you
have a male male in there that you need
to go out thank you what the hell is a
Boeing way of opening them my mailbox
every day because I expect mail every
day right why why would the guy be like
just let you know there's mail in here
no that's not it doesn't work like that
you right now that would be practical no
what are you talking about the way
dragon our new cembran to tell the
mailman hey I'm really good for you Jim
my current mail for the day in here
right stick your old hand in there pull
out what I'm trying to get out to the
world trolling you right now extra
mailbox in Australia just for packages
because then you will need to notify if
there's something in don't know how it
works you know cuz there are no remote
much say this again there's some quite
remote parts of Australia so obviously
you can't drive down for hours and go to
the post office I don't know what they
do a pitcher they have flags or
something better oh okay I'm the most of
my life
I don't but there's these flags I
understand that and and and when you
live in an urban area you're not you
don't have a mailbox like you do in
suburbia right where it's just like a
little mailbox on the sidewalk you flip
little Fleck here it's like others
mailbox in every corner you're gonna
dump it in there right or you gonna walk
to the post office yeah this that's the
your and you're kidding right you're
right you're messing with me what about
the flag yeah I don't even have a flag
of course no one has a fun I just have
like a 15 knowing you live apart when
you get before drilling every single day
right so you flip the flag when you want
an outgoing okay this guy's just pulling
much in my chain um the chatroom asks
what is male yeah back in the day I just
have to lick the top of an envelope yeah
that's just poof okay mail sucks man
surely mail does stink let's go talk
about a few other things not the iPad um
this is cool the very popular simulation
city game right that's what i call it
simulation city it's coming back
SimCity's coming back after like what a
10-year hiatus when did full commit 2005
something like that I don't even think
it was giant evil it was that late I
think well we're looking at the post on
crave here it says nearly 10 years after
the last major SimCity release which I
would imagine was SimCity 4 right the
fifth version of the iconic SimCity game
is due out 2013 and features a large
range of graphic and gameplay
improvements over previous generations
one major new feature is multiplayer
support for up to 16 players that
doesn't sound like a lot of fun
multiplayer in SimCity know that
horrible that's like a committee game
yeah that just sounds like it's like sim
council board it's like no you know it's
on everything in triplicate I just don't
bunch of stuff yeah the garden vote
anyway these concept art they were
looking at on the on the page here looks
brilliant um I I mean you know SimCity's
come a long way we first got a taste of
it I I can't remember when it was must
have been the late what late eighties
was the first SimCity game and remember
but I used to be a Sim City attic yes
definitely the first
multiplayer game that really people just
lost their life not multiplayer just
like leaning all in the app just just
really really addicted to the gameplay
and managing your city and making sure
you you know it was logical for where
the power lines were and residential and
commercial and industrial and all these
different sort of segments of your city
and then once they went to like a 3d
sort of thing in SimCity 4 I was like
well for get it right it's over but I'm
pretty psyched man I I feel like SimCity
is due for a refresh arm and Maxis in EA
you know are bringing it to us in 2013
I'm really looking forward to that
tapped out game the simpsons which is
essentially building springfield right
we have that is it any good it's good um
it's not as complicated as SimCity which
obviously should not be it's on your
iPad but it's good and if you're a Sim
City fan and or obviously a Simpsons fan
for sure it's a lot of fun yeah it's
pretty cool Oh check it out well then
check it out um so yeah simcity 2013
look for it well we'll post the story we
have on crave in the show notes today
other news uh is that Netflix might be
coming out of your cable box and this is
a interesting sort of story I don't
really understand how that could
possibly work but according to Reuters
Netflix honcho hit Reed Hastings has
been meeting with us cable bigwigs in
hopes of injecting the company's
streaming video service directly into
your TV's cable box now I'm just trying
to like look from the outside in on this
one isn't that doesn't it defeat the
purpose of what Netflix is as a separate
entity al colleague David Katz my
actually came up with a good point in
that it would be a gimped version so
essentially what a baby like a special
net cast on you know what netflix on
comcast something so be branded like
that right and it would not have
duplicate content right so all the stuff
that they've got on video demand they
wouldn't have so it's a branding
exercise for netflix and obviously the
whichever company they go for get some
sort of kickback financially sure so to
be for the people who don't want to buy
a separate set top box basically they've
got like a CRT or something still
they've just got one cable box and then
they get extra movies so it's
win for them and it actually sounds like
a good deal but of course the smart
people would go out and buy a
fifty-dollar roku box which you can
connect right tht my body feels I think
it still has a composite port so if you
want to live you know in 1932 you can do
that as well this is oh but yeah I mean
that's I think it's actually a good
thing it's a good branding exercise for
them and then it actually might be like
a gateway device and people actually go
on by well the simple set-top box good
point will be curated movies and TV
shows absolutely dream right I you will
be able to choose like you would on a
normal netflix i think you would be able
do you still have like a user interface
you be able to pick but you will have
the cut the library that you do on a
normal for netflix I us something I'm
still definitely just bitter about with
Netflix is like the constantly changing
library there's no it's not an archive
anymore it's sort of like well these 50
movies are here for four weeks and you
better watch now because you're not
gonna be back I don't like that I kind
of and I know it's you know a
first-world problem of course but I
really wish the every movie that ever
hit Netflix was there and is there
forever you mean because you're like all
right well I know I'm always gonna watch
back to the future two over and over
again but I don't want to have it with
like limited availability on this thing
i'm paying books a month for my grad
about netflix is that it assumes what I
think I'll like or dislike about a movie
right like the ratings that show up
share stars I thought I always thought
those were user ratings but I think
that's just netflix this best guess
about what i think will the movie will
be like yeah I appreciate that I mean a
little invasive to me like how and
they're always very specific like you
like dark comedies sit in my future with
Jude Law yeah well that's very specific
yeah maybe I do you know I don't like
that I think if they actually charged a
little bit more so you could have a
library like other streaming services so
dancer three or four dollars and then
you could have back to the future for us
all those sort of things i think you
know i do think and I've said this
before the netflix is actually to cheap
and that's not a very popular opinion
but no I think you know if they did my
pitchfork rate actually charging more
money then I would have more leeway with
the studio's I could pay the studio's
more money they'll be able to keep hold
on to these catalog I agree
you I hundred percent agree with you
seriously I'm not I'm not messing around
you're right it almost is too cheap and
they can't afford these sort of premium
luxuries that would definitely I think
you know if I gotta pay 12 bucks is at
eight bucks somebody up there more good
same with and I mean that's another
thing for Spotify as well as that they
have a similar problem in that they are
they're actually streaming full quality
mp3's to your phone which you can
actually archive now which I think why
would you buy anything anymore right
when you can just stream it and hold on
your phone you you pay eight bucks or
whatever it is to to Spotify and I think
that's gotta change that will change all
right well really insightful stuff from
tied today that appreciate this is
streaming media is my my bugbears I've
your what your bugbear bite my bug bag
is that mean like your bag I love to
hide it okay all right thing that
expression before that's why we bring
you on cuz you don't have my bears in
Australia no I'm drop bears that's
another thing drop bears share what you
have a drop in those terrified I was

honorary Dominican being a Dominican I

it's like little you know like also lay
there a little white boy right here
ginger beard and your stupid face yeah
that's it sober drinking and you're
saying you're sober drinking that's
funny we had someone else call that uh
taking a honeymoon in Punta Cana he's
like I was drinking all these strawberry
daiquiris and found out they were virgin
shrubbery deck right dude you hear about
this yeah stupid me Oh what an idiot our
deli yeah um let's lucky to stop us it
is awesome here's some more stuff of the
iPad and then your touch bed hey guys is
orange county from Ryan just three quick
things Jeff really loved your post
yesterday about the ipad versus the home
console comparison really look down what
I was feeling and thanks for that I'm a
suggestion said that he touchpad use
have gone down you should try putting
them ice cream sandwich through signs in
maan nine alpha p on yeah I did it last
week it was great took a half an hour
not in dual boot into web Louis and ice
cream sandwich I'm a touchpad
they're just some small issues I worked
out on the forum are two dude you should
do that so he's talking about what
models at the cyanogen I think it's
called Sanjana cyanogen nine just came
out yeah it up online what the hell's
that it's a way to root your eye your
touchpad in order to put a to do yeah
you know what i would do it with it is a
amélie install Flipboard and that's
something that I really wish that was on
the touchpad do it man I mean ice cream
sandwich on my Nexus is awesome yeah I
love it okay do it I'll try it it'll be
like a nice little project for me a
report back everyone what's the worst I
get up and you'll break your touchpad
yeah i'll be out a hundred dollars Oh
big of a deal you know that like that to
me that's like disposable yeah I'm
kidding it's not a lot of money but uh
but yeah you should definitely try it
here's a good idea about adding
something called study mode to iOS 8 40
for this is Long Island from freshman
and I just really wanted to emphasize
what you guys were talking about before
about reading books on the ipad I'm how
there's like notifications everywhere
yeah the thing when I use my iPhone and
stuff for one studying because I should
own airplane mode I don't know why Apple
has made like a study move like I split
on airplane mode I just tell everyone to
go away I'm really homework I just want
to listen to music I don't want to hear
that Bob inches profile picture here
that Julie texted me yeah hey what's up
what are you doing i meani pizza no now
I can just listen my music and just do
what I need to but if they put it like a
you know you know education mode it can
leave on the internet so i can browse
the web and look up information you know
and you know let me just call you know a
certain contact or just know he's not
with me on this are you is it going to
go to it don't let you to Wikipedia for
example or no I think you've got the
internet there that's that opens up a
whole lot of just no rights what I just
call it the ipad babysitter mode oh
that's what he's asking for you know
it's not like computers duh they don't
have that function and you can still
access all the same things just turn off
aim turn off facebook yeah listen to me
i'm not i think it should be disciplined
dude i got to be mean on this guy i'm
just saying you know like I bishop or
imagined
like I have a TV right in front of me
like we have all this entertainment
around the office we still get work done
yeah I did I just think there should be
a no I all the other crap whatever there
should be a no notification mode yeah
definitely especially for the book stuff
I'm sorry man you cannot argue with me
that it's cool getting popups while
you're reading a book yeah there is just
not cool it's why you shouldn't be
reading books on here of course should
be reading on your kindle ah we got a
couple emails from Alessandro people
like my dad and Wilson's grandma and
sweet Lou would probably SQ hey son the
new ipad 3g or is it 3g no data grandma
its 4g see the confusion if you shorten
ipad 3rd generation to ipad 3g then
everyone there will be confused as to
what technology capability they the ipad
has i was just my teasing he's right but
they weren't they weren't gonna call it
throughout three they were going to call
it HD that was the thing right in which
i still think it should be called that
even though the HD suffix is tired you
know originally what was it seven 1024 x
768 the original that is HD right
because it is it's it's 720p yeah yeah
so I don't think HD was always a bad
name for me I don't know I'm with I'm
not saying it's good but at least it
freaking tells the difference uh Colin
from weehawken always a neighbor of mine
this is what I said everyone gets one he
says hey 44 crew and 09 my macbook pro
battery had swollen to the point where I
had to remove it really that could
happen on a macbook your batter can
swell that's insane uh it's so much of
the point he couldn't press up on the
trackpad have you ever heard it he's
like very annoying I think it's more
than annoying sounds dangerous I was
going to buy a cheap replacement off
ebay but he went to the fourteenth
Street apple store to see if he could
get a free or discounted one his macbook
warranty was done and they were going to
get him a new battery for 70 bucks
rather than the list price of 120 the
guy typed the return label in
incorrectly and said his name was uh
something else and he got a free battery
and then the UH realize they made a
mistake in the Apple Genius said I'll
don't worry forget about it will just
give it to you for free that's what I'm
talking about like this it is like pro
tip give them an ink
ragni dance say it's wrong when you go
to pay actually that happened to me ya
like my my phone died yeah my old phone
that i bought from australia and i
actually went in but they actually read
the serial number off wrong so it was
under some other dude yeah um you know
in it with an Australian number and I
was like I don't want his phone to
suddenly stop working because there's
exchanged mine right I said and they
gave me a free phone amazing judge but
they don't care you wanna know why cuz
they're stocksfield 500 ah this year I
don't know ok so we got another email
that's kind of contradicting this point
it's from Barry he says I work at a
genius bar in somewhere I don't want to
blow them up I can confirm that it's no
longer true everyone does not get a free
pass at the genius bar while yes we
waltzed yes we used to offer a free
first time pass service model that
turned out to be very inconvenience
istant now we work on a fast and fair
model of service where everybody gets
the same answers in revel in resolution
so well I think so but if they were
looking for consistency it sounded like
they already had it yeah you know in
giving everyone one you know free pass
right it isn't some we're doing that
anymore I hoped I hope that's not the
case because rich people to do applecare
maybe is they're losing on money but did
some bind it seemed to sort of feel like
there's no incentive to getting out of
here after i got it for free um we're
talking about app hoarding yesterday
dave says i am officially an appt
hoarder i am currently at listen are you
kidding me 4770 9ab stored on my hard
drive in itunes hill bro you've got a
problem that is way too many a plucked
it I it's that that's crazy gonna go
into kill mode uh I don't I mean Dave we
gotta talk dude you gotta get like TLC
up in your piece but that doesn't mean
that he has all four thousand says
matter 79 doesn't matter ipad i know
that just downloaded that but that's
still too many that's about 4,700 too
many i think yeah anyway as long as you
can do and you know I just I feel like
it's like gambling people get into debt
with this stuff I hope they're all free
or 99 cents even though it says a lot of
money that is up man that's crazy um oh
and then yes you talking about bringing
an ipad into an outhouse right how did
you get that point of I that's right
and then our buddy Jason from Michigan
says he grew up in Idaho where in some
places there are still out houses or pit
toilets if I saw one of those I would I
don't know what I would do is pretty
crazy although I'm too poor to afford an
ipad that's not funny if I and I was
traveling in some parts of northern
Idaho it would be possible to be using
an iPad in an outhouse right so dude I
want to see some photos of this want to
see someone's in that little string that
they have in our houses that they put
the wrong this is I wouldn't touch that
No Touch iPad 1 i've had doc in every
single outhouse yeah 2013 and my dream
is an ipad and every outhouse sums do we
have like that that's funny man so yeah
I guess you can't have an iPad house the
more you know gross that's gonna do it

number to call that's how you get in
touch with the show that's how you get
