Donna Tam from cnet who's been covering
the cell phone radiation industry and
one of the issues that's come up is that
the city of San Francisco would like to
see some warning signs put on cell
phones when they're acquired by
customers and quite a bit of controversy
around that correct yeah the city passed
an ordinance the rights no ordinance in
2010 saying they wanted to educate
consumers about specific absorption
rates of cell phones which means the
amount of radiation that they might be
giving off and after after they approved
the ordinance the ctia which is the
wireless industry's lobbying group filed
suit saying that it was it was going
against their First Amendment right and
forcing them to convey a message that
they didn't want to convey they're
afraid of the weight that would be
placed on them providing this message
for consumers which would cause some
alarm and panic about cell phones in
general that seems this is very similar
to what happened with the smoking
industry where for years and years the
smoking industry would say that well
there's no need to have any warning
labels on sun because there's no proof
well at the end of the a turned out that
smoking was harmless harmful to health
and I think a lot of people could have
lived longer have they been warned
earlier there are a lot of parallels are
being drawn about that the city is
definitely standing by that they're
saying you know there's no definitive
proof that cell phones cell phone
radiation is related to cancer but are
do we have to wait till someone dies
before we can say let's warn people
about that risk and it's not just San
Francisco in Washington DC
representative dennis kucinich has put a
bill in play that it will require some
warning labels put on cell phones as
well it obviously it's not going to get
through this Congress anytime soon but
the cell phone industry is really
ratcheting up its lobbying and you know
trying to keep itself from having to
post these kinds of warnings yeah and
definitely everyone all the cities and
counties across the country or that one
do cell phone radiation labeling like
this they're watching this case in San
Francisco to see what will happen in the
courts what happened yesterday so
basically the judges heard arguments
from both sides both from the wireless
industry
lobbying group and also from the city of
San Francisco and the judges asked
pretty tough questions on both sides and
at the end when the judges remark that
both sides had really good arguments and
that they would take into consideration
and and we should be expecting some sort
of ruling from them soon if they decide
to stay this preliminary injunctions
which will put a hold on all these
materials at San Francisco once produced
they may choose to appeal may go all the
way up to the Supreme Court or may go
back down to the district court where
they'll duke it out some more well
thanks Donna we'll stay tuned for seen
it i'm dan farber thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
