Akhtar when your home network is working
well life seems so great videos load
quickly and streaming a beautifully high
bitrate your PC connects to the network
in the blink of an eye but then when it
gets bad it can get really bad we're
talking not being able to connect your
printer using your phone's network
instead of your own and videos timing
out let's fix that these are the top 5
tips to build a better Network number 5
secure your Wi-Fi this is a really easy
tip go to your router settings through a
browser and change a couple of things
first up if you haven't changed it
default password on your router change
your default password why
so other people are mucking around with
your router after that make sure your
Wi-Fi network is secured and not open
why because if your neighbors leeching
off your Wi-Fi your network speeds could
suffer number four is router placement
where you place your router makes a big
difference in how your network performs
in the best-case scenario you have your
router in a central location in your
home that way the Wi-Fi signal radiates
to where you need it on top of that
minimize the amount of barriers between
your router and your machine you'll also
want to make sure your router is it near
reflective surfaces or metal ones since
that will interfere with your network
today's routers are no longer eyesores
so if you can have your router out in
the open you can extend your network
using an access point an access point
attaches to your home network using a
wired connection they can be used to
extend your wireless network if you want
to extend your home network wirelessly
you can invest in a repeater the device
will relay the signal from your wireless
router to your device the downside is
the speeds will be cut in half if you've
got an old router sitting around you
might be able to turn it into either an
access point or a repeater with dd-wrt
if your router is compatible number two
maybe it's time to invest in powerline
adapters sometimes it's difficult to get
a signal to certain areas so a power
line Ethernet adapter may be a good
option these devices are usually sold in
pairs first you plug it into an
electrical outlet then you catch one to
your router using the Ethernet cable the
second one is attached to another outlet
in your home the adapter uses your home
electrical system to create a network
powerline wasn't exactly known for speed
in the early days but things have
changed
if you look for adapters that support a
standard called
HomePlug av2 you should see speeds
faster than your wireless network and
the number one way to make your home
network better is to wire up as many
things as possible a wired connection
and subjects just so much less
interference compared to a wireless
network if you want a streaming video
using a service like Netflix or play an
online game it's impossible to beat a
wired connection take a look at your
home theater wire up your consoles your
set-top boxes whatever and you'll have a
much more pleasant experience one of the
most useful things I've ever learned was
making my own network cables which I
used to make ridiculously long runs to
connect far away rooms to my router
Wireless is good but wired is better if
you've got a super-secret tip on how to
make a network better like a foil
reflector or something hit me up on
Twitter I'm at is more top fives like
