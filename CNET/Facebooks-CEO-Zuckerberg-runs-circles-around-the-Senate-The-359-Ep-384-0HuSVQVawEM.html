knob Dan Ackerman Facebook CEO Mark
Zuckerberg sat down for his first
congressional hearings on Tuesday to
respond to the Cambridge analytical
breach perhaps the biggest scandal his
14-year old company has ever faced but
after getting grilled for over four
hours he seemed to come out largely
unscathed in Facebook stock jumped four
point five percent dan how do you think
he did you know it's kind of its kind of
like he dodged some bullets because the
people asking the questions didn't
really know how to get around behind him
and and really get him with the gotcha
questions but at the same time his
robotic nature and the fact that he
looked so uncomfortable up there and how
could someone so much money look so
uncomfortable in a suit is beyond me
he's used to wearing a t-shirt yeah it's
a bit of a draw in that suit ah you
think he looked uncomfortable though I
think that a lot of the well everybody's
impressions are different but I think a
lot of people saw this as Zuckerberg out
outpaced expectations
he looked poised he was very media
trained he was on point this wasn't the
Mark Zuckerberg from years past burger
was fat sweating on camera it was
certainly a much more poised situation
than previously he just had to outlast
all these questioners without saying
anything radical or divisive and he
largely did that I said last night after
after seeing everyone kind of go off
about this all day long I said this is
an unpopular opinion I said on Twitter
but I could not be less interested in
watching all these hours and hours of
Zuckerberg testimony because the
Senators and staff don't know enough to
ask the right questions and Zuck is so
heavily media trained so much to avoid
saying anything remotely interesting
okay I mean look I would select agree
with that actually but let's talk about
what could actually change and let's
start with regulation so Zuckerberg at
least opened the door to the idea that
look I'm willing to work with you guys
on new regulation the problem is is that
you and I both know that Congress has a
very hard time getting even basic things
done so what's your expectation
even that would actually happen even
basic things about technology and and I
think he has to go up there and he has
to appear open you certainly can't go up
there and and appear closed off to it
and say no that that's it we're not
going to do this because then everyone
would turn on him and and would rush
something ridiculous through that
wouldn't accomplish anything so in that
way he did do the right thing he's he's
playing ball but he also knows they're
probably not gonna get it together in
any meaningful sense and of course it
goes against the entire ethos of the
governing party to want to regulate a
private business so he has that on his
side as well so let's also talk about
what Facebook as a company hopes to do
Zuckerberg talked about the idea that
they're gonna do a lot more
self-regulating in that they're going to
police themselves much more they're
gonna be a much more proactive they said
we're having this big philosophical
shift at the company and do you do you
actually believe that's going to be the
case and in years to come this is going
to be a different looking Facebook I
mean there's two big there's two big
issues or two big problems they have to
confront a number one is they're not
doing anything that's really all that
radically different from a lot of other
companies that mind a certain amount of
data about you and secondly they have to
they have to come to grips the fact that
you and I and these senators may may
care about all this but I've talked to a
lot of just regular Facebook users and
they're not that concerned about it they
don't have the same expectation of
privacy that you and I do rightly or
wrongly just as in years past they would
use Gmail and they wouldn't be concerned
that that Google was scanning their
emails and giving them contextual ads
based on the content of their emails
like that horrified me we're gonna folks
would be like alright I kind of expected
them to do it so I wanted to end with
one more question there's there's kind
of this broad consensus that or or
there's there's this argument that like
maybe Facebook should start getting you
to pay subscriptions for getting an ad
free service do you think that that
would work would you sign up for it do
you think that would ever actually it's
so interesting a premium model there are
some social networks and services that
we all use that have premium models that
you can trade up to I'm not sure they
would get enough from a subscription to
offset what
they would lose in terms of the data
because I think their larger subset of
data is is you know the massive
conglomeration of all this information
is what's really valuable to them so I
doubt you could ever fully opt-out no
matter what you paid them well Dan thank
you very much if you want to read more
about these stories check us out on CNN
I'm Ben Fox Ruben and I'm Dan Ackerman
thanks for listening so it's pretty
quiet in the chat today and I think
people are tired of hearing about
Zuckerberg to be frank really not that
surprised but you know this was this was
the big thing and it got an enormous
amount of attention much more than a lot
of other congressional hearings this was
the story du jour yesterday so we would
be remiss if we didn't talk about it I
do have one good question start now from
syringe oh he says what do you think of
the extra seat cushion that Zuckerberg
had to sit on to make himself look big I
think look if I was pretty standard I
mean I'm just gonna sit there for four
hours I would have liked to have a giant
seat cushion to sit on to I mean I sit
for a lot of TV interviews with leaders
and reporters and and every time they
have me and the other person they are
they sighs I stop and they figure out
whose chair is gonna be higher and lower
and how to make everything look even you
know he's not a tall guy and he's also
sitting lower down in the room then then
all the said they're deliberately up
above him and I I call no no foul on
that okay it just seems odd he if he was
next to somebody they want to even him
out especially for the sake of the
camera angles and whatnot but for him to
sit alone on this cushion which doesn't
look comfortable looks like he's having
to like anything out of it we'd have to
see out what other people who have been
in that room at that desk have done if
this is the only cushioning that we've
seen or if it is a common practice yeah
yeah but as we said yesterday too you
know he was so media trained that there
wasn't really a very high expectation
that there was gonna be this big oh my
god moment where he was gonna
accidentally fly you know he was media
trained in that he played it close to
the vest
and he just answered questions in a
simple manner and he made sure not to
show his cards he wasn't media trained
in the sense that he was
convivial and chatty and conversational
and and got people to embrace him as a
personality he was there I say his
normal robotic self I felt like he was
less robotic than usual but you know he
was also like you said he was just very
clipped responses ai is making great
strides where we're moving towards that
uncanny valley and she's close to
passing the Turing test he's not quite
there yet but he's getting there he just
wants to learn to love why does this
thing you humans call a kiss I wish we
could get away with it without getting
our butts sued off but right before we
started the podcast Dan was sitting here
monologuing from the screenplay for
Blade Runner oh he was doing it and it
was so perfect the we could do a bit of
that no we can't I'm just quoting from a
movie I'm doing a couple of movie quotes
it's the electrical property don't even
bother it's not worth it just use your
imagination dance soothing voice
Zuckerberg sitting in front of a
questioner looking into a little box and
the guys on the other side smoking and
it says duck see a tortoise lying on its
back belly baking in the Sun we're
getting sued all right so let's talk
about helping Zach why aren't you
helping it Dredd headlocks awesome name
is this just a dog and pony show or are
they actually going to ask him some
serious questions into what security was
leaked now it sounds like they're
actually in the midst of that right now
as we are sitting here chatting at least
it seemed like it was heading that
direction when I departed the hearing
this morning I wish I had mentioned this
earlier as I was coming to the podcast
Alfred Inge who's watching the whole
thing unfold now told me that Zuckerberg
was in fact part of the 87 million who
had their data breached as part of the
Cambridge analytical breach and I was
not neither was I excellent we both
checked up on it but I guess Mark where
somebody mark knows did that silly quiz
resulted in this whole situation but
let's not use the word breach to too
strongly here
what information exactly was shared from
my understanding some of it is just the
very public information you have on your
public facing Facebook page
it just got scraped it wasn't anything
you know hidden behind your personal
like friends only firewall was like your
name in your hometown it depends on what
you allow people to see hmm
so calling this a breach I think is
still a strong word it's it's an
inappropriate use of data that was
collected data of misuse a mis sharing
but this wasn't a hack in any way this
is no you know a breach indicates that
there was some security that was
circumvented yeah and the only
circumventing really happened against
Facebook's rules is that somebody who
got all this information and data and
got it
according to Facebook's rules then turn
around and shared it with a third party
they were not supposed to so that's not
really a breach that's a misuse of
information that you got from Facebook
by a third party hidden Fox sorry what I
was just saying good point yeah hidden
Fox largely agrees cousin and Fox the
hidden Fox and hidden Fox hidden Fox
yeah they say is that nice to hear from
you hidden Fox they felt that the
environment was too jovial to be taken
seriously and that he seemed to get off
really really easy yeah now it'll be the
general impression to contrast that
Michael Brown was saying that I
appreciate the fact that Mark Zuckerberg
is taking full responsibility for this
however I never thought their business
model was really a good idea monetizing
people's personal thoughts basically I
want to adjust everybody yes true I
think the thing is is that you know
Zuckerberg definitely made an admission
of guilt he said the buck stops here
this is my company I take the blame for
this type of situation the problem is
and I've seen this reported on before is
that they've made a lot of mistakes and
he's done apology tours in the past and
he's apologized plenty of times in the
past so the question is what's actually
going to change because there have been
these dust-ups
previously about your privacy settings
are too confusing or too Byzantine they
make small tweaks on the side they don't
really change a lot so I think people
would be right to be skeptical
waring is gonna change they change it
too much that once you figure out where
all the privacy and security settings
are on Facebook when you go back later
they've changed it all around a
reconfigure and then you have to relearn
it and that's that's really the that's
really the issue yeah I mean look to
broaden it out looking at a lot of the
Google Chrome settings just how a lot of
that stuff is set up and how you reduce
the types of ad targeting and cookies
they could do a better job of making
that a little bit clearer so but you
could also do the same thing with with
your Google Account with with a lot of
other things you could click on that
little blue triangle in any of the five
million banner ads you see every day and
go to that ad choices page where you can
opt out of all these ad networks so it's
not just Facebook that's that that's
tracking you all over the place it's
it's all these ad networks and it's
Google right and and other people which
is ultimately why I think it's a good
conversation that we're all having as
far as this is what happens when your
privacy does get you know utilized in
these misuses so it is good that we're
talking about I don't appear to be pro
Facebook or pro big company but you know
what do people expect when they go into
these sharing platforms and they share
and they're using the platform for free
and and they know that it's you know and
and marketing supported I I think people
sometimes have an unrealistic
expectation that they get all these
goods and services for free and and
there's no trade-off there yeah I just
want a quick shout out hidden Fox you
were great Metal Gear Solid yeah I just
want to include a sentiment somewhat
agreeing with Michael Browns earlier
statement and that I was legitimately
impressed with how well put together
Zuckerberg was I thought he was very
well handled I'm no I'm not alone in
that opinion but I do still see fear in
his eyes hmm I didn't I know a lot of
people say he's been truly poised but I
think what it really comes down to is he
is taking it quite personally and I
think that's endearing in this case and
yeah the flopsweat is is there it's just
just well well masked by the TV makeup
I'm sure he's wearing it's got that look
in his eyes yeah
look the problem is is what are they
actually gonna do to him you know like
what would regulation look like it's one
thing to say are you for regulation and
then really what though and then he says
yes for the right regulation or the who
wouldn't say that the complaints have oh
your Terms of Service are too confusing
how is that different from every other
Terms of Service you ever click through
from Apple or Microsoft er or Sony or a
or Google or anybody else it's not
really yeah yeah in fact Facebook
Facebook's material now is much more
open and easy to read than most other
people's because they've been called on
the carpet so many times for it we did a
TV news piece not that long ago where we
went through a lot of the Terms of
Service and things on Facebook and
frankly the layout and and the way they
explain things in the way they cut
things up was was much better than I've
seen from almost anyone else at least in
the most recent version I'm not in the
past sure total mess
hidden Fox still thinks that the
Senate's dropping the ball when Zuck was
asked about people departing Facebook
and taking their account offline and all
that he was critical of that that no one
in the Senate followed up with but do
you destroy their information or do you
still keep that about them are there any
other major details you think that
they've completely glassed over in this
proceeding
now that's Facebook's fault because they
muddy this issue a lot when they hear oh
you only Facebook all right click this
button to suspend your account and that
just kind of hides it but keeps
everything there and then if you want to
actually delete it that's a whole nother
process you have to go through and even
then they say we're not gonna erase your
data for a certain amount it's gonna
take a while to pull all your stuff down
although I think he didn't answer one
question and and and say that once they
actually do that they can't recreate it
got it but at that point somebody else
probably already has it but to the that
to a certain extent sounds like there is
a value to the user in doing that though
in that you know let's say you wanted to
suspend your account you wanted to take
a digital break from this or something
maybe they shouldn't make it so easy to
delete it entirely they don't you know
they they make it easy to suspend they
make it harder because people are say
that's it I'm quitting Facebook and then
they click that button and then they and
then they are gonna come and they come
back month later to go oh all right I
guess I can bring it all back in they're
back to
where they were right and we just say
all of this is why over the years I've
always kept my MySpace page I need to go
validate this now is that true
it's probably somewhere unfortunately I
don't think any of this benefits that
one social media company ello is that
what it was yeah man hello it's like a
speech the other one peach oh yeah I
think around I still get emails from
them I'm like I've got that Google+ yeah
plus is still there Google+ exists but
more more that Israel that is their
slogan we we exist and we're all
switching to discord but yeah that's the
problem is like what exactly is the
alternative for the time being it seems
that there's no upstart that's really
going to take out Facebook there are
plenty of alternatives oh the turn of
this but it's not why everybody in your
family that's a terrible idea
no but I mean they're obviously there
ever we all know I don't need to list
them but they are different experiences
and I think that's largely why this has
become such a sought-after proceeding I
mean people are interested in it because
above all else as being reiterated in
the chat right now Facebook seems to be
more personal than a lot of the other
places you could argue Instagram but
Twitter snapchat that seems to be a
little more commercialized a little more
fleeting Facebook being so personal gets
a lot of passion out of people you feels
like it's truly an invasion of your
privacy and that's I know a redundant
statement but it feels more like so it
makes him to your home that makes a lot
of sense to me because it is in many
ways Facebook does encourage you to
share a lot of your own personal life
and it is kind of like your personal
blog like this is the defense the spear
down your network because that when you
connect with is a friend or a PR unlike
Instagram or Twitter where you're just
projecting out to anonymous people who
follow you right and that's why maybe
it's discomforting people for people to
be reminded that there's this giant
gorilla in the middle of this whole
social network that's pulling all your
information and packaging it for
advertisers and sometimes completely
misusing your data and that is certainly
something that everybody needs to be
reminded
hopefully Facebook does actually change
some of those things I mean if but what
would I change chastened by this maybe
they are actually you know other than
what they already did which has changed
the rules for how third parties who
collect information can use it and can
share it with other people that's the
that's the main thing I don't think
they're planning on changing anything
about what they store and collect and
what they sell the only the only real
changes they've talked about are are
making sure that no one gets some of
that information and then resells that
the repackaging and reselling may be you
know not just because it's potentially a
violation of your privacy but also
because somebody's making money off that
data and they're not getting their cut
yeah yeah and the midterms are gonna be
a good testing ground no show no no
votes in the midterms will be decided by
anyone's opinion on Facebook I don't
know I very go on it right now we'll see
about that it's not gonna be a driving
issue for people continuing on with the
whole personal sentiment number of
people in the chat site that people
don't fully understand how Facebook
works and maybe from Chris garner that
people should realize that they don't
want if you don't want your information
shared maybe don't create an account you
know the people do opt in to this to a
certain extent and really opt in it's
just 100 percent object and okay all
right you make how much truly is on
Facebook as a fault they have I I would
it's a great question but I would say
that they and haven't done enough to
police their own platform and Zuckerberg
said just as much yesterday he said that
what we would do is create tools and
just expect people to use them for good
now we're having this philosophical
shift and saying we're gonna create
tools and then make sure people are
using them for the right reasons
as opposed to you know hate speech
Russian trolls election meddling all
that other studying on that stuff I
think is much more important than you
know trying to let people know that
they're letting advertisers know what
their home town is and what and what
pages what band fan pages they like
mm-hmm I like wean man I've gone pro
Facebook I can't believe it yeah how I
feel but at the same
hi people with our key people whining
that they're getting exactly what they
signed up for doesn't hold a lot of
water with me fair enough
that's a good point expanding on that
from huy egg isn't this about a much
larger problem ethics in the corporate
world seems at face book and tech giants
aren't alone in this now that's another
really great point and I don't know I
don't have the chops to speak on that
Ben maybe you do with it living in the
Amazon world I could probably talk about
it broadly in the tech world because
like tech is definitely the the space
that I exist in but the misuse of data
and the complete lack of regulation
around data particularly in the United
States is something that I think is a
conversation that we all really do need
to be having especially with the EU
passing new regulations with the GD P R
that's gonna go into effect next month
that's I'm sure a lot of US citizens are
looking at that and saying gee I wish
our government did something similar but
that's a real restriction like just like
that right to be forgotten in Europe
where if you go to Google they're in a
European country you're not gonna get
the same results that you get here
because people have frankly often fairly
ridiculous reasons for requesting
redactions and we would not allow that
here because that would be a prior
restraint on publication basically and
or yeah it could even be viewed as uh
you know infringing right your right to
know is is all we always consider the
the larger public good of free exchange
of information to be more important than
an individual's right to hide something
embarrassing or negative about
themselves in Europe though they feel
differently and they don't have the same
baked-in constitutional protections that
that put that right paramount above all
others that's a good point yeah I think
with the GDP are a lot of folks view it
as a positive in that it has stricter
regulations on how you collect data as a
tech company and how that data is stored
and disseminated that's something that's
broadly it seems lacking but anyone
who's looked at how Europe as a whole
the European Union has has regulated
various industries knows that they are
terrible at it
and their answer is always more
regulation that strangles you know
businesses for ridiculous reasons
because a guy a new legislator in one
country can't understand what's
happening in entry in another country
and that's one of the reasons why people
scratch their head and said I can't
believe the brexit people won you know a
lot of that was because people were
afraid of this overreaching European
Union regulatory uh thrust
I like the farmers in the UK I like this
version of Daniel you know weird we're
taking orders from other countries about
what to do with their cows pro-business
dan calm man is a very enjoyable day in
accra Mendel who knew so there's a few
requests for us to commentate on some
more of the political issues of the
these hearings and it's not really our
forte but we can my forte
we can try well that try not to get too
political but from Josef del mondo do
you guys find the breakdown of the
countries that were affected by the
Cambridge analytical scandal interesting
I'm mostly interested interested and how
the Philippines was the close second in
the breakdown now I have absolutely zero
perspective on that but maybe you guys
do I can't say that I know much about
that my understanding is just based on
who took that quiz and who their friends
were who were linked to it because it
went you know one degree of separation
down so that might just be you know who
got served that that that quiz and took
it but beyond that I I do not know
thanks for trying
lost legacy do you think anyone from
Facebook's can get fired for this
oh that's a great question the question
lost lost legacy Zuckerberg has been
asked this a few times apparently
nobody's been fired yet in some cases a
firing would be an even broader
admission of guilt and who would be
fired and what would the what would they
have done to deserve that because their
case has always been and frankly if you
look at it they're not entirely wrong
they they operated under their own
guidelines and it's a third party who
then misused this information and
disseminated it and they had no control
over that and you could say well they
shouldn't have let it get to that point
anywhere where someone had the ability
to do
and that's true but they were still
operating within their own guidelines so
anyone who worked on that would not have
been violating a company policy as far
as we can tell right now that's a good
point from Mike Brown I thought the
interview was very monumental in the
tech industry when Facebook makes its
changes do you think people will still
enjoy it
have we perspective theorized about any
of the changes that could come beyond
the the most recent policy change about
ad sharing I think that their efforts to
clean up some of the bad actors you know
like the hate speech like the election
meddling like the sharing fake stories
fake stories of fake people gaming the
system to get things to the top of
people's newsfeeds
that's a major day you know so answering
Michaels question I don't know that
anybody's gonna particularly miss that
stuff because it's gaming the system and
it's already broken now everyone's
complaining about their new emphasis on
things that your friends interact with
or like or comment on means every time
you go to Facebook the same stories at
the top of your newsfeed because people
keep commenting on and they're liking it
cuz they see it I've noticed and that
then it's because it's at the top more
people do it and then it becomes a
self-fulfilling prophecy that that stays
like the top posts like two days at a
time so clearly there's more there's
more tweaking they have to do yeah and
they're constantly trying to do that
just to make sure that you continue to
engage gasps read stuff it's mainly at a
more boring experience though because
you see the same thing if you go back
later in the day at the top of your feet
and that seems like a mistake and I
think they were aware of that and I'm
sure they're working on tweaking that
yeah and in the meantime we'll see how
much any of this is really impacted
their user growth their monthly active
users daily active users that's what
it's all about yeah from what you said
before it wouldn't surprise me that the
impact will not be that significant not
as a matter talk about this you know the
broader public is probably aware of
Cambridge analytic now you don't think
so a lot of public can't name the vice
president that's Joe Biden
I know the broader public is not aware
if you did a man on the street survey
and he said what is average analytical I
would joke three out of three out of
twenty would would be able to give you
the correct answer maybe five or six out
of 20 would it would even say they heard
of the name well in that regard if you
are right and I feel like that would be
unfortunate if that were true I
congratulate our YouTube listeners for
being so well-informed self-selecting
group of very smart people who know
quality podcast news and entertainment
when they hear it all right we have just
enough time for a couple more quick keys
from Michael Brown what do you guys
think the difference between the data
that gets collected by Google Facebook
Twitter reddit do we know exactly how
much each of these can collect where
they pull from where it goes to yeah The
Wall Street Journal had a good graphic
on this yesterday that Michael you
should definitely check out it basically
shows that Facebook has a tendency to
collect more data and more kinds of data
but they all collect data to a certain
extent but if you're looking at it from
a level of egregious Nisour just the
amount of specificity that they do
acquire Facebook does tend to be on more
of the extreme plus people do share more
if their lives and their information on
Facebook as opposed to on Google or with
Twitter I mean like other doesn't know
what iSchool I got into but but Google
does collect a tremendous amount of
information and built a profile of
relator you can go and see right and
that can follow you from website to
website and serve you a lot of
contextual ads and it is pretty scary or
surprising to find out how much they're
able to profile people relating to their
search and they also as you said they
scrape Gmail accounts so it's it's
something that it would be really really
hard to get away from these things to
not have so much of your data scraped
I'm sure a lot of people have tried to
do that kind of thing but you know these
companies are really critical in
people's lives a lot of time a lot of
the time so it's hard to do it so
bringing out our fine tooth combs Chris
garner asked does the Facebook term
specify
what they have the right to take as far
as information goes and how ever they
want to use it how detailed are the
terms of service they are very detailed
I'd have to try to look them up right
now but there there was a very good
series of pages that they had that are
color-coded and have like basically a
little jump links in between them and
you can follow this whole path of what
they collect and how they use it I don't
know how if they list everything
specifically in there but having looked
at them very recently for a TV segment I
I thought they deserved a little bit of
credit for that let me draw your
attention to Exhibit A from yesterday's
hearing I don't know which senator that
is or who that is making the the savage
statement as it was but I thought that
was pretty solid roundup to encapsulate
I don't think it's any worse than
anybody else's I thought that was a that
was a get my get my face on the news
pre-planned quote there I mean that's
the attitude you've had undertaken about
most most of this I just think they're
they're bad but says everybody else fair
enough okay we are out of time I think
we have really gone in deep on this and
I'm tired of hearing his name so here it
is data policy right here on and really
you can scroll you could scroll through
that am I really doing this
I don't know quality TV for having a
clear layout of their data policy I mean
it's even easier to read on the web
version it would be interesting to see
how many people actually read any of
them I had to go find it to do this TV
news segment so you know I had to go dig
for it but the layout and the was good
it was written in plain English so you
know a tiny bit of credit for that
so a tiny bit and I think geniuses don't
dominate the world by accident yeah and
robots will see if we do more Facebook
tomorrow we'll see what ends up
happening but there are hearings going
on today so yeah maybe something else in
tech will happen but we we don't know
the first time I've ever said this I
hope they drop like a new iPhone or
something like this right
we need something else yeah but I know
we are at a time thanks everybody thank
