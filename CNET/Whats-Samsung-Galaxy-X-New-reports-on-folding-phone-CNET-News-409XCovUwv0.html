closer to finally launching some
analysts are now saying that it could be
ready by early next year and the latest
buzz is that this folding phone is going
to cost twice as much as other top
phones prepare to dish out more than
eighteen hundred dollars for a galaxy
phone that can fold up all these are
from analyst speculations first reported
by The Korea Times one firm Golden
Bridge Investments says that this
folding phone is going to have a screen
size of 7.3 inches when it's open and
it'll be four and a half inches when
it's shut also the report says that
Samsung may have the prototype ready in
time to show this January at CES so what
do we mean by foldable Samsung has been
tinkering with flexible screens for
years the company made this concept
video of a phone screen that can just
fold flat into your pocket and there is
a patent that Samsung has for a phone
that folds up like a wallet but what is
more likely is something from this other
Samsung patent where you could see the
phone has two side-by-side screens with
a hinge unfolds like a book some refer
to this project as Samsung Galaxy X now
Samsung would not be the first to make a
phone that folds like a book Chinese
companies ZTE came out with the ax on em
in 2017 and it's got this big old ugly
bar down the center when it's open so
yeah maybe Samsung will find a way to
make the seem less distracting what's
your take on a folding smartphone and
what does it need to do for you to spend
more on it growing up in the age of flip
phones I can see there's something
charming about the concept but let us
know your thoughts in the comments I'm
