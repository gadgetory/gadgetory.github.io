seqable days August 79 it's a four to
six thousand 359 and I'm already tagged
out for the day good morning Roger tang
and Ben Fox
Reuben what's up everybody good morning
all right we're gonna be talking about
Apple all day no Apple shocker right we
avoided that chunk we could yeah but you
know what Apple reporters last night
pretty surprising and interesting stuff
that came out running so we're gonna
talk about that was it down it was it
was kind of I like the Apple watch stuff
numbers themselves were not as
interesting I think a lot of people are
taking more into the revenue forecast I
mean that means for iPhone 8 but we'll
break all that down for you as usual any
questions leave them in the comment
section brightly feel best and we'll get
to them in 3 minutes and 59 seconds from
3 to welcome to the 3 to 9 I'm Rutter
Chang I'm Ben Fox ribbon apple posted
earnings last night and they drop some
hints about the next iPhone it offered a
pretty rosy revenue forecast for the
current quarter which suggests that at
least some new iPhone will come out by
September obviously they've been a lot
of rumors that the big iPhone 8 will be
delayed until later October or even
later in the year but the forecast seems
to suggest that Apple is on track just
by the way like the stock is at an
all-time high because of this so up then
we figure you excited are you like you
pumped for iPhone 8 or iPhone 7s or
whatever they're going to call it I mean
I definitely want to see what it's what
it looks like the rumor mill has been
going crazy for like the past year so
obviously we want to finally see what
this is supposed to look like yep
but typically Apple rumors tend to be
right a lot of the time so the
assumption that this was going to be
delayed I thought they were right about
it I thought that this was probably
going to push out a little bit further
so ya know I talked to investors I've
talked to analysts and everyone sort of
assumes there's going to be some sort of
delay the sort of compromises that we
might get an iPhone 7
sn7 s+ sort of a slight upgrade in
September and then an iPhone 8 the fully
wholly readily redesigned wholly
radically redesigned iPhone eight will
come later in the year because out of my
constraints that doesn't mean two
different events right they're going to
balance both I think they'll announce a
mobile now it's both and they'll say you
know the 7s and 7s plus are available
for pre-order and a week or two
iPhone dated remember you know it don't
mumble it away like oh yeah coming with
and the iPhone eight is expected to be
the like the high spec okay that's right
thousand dollar thousand-dollar iPhone
AMOLED display you know all the bells
and whistles you can imagine that you
know removal of the bezel the full
redesign that could come in October I
have to say that anybody that's willing
to pay that much is willing to wait
until October that's not that much later
you're going to wait a couple more weeks
if it's later than that then you know
like you're starting to upset people but
even then you're not and like people are
still gonna buy it well I think that's
why there's some debate now but whether
what this forecast really means because
that revenue for guess was higher than a
year ago
and much higher than this this past
quarter which suggests they expect
pretty robust sales supercycle as it
were another supercycle yet but they
expect you know healthy sales and you're
not going to get that if you're getting
if you're not going to have that iPhone
eight so there's some debate about
whether or not that radically resentful
will actually show up okay so I know the
iPhone is like the big deal for Apple
all the time but let's get to like some
of the other devices yeah the iPad had
actually improves for the first time in
what was it like thirteen quarters is
well just it was thirteen consecutive
quarters of declines if this is the
first one that actually went up year
over here which was just like a dead cat
bounce we're like really hit rock bottom
or people actually like buying iPads
well you know Tim Cook talked a lot
about the education market I imagine
them being been successful in getting
iPads into schools and businesses you
know they obviously they cut the price
on their base iPad I think that helped a
lot they introduced a new iPad pro the
ten point and I think five ten point
five inch yeah like the kind of middle
ground iPad pro which I don't know if
that actually helped I don't know anyone
who
actually I go like to people who own an
iPad pro who actually paid for one sure
I don't actually know if they're they're
doing well but it seems like the kind of
on the budget side of things that peds
doing well right and on the other thing
that I wanted to mention was the Apple
watch yes they clued us in they said
that's 50% increase in sales this is
very positive for a device that like we
have not been the nicest to on this
podcast dying that it's not you know
it's the best SmartWatch out there which
doesn't mean a whole lot
oh yeah and they talked a lot about how
from a market share perspective they are
far and away the leader but there there
are there there is no but there's also
no real clear pictures of what the
market looks like so you know it there
aren't that many concrete numbers we
still don't have a good education
because they bundle the Apple watch
under other components which include air
pod sales which include accessories
Beats headphones so it's really unclear
exactly how well that Apple watch do but
it's I mean yeah the the growth you
mentioned that's that's pretty
impressive either way all right so they
have a ridiculous amount of money
way to go Apple yes and their stocks at
all-time high so if you're know that's
very good for you I'm not I'm not either
I am not full disclosure but yeah I like
going back to the iPhone numbers I mean
it was up a little bit and there's you
know they still about 41 million units
and you know basically any other company
that's they want they would kill for
that this is a ho-hum quarter we're just
talking about how this is this is their
sleepy right boring quarter for the new
iPhones right exactly like they're just
clearing out the inventory yes also
forty point million years that's kind of
amazing right into I do have to wonder
why folks were buying their phones now
like are you not thinking about just a
few weeks from now where the new iPhone
comes out yeah gotta have you out of the
current one goes down by about a hundred
doll exactly like even if you don't want
the newest and greatest that that next
iPhone or the this current iPhone will
probably get a little bit cheaper
I think 41 million people accidentally
drop their iPhones in the toilet and
they're like me to rush out and get a
new iPhone that's what after that is a
highly plausible I will wrap it up for
these stories are more check us out and
seen it I'm Roger
I'm Ben Fox Ruben thanks listening
boo-boo-boo-boo well that was way banks
four minutes three minutes when was the
last time when was the last time we did
four minutes that's a legitimate
question I want to ask the audience one
of the left
April attract this more than we did more
minutes accurate all right so what do we
think is going to happen we're going to
get a delayed event this year that's
kind of well I think the event might
might be around the same time I think
the actual launch might be a little
delayed I think it'll come out at the
end September I think there will be some
serious supply constraints I think it's
really really tough to get one
especially the iPhone 8 whenever that
comes out that's going to be that's what
they're calling it I don't know we've
been hearing the 7s and listen yes I've
been hearing there are a lot of rumors
about this that there are two versions
there's going to be like the minor
upgrade mm that's like the S upgrade and
then the bigger iPhone and make
retention as opposed to like naming them
all three the iPhone aid or naming all
three I mean it's the the kind of Steve
Jobs fanboy me is kind of annoyed by
that because you know he was big on like
the idea of like one phone and now we're
to like six or seven different I thought
if you have the S II Israel models like
different variants it were just like in
this crazy number of however yeah look
at Samsung you know like they come out
with like a different phone every five
seconds well yeah yeah Samsung that's
it's different though because they
they've come up with phones for
different categories right like there
are super cheap phones or mid cheer
phones like apples technically supposed
to be like the one high-end phone for
you except now there's like seven
options yeah speaking of Samsung I like
this comment from zombie see enjoy your
Samsung enjoy your sampling displays
sheeple welcome to 2012 Apple that's
true oh yeah I cold water the OLED
display has been around for a long long
time Apple is finally gotten around a
stop again we're so excited we're okay
we're totally finished through the nose
for it oh yeah you want that mo-mo LED
display is
LCS a but for 725 dollars
yeah yeah you're gonna have to pay a lot
more money to get it on the iPhone aid
which I know for like the fanboys like
fanboys and fangirls like they're all
going to go for that phone and that's
probably going to be the one that like
everybody I mean where they work just
fine that I always say like they had
apples innovations so to speak appeal to
someone like my mother who wants it
simple and taken care of for her it does
the heavy lifting for her kind of
situation hell I appreciate that myself
to a certain extent right I'm lazy and
there's last I'm real lazy guys we all
know yeah I know I know you got to
wonder though why Apple does an embrace
stuff like right now Danny Green and DEF
CON are having a bit of a chat about
removable storage in our YouTube channel
and it was like well how hard would it
be for Apple to appease its audience
once in a while instead of like trying
to lead the pack and by lead the pack I
mean like recycle things that aren't bad
ideas they're not new ideas either know
that I think that discussion gets
recycled every single year yeah as far
as removable storage unfortunately
Samsung with its flagship phone this
year it went in the other direction
yeah whereas in previous years you could
do removable storage I think Apple they
just are able to upsell you on higher
storage yes it's like too big of a
market for them to it's they charge you
an extra $100 for something that costs
them like I don't know maybe six or
seven so they don't want to provide you
with removable storage yeah that's
exactly it
I mean it's it's it's their way of
getting you to pay up and they've got
some crazy margins of that memory
because it's it's not like the memory is
not expensive it's $100 more for 64 gigs
now why would it be I think is yeah so
we didn't get to this like home pod
thing too so apparently there we had
some software they came out related to
the home pod there was like a new form
factor this was basically generally an
image of the designer the icon of the
new iPhone was found in my ceiling code
the silhouette right yeah found in the
code for
or some software that would go into home
pod and has covered outline of this sort
of all screen look right yeah and it's
pretty much in line with what we've seen
I think it's kind of interesting that
it's it basically looks like the same
design as the essential phone oh really
yeah do you think oh I think all screen
is in the top just come a little lip for
the camera for the front-facing camera
right and that's essentially what the
essential phone looks like I would be
very curious to see if they do go that
route which we've been expecting them to
wear like the fingerprint sensor ends up
because we know what happened with the
s8 right so I mean Apple right yeah
right the smaller indications say that
they're going to get it in the front
underneath the glass mmm I mean if they
do that's that's definitely a one-up
speaking of innovation like that would
be innovating because no one else's
figured it out right like I and I don't
I haven't been hearing any rumors at all
as far as their note eight there was a
chip which I think it was one of the
Chinese phone makers held an event
talked about how they were going to put
it in their phone but the phone just
come out to like middle next year so
they kind of like tease it like we've
got were the first we've got this
fingerprint sensors of loud mention well
by the way the phone's not available for
like another year so so first step first
it's about as relevant as being first in
the comments exact ouch okay sure though
hey Vijay wants to know if there's any
Apple watch three updates no updates
from the conference call I mean Tim Cook
was asked a lot about new products he
wouldn't comment on upcoming products I
mean I think if we could safe bet to
think that there will be a new Apple
watch nation or later
earlier like this year yeah fresh you
think they put that alongside the big
iPhone unveiled oh that seems like it'd
be severely in the shadow I don't know
maybe maybe it'll hold a separate
October event oh thank you that oh that
means we got two late nights come on
yeah plenty late I got we got the note
eight coming up man yeah that's true do
you think if they did release the Apple
watch three would it look any different
than the other two that was the thing
the Apple watch to like the I gotta say
didn't look at any different I really
to make a round watch when I'm really
liking I'm taking the round watches it
looks like you are I know I'm rocking
one of these the gear s3 and it's a
little too big for me but is still nice
now I was sitting in room actually in
Google's offices yesterday surrounded by
new Android wear watches and they're all
circular they're all fashion brands all
really nice and they don't have like the
chin thing on them I remember there were
like some Google watches that had oh
yeah no no chin yeah
no chin is they figured out hundred
thank God good question from Danny Green
so Apple does the face ID can you set
more than one person I have my touch ID
did set so that my wife and son can
access my iPhone in case something
happens to me that's a really good
thought I wonder yeah I mean I would
imagine yes like it's just a matter of
storing the profile you would think it'd
have to mimic the functionality of touch
ID I necessarily using the finger we
know Apple they kind of get some of that
that those little touches down usually
they're pretty good about those details
so I would imagine something like
different users or different faces good
can't PlayStation do that already I
don't know I don't have to protect with
Ackerman again I thought I remembered
him showing me something about facial
recognition and PlayStation that might
have anybody can tell me in the chat
like to hear about it Apple the Xbox do
that does it look what connected I don't
also run on a 360 so Apple will also
benefit from Samsung's release of the s8
previously because like they had facial
recognition in that phone and then
everybody like there were a lot of like
tests on it that you could just put up
like a picture or something so there's
some debate about that because I think
we tried during our run through the
essay I think we tried a picture and it
didn't work but I think that was during
the initial demo stage I don't know if
like that's what the final software
looked like yeah yeah there are the
results of some questions about how
secure facial recognition was I think
Samsung maybe argue that it's more about
convenience and security like if you
really want security you want to lock it
down with something else like the iris
scan I respect ID or whatever
fingerprints on yeah
so let's fill in DEFCON 1 says that you
came in late and you guys to know what
the updates on touch ID are I'm going to
say is we don't know yet we don't know
we don't know anything the writing's on
the wall
I don't see we're not supposed to
speculate but what I do that's this
whole show to give a reliable
speculation they're going to rename the
iPhone the Apple phone or the I don't
know I am at if I do like if you so cat
is where I found that what it would be
the Apple phone episode Epiphone Apple
phone a shout out thanks to Quincy
Williams yes PlayStation has face
recognition there you go I'm behind the
time for my video gaming I'm sorry yeah
hey well I have an xbox one that just
collects dust so he pretty awesome
Joseph wants to know where's our brine
Chong Ryan not for this show people
right now there are other podcasts that
see that now there are we're trying I
mean he maybe we should have a modern
when he's yeah you know one point when
he's here for the Samsung event reach
other yeah yeah totally yeah mmm-hmm
anybody want to see Brian song yeah no
sure I saw him on comic-con oh cool yeah
hung out with them
how's he doing good how's the family Hey
yeah good you just kid he just got back
from a family vacation he was looking
rested Hawaiian jerk
I don't want Hawaii next year dude hope
you don't treat me that I want to get
back some agree with oh man we just
about got to wrap it up here yeah one
more question from elite Brian gaming is
the home pod worth it we're still I mean
we don't know yeah we don't have not yet
have one yet yeah it's like later this
year they showed off a really early
version during WWDC so you know we we
will definitely get back to you in a
yeah we will review the crap out of it
we're excited to see it yeah yeah yeah
our home stuff is always kind of a fun
experiment because it can also be very
unpredictable and it can also go just
get scurry enough where it's like oh
this is weird and hysterical like that
conversation between Alexa and Google
assistant oh yeah where they talk to
each other it was priceless like it
alott that for hours what what I would
say about that is that
if you're really interested in the smart
home stuff you might want to start with
like an echo dot because it's only fifty
dollars but if you're really really into
the Apple ecosystem then it may be worth
it for you to spend on three hundred and
fifty dollars for the whole times it's a
lot of money I've also seen a lot of
studies that say that Syria just is a
worse
voice assistant but then again you
remain how R this thing I think is a big
it there's supposedly AK mark maybe it's
supposed to be updates to Syria and make
it smarter or more it's not going to be
overnight the energy overnight so take
time
yeah she needs to learn right so I would
probably direct people to the echo dot
you'd save a lot of money but you know
if you're really into the music maybe
you want to get the home pod I don't
think I would spend three hundred and
fifty dollars I'm not no no not for me
that music market is probably a good
place to target though to try to draw
the folks in and those who want to be
the loyalists of course but those who
want to be part of the building of the
next one since the echoes kind of
established at this point right that
device has I mean it is leaps and bounds
above the rest but maybe somebody wants
to be part of that building process the
innovation the beta per se yeah I do
your action factor I like I want my
icons of dawn I don't I don't need no
arms ride or brave Expedition vs. wait
those all settled and like everything is
all gentrified and I'll move in right
yeah I'll use when it comes to
technology but yeah question or a
classhole'
yeah yeah and will when we get a chance
to look at it will we'll have a lot more
to say couple more quick keys to fire up
before we're done DEFCON one is
inquiring about how facial recognition
will work in the dark and that's
something I have not thought of what you
got I think that I will tell you I the
the flash would probably flash it I
believe for the iris scanner it actually
does work in the dark as it uses if red
ah there it is so just okay night yeah I
say I wonder if like you got out with
around to the note seven so I'm not sure
why but yeah yeah that was one that was
the last time they had a I don't know we
were not allowed to speak okay I
remember I was testing it and I asked
that's explicitly they were like yeah it
works doesn't he like I I think with
facial recognition usually it's been
paired with fingerprint sensor so it's
not like they're going to transition to
like only facial recognition you're
always going to have like another thing
available yes yeah but I think the idea
is that it would work just it was like
facial recognition should just work
would work like a hundred percent of the
time I mean it's not an apple and to
make sure that happens
hmm okay oh god here's a thought dad she
says a flash talked about killing your
ability to sleep think about how bad it
is now when let you wake up in the
middle of night one check what time it
is it's like on a screen so but I didn't
adjust it before and the question now to
open it up it's gotta go hey oh my god I
can't admit that's a fate worse than
death
really that's pretty extreme what's the
last time you woke up and looked at a
bright phone in middle of night it's
awful it is how much fun every day in
your face
Cooper first world problem it says work
to the first world geez
I can imagine a lot worse pain one more
let's get one more in with a couple more
good questions flow in but we are
running out of time Brian
cheeri fee will carrier subsidize a
monster's iPhone eight price uh no no at
this point those most things carry the
drop subsidies yeah right I mean you're
gonna be paying in monthly installments
you paying a lot more in monthly
installments presumably for that
thousand dollar phone my other there are
leasing plans as well but you know
they're also it's the same deal you're
paying month a month for this thing so
you know you're not going to get a
subsidy they may do more like like
better trade ends early on I imagine or
it's going to get failed especially here
in the US it's going to be really
aggressive all the carriers you're
looking at this iPhone in sort of a big
event where people potentially could
switch so they're all going to be
throwing last year and the last effect
last two years the carriers have all
offered some sort of like give us your
iPhone we don't care what I thought it
is we'll give you the new iPhone for
free or half off or something some big
promotion okay so you can expect
something like that for that yeah and
you're more likely like early on to see
that kind of stuff yeah you need six
months yeah six months you're probably
out of luck but if that's four
kind of rush the first few months I can
imagine the carrier's offering all kinds
of incentives for you to switch again I
do like an existing user that might be
maybe a little bit more hard-pressed for
some of these deals but it's totally
possible though yeah
so look out for those early yeah all
right let's bring it home all right
