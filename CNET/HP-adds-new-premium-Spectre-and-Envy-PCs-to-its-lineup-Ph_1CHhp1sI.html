and hybrids just in time for the holiday
season one is the HP Spectre x-360 this
is a model they've had before it's got a
13 inch screen that folds all the way
back to form a tablet or you can prop it
up like a kiosk or table tent it's got a
13 inch display that goes better than HD
if you want to pay for that upgrade and
of course it has the 6th generation of
Intel Core i5 and i7 processes the
latest from Intel there if you're
looking for something a little more
experimental there's the HP Spectre x2
this is a hybrid that's more tablet than
laptop in fact it feels a little bit
like Microsoft Surface and that it has a
stainless steel kickstand that comes out
of the back and props up the tablet half
and then you can attach if you want a
magnetic keyboard cover
unlike the service cover this feels a
little thicker a little heavier a little
bit more like a traditional laptop
keyboard whereas the surface cover feels
more like a cover with the keyboard
built into it now this system has got a
12 inch display and it's going to have
Intel Core M processors which are not as
powerful but our low power system so you
can put them in thinner lighter more
premium feeling products and if you want
something that's a little more
traditional well there's always the HP
Envy notebook HP's have this line for
awhile as well the latest version is
all-metal no plastic there it's got a 13
inch display and current generation
Intel Core i3 i5 i7 processors it's a
very minimalist look but kind of
sophisticated and exactly what you
should check out if you're looking to
get an alternative to some of those
popular macbook laptops I'm Dan Ackerman
and that is HP's premium laptop lineup
