behind me is a television believe it or
not this television is LG's rollable
display doesn't even look like a TV down
here just a little box sexually includes
this box above and a little stand below
that the box holds speakers but the
really cool thing that it holds is a
full-size 65 inch television the TV can
roll straight up slowly it takes a few
seconds to get to its full size when
it's there you have a beautiful OLED
television OLED TVs are the best
performing television we've ever tested
they have beautiful black levels great
viewing angles the whole nine but this
TV is the first we've ever seen that can
do this it disappears completely of
course the huge advantage is when it's
off there's no TV at all you just have
this little piece of furniture here when
it's on you got a great big TV
particularly effective when you have
this beautiful view in the background
like we have here another cool feature
this TV is it goes down about a quarter
of its normal size and produces these
little apps on the bottom here so you
can look at a clock you can get some
photos you can do some extra things on
the bottom here when the TV's just
partially up another big advantage is
the sound system itself built into the
TV it's a full hundred watt Dolby Atmos
sound system so this thing can really
blast and of course if you want to
listen to music on it you reduce the TV
size completely and just have the music
coming out with no TV screen and no
picture
no screen whatsoever you might be
wondering about durability this thing
does roll up into a little poster
looking thing inside here LG says that
they've done it fifty thousand times and
if you do that four times a day that's
gonna last you thirty six odd years so
that's a plenty of durability according
to LG we'll see what actually happens in
the real world is no special warranty on
this TV that they've told us about so
far you also might be wondering how much
this TV costs well they haven't told us
that either they're saying the second
half of 2019 but when it comes out it's
not going to be cheap
I'm David Katz Marv with the first
rollable oled TV actually going on sale
later this year at CES 2019</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
