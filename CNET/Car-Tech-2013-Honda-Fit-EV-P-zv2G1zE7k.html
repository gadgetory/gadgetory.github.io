plenty of electric cars many of which
probably deserve to be on the golf
course this however is not one of those
if it's not a hole-in-one it's at least
a 300 yard drive I read it up with the
golf parallels let's drive the 2013
Honda Fit Evy all electric I check the
tech now as you can see the fit Evy is
built on the outgoing fit not the
radically redesigned 2015 it's easy to
spot a fit Evy it's got graphics all
over it screaming that which you'll want
to pay a body shock to remove the day
you bring it home at least I would also
slightly higher ride height because they
packed a bunch of batteries underneath
now the most important thing to notice
inside the cabin of the fit Evy is a
very different instrument panel fresh
and really well laid out as electric
cars go let's take a quick tour on the
left is your charge or discharge gauge
down means you're getting energy into
the vehicle with regen up means you're
expending it on acceleration in the
middle great big speedo and then the key
thing you're gonna look at all the time
right underneath there is the range
indicator and we're gonna talk about
that little icon next to it in a moment
and then on the far right you've got
this giant gasoline gauge style charge
indicator and then something interesting
to the left of that you've got two
parasitic discharge areas on the upper
left shows climate control and how much
it is sapping your battery turn on
things like heater or air conditioning
and you're gonna show more blue bars
there that's a bad thing below that or
things like lights or maybe a lot of
things plugged into your power outlets
so that tells you what you can get rid
of to take less out of the battery and
extend your range now look over here on
the far left side there are three mode
control buttons you've got the Eco at
the bottom norm in the middle and sport
at the top we'll get on the road and see
how these really work sometimes they're
almost kind of the same thing you can
barely tell a difference in this car I
think we're in for a surprise
the only place this display breaks down
is in that centre LCD you can get into
way TMI when you go through some of
these historic charge versus average
discharge this is for the high per mile
crowd you don't care now on to the head
unit I want to show you the key feature
on this now watch carefully it's right
down here
you see that look right in there
see what that is that's where you're
gonna put the crowbar and rip this POS
out and throw it away the first thing
you bring the car home because that
sucks
this is a tired old design that dates
back to when scene that first started
reviewing cars the better part of a
decade ago it does nothing very well and
it's completely out of place in an Eevee
in 2014 so let me tell you get rid of
this it's a double din head unit you can
pop in one of the new pioneer or Alpine
units that have mirror link to more
intelligently bring your phone in
there's a Honda Evy link app that lets
you control charging find charging
stations and range precondition the
cabin etc I've never gotten it to work
because Honda's online reg system is
amazingly complicated now down here
under the snout not a whole lot little
tiny electric motor an inverter an
electric air-conditioning compressor and
a whole bunch of room as well what's
happening here is a motor fed by a 20
kilowatt lithium-ion battery mostly
packaged flat low under the car that 20
kilowatt battery is able to get this
electric motor to crank out 123 horse
but 189 foot-pounds of torque torques
the story with v's remember the guy
weighs thirty two hundred plus pounds
that's six hundred and thirty more than
a standard gas fit with an automatic so
ain't going
hence Xun 260 is okay at nine seconds
but v's tend to feel faster than they
read will see on the road epa says
you'll get 82 miles on a full charge out
of this guy that'll vary depending on
your terrain driving style and how many
of those parasitic systems you use that
we saw on the dash that's why they're
there that charge will take you anywhere
from 15 long hours on a 120 outlet
that's survival stuff as all that is to
just three hours on what they call a
level ii or 240 volt outlet 118 MPGe
is the EPA number for the miles per
gallon equivalent compared to the energy
cost of gasoline now to get a full
charge at hu 80 miles it's about 2 bucks
here in California at the lowest
overnight rate that same 80 miles
covered in the 2015 gas engine fits
gonna run you $8.50 so it's night and
day the cost of getting around on this
car wait she / however its range and
charge time have to work for you oh by
the way in addition
that app I showed you check out this
dongle that comes with the fiddy v it's
basically a shortcut version that lets
you do things like check your state of
charge you push that button it goes over
the wireless data network and tells me
I've got 24 percent battery right there
I can tell it to charge by hitting this
button right here I can also tell it to
pre charge the climate all for those who
don't want to use an app now my first
impression is not a favorable one I'm a
little disappointed with the amount of
motor and gear wine is coming through
this cabin that makes us not like a golf
cart quite literally I'm not just saying
that as some kind of a disc
it sounds like an electric golf cart
it's not horribly intrusive but it's
more than a lot of electric cars I've
driven lately so they need to address
that however once you get past some of
that intrusive wine
what a nice driving little car it's
nicely planted it doesn't have a brittle
suspension it's very well sort of
modulated of course all that weight down
low that extra 600 pounds in the belly
makes it handle better than I recall a
gas engine fit if not quite as sharply
you know what I mean now about these
three magic buttons over here on the
Left eco normal and sport what a
difference more than any car I've ever
driven that has similar buttons Eco is
really tepid I mean you can't get much
out of this car but boy does it make the
range improve when you go to normal boom
you feel an immediate difference in
responsiveness and when you go to sport
another huge jump but what you also
notice is a big change in those
predicted mile ranges there on the gauge
I'm looking at roughly 12 to 15%
different between each of the steps so
if you go from eco to sport ballparking
you lose about a third of your range
okay let's price our fiddy v it's 37 4
gulp it's a lot of money for a fit but
it doesn't matter because you can't buy
one you can only lease them to 59 a
month and for only 3 years at which
point you got to give it back Honda
gives you a number of things for free I
think sweeten the deal free level to
charger although you're on the hook for
the installation that can run 5 to 1500
bucks
typically unlimited miles that's fairly
unusual for these kinds of cars and
you're gonna get collision insurance
thrown in that's interesting as well
brings your bill down so it's really a
$9,300 experience to get in
the car now on the downside this car has
got a crappy head unit and as I
mentioned kind of a lot of gear and
motor whine that surprised me in a bad
way however it's got a lot more upsides
in its overall packaging handling
performance and the way they've put the
deal together for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
