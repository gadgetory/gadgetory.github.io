appliances and right now we're taking a
closer look at the lrg 30 85 st by LG
for one thousand six hundred and
forty-nine dollars this freestanding gas
oven certainly isn't the most
inexpensive one you can buy but for the
price it definitely has plenty of
stainless steel style
not to mention is easy and fun to use as
you can see it's got lots of handsome
design elements that are clad in
stainless steel you also have these very
shiny metallic looking front burner
controls which they're plastic but they
do feel very premium you also get a nice
gas range up top with five burners
it has a very uncluttered interface for
the touch panel in the back you actually
have just the minimum amount of controls
with names for everything and it's
pretty easy to use and quite responsive
the oven is only 5.4 cubic feet in
capacity and compared to other ovens
from Samsung and GE and other device
makers they tend to offer 5.8 cubic feet
of space so that's a little bit smaller
than you'd expect another thing that I
don't particularly like is that there's
not a lot of extra features and you also
don't get many accessories bundled with
the actual oven itself it's probably the
biggest problem with the lrg 3085 st is
that it doesn't cook very quickly so
these are things that may be a problem
for you if you want fast cooking
performance so when you boil it all down
this range from LG is certainly a solid
oven it's just not going to offer the
same amount of fast performance and
extra features that you'll find in
competitors from say Samsung GE and
others be sure to check out my full
review of this oven as well as other
ranges at cnet.com I'm Brian Bennett for
