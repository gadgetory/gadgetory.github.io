entered the world of fitness fans
I'm Scott Stein and this is the HTC grip
it's a collaboration between HTC and
Under Armour and it's gonna be available
in the US this spring for $199 and it is
designed to be for serious athletes this
design here kind of feels a little like
a Nike FuelBand but also reminiscent of
what the Microsoft band has been
attempting to do and this design is
rubberized fits all the way around the
wrist tightly and clasps and it has
three different sizes so you've got to
pick the right one and there are
adjusting sections in the middle to make
sure you got the right fit on top here
is an OLED display that's flexible
monochrome and you can touch it to swipe
through various settings you can check
your progress you can record workouts
you can actually run mini apps and it
receives notifications through iOS and
Android
this also has GPS so you can use this to
track your run on the go about five
hours of battery life when using GPS
two-and-a-half days when you're using it
with the notifications put in the grip
pairs of Bluetooth le two chest warrant
heart rate monitors as opposed to using
any optical heart rate monitor on the
band because the accuracy issues really
haven't been proven yet and the chest
warrant is the more accurate option
although you don't have to find one of
those Under Armour cells them to to
connect with on the go this is really
meant for runners it's gonna be
interesting to see if casual people can
get into it - it's a get-up-and-go type
of mentality with smart notifications
could there be a SmartWatch in the
future - who knows but for now HTC is
looking really at smart Fitness for now
the HTC grip comes in a matte black
color with an electric lion green
underneath this is the HTC grip on my
wrist from Mobile World Congress in
Barcelona
