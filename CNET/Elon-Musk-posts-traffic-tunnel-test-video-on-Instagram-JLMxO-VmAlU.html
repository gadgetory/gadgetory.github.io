got a little more real musk posted a
30-second video to his Instagram account
with a warning that the video may induce
motion sickness or even seizures we'll
offer that same warning here before we
actually play the video he says the clip
is a test run of an electric sled
similar to the prototypes he proposed as
part of a massive tunnel concept
designed to alleviate traffic as more
autonomous cars make their way to the
roads musk explained the idea in detail
at a recent TED talk the idea is to make
a network of tunnels under major cities
that can cart vehicles around at high
speeds the cars would use a kind of
elevator that doubles as a transport
sled and the sleds would reach speeds of
approximately 125 miles per hour in the
comments for his video musk mentioned
the light bands were only in place as a
way to assess speed which is probably a
good thing because otherwise writing in
this thing would be as scary as Willy
Wonka's terror cruise
there's no information on where this
tunnel test took place or even if it's
built to scale so while this appears to
be going somewhere near the speeds musk
is aiming for if it's on a to scale test
track that's about a mile long it's also
possible this test sled and tunnel are
the size of a toy car hashtag bow-wow
challenge we'll be keeping an eye on eel
