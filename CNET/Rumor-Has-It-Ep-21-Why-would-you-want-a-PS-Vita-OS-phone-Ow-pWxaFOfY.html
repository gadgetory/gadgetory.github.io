landscape for the PS Vita OS after a
year-long delay can photographers
finally get their hands on the canon 5d
mark two and should ice cream sandwich
get out of the way of the next OS jelly
bean all that a special guest yay or nay
and more on today's rumor has it
it's Tuesday februari 21st 2012 and
welcome to rumor has it I'm Kareem Levy
and I'm Emily Dreyfuss and you are
watching the Internet's funniest
hopefully gambling show where every week
we round up the text the internet's
biggest rumors about technology and then
we run them down and we bet on which
ones are likely message and which ones
are not exactly and the most important
part is the bedding yes and what the
bedding that's the betting this is a
gambling show after all guys we'd like
to keep it interesting so this week
we're gonna talk about four interesting
rumors one of which is going to either
come true or fall on its face next week
so one of us will get a point right away
I'm very excited I know I'm very excited
um and that's good because right now
we're at a stalemate yeah so we we keep
adding points so we decided to get
really organized and we put all of our
wit we went back through all of our
episodes put it in a spreadsheet and it
turns out that we both won two points I
can't even tell you for what and was
something about Siri not being allowed
on older iPhones and something on
facebook that Facebook IPO that happened
we both bet on that and so we both are
winning or losing which removes the same
yeah and since we don't have any sort of
safeguard in place for when this happens
when there's a tie what will happen is
just there won't be a humiliation day or
we'll have to humiliate ourselves both
of us I think that's what I think I
think that we should you should both
steve is really a part of it I would
love to okay so i think i think because
we have to maintain a level of
humiliation at all times we will if
there's a stalemate as there is and as
it looks like there will be then we just
both all three of us will humiliate
ourselves rather than not have
accumulated a i think we should have
like extra special he Mele and I think
what we need to think about is something
that is humiliating for all three of us
because we have different talents and
weaknesses and there are certain things
that would be humiliating to you that
would not be a humiliating to me if we
did karaoke you'd have a very unfair
advantage because as we know you're
amazing in it well and I already did and
you already did it no we need something
that is universally humiliating I think
it should also be public where we can
get the word out on rumor has it that
it's here on cnet so people come on yes
igg promotion here okay I'll maybe we
should wear sandwich boards yes
all or some totally and really pimp
ourselves yeah my favorite things will
be those people on the street handing
out the leaflet that says rumor has it
it's so embarrassing and there's like
nothing in the pamphlet it just says
rumor watch it well maybe we'll be like
we didn't put it on paper because our
show is digital so we'll hang out
pretend netflix watch our show it's on
the internet will work on it all right
so we have so much as we said an intro
we have so much happening today that
we're just going to get right on it
we're not gonna yadda yadda limo usually
do alright so our first rumor is about
the new PlayStation Vita and whether the
operating system will land on
smartphones and tablets so speaking
recently in a question and answer
session with reporters Sony's incoming
chief executive Kosovo here I I love it
that right guys a boy guys a little can
say here I you just said that with a
Russian accent sorry believe he might be
Japanese well I don't know how to do
that one had the operating system
running on the PS Vita was intentionally
designed to be expandable and could work
on both smartphones and tablets that was
like a big session when the PS Vita came
out there like why isn't this thing a
phone yeah I quit and that's the thing
and so and it could be known as you know
we know that people it's big I mean
right as a 4.3 inch screen or whatever
it is and the samsung galaxy note that
just came out is about 5.3 and yeah so
this is about the same size so why
wouldn't it just be a phone if they're
already gonna do that I actually think
it also makes sense because the trend is
towards gaming on phones this is like
the last vestige of actual like
dedicated handheld gaming and one way
that they could make that technology
worth it because people are not going to
buy this in droves but they could make
the money that they spent in advancing
this technology worth it by putting
pouring it over to smartphones and
saying that's what this was really about
exactly and then like what they tried to
do with the xperia play which totally
fell on its face which was the
PlayStation yeah well they could have
just called it the playstation phone and
then do right people would have known
what they were talking about exactly
instead they were just called it
something random and then they were like
oh yeah that was the playstation phone
that we were talking about really like
we had no eyes all we've been talking
code name playstation phone or six years
that's like if
called the iphone 5 like something
completely over like at the 4s yeah
nobody oh no they called it like Siri
phone yeah people be like what I Drive
on five so the Vita software already
includes a host of applications that
users can tap to access including a
browser a camera location based social
networking programs it also comes with
Facebook Skype Twitter everything that
you would have on your phone or tablet
now it's not clear how easy it would be
for Sony to put in port the operating
system to smartphones and tablets but
whatever I mean what camp why wouldn't
they be able to do it it's like what I
it's hard I'm torn with this with this
rumor because I do on the one hand I
feel like okay so sony has been putting
android on all of its products right
everything all the sony phones and
tablets are running android why would
they need to have another OS i got a
friend in android because android is so
fragmented and doesn't update and they
can't depend on it maybe they want to
just do with them so and if you keep it
all in house then you stop bleeding
money because then you just like put all
your resources have to like internal
stuff and that makes sense Apple is very
sick Seattle but the reason not to do
that is because then developers are not
making apps for it but if their whole
point is that it's gaming and they're
making their own apps and they're
they're having it dedicated to gaming
developers who are already making gaming
things for that OS then it makes sense
yeah you know exactly because then you
know they already have skype they
already have twitter they already have
facebook like that's what people want
then the other things that people are
downloading our problem you know if from
the app store for the android
marketplace or probably games and so if
they can make games that are PS game is
it way better than I join are you sure
you know and if they could probably
figure out a way to make um words with
friends on there which is the only open
that is all that I Caitlyn will be
happening nobody don't need anything
else I was on an airplane yesterday
sorry but this woman was playing words
with friends on the bus on the way to
the airport and she ran right into an
elderly gentleman and his she was
playing I was riding it and he goes okay
excuse me and she goes she literally
said oh my god I'm so sorry I had to get
the next word and words with friends
like this is a social problem to be bad
golly that's how like when people are
texting it used to be texting and then
they would fall down manholes now it's
like words of friends I got kicked off
the bear plane because I wouldn't turn
off my phone I felt like this all day
about an old man in the face yeah so I
don't know I mean the thing about a Vita
phone it porting the Vita OS on two
phones already exists makes you wonder
why they didn't just like what Stephen
said make the Vita a phone to begin with
well but answer is sony ericsson well
they just they just but they now they
gay now they don't have to do what
Erickson says because now there are
ericsson so they're not encumbered by
the fact that i think that's why it was
called the xperia play because it was
they had all of this complicated stuff
because it was two companies coming
together to make phones got just so the
PS Vita was a little bit too late
because they just did the whole sony
ericsson yeah and like PS vita we
developed solely by Sony at a time when
the sony ericsson was doing the phones
okay i don't have to worry about that
and now itself for their next iteration
gotcha because I mean when every when
you think about an ipod touch it's just
an iphone without the phone right yeah
so basically and it has everything else
that has facetime has or whatever so I I
can see why so the PS Vita could be the
PS Vita without a phone yeah and then
they could come out the PS Vita with the
phone it just makes the Vita only for
people who don't need a phone who are
people who are below the age of seven
and then why do they need two hundred
and fifty dollar device oh it's more
than that it's like 300 Oh realest yeah
it's like 350 want to buy all that no
its way it's expensive because it's 300
just baseline I think and then it and
then maybe more if you get 3g and then
you have to buy a proprietary a memory
card and then the game and whatever it's
like I it's like five hundred dollars by
genetical are hated yeah we mad about
them so record yeah exactly there was
all proprietary and then so anyway on
the heels of this story there was a
really quick other rumor about what I
don't even think we need to bet on this
about HTC getting Sony branded games on
its phone which would then defeat the
whole purpose of a so you know of a sony
phone if I having the Vita mmhmm yeah of
having a Vita phones
you then you would have an HTC phone
with playing Sony branded games branded
it probably won't have the thumbsticks
and it'll be big screen and the Vita is
a little bit better for that kind of
gaming yeah but I mean I just don't even
even get it remember when Sony just made
Walkmans why was it I really think this
is if this worked true this would be
sony's way of dealing with the fact that
it's all going in the smartphone sphere
and they have so far not been successful
with it which is why they got rid of
their why they bought sony ericsson what
they're trying to revamp their whole
approach to smartphones yeah and and
this I mean this is they're not going to
make another handheld gaming device this
is the last right this is it and well
and it's just interesting to think like
what a PS Vita phone make the PS Vita
redundant like why not just spend
another couple hunt you know and make it
a phone um I guess you don't have to
have a contract right that's true there
a lot of that's great you and there's
some reasons but and I get that they're
trying to make a unified experience like
then you would need but then you know if
you have a sony computer sony TV the
sony playstation in the sony vita and
maybe it's only beautiful i want to sony
microwave yeah and then you have
everything but then they all need to be
running the sony vita OS so to make it a
true unified experience like how
microsoft is doing it there maybe they
don't have their own necessarily
hardware like microsoft is running on
whatever come here but the OS is the
same and that's the important part we'll
get back to this when we talk on later
after the break about the Chrome OS any
Android OS maybe being ported over to
something that's going to be one of our
next rumors all right so Oh actually
that's going to be this rumor come out
right now I have to set the duck timer
but maybe we should vote on the let's
put i'm going to write in our little
notes that we should also vote on
whether HTC will be the first to get
Sony branded yeah that's a good um OS PS
period games let me set the duck timer
because we are really trying to keep on
schedule today I'm so proud of us
usually we just talk and talk okay so
this next rumor way is what can I just
say the name of it while you are setting
that up yes the next rumor is that
android 5.0 jellybean may be launching
in q2 of this year ready and go who
cares so none other than digit times of
course our friend morning that Google
may be ready to release android five
point
Oh which is kind of ridiculous since
none of you have even had a chance to
taste Android 4.3 mess and which unless
you're like just an echo sand you bought
yourself a Samsung Galaxy Nexus already
and basically it's an ice cream sandwich
is not out there yet and now they're
already saying jelly bean will be the
next one and if you guys are following
google names their OS is their versions
of android after desserts and then they
follow along the alphabet so because we
had ice cream sandwich right now they
think that J is next and so a J dessert
or sweet or candy is jelly bean like um
Taiwan these based digit I'm says that
it spoke to people in the supply chain
who claimed that google is planning to
launch five point 0 at some point in the
second quarter and that it will be
optimized for tablets which makes sense
because all the operating systems are
now sort of being optimized for tablets
and then it'll be this like
cross-pollination and everything will be
using the same thing but this is the
interesting part of this rumor not the
jelly bean is going to launch because
obviously it's going to launch but the
rumor says that the vendors who are
working on this claim that you will be
able to port android 5.0 over to windows
8-based tablets phones and notebooks so
you can buy a dell running Windows 8 and
then you can without having to reboot
without having to do anything you can
just BAM snap it into being an android
OS which is a little bit confusing
because Google has the Chrome OS which
is for notebooks they don't have the
android OS is not for computers it is
mobile right it is solely mobile so it's
kind of a strange rumor although I I
want to say that I think it has a little
bit of credibility because nobody likes
android OS and even though there I mean
the Chrome OS Chrome OS yeah they're
coming out with new Chromebooks
everyone's like who cares that party
okay like if it uh member google TV
Chromebooks are like the next Google to
you and then now at the next Google
Wallet and Google like you you have some
issues these ones are not good and like
I will don't like some of your things no
and I think this okay that's okay keep
talking about it that might be some that
might be um one of the reasons why they
actually would let you pour androïde
over to your notebook and your tablet
because maybe they're going to give up
on the chrome OS so that would be the
second part of this rumor if that part
of the rumor is true I think it would
mean Chrome OS is going to go the way of
the dodo bird
and android 5.0 is going to be the like
unified system that we were just talking
about that would be across not just
mobile but also computers so and not
just a google computers like just google
it already runs on HTC well then you
could have OS X for Apple you could have
android for whatever and then you can
have microsoft for whatever well yeah
and what this is saying what's weird
about it is it saying you don't have to
buy a computer you not to buy an HP
computer like I have in front of me
that's running Android you can buy a
Windows computer at best buy and then if
you want it to run android you can just
put android 5.0 on it i say that's i
mean i'm sure that the truth that would
not be true of an apple computer that's
what they're saying that if you bought a
Windows 8-based laptop you could turn it
into an Android laptop why would you
want an android laptop that's i don't
i'm not sure i guess if yours if you
could play words with friends on your
big laptop yeah you would do like this
why I think it's so stupid then you'd be
someone who has a computer that's
suffering from the same fragmentation
that my stupid android phone is because
my phone is so old that it isn't even
running Gingerbread because they push
out the Android updates at so many
different times the people are walking
around with so many different versions
of Android that the apt of I spoke to an
appt deliver the other day who literally
had like bags under his eyes when I
asked him if his awesome app was
available for Android and he was like
we've been trying to get it available
because there's like 75 different
versions of Android plus all the skins
yes everything they like to do it we
might be able to get it available for
Gingerbread i'm not sure if we'll have
the time to get a built everything else
karen even then he was like and actually
at this point i might give up and just
have it be only an iOS app because iOS
is so cuz it's so easy and confine yeah
yeah but this is the one thing i want to
say since we have like one minute left
and then i'll be done at five oh okay
our next our next segment doesn't happen
for another five min we started early
sure mom no cuz okay to be here okay we
can take our break and she come in at 30
gotcha okay well what I want to say
really fast is that the thing that I
really think is stupid about this google
but beyond the fact that whatever maybe
you have the right idea that you should
get rid of Chrome OS maybe you should
put android on computers whatever stop
naming your and
versions after dessert I know you think
it's cute I know your engineers think
it's cute I know you guys in the office
think it's adorable and hilarious but i
have to say i write headlines for a
website it's called cnet com when you go
to cnet com those headlines I wrote them
and when you make me write a headline
about ice cream sandwich how stupid this
sounds guys people you can your android
phone can finally get an ice cream
sandwich what yarm don't know less I'm
talking about they have no idea what the
story's about and beyond that even
people who do know what ice cream
sandwiches the worst part is that it's
so long it's so many characters in that
name that I can't fit any other words in
because you know how the internet works
Google your kind of confined like
characters in HTML on a site and so when
you name something Ice Cream Sandwich
you leave me this is why i wrote the
headline Samsung Galaxy Nexus Ice Cream
Sandwich guinea pig which made it on to
read it as one of the dumbest headlines
they'd ever heard and what's funny is
when I read it and I read over that and
I was like that is brilliant Emily you
are a genius with this headliner we all
know cloud surprise really sore the next
day and it was on reddit as headlines
from the future what is this and then
people were like making images of what a
google ice cream sandwich guinea pig
would look like so finally beam is just
as bad jelly bean has just as many long
characters it's just as dumb I mean I'm
just I've decided I'm boycotting your
nicknames I'm just calling it Android
but you know what's what I was just
thinking while you were saying that is
like I don't even know what version I
know that my phone my iphone is running
iOS 5 right or for whatever time I have
five okay so so I know that Blake what
iteration like I don't quite get is ice
cream sandwich for android for interning
me yeah like you almost don't it takes
you a second to know like oh oh and then
gingerbread is Phi wait jelly vision
says I ya know Brett is three right so
it's like you don't even know so if you
were to write a headline android 5.0 is
coming like nobody would know what that
yeah but if you set Android jellybean
then people will be like oh wow android
the second the next one unity I'm now
going to take the exact opposite
dick and I'm gonna go with by the
numbers and I'm gonna hope that our
readers can make that adjustment because
the words are too hard to deal with and
someone in the chat room was saying
Emily can't you just write um android
ICS short for ice cream sandwich and I
do that but people don't know what I ecs
is that's not searchable like what does
that do SEO ter it's terrible it's so
Terry yes you have to who are like
coming to it sina com to buy a printer
but then they see an Android story that
they might otherwise have thought was
interesting but with Nick see android
ICS finally available they're like what
is I see what does that mean yeah and
then exactly and then even with ice
cream sandwich jb android jb justin
bieber android justin bieber I got it
just learn that in scioto Justin Bieber
toothbrush you my in-law you press it
you press a button and it sings one of
two songs while you brush and then it's
like exactly two minutes and that's how
you know how long you're supposed to
brush oh my god I mean it's pretty
genius that sounds like the most
annoying thing in my life I'm gonna
bring it that's gonna be your
humiliation you have to use that in
public brush your teeth in public I can
I couldn't even sing a justin bieber
song to you right now I can't think of a
single I don't know baby I will never
say no you guys really knowing that baby
baby okay I guess I've heard that yeah
exactly all right so shall we take our
break and when we come back from the
break we are going to have our very
first guest in the podcast rumor rumor
has it well and we're talking about some
great other rumors so stay tuned to
stick around she's out there right now
you
alright welcome back from the break we
had the rumor board fell on he will
never see me again that's why that took
so long because she now had the
concussion if she felt my funny bone if
she falls asleep during the thing will
have to wake her up to make sure that
she's still breathing uh-huh anyway it
was I care for you guys for me it wasn't
scary at all cuz that thing weighs as
much as air yeah some but we have our
fur vest guess we would like to welcome
on to our show Madison tutorial Madison
thank you so much for joining us Madison
is joining us to talk about something
that is very dear and near to her heart
and I'm gonna give you a little rundown
about it and then we're gonna interview
her about it because I know almost
nothing and she is here to enlighten us
what this is is a rumor about the canon
5d mark 3 yes oops I said markeesha more
too but whatever um may it finally be
coming after years of waiting and delay
people are very excited about this
camera because it is going to be the
update to the canon 5d mark two which is
and remains at this moment the hyatt the
best DSLR you can buy and it has the
best video it's video so good in fact
that Hollywood has taken note of it and
has shot some TV shows and movies with
it including a movie that's coming out
next week that's called Act of Valor oh
they shot that entirely using the mark
two interesting yes okay I learned out
on Wikipedia ladies into it ya know you
just did take it interesting hardcore
research verified it on IMDb com okay
are we using the inner yeah for
everything since nineteen eighty-five
ninety 2005 so i am not a photographer
and i really can't tell you exactly what
is the most amazing thing about this
camera but what I can tell you is that a
man who's very obsessed with it was on
safari recently in Kenya and while he
was there taking pictures of lions and
zebras and tigers in Bay
years I don't think I actually think
there were no bears there I'm sorry boys
I rest either um he saw that this man
from Japan next to him had this camera
that looked suspiciously like an update
to the canon 5d mark two yes and he
asked him all these questions about it
and the man said yes in fact I actually
work for canon ah yes he very well canon
he didn't say what it was he cuz it cuz
another camera the people were excited
about the 7d right oh there's I'm what
is it well there's a few little ideas
right now but you're kind of confusing
me to be honest because you know it's
like how the 4s came out instead of the
five so who knows you know they're
saying oh maybe it's gonna be the mark
three but it could surprise us and be
like it's gonna be the urea yeah yeah
exactly yes oh great said there were
people who were saying that this one the
one that we have these pictures of from
Kenya doesn't look like the 7d because
it's bigger and it has the buttons
something this is the photograph right
yes that's a photograph yeah yeah I
should have been shooting at that moment
a lion and instead he turned it on to
the command that someone was like oh my
god oh my god oh my god that's so much
bigger than what exactly the whole
photography community probably rose up
and was like that is what he should have
shot anyway I got any photographer that
shoots cannon would have shot in a way
for more excited about that you can
always go see a zebra yeah you can see
go to the zoo but you can't see the mark
3 yet and that's what we're really so
why don't you go ahead and tell us what
is so exciting about the mark 3 okay so
of course it's all rumor at this point
and that's I think what the show though
so it's all rumor and so recently nikon
came out with d800 which I believe will
be revealed in or they already announced
it yeah we had a big story about it
already okay right and now it's going to
come out in late March so canon is kind
of you know like my twin sister oyes but
she would kind of sit back and watch me
and see if I fell and and then went
ahead and sort of you know made her move
yeah so they're kind of being the you
know a little like okay let's just see
how this goes so you know nikon has
released their d800 or they've announced
their d800 and all of its new fancy
features and that thing is going
pack a whopping 36 megapixels which I
doubt canon 5d mark 3 will ever reach
yeah they're saying the rumor about the
Canon demon mark 3 is it only have 20 2
megapixels right thing though isn't that
like now lately I've learned like when
I've been in the market for a camera
that the megapixels like it doesn't even
matter yeah when I get you a certain
point it doesn't ruin ins always trying
to realize that like more about the
sensor than anything right in the
megapixels I mean once you get up there
it's like really I mean are we really
gonna talk right like unless you're
blowing it up the size of leg yeah a
billboard 736 or twenty yeah basically
right if you're shooting you know if
you're just a regular photographer who
let's say does portraiture I tend to
shoot let's say kids it sounds good i
tend to shoot shoot out exactly so if
you're doing that you know unless their
parents are really serious about blowing
that thing up it's not that big of a
deal so I mean the 36 megapixels it
looks good on Nikon's behalf let's be
honest you know there's old people's
love to hear that number yeah so no
let's just go back take it one step back
and talk about why we have you on the
show to talk about this because I want
to tell our viewers Madison sits right
behind me and Kareem oh yeah and she's
so adorable and we're always chatting
with her when we should be doing work
and the other day I had on my computer a
picture of a camera and that's install
it and was like oh my god is that the
canon mark d 5d mark 3 data like i
wanted so i want you to first of all
tell us what you do here at seen it and
or at smart planet and then also tell us
what type of photographer you why are
you what are you so interested in
photography okay so that we know cuz i
think the canon 5d mark 3 seems to me
like it's for professionals like yes but
okay you won't buy it so I see what you
mean okay so I work for ZDNet smart
planet and MoneyWatch originally with
bnet and money watch but you know a few
things happened and now I work for these
through website and I deal with our
bloggers basically so so photography for
me is more of a hobby you know I don't
do photography here and I don't work
with Lori groanin who of course you know
reviews all the cameras and everything
like that so so i'll start by saying
that my job is not photography
necessarily though i do don't tell the
taxman work on the side a little bit as
a photographer
no don't worry sit with us I'm sure to
the tax man is not watching this are you
sure I don't know that for a fact but
we'll find out won't we hang out when
you get out excited God you know so is
all conjecture so I am I tend to you
know I've always been interested in
photography but never quite made that
leap to to actually purchasing a real
camera like a real DSLR I've always had
the handheld's and you know I've owned
an iphone before and um but it's not the
same so I decided get a camera you know
stop sitting there watching other people
with theirs and actually go buy one and
see what it's like so you know start
with an entry level so i started with
entry-level camera and i'm still there
but i bought which I brought today for
ya alrighty night I lovely l-series so
if you if you're not familiar with Canon
this little red ring means that it's
l-series and it's um it's the top level
and it's actually the kit lens to the
canon 5d mark two which is sort of
rumored to be maybe the kit lens of the
mark real that would be wonderful
because then you don't have to buy
another lens so you have an entry-level
camera with a really high-end leg Zack
and so you're getting amazing shots no
matter what yeah and I've kind of been
told that if i upgrade my body it might
not be that big of a deal because I'm
just looking to upgrade the body this
this thing is a wonderful all around
lens and I can see why it is the kit the
kit lens to the 5d mark two um but you
know it's it's it's pretty wonderful but
you know if I'm looking to upgrade I'm
thinking I've been thinking Oh mark to
that sounds good and then when I heard
about this mark three I thought that
sounds good to drive down the price of
marketing yeah what are you shooting
with no right now I'm just shooting a
rebel basically it's a relative
continued digital a video does it take
video I have the one below that that
doesn't take video games okay I should
have splurged and spent another couple
hundred and not the video shooting right
I've never used video on mine oh you
were gonna buy the canon mark too is
that because you would want to shoot
video you know it's not which is funny
because mark two came out and it really
started to cater to video yeah and
everybody really picks up on it was
their first full HD and everybody got
really excited and of course Hollywood
got excited
well which was really exciting if you
get it you need to shoot videos and you
need to shoot videos of me and Kareem oh
I like this humiliation day do you guys
think she just inside bring it back to
us I like this is hurt yourself in sorry
my work and we will use every new
nickname is yes it's shameless and I
love it so hey let's do it let's let's
talk about the fact that it might be
coming next week have your 28 so the
rumors have been going crazy ever since
this camera was spotted in Kenya and
they're saying that it's gonna 22
megapixels 61 point AFS I mean aperture
lot of folk oh thank you our focus oh
shoot we need to happen and 6.9 frames
per second shooting burst speed right um
now what people are saying now is that
it is going to be coming out
dun-da-da-da februari 28 why do they
think that I don't know who are they or
their sources of exciting nobody you
should drink to that yeah they're all
like that drink up I didn't bring my
they make mugs that look like so funny
that you say that because somebody in
the chat room when you help it up
they're like oh is that one of those
bugs yeah yes photojojo makes them
they're like you could actually bring it
with you and sort of that is yes
schedule you're like I am a geeky
photographer and also a drunk and also
great this is my flat I put color in my
coffee in the morning um but so this is
really exciting people are really
excited not just professionals but also
just enthusiasts who love to take
pictures I hope that it does drive the
price of this camera down for you yes um
of the mark 2 and then you can go to the
guy don't we have a cnet is right next
door to a used camera store Madison will
be able to go to Adolf's cameras it
almost on photo gassers gassers we love
it here the worst name on the planet
Earth and you should change it but he'll
be she'll be able to march it over to a
dolts and say not in a German accent ok
Adolf can I please have a deal on the
canon 5d mark two por favor mm-hmm right
I'm so excited for you so we'll find out
we're gonna take a bet after this if
it's going to come on the twenty-eighth
yeah and if so we'll see you running
on the office shooting yes something
every last with the yeah and I tried to
ask Laurie gruene in this morning I've
tried to sneak it in Laurie do you think
it's coming on the twenty-eighth and
Laurie responded by saying actually her
boss responded by saying Laurie is not
on the phone she is sick and if she had
the answer to that Emily she would never
tell you because you have rumor job oh
yeah you know I tried that with Lauren
in two weeks ago and I still haven't
heard anything maybe she knows I think
she may be does know and that's why
she's not saying anything this is my if
there's an NDA on it doesn't want to
yeah in her contacts was is she if she
had no idea she'd just be like i have no
idea haven't heard anything but like the
best that the rumor is that it's coming
next week yes that's pretty big deal ok
Laurie's being shady all right radio
chatter man holding up all right let's
go to our next rumor which is I don't
know much about what and the Kareem does
all right I don't even know much about
it either it's about the xbox 720 which
is the next version of the xbox right
maybe so unless they call it the 360's
which we've seen that that's what
companies do now is that they're going
to get a touch screen remote so this
story comes to us from our friends at
cnet Asia thank you seen at aja fighting
expect another rumor um they write that
the ex that xbox world magazine has
recently published some rather bold
claims about Microsoft's upcoming game
console in its latest issues sources
cited by the publication of course
they're anonymous because nobody knows
anything because this thing nobody
should drink to that I'll drink yeah
please drink to that I don't have time
sources cited by the publication said
that the xbox 720 will support a
souped-up controller which touts an HD
touchscreen now it's going to be this
big so it's going to be HD in a
touchscreen this big right because the
controller can't be it's gonna look
nothing like this right yeah well that's
amore ridiculous that was like it
belongs to Batman's child looks like one
of those things that are just like
standalone games that you buy at toys r
us and they just have all the games in
them already and it costs 2999 and a kid
slobbers on it and eats and it's not a
big deal right it's fine so it'll have a
I am HD touchscreen it'll have analog
sticks and buttons designed is pretty
much similar to the
we you or whatever they decide to call
it that that has a tablet controller the
Microsoft version is said to be the size
it's closer to the PS Vita back to the
today is all about gaming gaming and
things brought online gaming um
according to this a sponsorship game I
love please non-gamers I guess so
according to the Xbox world article the
touch screen controller also doubles as
a TV remote a browser and a panel for
displaying software buttons and game
information like gimme a great browse on
my on my list controller for the xbox I
don't know why you would need I mean I
guess I don't know because you can
already browse on the screen through
your xbox why would you need to do it in
your let's say mom comes in she wants to
watch your favorite show and you don't
want to stop playing your game and you
can sit there in place you can still so
it kind of a handheld game but you have
to stay in your room like the mom is
watching TV and you don't like what
she's watching can you sit next to her
because you're spending time and then go
on facebook that's because it's a
browser the wii u supposed to be like
yeah and the wii u you're supposed
you're supposed to be able to continue
your game on the controller so i get it
and it's touch screen in whatever
whatever but here's the thing about
touch screen first I'm over it let it be
known even though everything I own is a
touchscreen and second the controllers
for me I'm from the Nintendo days of you
know the original intended days of
gaming where the controller was this big
ad for buttons on it and it in a deep
remember the original little Nintendo
and so now the controllers have got you
so complicated they have to trigger
buttons up here and up here two analog
sticks for buttons here a pause and
whatever there's so many buttons that
every time I have to do anything I have
to look down before I have memorized
where the a button is because there's so
many things going on I still don't know
where the RT button is I can just
imagine there's an RT but I don't even
know what the hell yeah to trigger
button I guess I don't know what does
that mean
it allows you to climb up a wall okay so
I've seen that I've watched that in like
Madden it makes you do to pretty no to
me and it it does think it's another
button that you need to use all the time
now if you had a touch screen also I
would look down all I would do would be
would die I would just die all day long
yeah what's the point I've been looking
for a looking for my stylist looking on
a browser in my game with this is for
geniuses because this is like the story
when Beethoven was playing the piano and
okay I might get a wrong am I not have
been Beethoven but I think that it was
when Beethoven was playing the piano in
Mozart was his teacher and he was like
he was a child now I'm playing this he
wrote some music and he gave it to his
teacher to play and Mozart said this is
impossible this what you have written no
one can play this and Beethoven said I
can play it and the music called for the
two hands to be at this end like this
doesn't and then there was a note right
in the middle and his teacher said no
it's impossible and he said I can do it
and he went like that yes no exactly so
that's what's gonna happen a street is
where your nose will be in a game and
why are gonna be so intense that I'm
gonna have to button mash with this hand
move this hand like this and put my face
then move the guy yeah so I mean the PS
Vita has a touch screen on the front and
on the back which allows me yeah even
though that use your toes for it now
it's so it has a touch a touch okay it
wasn't Beethoven and Mozart but it was
Beethoven's teacher yeah I saw that
movie Amadeus I knew that it wasn't beta
good anyway it was a good news a good
track um the screen on the back does
stuff it changes this for augmented
reality exact offended reality that's
and there are some interesting
applications i know that when Jeff
Bakalar reviewed it he's like I'm barely
use this back touchscreen it depends on
the game of course and I just think
touchscreen gaming is so not precise for
anything so that it should stay in the
mobile sphere like yeah it's great for
smartphones that's what it's wonderful
for but don't poured it over to hardcore
gaming which actually loves and uses
buttons yeah that's that's true yeah um
shall we move on to the yay or nay now
that I have come
lately bastardized history and men and
everyone in all of absolutely i'll read
them ready or nay look thats mozart we
think don't say anything about it is
arms alright is HTC working on a

mark 3 come out finally next week what
do you gotta sins dreams come true
magical thinking yes is it possible I
mean I Madison says yes I'm gonna go
with it yes I'm also gonna go with yes
because those pictures look like they're
pictures of an actual camera and maybe
there are some other camera happy that
was the night I want it to be that one
for Madison sake and also because I
think it's awesome that movies can be
shot on it because I think that it's
going to be really great and support the
independent filmmakers of the world who
only have to buy I know it sounds
expensive but like a
five-thousand-dollar camera and then
they can make a movie instead of having
to get millions upon millions of dollars
right all right and finally will the
xbox 720 get a touch screen remote shhh
