landmark 200th episode of the 359
podcast and in the room today is Ben Fox
Rubin Roger Cheng and Alfred Inge how
the hell did we make it this far I don't
know huh really at week wait a minute we
set that on episode 2 though that's true
really gonna get knocked out pretty
quickly I know but here we are still
standing spells driving like the note 7
they are still standing they are
supposed an act yeah well we're not sure
how they'll be spending yet not allowed
each ales there something oh so for the
200th episode not all fanfare we're not
gonna when I can do a recap like we did
with episode 100 it can be all samsung
today no surprise samsung in the
headlines not for the GS 8 actually
confirming that they will actually be
selling refurbished versions of the note
8 or note 7 sorry the note 7 and then
we'll talk a little bit about the GS 8
obviously the launch is wednesday we'll
have more talk about that tomorrow but i
think today we're just going to go
through a sort of quick with wish list
of what we want to see in the GS 8 but
yet nope the notes haven't come back
crazy we've been talking about the note
7 for a long long time I mean we've been
talking about it since before the note
said was around before was even a thing
but well the whole you know scandal with
its phone and its battery I checked
episode 101 we were but we were talking
about the note 7 then says it's 99
episodes later it's a story that keeps
on giving thank you saying are we doing
a podcast today just gonna keep doing
this all right look I couldn't no let's
do the pacquiao no let's keep schmoozing
let's not and what I want to get back to
as always if you have any questions
about the note 7 the GS 8 samsung in
general leave in the comments section
Brian will pick out the best and we will
get to them in three minutes and 59
seconds from exactly 32
welcome to the 359 when we talk about
the top tech news of the day and only
the crap we wanna throw in I'm Roger
Jane Ben Fox Rubin I'm out for dang it's
episode 200 whoo I can't believe we're
still around and hadn't been canceled
yet but we don't anything too special
plan were really just going to devote
this show to one of our favorite topics
Samsung I never thought it would happen
but Samsung confirmed that the note 7 is
making a comeback the company said we
consider offering them up as a
refurbished phone or a rental but offer
a few details on where would that we'd
actually see them this after we
published the story on how the industry
has reacted to Samsung's notes have an
incident and the introduction of its
eight-point battery check samsung wanted
to create this industry standard for
everyone follow and we started digging
around most of the other players are
sort of like man not really this is so
the note 7 News happen literally as we
were coming into the podcast room and I
can't say that I'm pretty surprised like
I thought that they would just let it go
like just kind of give up on the note 7
but I guess they had a bunch that were
lying around and they figured if they
could refurbish them and absolutely
positively say yes these are safe these
are not going to explode then they'll
try to find a way to recoup their losses
I mean I'm not surprised that they're
sending it back out there when I talk to
you know galaxy note 7 owners back when
the original recall happened that we r
we love this phone so much that we don't
care that it's exploding and that has
the potential to cause a house fire
right it's such a good phone that we're
willing to take that risk can you like
imagine having that is your customer fan
base where they don't care about that
because they love that phone back
they've talked to them they said they've
got thousands of people in this this
hand raising program basically folks who
volunteer to sort of keep in touch with
Samsung for like the next update on
their newest phones and these are all
node 7 owners they're all super hardcore
so yeah it's keep in mind though that
they weren't clear that they said
they're going to talk with local
regulatory authorities and local
carriers about the possibility so it may
not be coming to your market yet we
don't really know they kept the details
fairly vague all right lastly we want to
talk about the samsung galaxy s 8 it
launches on Wednesday so we can get all
the details a full blown coverage from
cnet there I just want to do something
fun
sort of go through some of the the wish
list like what you guys want to see in
the GSA I've been wanting to go first so
it would be nice if they got rid of at
least some of the bloatware I know then
they haven't been able to do that in the
past but um you know on on the what is
it the s edge s7 edge that I i I've been
messing around with you've got like the
AT&amp;amp;T folder ya got the same Sun folder
and you've got a google folder it would
be nice if they streamlined in a bit I
know it's it's an easy fix but at the
same time it would make the phone just a
little bit better yeah i mean my my s6
edge has got a you know verizon
messaging app it's good samsung apt it's
got verizon apps then you know just
there's a bunch of stuff that you can't
really get rid of and i'm like it's
unlikely that we'll see less blood we're
just given that they're very cozy with
the carriers and they really want to
load up the phone with as much of their
own stuff as possible mmm okay my wish
is longevity it in the same that's the
biggest thing keeping me away from a
galaxy or any samsung phone in the sense
where every year they come out and this
is going to be the best phone ever right
they've got all these cool new features
and then somehow the next year they come
out with like their next phone which is
bat phone last year I know that was not
that phones awful now and it kind of is
to be honest yeah it's just I would want
a phone that I can keep for at least
like three years I know it doesn't fit
in with the upgrade cycle but yeah no I
agree the longevity is definite question
with some of these devices my wish
wireless charging and before you
interrupt me while charging is already
in the phone what I'm thinking about it
sort of long-distance wireless charging
which we've heard rumors of technology
isn't quite ready yet so I don't plan on
seeing it but the idea that you could
walk in a room your phone starts
charging immediately sort of on my dream
date years ago oh yeah is that anywhere
near happening yes yeah I would say well
probably couple years two years okay
yeah but we're there alright for more on
these stories check us out and seen it
I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox Rubin I'm
Albert Aang thanks for listening alright
so first off in the chat the first
question outside of thank you everybody
for your sweet comments and congratulate
thank you we do really appreciate it
it's been so much fun to be here along
this line so we don't that's something a
little more special plan but we
what better way to celebrate them to
keep the truck rolling there you go the
best question in the chat so far as are
the airlines going to lift the ban great
question I think it's still super vague
as far as white where this is going to
happen when it's going to happen and how
many phones are actually going to get
released so I think that's going to be
coming up yeah I mean I think it's a
it'll definitely there's a long process
involved i think they're going to have
to come back and reassure not just local
regulatory authorities sort of
international toys right so and yes this
is businesses so right it's an airline's
and agencies like the FAA so it's I
think there's a long road ahead of it
but it's exciting that they're actually
gonna bring it back well this is a long
road which is which makes me wonder like
why even bother like we're already into
2007 it's weird because they're just
about to release you know I know it
almost seems what kind of undercut their
their news from this week or I like Oh
ignore that super big awesome flagship
phone we're about to launch right which
by the way has a bigger back it has a
bigger display like the S II that's a
rumor slice is rumored to have a bigger
display than the note 7 yeah so granted
it's not gonna have a stylist but at the
same time I mean if you're looking for
really like like a phablet type of phone
just wait until later this week you'll
find out when you can get it and I think
there's a little bit of ego involved in
that they want to make sure that there's
like no we can salvage this but I mean
if we can see the Nokia bring back the
3310 and everybody celebrate that sure
as hell the galaxy note 7 can come back
flawlessly maybe they've recalled it
twice yeah third recall only three times
yeah yeah but the third recall they
would just have to like shut down the
operations would be like okay we're
getting our ball enjoy yeah we're done
here the entire competition they did
define what the issue was the battery
that's right that's an easy enough thing
to address and they're just slapping
themselves for not addressing it earlier
cuz I mean human error mm-hmm but like I
said if they can mobile human error I've
21 year old phone to fanfare this
shouldn't be a big issue hello you know
that phone a 3310 did have 17 years of
nostalgia building up whereas
note 7 was just like last year so so
you're saying in 17 years and also seven
reissue yeah yeah exactly exactly this
one doesn't explode it took seven ten
years to perfect it but we finally got
it I love this idea yeah it has a 70
year old chip and everything it's
awesome I never play snake it doesn't
even charge wirelessly man who in the
chat is asking what are your thoughts on
the iris scanner for the galaxy SI I
think that's one of the rumors in node 7
office had iris scanner so you know
there's a likelihood that the that will
return for the the essay now that they
kind of know how to kind of lock it in
again we're not really sure yet we'll
get all the details on Wednesday man who
also asks is it true that Samsung is
hoarding the newer Snapdragon 835 for
their newest flagship devices uh
recording it yeah according it might be
the right wrong term i mean i i'm
willing to bet there's some sort of
handshake deal where there they get to
be the first phone out there in the
market with a Snapdragon 835 Sony
already announced their phone their
Xperia premium XYZ whatever time that
one hazardous got one has an 8 35 they
said it will have an a 35 but it comes
out later this year after Samsung so
keep in mind samsung samsung sister
business that the chip business is
building these chips yeah it's
understandable that they would get a you
know a first crack at it right it's a
good thing also for qualcomm i mean like
this is a major major flagship phone so
for them to its it's just as good for
qualcomm as that is for samsung to have
you know the 835 presented i would say
in the essay natasha we kind of touched
on this a little bit ago but why would
anyone buy the seven if they just can
wait for the eight yeah i mean my
question do you know what there are
folks who like that feeling like the
stylus in particular more importantly
let's throw this out to the chat yeah
and find out who in the chat amongst us
would actually go that direction but
continue yeah no I mean I'm assuming at
this point it'll be much much cheaper
there is the stylus which i think is the
main differentiator between the SS line
and the node line
and those are really I mean that's
really good I mean who's a good phone I
mean I'm wondering if Samsung wants to
take it as a budget option now in the
sense of not only we don't know if
anyone actually wants to buy this so
what's our most your teaching
perspective it doesn't really make that
much sense since your note brand is like
you're super high in for the the pro
heavy user and to bring it back as kind
of a budget model seems kind of weird
how budget could it possibly be wasn't
this thing selling for like nine hundred
dollars yes very expensive but yeah but
they're not gonna sell for that yeah
it's not gonna sell mean like but they
probably sell it for like seven hundred
always refurbished package deal boat oh
these are these are all refurbished to
go it no I would say like it mike is
Amit markets that you know that the node
seven couldn't reach before whether it's
like India like emerging markets where
price sensitive sensitivity would have
made the original seven impossible
noches Yahoo's asking does the note 7
have the same configuration or will be
any change like in the UI since the
essay will likely get a UI makeover will
we see that translate onto the s7 we
have no idea there's no closer good
question and what's up yo yeah that's
four thanks for watching ya gotta love
our our consistent audience base
absolutely um oh looks like we're having
sound problems oh great hello hello are
we back sorry everybody I screwed up the
mics undie episode 205 would absolutely
be absolutely 200 if I didn't screw
something up classic um let's keep
moving along guys uh let's speculate
more about what's coming in the sau talk
about the wireless about entering the
room back full circle tell us more about
what your dreams also i mean there's a
company out there that's actually
building this technology out it's a
couple energies it's actually i think a
publicly traded company like it's fairly
legit there are rumors that the well not
rumors they've confirmed that they have
a deal with a large company they
wouldn't say who everyone sort of points
to apple as the rumored partner and that
that bat technology will venture show up
prob won't show up this year but may in
a year to the idea is again like like
Wi-Fi broadcasts internet signal
the air these things will be able to
broadcast power over the air you walk in
a room and immediately starts charging
the only thing is it doesn't charge fast
they call it took a term people like to
use called trickle charging basically
like little bits of power but if you're
if you're basically walking your room if
you're always there your phone's always
there you're just continuously being
topped off I would be really surprised
if an apple was the first to come out
with this because an apple does not come
out with a lot of techno troops for
absolutely absolutely didn't Disneyland
do something similar with this with like
a project and like at one of the resorts
or something like that was a specific
room no in terms of over the air right
now there's no they haven't gotten sec
approval because you need to have an
approval to make sure like the power
that's going through the air doesn't you
know microwave your organs while you're
at it that would be nice that would be
nice so it's supposed to run around the
same spectrum as Wi-Fi which you know is
seifish I guess so I don't know we'll
see the one counter to your arguing
about Apple not using new tech the
original iphone was the first to use
gorilla glass which was new tech okay
fine haha I mean likes your did your
right generally they don't like to adopt
technology ahead of everyone else they
like to make sure that it's sort of
ready to go yeah so once again my
apologies this is all on me something
went wrong with the encoder so sorry
everybody for that dead spot of audio
but we're back yay hanging on wait how
long was that I have no idea as they
been they couldn't get my amazing voice
we may hear my social security number we
do with dad I do read the chat but I was
so backlogged trying to catch up with
all the great questions that I got lost
in it and then I finally realized where
we were and I'm fixing it and yeah
you're probably right we're probably not
gonna get episode 201 after this yeah
yeah we're gonna get episode 201 but
then they'll cancel yes yea yea though
they'll give us with that false hope
nope sorry guys done yeah probably
alright so let's go and celebrate our
200th episode before we call it a day as
we had been calling out for contributors
