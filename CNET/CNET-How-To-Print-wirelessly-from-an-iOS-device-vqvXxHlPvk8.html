your iOS device it makes sense that you
could print from it too well you can
using a feature called airprint when
it's set up you just head to the doc or
the photo that you want to print select
print and just like that I've got my
document on paper it really is this easy
but it does require some setup the first
step is to find out if your printer is
AirPrint compatible Apple has the
complete list of airprint printers on
its support site so browse through that
list to find out if your printer is
AirPrint compatible like this one the
setup is simple start by connecting your
printer to your Wi-Fi network that's
almost always done on the printer itself
I'll choose my network enter the
password and the printer will do the
rest I know it's connected to Wi-Fi
because of this indicator light right
here okay that's done now the next step
is to connect my iPad to the same Wi-Fi
network you might already be connected
but double check just in case as far as
the setup goes we're all done now let me
show you exactly how it works I'll open
up one of my documents tap the action
button which is where you'll almost
always find the print button tap print
and then tap the printer field choose
your printer head back and finally hit
print the phone and the printer will
connect and my doc prints almost
immediately but what if you don't have a
printer that's AirPrint compatible the
good news is that you don't have to go
out and buy a new printer what you need
is a program that tricks your ipad into
thinking your printer is AirPrint
compatible there are a bunch of options
but a couple good ones are handy print
for mac and oprah nor windows with oprah
nay once it's installed any printers i
have set up with a computer will
automatically be airprint ready all
that's left to do is make sure the
computer is connected to the same Wi-Fi
network as the iOS device and of course
that
your printer is on with that setup I'll
just go to my iPad open up a PDF hit the
action button tap print and my printer
appears in the print dialog okay I'll
tap print and my doc will get sent to
the printer just as if it was AirPrint
compatible so now that you know how to
print from your iOS device directly to
your printer it makes printing things
like event tickets photos and docs that
much easier if you have any questions or
tips of your own hit me up on Twitter

written guide to this tutorial for cnet
