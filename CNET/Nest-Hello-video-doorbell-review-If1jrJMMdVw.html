nests 229 dollar hello is a great video
doorbell its slim design makes this
hardwired buzzer easy to install on
narrow door frames and the apps step by
step tutorial makes the process simple
from start to finish out of the box you
get free access to your cameras live
feed from the nest app on your phone as
well as from the web login opt in to
receive push alerts and/or emails
whenever your hello buzzer detects
motion sees a person or hears a loud
sound and when someone rings the
doorbell you get an alert and can chat
with whoever's there using two-way audio
or send one of nests pre-recorded quick
responses like hi there no one can
answer the door right now will be
notified you stopped by the 1600 by 1200
high definition camera has a section in
the app where you can adjust the video
quality whatever your Wi-Fi network is a
little spotty and manually enable the
night vision setting if you don't like
the auto default you can also share
access with friends and family or enable
the home away assist feature so the
hello is tied to your phone's location
and turns on when you leave and off when
you arrive that isn't an automation I
want with a video doorbell because it's
a privacy thing so I didn't turn it on
for this but it's nice to have you can
also schedule when your doorbell is on
or off as well as enable the quiet time
feature which leaves the doorbell on but
turns off the chimes inside your house
all of that stuff comes free of charge
including three our image history of
activity happening in front of your
doorbell but you get even more with
Nest's aware service starting at five
dollars a month with Nesta where you get
access to 24/7 continuous video
recordings facial recognition saved
video clips and motion detection zones I
set up a Google assistant and
we'll nest cam IQ indoor and that
actually acts as another doorbell chime
in your home and if you're paying for us
to wear your hello doorbell can even use
facial recognition to tell your IQ
and/or or Google home speaker who
specifically is at your front door so it
will actually announce who's there
I really like the hello door bow yes
it's expensive yes you do need to pay
the five bucks a month if you want all
of its advanced features like facial
recognition but I think it's worth it
because it worked well on its own as
well as part of the broader nest in
Google smart home
