on today's show what to expect from
billionaire Space Bros Elon Musk and
Jeff Bezos in 2019 and beyond an
amphibious robot with a unique way of
getting around and finally we take a
look at how one company is using
simulations to teach their robot dog new
tricks let's get into it
SpaceX launched 21 Rockets in 2018
that's roughly 20% of all rocket
launches worldwide it's also the only
company to have recovered and reused its
rockets a critical step towards making
space travel more accessible and
affordable so what's next for the
pioneering space corporation even bigger
rockets of course must eventual goal has
long been to help make mankind and
interplanetary species that means
transporting large amounts of people and
machinery to the moon Mars and beyond to
accomplish this SpaceX has been working
on the starship formerly known as the
big Falcon rocket musk said the rocket
will be able to bring 100 metric tons of
cargo to the surface of Mars as long as
it has a chance to refuel in Earth orbit
first a test model of the starship
rocket has been built at the SpaceX
launch site in Boca Chica Texas this
test model will reportedly be used for
vertical takeoff and landing tests in
March of this year the stainless steel
skin is heavier than other rocket
materials but must says it's the right
choice for the starship because of its
resistance to extreme temperatures the
orbital version will be taller with
thicker skin and is aiming to launch in
2020 another major player in the
privatized space race is Jeff Bezos his
Blue Origin the company hasn't launched
anything into orbit yet but its goals
aren't any less ambitious its new
Shepard rocket named after the first
American in space Alan Shepard is a
suborbital tourist vehicle capable of
taking up to six people into space Bezos
said he hopes the first tourist flight
will launch in 2019 though to be fair he
said the same thing about 2018 beyond
that blue origins new Glenn rocket is in
developed
it will be capable of taking 45 metric
tons into low-earth orbit and is
scheduled to launch in 2021 best believe
Andy and I will keep you all posted as
the space race continues heating up in
2019 this amphibious robot sure has a
unique way of getting around it's name
is Vela and it was made by pliant energy
systems funded in part by the US Office
of Naval Research Belloc's can
transition easily from water to land and
can navigate snow ice and sand as well
its undulating fins allow it to swim
crawl jet or slide it can also reverse
easily make quick turns and it's special
fins are gentler on the environment than
propellers it's not the only fin driven
aquatic robot out there
Festo the makers of many different
animal inspired robots release this
video in August of last year it's called
the Bionic fin with the autonomous
swimming robot is beautiful to watch but
it is never shown outside of its tank
and Festo doesn't mention any kind of
amphibious capabilities Belloc seems to
be the more versatile robot for now
developers say Velux could be used for
bringing tow ropes to people who have
fallen through thin ice personal
propulsion for divers or for monitoring
coral reefs this robot dog has been
learning some new tricks the animal
robot made by robotic systems lab was
taught to run 25% faster to run at a
specific speed and to get up after
falling down in a variety of positions
the fall recovery technique that animal
learned was successful for 100 percent
of trials in any fall position these new
skills were learned with the help of
simulations which are faster cheaper and
safer than real-world reinforcement
learning the simulations are 1,000 times
faster than in real time and can
simulate up to 2000 animal robots at
once the best part is that this method
of machine learning is not robot
specific meaning this technique could be
a game-changer for other legged robots
learning to maneuver in our fast-paced
world jump down in the comments and let
