to contributor and today I want to take
a look at how to use the up next feature
on your Apple TV there's actually a
couple different methods or ways of
going about using up next on the Apple
TV and the first is through the iOS
remote app which is updated at the same
time the Apple TV update was released
and iTunes 11 was pushed out so what you
could do when you launch the remote app
you'll you'll notice that it bears a
resemblance to iTunes 11 you're able to
view all of your music and we can go and
add songs to the up next q as you can in
iTunes 11 if you want to add an
individual song you tap and hold on that
song and you could select play next add
2 up next and then you could even view
your up next Q by clicking on the same
button you find in iTunes 11 so that's
pretty straightforward the iOS remote
app doesn't really change a whole lot on
how you use up next especially if you're
familiar with how it works on iTunes 11
so now let's take a look at how to
manage up next on the Apple TV itself
alright so I have the iOS remote app
pulled up here on my iPad and then the
Apple TV running in the background and
I'm gonna go ahead and launch the music
app and then I'm gonna go through and
select just a random artist let's see
here
and start playing this song and you'll
still notice that there's no real up
next feature visible but if you back out
and go all the way back to the very
first music screen there is enough next
option so we can do is tap on that and
you'll see the familiar three line icon
next to the name of the song but it's
not highlighted and traditionally with
Apple that icon indicates you can move
items around so I want to come down here
and move this song to the top of the
list and play it next with the gesture
to the right or on the Apple TV remote
hitting the right button I can then move
the item up this would put it at the top
of the list and allow it to play next
when I'm done I could swipe back to the
left or hit the left arrow on the Apple
TV remote and then go back so anywhere
you see that icon you can swipe over or
hit the right arrow move up and play
that song next so if we want to go and
view not the nut up next queue but view
just a random song and add it to the
list you'll need to press and hold the
Select key on your Apple TV remote and
then you get a menu asking you if you
want to play next add it to the queue
clear the queue and a whole bunch of
different options there so there's a lot
of different methods and ways of going
about managing up next on your Apple TV
