this week we're looking at stabilization
devices so things we can put onto our
pocket camera to help keep those shots
nice and smooth now one of our
challenges in shooting with a smartphone
is that of stability now if I hold off
my iPhone I usually hold it this far
away so I can see the screen and what
happens is my arm acts like a huge lever
so every vibration that goes through my
body gets picked up along my arm and
amplified by the timer gets the camera
which means that that shot is not always
as steady as what it could be
I'm going to start off with if we have
to find a way to fix our smartphone to a
stabilization device now this one here
is called a sidekick it's also named a
glyph where you can slide your iPhone
here into this little cradle keeps it
nice and steady underneath here you have
a little conventional tripod screw there
so you can fix it to a number of
different devices for just a couple of
dollars you can buy one of these online
okay now these come in all different
shapes and sizes but they're essentially
just a fixed arm little tripod they're
great for mounting on table surfaces
they're easy to keep in your pocket on
your bag and they help keep your shots
nice and steady
now all the mini tripods one of my
favorites would have to be this the
gorilla pod these are fantastic and
really versatile because they have these
little flexible legs and they're
rubberized so they grip onto anything
you can wrap them around a tree branch
I've used them on the railings of
staircases and they can hold your camera
nice and steady
another one of my favorite devices is a
thing called a monster pot now these
things are quite flat portable there's
no arms or legs to extend in fact you
take off the back case there so the
special polymer backing on here which
sticks to just about anything it's crazy
on the top here you got a little tripod
screw mount there for your camera and
I've seen these mounted on brick walls
I've seen them even mounted vertically
on a wire fence and it holds if you're
looking for the ultimate and
stabilization devices you probably can
go pass one of these we've all heard of
steady cans well this is a similar kind
of a device they operate on the basic
premises of a handle with a gimbal on
the top and a weighted brace that
redistributes the way to the camera in a
different way so when you go walking
set of stairs you can move your arm
around without it moving the camera shot
itself they're really really good okay
now my ultimate peak for something to
keep in your camera bag is this the
steady pot these things are incredible
extend this out steel cable with a grip
on the bottom that you can put
underneath your foot pull up then you
lock it off this little tripod screw on
the top here is where you attach your
camera and it operates on the basic idea
of tension so you just basically put
this on the ground stand on it and then
you can move this around like so and
keep your shot nice and equidistant
alright so as you can see plenty of
stabilization of ice is no excuse not to
have steady shots for your pocket
filmmaking now before we go I'm going to
leave you with a short inspirational
film to check out called split screen
it's all filmed on a smartphone it's a
love story it's very pretty check it out
now next time we're going to look at
great ways to get fantastic sound out of
your pocket camera so stay tuned see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
