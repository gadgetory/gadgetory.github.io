they're really good at board games I'm
Jeff Bakalar filling in for Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update so a
super computer program by google just
beat world champion Lisa doll at go
which is an ancient and complex board
game Google's bot named alpha go is part
of the company's artificial intelligence
team now the competition took place at
google's deepmind challenge in south
korea where the game has been streamed
more than 3 million times so of course
whenever a computer beats a human at
something the internet seems to freak
out about an imminent takeover but most
experts in the field still reassure us
that while a robot can be really good at
something like playing a game the AI
that would be needed for more complex
things like world domination yeah that's
still mostly science fiction Apple
co-founder Steve Wozniak says that he's
most excited about Amazon's echo the
personal assistant has begun to pick up
a lot of momentum even before the woz
endorsement because of its ease of use
and always listening for Matt you don't
need to pick anything up you just talk
and it works woz believes it'll be the
next big platform for the near future so
some really interesting Twitter data is
suggesting that mining the social
network for key information about the
aftermath of superstorm sandy might have
been more accurate than government
models in assessing the damage in
accurate mapping delayed the region's
recovery by what's estimated at months
and amazingly enough tweets from
residents on the ground have proved to
be more of an accurate geographical
representation for narrowing down the
damage at the south by southwest
conference in austin texas President
Obama was asked about the government's
involvement in the controversial iPhone
security situation while he couldn't
comment on the specific FBI vs apple
case he did talk about the ways in which
we view data and his opinion that we
cannot have an absolutist view on data
as a whole Obama went on to reassure
that there should
be a government overreach when it comes
to privacy but the quickly evolving
world of technology certainly makes that
a tough situation to balance and finally
cross console play may not be such a
far-fetched reality today Microsoft
announced its support for cross-network
play meeting one day Xbox players could
play against PC and PlayStation users
there is a catch though no one has taken
up the offer to allow for cross-play
just yet meaning we may not see
widespread PlayStation and Xbox
compatibility but it's definitely cool
to know that the door has been opened
that'll do it for this tech news update
for everything else head over to
