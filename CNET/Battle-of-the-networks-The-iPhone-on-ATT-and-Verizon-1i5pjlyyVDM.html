with Jessica Thole court-created
performance testing comparing the
Verizon iPhone with the AT&amp;amp;T iPhone
we're gonna break the test into four
parts starting first with a test of the
number of bars in each location and then
moving along to signal strength
including upload and download speeds and
then we'll try uploading a sample photo
to Facebook and loading a sample webpage
we're gonna go to four known
trouble spots in San Francisco starting
first with this scenic garage the first
thing we're gonna do is look at the
number of bars on the signal meter on
the display so it looks like this
Verizon phone has five full bars on it
and that's staying pretty steady and on
the AT&amp;amp;T phone we're going back and
forth between four and five so it's not
current step every few seconds of
switches next we're going to look at the
upload and download speeds and the
signal strength as measured by the route
metrics app we'll wait a couple more
seconds now the AT&amp;amp;T phone actually took
a lot longer to complete the test we're
seeing four bars for the signal strength
the Verizon iPhone as you can see signal
strength is a full five bars and then
the Downloads means received forty kilo
bits per second download speed was 518
kilobits per second upload speed was 149
kilobits per second eighty the upload
speeds 28 kilo bits per second now it's
Facebook time and we're gonna upload
photos to Facebook
horizon got it now it's fun there we go
and now on to our fourth and final test
loading a website we're gonna use Giant
Bomb comm which is a site that stat labs
uses when they test browser load times
and it's the Verizon and the Verizon
keeps missus first still looking at the
AT&amp;amp;T and has a load of the banner but
there comes with press to the photos
and it looks like your AT&amp;amp;T iPhone has
cool bars right now it is just taking
the longer sending 18 she's still going
and just about done and the 18 T is done
we're here at our second stop and
Treasure Island kind of a balmy day well
actually not really it's freezing but
we've got a job to do so we're gonna
start our second round of tests since we
got here the bars on the Verizon iPhone
have been bouncing back and forth
between 4:00 and 5:00 right now it's
holding steady at 5:00 but it will
fluctuate a little bit pretty much the
same story with the AT&amp;amp;T phone has gone
up to five but it doesn't bounce back
and forth on to the second test so a
Verizon was the first to finish we're
still waiting on 80 there we go so here
we've got five bars of signal strength
for Verizon on the AT&amp;amp;T side we have
four bars of signal strength download
speeds or 189 kilo bits per second a
download speed of 440 kilobits per
second upload speed of 66 kilobits per
second and upload speeds are 24 kilo
bits per second
Sun Rise and finish first oh there we go
ATT to take a lot more over that time
ATT wins that time I know this is not an
has been a little stuck there a teensy
actually want this time by 30 seconds or
so now at our third location in San
Francisco's financial district and we're
testing number of bars Verizon iPhone
here full bars full bars on the AT&amp;amp;T
iPhone as well and neither of them is
fluctuated
we're getting good at this synchronizing
thing
Verizon finished first this is not so
much of a trouble spot after all the
Verizon iPhone has five bars of signal
strength and on the AT&amp;amp;T phone we also
have five bars of signal strength
download speed is 651 kilobits per
second we have a download speed of 116
kilo bits per second upload speed 173
kilobits per second and an upload speed
of 55 kilobits per second
Verizon won again on this test followed
shortly after by AT&amp;amp;T but now it is
rising this load at 18 s is still
lagging probably about halfway done and
AT&amp;amp;T is done so followed after a few
seconds
we're here at our final stop it's a
place that I've had a lot of trouble in
the past with all carriers we're at top
of Market Street near Twin Peaks fifth
round test number one the fries and bars
are holding pretty steady at four and
five although I did see the bars drop
down to two and three and on a tee when
we first got here was wine it got up to
three and I spent five pretty steady Oh
Verizon finished first followed shortly
thereafter by AT&amp;amp;T so for Verizon our
test results five bars of signal
strength and on the AT&amp;amp;T side we also
have a signal strength of five bars
download speed 543 kilobits per second
upload speed 174 kilobits per second
upload speed specially more 130 kilobyte
sure the best speeds that the iPhones
had all day on 18 - definitely now in
our third test the photo upload test
well 18c actually beat it by us just
very very short amount time our fourth
and final test page loading so looks
like a cheating is going faster but rice
it's not soap presents done rice and
actually finish first 18 t fall
adjusting second or two behind well we
went to all four locations and the
verizon iphone did win the majority of
the time the only time the AT&amp;amp;T iPhone
won were here on Twin Peaks with the
photo upload test and on Treasure Island
with the browser upload test we're gonna
have a lot more details for you a full
review of the Verizon iPhone plus and
tests for mercy net labs so be sure to
check them out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
