year and YouTube is giving its creators
the opportunity to make content to start
a conversation with voters people often
confuse this facility as a production
only facility my name is Alvarez rebajas
and I'm the head of YouTube space Los
Angeles I like to thank this as a
college campus except without the
crushing debt or finals well this is the
place where people come to learn to
connect and to create it is open for you
to creators it is free of charge
restrictions apply see your local
YouTube space website for details but we
really believe that this is the place
that can supercharge your videos and the
way we do this is to provide the tools
and the guidance that they need be very
creative and very innovative so we have
everything from you know canon c300 to
red's stands lights you name it we have
it along with our BR cameras that we
have on display here ok so how is this
space specifically helping with election
videos the community of YouTube users
and creators are a key member of this
discussion we have more than 50 creators
enrolled in those workshops or to use
the ready-to-use set and the idea is
that those videos are published before
the election youtube doesn't even care
who each creator is voting for it just
wants them to make video and get their
audiences involved let's drop in on me
to one of the creators using the space
today Leo Gomez I'm here creative at
meet you the basic ideas tried to send
super clear messages about why it's
important or to both be on the generic
messaging on have your voice heard and
that kind of thing right we're like
sending a different message to learning
that it's already there and now we're in
a point where we can say okay now it's
time to get together and actually make
something happen let's get jack'd on
democracy everybody I'm excited
America's changing in America looks more
like a multicultural country more than
ever and I see that reflected here I
don't even have a joke there well said
YouTube is facilitating all of these
spaces to allow people to manifest their
ideas is
very important to go out and vote
because if we don't vote then we're not
being a part of the decision and then
how can we complain later on when we
don't participate Twitter being able to
have fun with a space like this and to
talk about the elections i think that's
amazing it literally looks like you Oval
Office I'm it is like look at this I
love the Oval Office yeah I just walked
in there it's amazing i think is it's
fun it's uh it's great i don't even know
they're making profit out of this and i
don't care it's like it's a creative
space for people to come and actually
use it to create content and walk in and
see people from Japan Australia Latin
America the US all over the plains young
people creating and that's that's really
really amazing as really beautiful it's
a wonderful space basically
multicultural youth get together and
register to vote they can actually
change the course of this election so if
you haven't yet registered to vote
because you think your vote doesn't
matter or you can't make a difference
well watch some YouTube videos from
creators that are utilizing this space
and other sound stages around it for the
election spaces program and register to
vote POTUS out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
