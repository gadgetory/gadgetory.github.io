it's launched by Nissan in 2010 in one
camp you have the people that hate it
for its weird looks and then you have
the enthusiasts who recognize the sheer
brilliance of this car I'm one of those
enthusiasts I love this car
now Nissan recognising the fans put the
Juke in the hands of its Nismo tuner
department who gave it more power and
better handling let's take a look at the
2013 Nissan Juke Nismo and check the
tech and it does have some funky looks
it's got these round headlights down
here on these blinker lights that sit up
in their own casings up above the level
of the hood as a mismo you can only get
this car in black red or white and in
either case it's got these red mirror
caps it also has these 18-inch alloy
wheels with this nice finish on it
this is also aerodynamics on the car
that Nissan says gives up 37% more
downforce than a regular Juke that's
going to help you in the corner
he's had a lot of plumbing on this
engine here underneath all this is a 1.6
liter block not very big but it produces
197 horsepower that's 9 more than the
standard Juke even though it's really
the same engine what helps Nissan get
this kind of power out of this thing is
it's got direct injection so the fuel
delivery is a lot more efficient than in
the port injection car also we have a
turbocharger on here the same turbo as
the standard Juke so all that extra
power actually comes from the Nismo
tuner Department shipping the engine
just reprogramming the software to get
more power out of it it also has 184
foot-pounds of torque
now with this small engine you get
pretty good fuel economy too that's 27
miles per gallon city 32 miles per
gallon highway
for the manual version with
all-wheel-drive in the CVT to take two
offs as part of the Nismo package you
get these sports seats here they've got
this pseudo suede on here this kind of
synthetic suede they've got these
bolsters - which are decent they're not
too high that it makes it difficult to
get in the car also we have a manual
transmission in this car that's the
biggest compromise in the Juke Nismo is
that the manual transmission 6-speed
only comes with front-wheel drive Nissan
also offers an all-wheel-drive system
for this car which has torque vectoring
across the rear wheels so it'll give you
a fantastic handling but you can only
get that car the all-wheel drive system
with a continuously variable
transmission now Nissan does an
excellent CVT and they even put this one
in the hands
Department to give it or hopefully give
you extra power make sure it's always in
your power band but I don't know we're
racing around and stuff like that I'm
not sure if a CVT is gonna do it you're
probably going to want the manual but
then you can't get the oil drive it's a
compromise another really cool thing
about the Juke that we also see in this
Duke Nismo is D mode we get this little
panel down here and if I push the
climate button it shows the normal
climate controls the temperature all
that good stuff then I hit D mode and
all the buttons change the screen
changes and you can set it between
normal sport and eco now Sport Nico
might not sound too revolutionary you
see that in a lot of cars but in this
one the sport mode not only changes the
throttle response it also changes the
steering response that's something
Nissan can do because they use electric
power steering in this car so put it in
sport mode it actually sharpens up the
steering as well as the throttle
response it bring in an eco mode
steering stays the same throttle
response is reduced so supposedly you're
not going to use as much gas and the air
conditioning is actually detuned as well
so it won't be quite as powerful but
you'll save more gas that way as well
and the sport mode changing the steering
and the throttle tuning you only see
that in cars like BMWs and Audi's that
cost twice with this Juke cost so that's
a really good value and we also have a
navigation system in this car this is
about an $1100 option and I don't know
I'm I really don't like the system it's
SD card based but even though it's based
on flash memory the maps really refresh
pretty slowly and the screen size is
tiny when you're under route guidance
you get very small graphics telling you
where to turn it would be easy to get
lost if you're in an unfamiliar city
with a lot of junctions does show
traffic and it does try to reroute you
around bad traffic problems so I like
that I would really hesitate to get this
option now the advantage is that when
you plug in an iPod or a USB stick to
this USB port down here then you get the
full music library on the screen for USB
Drive you just get file and folder
arrangement but with an iPod in there
then you get the full artists albums
genres all that good stuff what's really
missing in this car with navigation or
with
is Bluetooth audio streaming now that's
a big feature that Nissan left out in
this car we also have Rockford Fosgate
audio system that's pretty nice it's got
the regular six speakers then we also
have a powered subwoofer and as you'd
expect with Rockford Fosgate there's a
lot of bass response it really pumps
Iko brings down the acceleration to keep
it locked that throttle just doesn't tip
in it takes a while to build up speed
steering stays the same as a normal mode
as far as the throttle goes that fighter
tuning that makes me think that merging
in passing gonna take a while to sport
mode that's where the fun starts
the own experience really tightened up
with that sport tuning mode I like that
a lot
and then the yeah rival becomes a lot
more sensitive this the right quality is
always a little bit crop it's got the
most suspension tuned so you sort of
don't feel that ride on a rough road
it's really gonna make you yeah
you're gonna feel it through the seats
it's not the most comfortable thing but
a dozen a corner green doesn't really
improve its handling the corners keeps
car really flat it makes it really
rotate nicely around the apex it's a bug
car I would think on an autocross track
this thing would be a blast
now let's price out our 2013 Juke Nismo
23 750 delivered now 1170 gets you that
navigation system and the Rockford
Fosgate audio system I would probably go
aftermarket with that stuff because you
don't get a lot of features the sound is
good but you don't get Bluetooth audio
streaming so you can get more features
if you go aftermarket with that stuff 23
750 is about competitive in the hot
hatchback segment you get more power
from a Ford Focus ST but this car is a
lot of fun and I especially like that
tunable steering and throttle control</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
