its launch by Nissan in 2010 in one camp
you have the people that hate it for its
weird looks and then you have the
enthusiasts who recognize the sheer
brilliance of this car I'm one of those
enthusiasts I love this car now Nissan
recognizing the fans put the Juke in the
hands of its nismo tuner Department who
gave it more power and better handling
let's take a look at the 2013 Nissan
Juke Nismo and check the tech the Duke
is a compact SUV and it does have some
funky looks it's got these round
headlights down here on these blinker
lights and sit up in their own casings
up above the level of the hood as
Annie's mo you can only get this car in
black red or white and in either case
it's got these red mirror caps it also
has these 18-inch alloy wheels with this
nice finish on it this is also
aerodynamics on the car that nissan says
gives a thirty-seven percent more
downforce than a regular Duke that's
going to help you in the corner
he's had a lot of plumbing on this
engine here underneath all this is a 1.6
liter block not very big but it produces
197 horsepower that's nine more than the
standard Duke even though it's really
the same engine what helps Nissan get
this kind of power out of this thing is
it's got direct injection so the fuel
delivery is a lot more efficient than an
important injection car also we have a
turbocharger on here the same turbo as
the standard Juke so all that extra
power actually comes from the nismo
tuner department shipping the engine
just reprogramming the software to get
more power out of it it also has 184
foot-pounds of torque now with this
small engine you get pretty good fuel
economy too that's 27 miles per gallon
city 32 miles per gallon highway for the
manual version with all-wheel drive in
the CVT to take two offs as part of the
nismo package you get these sports seats
here they've got this pseudo suede on
here this kind of synthetic suede
they've got these bolsters to which are
decent they're not too high there makes
it difficult to get in the car also we
have a manual transmission in this car
that's the biggest compromise in the
Juke Nismo is that the manual
transmission 6-speed only comes with
front-wheel drive Nissan also offers an
all-wheel drive system for this car
which has torque vectoring across the
rear wheels so it'll give you a
fantastic handling but you can only get
that car the all-wheel drive system with
a continuously variable transmission
Nissan does an excellent CVT and they
even put this one in the hands
department to give it or hopefully give
you extra power make sure it's always in
your power band but I don't know for
racing around and stuff like that i'm
not sure if a CVT is going to do it
you're probably going to want the manual
but then you can't get the whole drive
it's a compromise another really cool
thing about the juke that we also see in
this Duke nismo is d mode we get this
little panel down here and if i push the
climate button it shows the normal
climate controls the temperature all
that good stuff then i hit d mode and
all the buttons change the screen
changes and you can set it between
normal sport and eco now sport niko
might not sound too revolutionary you
see that in a lot of cars but in this
one the sport mode not only changes the
throttle response it also changes the
steering response that's something nice
on can do because they use electric
power steering in this car so put it in
sport mode it actually sharpens up the
steering as well as the throttle
response to bring in an eco mode
steering stays the same throttle
response is reduced so supposedly you're
not going to use as much gas and the air
conditioning is actually detuned as well
so it won't be quite as powerful but
you'll save more gas that way as well
and the sport mode changing the steering
and the throttle tuning you only see
that in cars like BMWs and Audi's that
cost twice with this juke cost so that's
a really good value and we also have a
navigation system in this car this is
about eleven hundred dollar option and I
don't know I'm I really don't like the
system it's SD card-based but even
though it's based on flash memory the
maps really refresh pretty slowly and
the screen size is tiny when you're
under route guidance you get very small
graphics telling you where to turn it be
easy to get lost if you're in an
unfamiliar city with a lot of junctions
does show traffic and it does try to
reroute you around bad traffic problems
so i like that i would really hesitate
to get this option now the advantage is
that when you plug in an ipod or a USB
stick to this USB port down here then
you get the full music library on the
screen for USB Drive you just get file
and folder arrangement but with an iPod
in there then you get the full artist
album genres all that good stuff what's
really missing in this car with
navigation or with that
is Bluetooth audio streaming now that's
a big feature that Nissan left out in
this car we also have rockford fosgate
audio system that's pretty nice it's got
the regular six speakers then we also
have a powered subwoofer and as you'd
expect with rockford fosgate there's a
lot of bass response it really pumps
the burials here I've definitely felt
tighter manuals once it really is
slotted each lot of the gate easier
tighter with a little more a better feel
this one's a little bit loose now if I
put a mini coma of anybody could
maximize that the fuel economy
ecoa brings down the acceleration 2
o'clock that throttle just doesn't tip
in it takes a while to build up speed
steering stays the same as a normal mode
as far as the throttle goes that fighter
tuning that makes me think that merging
passing gonna take a while to build up
speed I put it in that sport mode that's
where the fun starts feel the steering
really tightened up with that sport
tuning Mona like that lot and then the
throttle becomes a lot more sensitive
this the right quality is always a
little bit rock it's got the mismo
suspension tuning so you sort of don't
feel that ride on a rough road it's
really gonna make a
you're going to feel through the seats
it's not the most comfortable thing but
a dozen a corner green does really
improve Italian the corners keeps car
really flat it makes it really rotate
nicely around the 8th experts a fun card
I would think on an autocross track this
thing would be a blast now let's price
out our 2013 Juke Nismo 23 750 delivered
now 1170 gets you that navigation system
and the rockford fosgate audio system I
would probably go aftermarket with that
stuff because you don't get a lot of
features the sound is good but you don't
get bluetooth audio streaming so you can
get more features if you go aftermarket
with that stuff 23 750 is about
competitive in the hot hatchback segment
you get more power from a Ford Focus ST
but this car is a lot of fun and I
especially like that suitable steering
and throttle control</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
