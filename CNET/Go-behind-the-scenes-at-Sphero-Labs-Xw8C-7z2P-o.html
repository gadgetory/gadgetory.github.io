behind connected robots like the bb-8
Lightning McQueen and the Sphero mini
but now the company is in transition
making robots that are more about
creating than just acting as toys like
the new $150 bolts we're at Spheeris
Design Center in Boulder Colorado where
we got an early look at the bolts as it
was being developed and refined it's
also where the company develops and
prototypes new products and mid playful
reminders of their greatest hits so far
spyro's first big product the teachers
and students with spark where kids can
code and learn how to control the robot
from the app and you can start even with
no experience you can just draw lines to
get it to move
you can drag blocks to represent code or
you can actually write the actual code
in a text editor so it's really scalable
from really young kids all the way up to
like University both is more
sophisticated than spark there's an 8x8
LED matrix that can be programmed to
display animations real-time data or
even just play a game of snake if you
have multiple bolts they communicate
with infrared in a game like pac-man for
example the ghost ball automatically
chases the pac-man ball as you drive it
around the room the ball can find
north's like a compass and it's also
waterproof plus the inductive charging
pod gives the battery around 2 hours of
play time so we've kind of we're taking
a swing in the pendulum is what we call
it you're internally um and we go we
don't like to say toys or education
anymore we like to say entertainment and
towards creators so for a while we were
making entertainment devices like BBA
r2d2 you know lightning mcqueen and
spiderman where these they were amazing
products but they weren't as really
focused on being creative they were
focused on interacting with a story but
we weren't a lot about robotics through
that we learned a lot about bringing
things to life we learned a lot about
characters and people's play patterns so
we're really happy with our
entertainment value right so like what
we do entertainment lines we got really
good at that we also realized that the
value for us is like building creators
the people who were use our product to
make something
it takes many moving parts to make a
rolling robots this is the electronics
room where the products start life so
this is all the equipment you actually
need microscopes you know that sounds
crazy 99% of our soldering is under
microscope it solved you know if you
look at these parts on here you're
putting all of these little super tiny
pieces on by hand in this particular
space we built bolt and mini so both of
those like all the way through their
electrical engineering and design were
built engineer this is probably the
worst station for any robot to come upon
this is our electric static testing
station so this is the ESD gun it goes
at like 50,000 volts or something and
you we put robots on this big metal
table and we shock the crap out of them
tree but it's important because you know
the robots go through a lot and you
don't want to to create electric
electricity inside of the ball it was
much worse on like r2d2 cuz yell r2d2
sitting here and like a little metal pad
on him and they're like you know like
a big part of sphero's appeal is how
each robot has a different personality
whether that sounds what do sprinters
eat
expressions all movements Bowles doesn't
have a speaker but it is something that
company's looking at for future rolling
robots we have some cool
samples and prototypes of ways to
vibrate the shell to make it become a
speaker or robot ball that can then talk
to you so oh hi mom like it would just
get amazing but that's probably one that
we're still working on there and Sphero
isn't the only one trying to merge cute
robots with coding credentials there's
the vector and Cosmo BOTS from Anki that
have screens to express emotions plus
integrated microphones and speakers so
you can talk to them but sphere is
aiming much more for the classroom than
the home three two one go the company is
trying to teach us that having fun and
learning isn't mutually exclusive just
to happy I don't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
