stunning 5-inch HD display LTE a monster
quad-core processor and a terrific 13
megapixel camera it's got a ton of other
features besides and all of those
together make this one of the top
smartphones you can get I'm Jessica's
all-court for CNN and the all-plastic
Galaxy s4 it looks a lot like the galaxy
s3 but it has a larger screen and
details that make it look just a little
bit more high-end and runs Android 4.2.2
which is already packed with features
and layers its own TouchWiz interface on
top
get ready for some highlights starting
with settings you see those OneTouch
icons in the notification tray now you
can toggle on and off even more of them
you can even edit their order and make
them appear in the top 5 controls if the
Android gets too overwhelming you can
also turn on the stripped down easy mode
websites games and video all look really
great on the 5 inch 1080p HD AMOLED
display thanks in part to the phone's
1.9 gigahertz quad-core Qualcomm
processor it's AMOLED screen delivers
rich colors and deep blacks but it's
also extremely reflective and harder to
read outside the s4 comes with Gorilla
Glass 3 cover glass and an extra
sensitive screen lets you operate the
device with a cloth covered hand do you
want to control your phone with your
eyes you can sort of new features do let
you scroll the screen up and down when
you tilt it and you can pause and resume
video when you look away from the screen
and look back something called air view
will preview items like an extra browser
tab or a photo in the gallery when you
hover your finger over the screen the s4
s 13 megapixel camera and 1080p HD
camcorder are really great and the 2
megapixel front-facing camera it's not
that bad either of all of these new
settings dual shot is definitely my
favorite it will insert photos or video
using both the front and rear cameras
into the same frame there's also a mode
called drama that arranges an action
sequence all in one shot and an animated
photo mode that moves a portion of the
scene and freezes the rest sound and
shot is one
that adds a nine-second voice caption to
your photo but it only plays back on a
galaxy s4 device now the problem with
all these fancy tools is that you really
have to plan out in advance when you're
gonna use them so I just wound up taking
most of my photo and video in regular
old automatic mode image quality was
really good in outdoor and well-lit
situations and I could even crop photos
that I took from far away without losing
very much detail at all video was also
really crisp here's a neat feature you
can use the s4's IR blaster to control
almost any TV and DVR player after a
quick setup you'll have access to
several remote control interfaces I
actually did use it at home to surf live
TV listings launch Netflix shows and
program my DVR by now you should have a
sense of just how deep the galaxy s4
futures go but here's the thing even if
you never explore them all that is for
is still a really great phone it isn't
as eye-popping as the HTC One but it
does do all the important stuff well and
you can get it from almost any carrier
the galaxy s4 starts at $200 on contract
for the 16 gigabyte model and goes up
from there
so there you have it folks the powerpack
samsung galaxy s4 for even more details
