never quite like this google just
announced a suite of new products
including a brand new phone called the
pixel that takes direct aim at Apple's
iPhone there's also a smart speaker
called Google home which is the first
serious challenger to the Amazon echo
both are stuffed with a voice-activated
digital assistant called simply Google
assistant this nameless female voice
software is Google's main weapon against
Apple and Amazon to rule your pocket and
your living room together with a new
virtual reality headset Wi-Fi router and
chromecast Google is creating a suite of
products that just feel like they belong
together let's start with Google home
it's 130 dollars it comes in 6 colors
and it arrives next month on November
4th sure it plays music and answers
trivia questions like you expect but it
also can control some smart home devices
you can ask it to turn lights on and off
or even pull up a show to watch on
youtube or netflix but you will need a
google chromecast for it to pull up
videos speaking of chromecast Google's
new ultra chromecast is twice the price
of the original cost and about seventy
dollars but with it comes higher
definition 4k video and wider resolution
HDR google wants to be in all corners of
your home with its new Wi-Fi routers
it's not exactly exciting tech but it
does show google seriousness about being
in every facet of keeping you connected
to the world unlike a single router the
idea is that with google you'll have
several of these Wi-Fi routers in the
home to expand coverage they ship in
December and start at one hundred and
twenty dollars but let's go back to that
pixel phone Google's directly targeting
the iphone with this one Google puts its
own touch on the phones design with a
rear glass panel and aluminum casing
like most phones these days it also
comes to two sizes but the big point
with the pixel is the camera it claims
to be the best smartphone camera based
on a ranking by camera testing lab dxo
all pixel owners also get unlimited
online storage for photos and videos at
full resolution charging is another
selling point 15 minutes of charging
will get you seven hours of battery life
but unlike Google's previous Nexus
phones this is pricey it starts at six
hundred and fifty dollars in the u.s.
you're going to have to buy it directly
from
to get it unlocked or buy it through
verizon google is taking pre-orders now
but it arrives October 20th the phone
even has its own virtual reality
accessory the daydream view is a fabric
headset that you pop your phone to the
front to watch vr video it comes out
November and it costs eighty dollars
that's much more than the original $15
google cardboard but hey it's also still
cheaper than samsung hundred-dollar gear
vr that's it for this tech news update
