cnet.com and I'm here with the logitech
wireless bluetooth solar keyboard the
k760 this is the successor to the k750
which was a larger keyboard this one's
smaller and looks very similar to
Apple's wireless bluetooth keyboard but
it is bigger and it does have that strip
of solar panel at the top and that's
designed to recharge the built-in
battery with just any kind of light
source that could be Sun a lamp anything
and that will keep this battery charged
for up to three months in a completely
dark room after you charge it so that's
one of the key features here obviously
you don't have to replace the batteries
in this the other key feature is that it
can switch easily between three
different devices there are three
buttons at the top they'll have that
little bluetooth logo on them and you
can basically pair this with a mac
desktop and ipad and iphone this is
ostensibly designed for Mac products it
does also pair with Windows machines and
Android devices but the keyboard layout
is Mac centric so mostly people who have
apple products will buy this the one
small drawback here is that because this
is a little bit larger keyboard than the
Apple keyboard it isn't one that you
probably carry around with you a lot of
people do like to carry around that
Apple keyboard with them this one's just
a little bit bigger doesn't fit in your
bag as well it's a little bit heavier so
this is really a keyboard that's most
likely to sit in a home or office and
it's really nice if you have multiple
Apple products if you have say an iMac
and a laptop you could switch seamlessly
between the two with this keyboard you
could also switch to an iPad I see less
people using this with the iphone but
really for someone who has an imac say
and an ipad this is really a nice
keyboard and well worth considering i'm
david carr know and that's the logitech
k760 wireless solar keyboard thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
