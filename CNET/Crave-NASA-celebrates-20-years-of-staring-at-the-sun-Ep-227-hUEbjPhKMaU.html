agra nose arm which cnet translated
using google translate is a robotic
looking arm that clamps onto your desk
and gives you a helping hand with rest
on your face and head on your desk while
you work the arm is extendable and the
wrist is adjustable for optimal head and
chin support and the hand is made of a
squishy material that will easily mold
to your facial contours the product
comes to us from the thanko store in
Japan and costs about 40 US dollars
unfortunately for everyone it is
currently sold out because it was such a
popular product an eight second video
clip of a person pushing a can of coke
with a marker has gone viral for obvious
reasons
the video is called coke vaca and
features a can of coke being pushed with
Chewbacca's likeness printed on the side
and I'm guilty of watching it three
times the lamp stir lamp modeled after
classic car design tractor headlights
and superhero confidence has taken
Kickstarter by storm the lamp stir is
simply a lamp with attitude in a few
bells and whistles Lancer is equipped
with two LED light sources that you can
control with either your hands or
smartphone app one lamp is for reading
and the other is an RGB for changing the
mood in your space or for dance party
lighting effects the head is adjustable
and can double as a headphone holder the
Lamster comes in a few different color
options with optional graphic extras and
can be yours for the pledge price of one
hundred and forty-nine dollars on
Kickstarter nASA released a video this
week celebrating the 20th anniversary of
the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory
launch otherwise known as Soho that has
had its 12 sungazing instruments trained
on the centerpiece of our solar system
for many years Soho's brought scientists
and astronomers a wealth of knowledge
about the Sun and the video tries to
showcase some of those discoveries the
video shows the sun's corona as seen
through Soho's coronagraph which blocks
out the brightest light of the Sun in
the video we see small UFO like JJ
Abrams lens flare surrounding the Sun
these are actually the planets orbiting
the Sun over time and because they are
so bright they cause the coronagraph to
view them as flying saucer-like shapes
moving about the Sun make sure you watch
