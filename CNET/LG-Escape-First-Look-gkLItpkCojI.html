editor here at Cena today were to take a
first look at the LG escape for AT&amp;amp;T now
I've long said it saying it that LG has
an image problem and its image problem
is it doesn't really have one it hasn't
had a lot of home run devices here in
the US and it doesn't have a lot of duds
either and this phone is a perfect
example of that it's perfectly
serviceable but it doesn't really offer
anything we haven't seen before and it
doesn't offer anything particularly
special it does have a nice solid feel
in the hand do like the ribbed material
that runs all the way around the edge
there is a 4.3 inch display it is qhd
doesn't have the brightest resolution so
that we've seen so it's not going to
compare with limited the galaxy s3 or
something like that but skipping on the
screen specs does keep the price a
little low it is only forty nine dollars
with a contract which is nice that you
get five home screens I like that the
phone does support Ice Cream Sandwich so
not quite jellybean but at least it gets
ice cream sandwich so all the features
you'd expect from there of course you
could personalize that display with all
the folders and widgets and everything
you need inside you'll find the menu
design just what you'd expect the
feature set is pretty mid-range does
have a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core processor
though it does support AT&amp;amp;T LTE network
so I put it to quite the test yet as how
fast it is but I'm expecting it to be
pretty good on the back you'll see that
there's a camera lens there is no flash
down below the display are the three
standard touch controls on the top
there's a 3.5 millimeter headset jack on
the bottom there's the microUSB port I
do like the placement of both of those
the having the micro USB port on the
bottom means you can use the phone while
it's being charged and then having on
the top means you can't carry it in your
pocket and the headset just comes out of
course there's bluetooth there's going
to be Wi-Fi there's going to be all the
features you'd expect from an Android
phone here on the side there's a volume
rocker I could find it when I was on a
call which is nice and over here is the
power controls all in all a pretty
standard Android device does have all
the features I need does have a dual
core processor does have a droid for
dodo and the LTE support just doesn't go
much beyond that but again the design is
nice it is solid is functional in the
hand so you need a serviceable android
phone for not a lot of money only fifty
dollars to the contract you probably
can't go wrong with the LG escape I'm
Ken Sherman here the first look at the
LG escape
