eleven I'm Wilson Tang on cnet com and
it's time to get loaded you don't need
to be a friend to follow someone on
facebook anymore the social network has
joined the likes of Twitter and Google+
offering a way to subscribe to sew ins
public post without the person friending
you back and you can choose the type of
post you want to get like photos or
status updates the subscribe button will
only show up if the person activates the
subscribed feature you can find a link
to that at the Facebook blog Netflix
expected people to unsubscribe after
raising prices but the drop will be
greater than the company initially
anticipated Netflix predicted its
third-quarter would have nine point
eight million streaming only users down
from the 10 million users it estimated
in July and forecast on DVD only
subscribers dropped also from 3 million
this summer to 2.2 million but for those
who want both streaming and DVDs Netflix
sees those numbers unchanged estimating
12 million users would keep both
services the Vita of the PlayStation
Vita has been revealed get it Vita means
life and at the Tokyo Game Show this
week Sony said the battery life of the
new handheld system will last for three
to five hours of gaming and about five
hours of video playback which is similar
to the Nintendo 3ds that is when the 3d
effects are turned on otherwise the 3ds
last longer 48 hours of gameplay sony
also showed off some accessories for the
video like earbuds cases and cradles but
still no word on a north american launch
date which is sometime next year it will
be available in Japan December 17th get
ready world you're cute kitten videos

editing thanks to a retouching and
editing tool being added to YouTube the
built-in video editor will let users
make a quick fix without having to re
upload a video and has settings to
adjust contrast color trimming the start
and end of the clip and stabilizing
shaky video Jason products are always
hot in the geek world but this one is
literally hot really hot is the name of
the dysons newest gadget a room heater
and much like the air multiplier
bladeless fan this is a bladeless way to
stay toasty reaching up to 99 degrees it
auto turns off in the room has reached
the desired temperature
and also turns off if it tips over it's
retailing for four hundred dollars
that's about a hundred dollars more than
what the Air Multiplier went for when it
first launched and if you think it's all
hot air you're wrong you can blow air
without the heat on if you want those
