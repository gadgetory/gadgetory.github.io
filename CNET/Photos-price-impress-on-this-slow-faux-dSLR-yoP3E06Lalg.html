sony alpha a 3000 the a 3000 also known
as the ILC ii 3000 it's sony's attempt
to hit the $400 sweet spot of pricing
for a kit with the 18 to 55 millimeter
lens in a camera that seemingly has
everything that people stepping up from
a point-and-shoot would want it's
basically a mirrorless
interchangeable-lens model for point the
shooters who want to fool people and
possibly themselves into thinking it's a
DSLR but while it produces really good
photos for the money it doesn't deliver
on the other aspects of DSLR shooting
most notably performance that you can
get for just a little more money on a
real DSLR like the canon SL 1 the a 3000
is lighter and more compact than a
typical SLR it's a good size for your
dainty lady hands though the grip is
better designed than the SL ones to
accommodate big old man hands as well
sony achieved the small size by using
the mirrorless innards of the NEX series
and that lines amount lenses it's not a
particularly attractive camera but it's
functional if clunky you have to delve
into the annoying menus for most options
though it offers some higher-end
features like a hot shoe and an
electronic viewfinder the viewfinder is
small course and has poor color accuracy
the 2.7 inch LCD is cheap extremely low
resolution and really difficult to see
in direct sunlight if you're even a
little off angle the one nice aspect of
the design is the location of the SD
card slot intelligently placed on the
left side instead of inside the battery
compartment the performance drives home
that this isn't a DSLR or even a
mid-range ILC the autofocus is pretty
sluggish and it's burst shooting tops
out at about 2.6 frames per second
neither of which is really sufficient
for photographing active kids or pets if
you want anything more reliable than
just the occasional happy accident but
the image quality is definitely better
than almost anything you'll find for
less than $400 unsurprising since
warts-and-all it still incorporates
sony's excellent 20.1 megapixel Exmor HD
sensor and solid JPEG process
you can usually get nice photos as high
as ISO 800 and in some cases as high as
ISS 1600 the video is pretty good as
well it is the same artifacts I see
elsewhere most noticeably jaggies on
edges but I see those problems and far
more expensive cameras to the a 30,000
supports full manual controls and video
mode plus manual focus peaking and
doesn't force you into specific movie
mode to use them there's also a built-in
stereo microphone which is rare in this
price class on the other hand it's
limited to 60 I or 24p for real HD video
that's about it for the interesting
features though it's pretty no-frills
with the most basic effects options the
a 3000 feels like a camera intended to
be a transitional buy a step-up in image
quality but designed to make you yearn
for faster performance and another
camera so just jump up directly to
something else instead I'm Laurie
grinning and this is the sony alpha a
3000</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
