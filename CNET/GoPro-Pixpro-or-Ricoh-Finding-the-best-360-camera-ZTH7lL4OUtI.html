view of the world but with so many
options out there it's hard to know what
you need we're going to break it down
for you to help you decide which 360 cam
is right for you let's take a look at
three different levels in the beginner
category we have the Ricoh theta s it's
two lenses built into one-piece shoots
in full HD is very portable and pretty
much ready to use out of the box all for
about three hundred and fifty dollars
others in this category Samsung's gear
360 and the LG 360 cam at the prosumer
level we have the kodak pixpro SP 360
dual pack to wide-angle cameras mounted
back-to-back that shoot in 4k higher
resolution but at a higher price $900
for the whole setup now if you really
want to spend some money this DIY rig
could be what you're looking for this
freedom 360 cage holds six gopro hero4 s
it's shooting up to 4k the whole package
will run you about $3,000 or just wait
for GoPros Omni which syncs all the
cameras automatically and will set you
back about five thousand dollars
the beauty of the theta no assembly
required all the components are built in
including the battery and storage choose
between photo and video and just point
and shoot with the capture button it
stitches the 360 image on the fly so
it's the only one that actually lets you
preview your shot using the phone as
your viewfinder with the pics Pro you
have two cameras two batteries and two
SD cards to worry about you can pair the
cameras to start recording at once or
press each capture button individually
make sure the object is facing one of
the lenses head-on because you can't
really see what you're shooting now will
supply that by 3 for the GoPros 6
cameras 6 batteries and 6 SD cards our
rig requires that you remember to press
the power and record button on each one
also with 6 cameras you're really going
to have to pay attention to that stitch
line which is that point at which they
all meet unless you want to end up with
your body sliced in two and you won't
know this until after the fact because
in the field there's no way of
monitoring this the theta does all the
work for you so just sync the videos on
to your phone or upload your videos to a
computer via USB and you own a 360
player you can share directly to
Facebook right from the app and
eventually even livestream you'll need
your computer for the pics Pro download
the free stitching software from Kodak
for Mac or PC and import your videos
from each SD card the program will sync
the videos automatically using the audio
as a base but the stitch is far from
perfect and you don't have as much
control over the Edit the GoPro also
needs a computer but it uses advanced
stitching software from a company called
color the downside you have to sync each
of the six clips manually the advantage
you'll have way more control and the
quality of the stitch will really depend
on your color skills
let's take a look at our 360 videos the
theta is good enough to share on social
media and looks great on a phone screen
with a near-perfect stitch but once you
view it in headset mode or in a larger
screen the lower resolution really takes
its toll and you can start to make out
the pixels the pix pro is a huge leap
forward in terms of picture quality it's
the sharpest and most vibrant of the
bunch when you're looking at it head on
but the image begins to deteriorate
around the edges as you move through the
space and you'll notice things magically
disappear right around the stitch line
the GoPro footage looks muted in
comparison with less contrast and color
saturation but the quality is consistent
overall the image is generally in focus
no matter what angle you're facing and
the stitch can be refined manually if
it's distorting the subject
no matter which one you're looking at be
ready to sacrifice quality when
uploading the services like Facebook and
YouTube 360 which compress the files so
make sure you're viewing at max quality
during playback
at the end of the day it comes down to
what you're willing to put up with in
terms of quality convenience and most
importantly price</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
