all powered by USB cords you either plug
them into your computer or into an AC
adapter and into your wall but what if
you could skip all of that and plug your
USB cord directly into your wall socket
I'm Sharon Vaknin for CNET with a
tutorial on replacing your
twentieth-century wall receptacle with a
wall socket that includes two USB ports
to get this done you'll need the Vieux
socket you can buy it online at places
like Amazon for about 30 bucks
you'll also need a screwdriver and about
twenty to thirty minutes of your time
now once you've decided where to install
the u socket make sure the power to that
receptacle is turned off the process for
doing this will vary depending on your
house but usually it involves flipping a
switch now we've turned off the power to
this AC receptacle but to make sure it's
definitely off you can either use one of
those voltage testers or just plug in a
lamp you know works for sure and if it
doesn't turn on you're good to go
to get started remove the faceplate then
unscrew the mounting bracket and pull it
out so that it's insides are exposed
before we disconnect anything let's take
a look at how the wires are connected in
a normal unit three wires will be
connected to the receptacle the black or
red wire is the hot or live wire which
carries the electrical current then
there's the white or silver neutral wire
and the green ground wire without
Anatomy out of the way we can start
disconnecting wires grab your
screwdriver and unscrew the terminal
screws so that they're loose enough to
let the wires loose do this for all
three wires
now grab the you socket and connect the
wires to their respective terminals I've
already done the green and the white and
finally let's tighten up the red screw
once the wires are set put the unit back
in the wall tighten the screws on the
mount on the top and the bottom now is
the time to turn the power back on and
the first thing to check is this
indicator light if it's glowing red that
means you're live and neutral wires are
switched so you need to turn the power
back off and switch those wires since
ours isn't on I'm going to put the
faceplate back on and secure it with
this screw in the middle here now that
we're all set let's take it for a spin
I'll plug in my phone and it's charging
here with plenty of room for my other
gadgets and appliances
besides convenience the you socket is
also energy efficient so you might save
some money in the long run if you have
any questions or want to show me a
picture of your installations and send
me a photo on Twitter and say hello to
me on Facebook for cnet.com I'm Sharon
Vaknin
