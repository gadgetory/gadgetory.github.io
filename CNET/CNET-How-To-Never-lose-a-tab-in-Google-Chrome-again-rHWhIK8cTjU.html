up in research to buy something you keep
opening tabs in a Wikipedia rabbit hole
before you know it you've got so many
tabs open at Google Chrome that you
can't find anything here's how you never
lose a tab again in Google Chrome you my
friend need a tab manager extension I'm
going to show you a couple because
different people have different tastes
first up is tab man tabs manager go to
the Google Chrome Web Store search for
tab man then install it tab man has this
superhero looking icon almost like tab
man was an anagram for something this is
a mystery for a smarter person to solve
any way you can click tab man or use the
keyboard shortcut alt + Z to invoke tab
man you'll see a drop-down of all the
tabs and you can start typing to search
for your inbox or whatever you're
looking for tab man only searches in the
window you've got open if you've got two
windows with lots of tabs you'll have to
switch windows to find a tab elsewhere
second let's take a look at the tab
manager called tab manager I wonder what
it does after you install it you'll see
little dots next to your address bar
clicking it shows you the icons for each
site you have open tabs and other
windows are also visible if the icon
look isn't working out for you you can
click the change the layout button and
get full lists you can shift click on
icons to do actions like pinned tabs or
close them there's even a search on the
bottom lastly there's too many tabs this
is a much more visual way of tab
management the icon next to the address
bar features a little icon but let you
know how many tabs you've got open at
the time when you click it you'll see
many versions of your tabs with a full
title visible this is search in sort
functionality as well by default too
many tabs only shows you tabs in the
window you're working in you can change
that in the options menu oh one more
thing I'm guilty of opening up many
windows minimizing them are moving them
to many different desktops so one more
tool that is indispensable when it comes
to never losing a tab is an extension
called merge windows clicking the merge
windows button will combine every open
window of chrome into one megazord of a
thing there you go how to never lose a
tab in google chrome for more how to's
