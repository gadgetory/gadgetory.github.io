use cameras for side mirrors but those
have only been on Auto Show floors but
now BMW is showing us a side view camera
system on the road here demonstrated in
a BMW i8 at CES we're driving down the
Las Vegas Boulevard and I've got four
cameras in this car two on side skrutz
where your normal side view mirrors
would be and two on the rear glass now
the input from those cameras is showing
up on a display where your normal
rear-view mirror would be this display
is a little bit taller than a standard
rear view mirror but it gives a nice
wide image and it shows me everything
that's behind me and to either side and
instead of just single images from each
camera they've actually fused the image
to one display this actually looks like
the imagery from a single camera and
it's showing everything that's behind me
it's actually a really beautiful view
and a really clear view to and beyond
the single fused rear view image we also
have smart cameras here so we have a
display that gives me a blind spot
warning if there's a car on my left or
right this warns me if they're there by
flashing red on either side letting me
know if it's safe to change lanes or not
and another advantage of the system is
that the cameras on the sides of the car
are actually slimmer than you'd get with
a normal side view mirror so that makes
better aerodynamics longer range in a
car and it even reduces some of the
noise in the cabin from wind now this
system is a concept right now but BMW is
testing this with some intent to
production there's no dates yet but
they're gonna be testing this in Europe
in 2016 in the US and 2017 and looking
at putting this system in worldwide cars
now driving with the system around Las
Vegas I've had to make some mental
adjustments to how I normally Drive
looking to the center instead of the
side mirrors to see what's - either side
of me but it works really well I'm
really impressed and it'll be good to
see the system on the road I think it'll
improve safety quite a bit
