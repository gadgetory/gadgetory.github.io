brand new watch that we're launching and
it's kind of an evolution of the current
pebble pebble is as you know is a smart
watch it talks to iphone and android
smartphones it brings notifications like
email caller ID Facebook Twitter all of
that to your wrist and then it opens up
your wrist to apps so we've also
launched the pebble appstore which
enables people to find you know
thousands of apps that are available for
pebble and put them onto your wrist cool
and this is um a surf report from spit
cast calm we also made it smaller in
pretty much all dimensions it's thinner
it's it's tighter we also improved the
buttons we improve the strap we improved
pretty much everything about the
physical hardware it's the same core
pebble inside so it's it supports pebble
OS to it supports the pebble appstore so
even though it's metal and and looks a
little bit more like a classic classic
watch it's still water resistant metal
definitely poses some challenges when it
comes to wireless connectivity can you
tell me about how you maintain the
connectivity to your smartphone this
steel ring over the top of the watch is
actually our antenna it's separated by a
bit of plastic from the main housing but
we're able to actually send a signal up
from the circuit board to the ring on
the top of the watch that radiates the
signal out so I'm here and then you
could look at the watch and see see me
as well the possibility of putting
something a little bit more classy on
your wrist while still getting access to
all your notifications all your apps
that you've that you've come to love
presumably classier means costlier as
well yes pebble pebble steel starts at
one 249 okay so 100 hours more than the
current pebble yeah if we did our work
well if we designed our product well it
measures into your everyday life and
just becomes part of your routine
without having to actually change your
routine so water resistance long battery
life ease of charging how do you see a
watch like the galaxy gear comparing to
either the new steel or even the current
level I think you'll see more and more
competitors on the market this year last
year this year but they're all kind of
it's interesting they're all kind of
avoiding the fact that this is a very
personal device a watch
your wrist has to work well it has to
mesh well with the devices that you
already use instead of trying to replace
your phone like that's definitely not
kind of what we're going for we're
looking at ways that your watch can
become extraordinarily useful during
your everyday life our emphasis in 2014
will be very much centered around the
pebble appstore so anywhere from sort of
utility weather notifications traffic
sort of the business of everyday life
right on your wrist to sports and
fitness to a Philips hue app where you
can actually control internet-connected
lights around your house right from your
wrist this is pedal it runs a lot of
cool and useful apps did you have any
thought that it would possibly go as
high as it did become the world's
largest most successful Kickstarter no I
mean when it did I felt it was felt
amazing and felt like we had we had
really captured the imagination of sixty
nine thousand people around the world
but we also knew we had a we had a lot
of work to do and we had to deliver on
the promise and deliver on the design
that we had that we had put out into the
crowd any advice for budding
entrepreneurs who are hoping to launch
their own hardware products that one of
the best things I ever read was this
blog post by Paul Buchheit who's one of
our investors and also the creator of
gmail he he recommended when you're
creating a new product to always have
three three things that the product does
very well don't worry about everything
the entire sort of like universe of
things that your product can help with
focus on three things that make your
users life's better or easier or more
more useful in some way we talked about
notifications sports and fitness and
customizability that was it that was
kind of like the entire pitch on the
launch of the original pebble there was
a lot of controversy and a lot of hurt
feelings win that was available in best
buy before some of the early backward
still hadn't received their devices the
way that manufacturing works is we
actually had to order batches of each
color kind of at the same at the same
time so we had a lot of stock of blacks
and we actually started shipping those
two people who had pre-ordered on our
website those are the first people to
get blacks right up
our Kickstarter through our Kickstarter
backers so we controlled the spread of
it but we also decided to enter into a
retail agreement with best buy and
around june or july 20 2013 and I
wouldn't say that yeah and i think that
the process was a little bit sooner than
a lot of people had expected but it was
very important to us to spread to spread
pebble out there you can feel incoming
calls when your hands are full we're
glance down at text messages when your
phone is away I kind of subscribe to the
school of thought that if you keep
working on what you love and what you
want to build will be successful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
