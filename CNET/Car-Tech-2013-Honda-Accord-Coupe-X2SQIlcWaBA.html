oxymoron there I mean you're saying
you've got the sporty version of one of
America's most white-bread everyday cars
let's find out if there's really
something pulling two directions here as
we drive the 2013 Honda Accord Coupe EXL
v6 with navigation in other words top of
the line and check the deck I wouldn't
blame you for saying it's just a sedan
Accord with two doors removing some
sheet metal stuck where they used to be
but not true this car is actually a
little over two inches shorter from nose
to butt and has two fewer inches between
the wheels the wheelbase that's some
pretty substantial difference from the
sedan so this is a car that's actually a
different platform in many ways and most
importantly it looks hot there's no
denying that
the first day I'm struck buying the
Accord Coupe is two things right off the
bat you often ask about first of all how
is the Headroom
I'm about six-two and I can go solo in
this seat that I feel too far from the
ceiling so good news for you tall folks
now looking at the trim you probably
also notice that you have double vision
you're not hungover this is the new
Honda Acura thing dual screens that
sometimes complement each other
sometimes they go different directions
like right now I've got nav on the top
media on the bottom that's great but
other times it gets real wonky like when
you want to go enter a destination you
get this weirdness I've got two entry
screens and that makes no sense to me
check out our review on the Acura RLX
which is their new flagship and of
course uses a very similar system to get
a real deep dive on where this works and
doesn't let's get there some media
sources now and you go to the audio
screen over here and by the way I hate
that stupid little interstitial screen
that shows everything just weird to me
here's a nice display of the AHA music
service this is being done through
something called the Honda link app once
you install Honda link AHA is wired into
there and you get a really nice stream
from the internet hand it off to the
head unit experience from your
smartphone
now because we have navigation that by
the way is an up trim option it's a
different level of the car that also
brings you 16 gigabytes of hard drive
storage you see that when I go through
the sources here and of course you also
see Pandora is in there USB and aux are
down here supporting iPod as Honda has
done rather nicely and the music on the
hard drive or on your iPod is available
by voice command for artists or titles
you can actually talk to the music
collections on those two devices over
here on the left you can see these guys
here there's an economy button that kind
of dampens the behavior of the vehicle
obviously we've got a manual
transmission we'll talk about in a
minute so it does not affect shift
profiles and down here is the lane
departure warning button we have lane
departure warning on this car but it's
passive all that does is tell you you're
drifting it doesn't correct it same
thing goes for forward collision warning
FCW will flash this guy right up there a
series of yellow LEDs it will blink
right up inside the windshield if you're
about to rear-end somebody last thing I
want to show you is this little button
here on the turn signal stalk if you
push that
or if while you're driving you execute a
right turn signal you get this
interesting view in the screen which is
looking out of a camera on my outboard
right hand side mirror this is pretty
unusual now up here in the engine room
you've got the three and a half liter v6
now that's the premium engine on the
Accord whether it's cooper sedan most up
we're going to ship with a four but this
is a nice motor
it says earth dreams here on the front
that's nice I'm happy for them we really
got here is a pretty conventional but
damn nice v6 it does not have direct
injection though Honda's fours do now
the numbers are good though 278
horsepower 256 foot-pounds of torque
it's this roughly thirty four hundred
pound of cord up to sixty and a
sprightly 5.6 seconds front wheel drive
only there's no all wheel drive version
on this guy now the mtg's know a thing
of beauty was the manual 1828 not bad
big improvement with the automatic you
get to 21 32 so you shave quite a few
mpg off gig over the 16 but the
six-speed is really cool by the way if
you get the six-speed you also give up
active cylinder management in the
automatic this car can run on its newest
green cylinders when you're loafing for
that better fuel economy but with a
manual that can't communicate with a
transmission enough to know when it
should do that as a result it doesn't do
that you're always running on all six
that's part of why this guy's going
through
the first thing you notice in this
Accord Coupe is that the powertrain is
really direct this is not what you
expect from an accord you expect it to
be kind of a driving appliance this is
actually more or less a road machine
first of all that v6 has good numbers on
paper but more importantly great
responsiveness on the road it's a right
now engine it doesn't stop and think
when you tell it to start to spin now
front-wheel drive only as I mentioned
the car handles very well it's not a
street fighter it's more refined than
that but it's absolutely no problem to
toss on a little corkscrew road like
this and it feels great it's very good
ride quality all the time which you
don't always get from a car that has a
really gutsy chassis and suspension of
course being Honda it can't help itself
but have a giant speedo and a little
tack that kind of lets the air out of
the performance balloon in terms of the
ergonomics but you can live with him
great gearbox nice clutch is the real
drivable car that feels very much like
it was built around this transmission
not sort of had that added on as another
option this is going to turn out to be
one of the sleeper hits of the year in
my book I'm pretty sure that even though
we're only mid 2013 right now because
it's a nice balance of being a refined
car that can also give you a grin on the
open road it's very much got a little
bit town and country built into it I
didn't expect that coming into it I
didn't expect a sharp powertrain a great
manual gearbox refined ride and at the
same time sporting feedback coming back
to me all wrapped up in what I think's a
pretty hot looking car so Honda good
work
okay an accord v6 coupe EXL not with nav
yet it's 31 one delivered the navigation
package is 2 grand more get you the nav
voice command for it FM based traffic so
no need for satellite radio if you don't
want it and it also goes in that 16
gigabyte hard drive space that you'll
probably never use on top of that you
can get backup sensors for 520 bucks to
augment that otherwise very good camera
and that's about it when it comes to
going CNET style so all in here and
about 33 6 now bottom line the Accord is
a very grown-up kind of sporty coupe one
of the most direct competitors would be
the Hyundai Genesis Coupe but that's a
whole different age demographic to be
honest this guy doesn't sell at all
compared to their sedate I mean it does
okay but why they make it not entirely
sure it's not different enough to be a
halo car doesn't sell enough in volume
to be a major business success but I'm
still glad they do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
