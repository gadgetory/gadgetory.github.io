Prius which it hates has outsold every
other hybrid in the world combined
Ford thinks that they've got the
antidotes let's drive the 2013 see Max
SEL hybrid and check the tech now the
first thing anybody asked me about the
c-max is what is it they hear it's a
Prius killer for its kind of imposing it
that way well it's it's somewhere
between a Prius and the bigger Prius V
in a number of different metrics to
begin with this car can be had as a
hybrid or a plug-in hybrid like a Prius
we have the standard hybrid today by the
way it delivers mpg smack in between a
Prius and a V it cost about $900 more
than the cheapest Prius it's shorter
than that car but has more passenger
volume than the big Prius V it also has
more front and rear legroom than either
Prius or Prius V it's the tallest by the
way you can be spotted that already it's
also the heaviest by at least 333 pounds
now inside a c-max first thing you
notice is nice Headroom because it's so
damn tall you get the benefits inside
we've got the panoramic roof over my
head it's optional by the way all a cart
dashboard is very affiliate I've told
you before I have an issue with the
Darth Vader mask up here because all
these eyebrows and cheek things here get
in the way of me touching the screen
now we have all the bells and whistles
in this guy because we have a high trim
car and pretty much all the tech options
as a result communications navigation if
I poke the lower left corner down here
if I can get my hand in there you see
our media choices and they are many in
this car obviously you've got am/fm we
have HD radio as part of an optional
trim up the USB jack there's two of
those and you can use those of course
for sticks or iPods here's my droid
phone on bluetooth streaming and of
course audio/video inputs meta tag
information is shown nice and big good
use of the real estate that's very
important for Bluetooth streaming
because you want to know where you are
what you're playing unfortunately
doesn't pull the tags all the time but
it's got lots of real estate when it
says unknown now because this car is a
hybrid we've got some fairly advanced
efficiency gauges here on the left to
show not just the usual fuel economy but
all kinds of things about charge assist
regeneration charge level things you'd
expect which Toyota tends to make much
more front-and-center kind of always up
on that big centre display but in this
car there tucked away and you can really
reduce them down and everything else in
here looks like a Ford not some
different line of car other indicators
and unlike a Prius there's no easy mode
button or B selector on the shifter
nothing to make you doubt you know how
to drive it instead you just put the
thing in Drive and drive it now you do
have a rocker switch here on the side of
the shifter which would typically be an
overdrive lock out in this car it turns
on this little icon that shows dissent
and what that really makes you think is
oh that's gonna go for the kind of a
descending grade gear but that's not
really what it's doing it's going into
higher regeneration mode like Toyota's B
position but it's masquerading it as
something that most drivers will
understand now we have package 303 a
cryptic yes but remember that number
because that brings in all the toys
without any screwing around which means
the navigation with voice and traffic
and weather so nice and instead of base
audio HD radio with iTunes tagging you
might
the former you'll never use the ladder a
power lift gate with that hands-free
technology waggle your foot and the gate
comes up rear camera front sensors and
self-parking which you enable with this
button right here just turn that guy on
follow the prompts let it do the
steering and you're gonna be parking
like an ace people will think you know
how to drive the powertrain of the c-max
hybrid starts off with a 2 liter
atkinson cycle lean-burn gas engine
that's how all hybrids begin sit
sidesaddle drives the front wheels only
through a one choice only CVT gearbox
now 141 horsepower by itself but it
doesn't run by itself it's got the
electric motor attached to it that gets
the horses up to one hundred and eighty
eight and a commensurate bump in torque
as well we're also looking at a car that
weighs 3600 pounds here folks hundreds
more than a Prius or Prius V therefore
the zero to sixty of eight point one
it's fine
the mpg is a little lower than a Prius
forty seven forty seven on this c-max
we're also talking about a car here
that's going to have perhaps better
crash worthiness because it's got more
weight there been studies lately that
indicate the additional weight of
hybrids has made them safer certainly in
terms of serious accidents fatalities
and injuries and this car may have a
little more of an edge that way
consider that anecdotal more than
documented but it's an interesting trend
we're watching also this car uses
lithium ion batteries the Prius line
still uses the somewhat old your nickel
metal hydride formulation let's go for a
ride okay let's drive our little blue
friend this is the same color as one of
those blue Slurpees what flavor is that
blue anyway the car is um it's actually
very Prius like in its feel in terms of
how heavy it feels how springy it feels
how responsive things of that nature
you're always aware of the great degree
of space in this car much like a Prius V
it feels very airy and roomy it feel
like a people mover to me more than a
car these cars began in Europe by the
way the c-max started selling in Europe
in 2003 where they go in for more kind
of practical compact utility vehicles
more than we do or at least earlier than
we do and that's why this car has the
DNA it has now this car is reporting an
almost 39 mpg over most of our testing
remember the targets are 47 according to
EPA we're doing our testing here in San
Francisco where you don't go anywhere
without encountering a hill for the most
part so I'm gonna spot it a few miles
per gallon it means it's doing pretty
well pretty close to estimates the last
thing I'll say is this CVT transmission
your only choice it feels like a CVT
it's got a degree of kind of vagueness
and wandering to it it feels a little
disconnected nothing wrong with it
that's just the way CV tees tend to be
and this one is among those that tends
to be that way as much as any other that
means that the performance is what its
modulated as opposed to really giving
you a kick when you step one which is a
little bit disappointed because hybrids
have the ability to have really great
snap because that electric torque can
come in this one mutes that out in
favour unsure of efficiency
okay let's price the c-max hybrid SEL
CNET style starts off a tick below 29
grand delivered then go right to the top
and just check off package 303 a it
rolls in pretty much all the tech toys I
showed you it's a good value for what
you're getting and all the technologies
work well then optionally 1195 for that
glass moonroof also a pretty good value
all in this car is about 32 7 out the
door with a lot of tech toys and a lot
of efficiency</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
