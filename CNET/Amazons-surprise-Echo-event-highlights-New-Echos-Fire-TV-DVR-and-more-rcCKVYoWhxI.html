to have you here
the first thing we'll be rolling out
today is a brand new echo dot first of
all it's got a completely new industrial
design fabric base comes in multiple
colors and it has more powerful sound
it's 70 percent louder and it's much
clearer sound will be starting to take
orders today kept it exact same price
$49.99
it'll ship next month today we're also
launching a new product we call echo
input this is an incredibly thin tiny
version of echo it's also our first echo
without a speaker it's built for the use
case to connect to the speaker you
already have or you aspire to buy this
will be available later this year for
only $34.99 an echo sub when paired with
a single echo will give you a 1.1
configuration and when you pair it with
left right you'll get a 2.1
configuration it gives you reach rich
deep sound and it also can participate
now in that multi-room audio echo sub
will start shipping later this month
it's available for pre-order starting
today a hundred and twenty nine dollars
and ninety nine cents today there'll be
a brand new echo plus in our lineup it's
got more powerful bass clearer sound
still has a hub built in so it's the
simplest way to get started with smart
home that we know how to do but we've
added a beautiful fabric design and the
team also found a way to fit a
temperature sensor inside of this so as
you put it around your house you can now
ask Alexa what the temperature is or set
up a routine if it gets a bit chilly and
the kids room Alexa can tell you and you
can take action echo plus pre-orders
starting today still only 149 dollars
we're also launching today the Alexa
smart plug it basically is our best
embodiment of frustration free setup
it'll pre-order starting today for $25
and it'll start shipping next month
we're starting with Alexa with something
we call Alexa guard
Alexa guard takes your echo devices your
Smart lights and your security service
provider if you have one and it allows
you to keep your home more secure when
you're away the first thing that it does
and how it works is it's really easy to
start Alexa guard if you if you turn it
on all you do is say Alexa I'm leaving
or something like that and she
immediately moves your echos in to guard
mode throughout your house and when we
do that we will be starting with a few
what we call smart alerts that if
they're detected they send you a
notification on your phone the first two
that will be launching with our is if in
when she's in guard mode she hears
breaking glass or a smoke or CO detector
those alarms go off we'll capture a
little bit of the audio clip of that and
we'll send it off to you on your phone
in addition optionally customers can
turn on what we call away mode lighting
again when you say Alexa I'm leaving and
away mode lighting is on Alexa if you
have smart lighting in your house will
intelligently randomize the lighting to
make it look like somebody's home to
deter intruders while you're away fire
TV recast is a new product from us of as
of today and it's the first time that
we're delivering a DVR to customers it
allows you to take over the air
television and deliver it directly to
your echo show or to your fire TV and
you can watch TV from any room in your
house with this and you saw the deep
integration that we have with echo show
now and these are common channels you
can get anywhere they're ABC CBS Fox
in addition and the nice thing about
fire TV recast is that we've separated
from where the recording happens to
where the viewing it happens it turns
out that with over-the-air television
where you want to place the antenna
matters and so we can pick this box and
we can put in any room of your house we
have an app that will help you find the
highest attenuation from your area and
you can put the antenna there put this
box there and forget about it and we
built an advanced wireless system that
allows you to then put this anywhere in
your house and you can get a large
number of channels we put an antenna
back here just the other day and we got
27 different channels and once you have
it placed then you can watch it anywhere
not only can you watch it on echo show
an echo spot but fire TV fire TV iOS and
Android on the go outside of your home
you can record two or four shows at a
time and stream to multiple devices I
showed it to you what it looks like an
echo show let me give you a look at what
it looks like on fire TV here as well
just go to the home you'll notice a
couple things different about the fire
TV home once this products installed
first of all you get a DVR menu up in
the top and then secondarily the home
screen has things that are live if I
roll over the live area I'll get a free
preview of what's on the antenna right
at this particular point in time and
then if I go ahead and scroll up to DVR
here you'll see there I get the whole
host of channels the Scrolls to the
right and you can see everything that's
on you can see what you've recorded
earlier and we've also added a channel
guide into fire TV now that not only
shows you what's on live 90s but we have
integrated into the channel guide and
the ability to have partners integrate
here so if you have subscribed to a
prime video channel or if you have
placed a Sony Playstation view it's
going to intersperse in here directly
with everything that you might see
coming over-the-air at any given time
we're going to start pre-order today on
fire TV recast it starts at $229 that's
for two tuners and a 500 gigabyte DVR we
also have a four tuner one terabyte
version that'll be available and this is
all shipping
before the holidays and this is Alexa
echo Auto now this is going to be
available for invite this year and do
not let the size of this device fool you
the team has packed a huge amount of
power inside of this and it turns out
there's a number of different ways to
connect to your car it's Bluetooth or
bluetooth LE and this also has the
ability to connect via auxiliary jack
into your car's entertainment system we
are now making Alexa location-aware I'll
show you some demos of that but one of
the things we're doing is we're adding
today location-based routines
so that you can now tell Alexa do X when
I leave my home when I arrive at work
when I leave work any kind of location
Alexa where's the nearest Starbucks I
found a Starbucks
it's 0.1 miles away on 7th Avenue in
Seattle
it's open now until 8:00 p.m. read my
book
getting your selection from audible
resuming the sum of all fears so much
the better for everyone if this had
happened one medics on that foolish stop
and then we've implemented navigation as
well so I can do things like Alexa give
me directions to SeaTac Airport getting
directions to Seattle Tacoma
International Airport se a at 178 zero
one International Boulevard as I
mentioned Alexa Auto will be available
for invite oops I almost got it
regularly it's going to be $49 but for
those that help us shape what Alexa is
going to look like in cars for the next
few months we're gonna have a special in
bright price of just $24.99 this is
unbelievable it's so great and I think
when you try this you're gonna find it
to be a great product and we'll start
shipping to invitees
a little later this year we also wanted
to extend this idea of voice control to
some of the other popular features that
we've had that traditionally required us
to be in the app to set up one of the
ones that we'll be launching this year
is starting to be able to make routines
directly from your voice routines are
those things that you can set up that
trigger something automatically to
happen I can give you an example that
Alexa when I say good night then played
babbling brook babbling brook by Joe
Baker starting now music Alexis stop
Alexa when I say babbling brook then
play babbling that's not gonna work
sorry I'll show it to you later they're
all live though you know that now
working without a net up here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
