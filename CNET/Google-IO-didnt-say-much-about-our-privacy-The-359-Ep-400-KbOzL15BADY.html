Alfred Eng Google did a good job of
wowing the crowd at its IO developer
conference this week but it left out a
lot of questions related to privacy and
data collection to areas that are
getting much more attention these days
following Facebook's Cambridge
analytical scandal Alfred do you see
this as a bit of an oversight on
Google's part or do you think that it's
okay why would they do this it's not
like Google is stuck in it I don't think
it's that much of an oversight I think
that you know they kind of follow
Facebook's idea of we provide a really
great like service for free so you can
you know but we need your data to do it
in the same way like all the features
that they showed off like Oh Google
assistant now knows like where you work
so you can like have your map like lead
you to it using AI very easily that like
essentially means that Google like has
all this information on you already and
they still showed it off so it felt it
looked very bold in the sense of like
hey we know like what time you're gonna
wake up we know what time you get home
we know where you work but you know
check it out we've got all these cool
features to help you out with it like
the Google photos feature that they
showed off it was like hey we can
colorize like some of your old photos
now using AI that also means that like
they have complete access to like all
your photos and like your childhood
memories and all that stuff so I think a
lot of tech companies these days are
also trying to present the trade-offs
and they understand that users are
getting a little bit savvy or a little
bit more uncomfortable with providing
too much information to them so they say
look you can you can delete this
information you can get rid of it or we
don't have to hold it for you but the
quality of this service is going to be
worse
I feel like Google says that Facebook
says that too these days and I don't
know maybe maybe consumers I'm gonna get
yeah if you want a service that really
doesn't have that much information on
you but you still want good AI I mean
look at Siri on Apple like look at how
it compares that you know Google's AI
it's not that much info yeah and it's
not that good related to the Facebook
scandal Democrats on the House
Intelligence Committee today released
more than three thousand Facebook ads
bought by Russian trolls from 2015 to
2017
tene Alfred you wrote about this did we
learn anything new with this big data
dump yes I spent a good amount of time
looking at the ads last night and this
morning so I found the most successful
Facebook ad it was a back of the badge
group that got more than a million views
on it and it only cost them about like a
thousand dollars to get that many views
and and they they went across like a lot
of different spectrums so the second
most viewed was like a pro Mexico
Facebook page they got about nine
hundred thousand views on it so they
really you know hit all the targets here
so they're just trying to like incite
chaos like you said they're trying to
hit a yeah although every trigger
possible there were there were nine
different categories on it that I'll
probably talk about in the post yeah
yeah okay let's get to the next story
also Spotify is going to be banning or
burying hateful quote hateful music or
artists this is already being dubbed the
r.kelly rule because apparently r kelly
is gonna get bounced from playlists and
also gonna get buried on Spotify it
definitely raises I think questions
about where does this it does this give
Spotify too much power but who knows I
mean I think Spotify is looking at its
role as like a radio station a lot more
because radio stations do this a lot
there was a radio station in Detroit
that said it would never play any Kanye
West songs ever again after the always
like Twitter rants like that's totally
political though but okay
I mean I think they have a right to
choose what they want on their platform
though it'll be interesting to see how
Spotify decides what's hateful and what
is and I remember last year they also
banned a lot of white supremists
like rock bands off of Spotify so it's
not like this is the first time they've
done anything like this
okay last US Transportation Secretary
Elaine Chao yesterday announced ten
projects to test out using drones in US
skies I think this one's pretty exciting
FedEx is going to be involved in testing
out delivery drones in airports there's
also going to be delivery of medical
packages like the fibula defibrillators
Amazon though wasn't included in this
latest round of approvals
anyway we're out of time so if you want
to read more about these stories check
us out on CNN I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm
Alfred Eng thanks for listening that's
actually our new sign off song I like
that so where it is spot if I stand if I
just hate something don't be a musician
Yeah right I don't know it's a good
controversial issue I would say now has
it because like like what what about
First Amendment
what about like what what actually like
counts as hateful speech Spotify is a
private service Spotify is a private
opt-in service Alfred I'm glad you
brought the comparison up excuse me to a
radio station because I feel that's
exactly the case and you have every
right to just cancel your Spotify
account and move somewhere else to get
the content you want that's screens
supposed to be blue don't worry about
that it's the same deal is like a chord
cutter I don't want to watch TV because
I don't like what's on TV
if Spotify doesn't deliver the content I
want I'll go elsewhere I for one don't
care for our Kelly at me bros wait a
minute what about the kanye west point
that you were making yeah but that's
like leaven right well like July Kanye
West supporting the president should I
mean I'm like I yeah like I said like I
think I think the privately owned radio
station I mean I think it's more than
him just supporting the president but
that's for another thing I mean it like
I said it'll be interesting to see like
what they consider hate speech because
like there's a lot of people that think
that Beyonce is is like an anti-police
like Black Panther protester kind of
thing but like I'm I think a lot of
people will disagree with that so it's
like where is Spotify is like
perspective on this right I I think the
broader message here is that like
everything is getting more political a
lot of businesses of are now being asked
to take sides in a lot oh yeah like
social and political culture wars that
are going on Spotify is obviously
decided that they want to weigh in but
you raise like the obvious point which
is how do you determine what is hateful
yeah when you mention the thing about
like white supremacist rock bands like I
don't know I'm sitting here being like
yeah that makes a lot of sense you know
but like when you're gonna go and bring
it to Arkell
who has not actually been charged
he's only been accused of things that
puts it more into a gray area yeah I
think I think the the push for this has
come from a lot of folks that have
wanted a lot of radio stations to
basically boycott or Kelly and take him
off the airwaves for a long time and
it's not really like it's not the
content of his music more so that like
you know if he there's all these
allegations against him I'm circling
around him for a night very well and I
think it's more of a boycott perspective
of you know stop helping this man make
millions of dollars and like supporting
him there's there's a difference and
with somebody like an are Kelly that is
a news headline making controversy as
opposed to somebody just not wanting to
do this because they don't like it
what's more wrong me being a DJ at a
radio station saying I'm never gonna
play Hall &amp;amp; Oates again because I think
they suck which would never be the case
cuz I absolutely love yeah that's weird
why did you use them as an example
because I always played a hollow notes
in fact I was told to play less hollow
notes when I was oh by the way I want to
correct myself our Kelly was charged he
was just he wasn't convicted thank you
but I mean that's just statistics at
play if you really look at it at least
to me that's people saying like no he
does kind of objectively suck at
everything
why would I want to support this because
it does better business for me well
there's a lot of people who agree and
don't want to hear our Kelly songs
anymore because they're disgusted by his
B it's also interesting to see like if
Spotify is doing this I wonder where
other platforms will go like I don't
know if like Netflix would do the same
thing with like Louie and all their
specials that they paid him millions for
I think I feel like HBO already did that
they are definitely show on Netflix
though HBO got rid of the louis c.k
comedy specials yeah but what about the
like like it's yeah it'll platform when
Netflix is different yeah so that's why
I'm wondering like if Spotify is doing
something like this I wonder like how
will influence like other platforms hmm
here's the ultimate question coming in
from APEC in the chat that's what I was
wondering what would they consider hate
speech who draws a line and rules and
why does everything have to be about
politics getting sick of
Touche I think what matters is it
doesn't matter because Spotify although
it is it's publicly traded right mm-hmm
it is now it's still privately it's a
private it's a business so they can make
a choice about their product I mean
that's the core of privileged American
right system as it is well not not
exactly I mean like you're not allowed
to discriminate as a business in a
variety of ways
now this discriminatory against our
Kelly
public figures are not protected by
slander and libel in all cases well put
well you guys are making very good
points about this I think Spotify has
the right to do whatever the hell they
want with the content that they publish
I mean like I just want any label they
can write something they decide robbing
our society to excessively limit things
they put too many things in the bucket
of this is hateful because I don't like
Hall and Oates
like the example that you were putting
proposing everybody knows you know but
people aren't gonna use the service
anymore because they're being like way
to restrict exactly and as we've had
brought up so many times in recent
memory especially when Jones here there
are lots of fantastic alternatives out
there to find the content you want and
they're all pretty ok price these days
it's just it's really interesting when
you when you thought about music as a
sense of like you know protest music or
any kind of like um like it's supposed
to be like an like an artistic thing so
like would you consider like any songs
by like NWA
like like a hateful song about like
police or anything like that now that's
a question right grab salut possibly or
like the YouTube video from childish
gambino which is like you know kind of
goes across the board is that is that
hateful i I mean like I wouldn't
perceive it that way but listen as long
as it's like a hateful or violence like
it was obviously violent but it was done
with a political message in mind so
that's very true and if we start going
down that path all we're gonna have left
on Spotify is VeggieTales VeggieTales
very hateful okay
interested to see where this goes just
being somebody with the history and
music I'm glad we added in this very
last well it's always good discussion
and I'm glad we're not getting too
overly biased and political with it but
if you're in the chat let's hear what
you think who's an artist and be serious
let's take this one seriously because it
could be easily run with the joke's on
this one who do you think Spotify is
likely to drop from the roster who do
you think deserves a Ted Nugent there
you go man seriously I washed in a bowl
why would he be questionable why because
a gun lover no no absolutely not but
because he's made some off-color okay
that's also very anti-muslim that's okay
all right those are good points
he literally threatened to shoot the
president yeah the figure much YG's song
like that's that would be considered
like eight fall under this I don't all
right yeah there's a lot of like gray
area here extremely there's an area
where do you draw the line with artistic
integrity and expression
Saji also threatened to shoot the
president so yeah there is takes all
sides
whoof all right next topic good
discussion Ryan Williams wants to talk
about the privacy not so much once to
talk about the privacy brings up a good
point and I'm kind of with Ryan on this
one personally I don't mind having
Google have all that information since I
don't really have anything to hide but
it's and it's only to help you or so I
hope and it's just like I'm with him on
that as far as that goes
is it a summary slope it's a trust issue
exactly I mean I'm glad that you know
he's willing to trust Google and it's
different for everybody but I've never
really been a fan of the argument of you
know you don't have anything to hide so
you should let people like see all your
information I don't then opt out yeah
you don't want it opt out of Google or
say it's almost impossible to opt out of
Google entire I mean you can just not
use don't use products how would you do
that like how is that even possible
Yahoo Bing DuckDuckGo knows like privacy
concerns Firefox there are alternatives
there are apps here's the fun part
they're all mining your data yeah I mean
you would have to really go out of your
way to do that and
Google just makes it oh so easy to just
hand over all your information yep so
it's it's like the point that you were
making in the podcast like they know
where your your workplace is it's like
Google knows where my house is and
Google's known where my house is and
like what what like GPS location I'm in
on a daily basis at all time so it's
just that's that's been yeah I think for
a year I think of it more as like a
necessary type of information like if
you were asking somebody like how to get
like home from where you are
like just let random stranger on the
street and he's like okay well where do
you live and you're like no I want my
privacy okay like that it's like you
need to hand over some type of
information to like to get help in that
sense so I understand like why Google
has some of this data but it was just
interesting that you know they were so
like brazen about it we're just like no
look forget it like we've got all these
cool amazing features don't don't worry
about us knowing all this but anyway
yeah I've always come from the mindset
of like do they really care about you
you're nothing more than a blip you're a
number you're a statistic no but they
really care about selling that firm for
tons of money sure and I'll keep saying
try to sell me something I want yeah I
still I know it's a weak argument but
I'm still in that mindset of you know I
don't really have anything to hide all
right let's take this conversation to
the point of what people were talking
about with Facebook f8 where they were
like I should Facebook have a paid
service where they're not packaging your
data to sell ads to you or or to sell
advertisements your information and a
lot of people thought that that was a
great idea
Facebook Plus Facebook subscription
service there's my personally would
never hurt my face there's been a lot of
like consumer studies on that and like
no one really wants to pay for that I'd
say like maybe like one in ten people
would pay for that I would also assume
that those one in ten people have
probably have the money to spare on that
right or that one in ten people isn't on
Facebook ya know and I don't think the
numbers even that high Josh Boyd who
says I don't mind if Google has my
information if it makes my life a little
more convenient Ryan goes on to expand I
guess the thing is the worst thing that
can happen with Google having your
information someone
hacking and stealing your info so it's
not about Google having it's about
Google not protecting it and then
Demonte said the same thing we don't
know the people at Google so really what
is the tipping point for everybody are
you scared of somebody else abusing this
are you scared of I know I may be scared
it's not the right word are you
concerned that Google just has too much
what are you willing to trade for the
services that come with giving up a
little bit of your privacy honestly even
with like hacking in your information
getting stolen I don't think that's
enough for you to get to get people to
stop using Google I mean like oh I'm not
saying people are gonna stop yeah and to
be fair to Google the likelihood of
Google getting hacked is much lower than
you know some know named smart home
company that like makes a device in
their house like they they have more
controls and more protections than some
of the startups yeah but I'm just like
yo Facebook like had the scandal of its
life you know just last month and
there's still kind of like dealing with
it but like the whole delete Facebook
movement that looked like it was like
growing is like completely dead now
there's like there's no tweets about
that and like they actually they made
more money even after the Cambridge
analytical scandal scandal like people
stayed on Facebook like there was all
this outrage over in Congress but like
you go you go to like Main Street you go
and like somebody's home or something
like that no one is like has left
Facebook like people don't really care I
would say that like in my own personal
life that scandal did resonate on Main
Street like III talked to people like on
the weekend my neighbor's whatever they
actually recognized and they paid
attention to that story outside world
are they still using Facebook for us
yeah then of course but it was at least
something that was that was recognized
oh yeah I think that that matters to the
point that Facebook is now on notice and
if they screw up again
everybody's gonna remember this
situation and I I do think that is
important because some of those problems
could potentially compound after a while
I mean historically speaking we've
always wanted to know more about each
other and ways to exploit it I mean
looking back at the Nielsen box even
though that does still exist it's
valuable but that's just to track your
TV watching habits in order to better
cater Talib commercial and look at the
census i mean people are just finding
new ways to delve deeper if you could
put a Nielsen box on everybody they
would oh wait they have in your brains
in your pocket actually saw a Nielsen
box for the first time I've never seen
one my well my girlfriend's mom has one
what and you have like this remote that
like you can Dex like so it's like
there's designated like who's watching
buttons is there an incognito version or
like it yeah it is they're not watching
TV paid for it though oh that's pretty
yeah I think that's why she does it
pretty minimal yeah anyway
let's switch over to the drone topic
real quick before I round up for the day
APEC says for the drones are they going
to be using that drop service here in
the US and if so wouldn't millions of
drones flying overhead dropping things
off cause some issues oh to be clear
this is very small limited highly
regulated testing that's going on we are
not anywhere close in the u.s. to having
drones flying over your heads delivering
you toothpaste civilian level air
traffic control no no not even close
and Amazon wasn't even included in this
so they've been pouring money into prime
air and really trying to develop their
drone delivery program at this point
they weren't included in this group of
ten some of these projects sound really
cool it's like you know emergency
defibrillator services or you know
airplane inspections so you would have a
drone like flying around an airplane to
make sure everything's safe and
everything's well taken care of but
getting it to consumers that's that's
gonna take a really long time or it will
never get there is possibility that
there's it just doesn't happen I
remember I wrote a story about like
three years ago about South Texas like
police officers getting drones for like
just in time for like the spring break
rush and when I asked them like so what
are you what are you using these drones
for they they like gave the most
wholesome answers where it's like oh we
can use these if somebody's drowning out
the middle of the ocean we kind of drop
a life like a lifejacket off to them
pretty Swift a drone I don't know that's
not what you're using the drones for oh
but these coded crowd control yes like
yeah I was like make sure people weren't
like doing drugs on like the beach or
anything like they use that to patrol
the beach they they didn't drop a single
life jacket that weekend that's too bad
because I really like the life jacket
idea well going on totally awesome life
saving going on that same theme living
here in New York you see the traffic
that emergency services have to battle
just to do their jobs right now I'm not
saying they could put a whole firetruck
in a drone but think about but that
would be on that would be dough right
turns whatever why wouldn't they just
get the drone with like a hose attached
to it and like fly up that thing that
has to be massive to get the appropriate
amount of pressure behind it to actually
do anything but maybe like a small truck
I'm thinking more like the defibrillator
concept if somebody is you know in the
middle of Central Park and having a
heart attack and people call emergency
services it's going to take a longer
time for an ambulance to get there to go
through the gates and get through the
traffic then for a drone dude boom right
and the good news is is that this
testing gets us one step closer to that
but to assume that this is actually
going to result in your life changing
anytime soon no that's not going to
happen this is this is the u.s. in
particular is taking a very slow and
deliberate process when it comes to
drone regulation good they want to make
sure that they get it right they don't
want any packages falling on your head
which is business we're doing something
slow which is great for lyft caution
it's great from a safety perspective
from an innovation perspective the US
has to be mindful and aware of that
there are other countries out there that
are being a little bit looser with their
regulations and therefore may innovate a
little bit faster than we do Rodney art
design in the chat says the drone
testing is coming to San Diego and
they're looking forward to it keep us
posted we want to see what you see
Phyllis in his in the chat tweet at us
email us let us know what your
experiences you know even on the
outskirts of it if you're seeing
anything cool developing what the
processes and experiments might be
looking like if you have any kind of
antigen to it one I just remember
there's one really cool project where
there's intercepts or drones where like
if
is flying somewhere it's not supposed to
there's an interceptor drum like a hawk
that will come and show up and and take
it out I want to watch that nature
documentary I want to watch like a
Werner Herzog narrated in the drone
drones taking out other drones the drone
in the mating season punches too close
to the old drone nest and then this
thing the desirable word is ugh then we
got to get Josh Goldman in here to do
that impression probably Annette Oh
oh my god I want to see that drone I
want to see a fake documentary where the
lot of disciplines and robots a lot of
cool stuff with drones but okay just
take it easy everybody because it's
gonna take a long time for the robot
Lords to take over hey but didn't take a
long time for us to get through this
show we are out of time we are ending it
for the week it's been a great week is
when we've covered some decent topics
yeah we had to focus a lot on Google i/o
