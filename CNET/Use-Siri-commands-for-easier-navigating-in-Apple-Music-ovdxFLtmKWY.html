don't have it on your iOS device yet
head to settings followed by general and
click on software update you will need
to be on iOS version 8.4 for to work one
of the coolest things about Apple music
is the Siri integration you can use the
virtual assistant to play songs from
specific days years and even movies
here's a few of my favorite commands
wanna play the top songs from a specific
era try played the top songs from the
90s or play the top song from the 60s
any error should work another fun one is
hearing the top song from a specific
date such as the day you were born for
me that would be Siri play the top song
from March 6 1989 or even top song from
the year you were born
so play the top song from 1989 another
cool feature is being able to play songs
from movies for example Siri play the
song from Fifty Shades of Grey to hear
newer songs in a specific genre you can
use the command Siri play the top pop
songs now or play the top rock songs you
can also use Siri to play the top songs
from your favorite artists I love Billy
Joel
so I say play Billy Joel and Siri will
offer me up his top hits unfortunately
there are limitations you will need to
be an apple music subscriber to use
these features at this time Siri also
isn't capable of creating playlists you
will also run into issues when some
songs aren't available for streaming
such as when you look up the John Legend
song glory from the hit movie Selma
for screaming but Apple music is new and
it's bound to get better over time for
more tips and tricks like this one be
sure to check out how to Tina calm you

any questions or comments I'm Dan Grazia
