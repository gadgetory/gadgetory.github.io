controversy over its trending topics the
drama began after a gizmodo report in
which a former facebook employee said
the stories in the trending box were
picked by human staff and the team is
suppressing conservative stories
Facebook denied the report but it led to
outrage over the influence Facebook
employees have to swing a conversation
shouldn't trending show what's naturally
popular instead of being hand-picked by
humans in a move toward transparency
Facebook released an internal document
of instructions that the trending team
is ordered to follow the stories
highlighted our result of mixing
computer algorithms with a human team of
curators the team works similar to how a
newsroom may pick what stories to cover
it also reviews what other major news
outlets are reporting on Mark Zuckerberg
jumped into the discussion with a
statement he says that trending topics
will not prioritize one viewpoint over
another or suppress political
perspectives and it is investigating to
see if anyone was suppressing
conservative viewpoints as the report
claimed Zuckerberg also says he will
meet with conservative leaders about
this issue it's no surprise people are
getting worked up over this claim we are
in the middle of a major u.s.
presidential election and Facebook could
sway voters by displaying or hiding
certain hot topics this weekend Nielsen
study revealed that social media is a
top source of news for people ranking
right behind television that's it for
