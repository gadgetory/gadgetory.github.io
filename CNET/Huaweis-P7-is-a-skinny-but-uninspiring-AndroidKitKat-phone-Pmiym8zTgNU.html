taking a look at the kwame extend p7 a
five inch android kitkat smartphone with
an extremely skinny body by looks alone
there's not a whole lot to separate the
Ascend p7 from last year's p6 it's
physically a little larger but it's
still incredibly skinny it's only six
point five mils thick the metal back
panel has been replaced with glass
maintains four rounded bottom and it has
the same metal iPhone 4 style band
around the edge the glass panels help
make it look pretty classy although it's
very difficult to tell the print from
the back when it's in your pocket which
can be frustrating and it's lightweight
makes it feel a bit cheap on the upside
Huawei has moved the headphone jacks in
this stupid spot on the side to a much
more sensible place on the top the
5-inch display has a full HD resolution
which makes icons and small text look
crisp while it's fair brightness and
decent colors makes Netflix shows
perfectly watchable inside it's running
Android 4.4.2 kitkat although you can't
really tell ask Huawei has heavily
skinned it with its emotion UI skin it's
not one of my favorite Android skins
largely because it's done away with the
app tray we need to have to keep all
apps and widgets scattered on the home
screens which can be very awkward and
cluttered it is customizable with themes
though and there's a simplified version
if you're not too familiar with Android
it's running on a 1.8 gigahertz
quad-core chip which is slower than the
2.3 gigahertz chips you'll find in Sony
and Samsung stuff and phones and as such
it didn't perform nearly as well on
benchmark tests it had enough power for
day-to-day tasks though and handled
gaming adequately the only time I really
noticed a slowdown was when I had to
wait several seconds for it to render
large photos on screen around the back
as a 13 megapixel camera with an 8
megapixel camera on the front as a lot
of pixels for a front camera so it was
clear that this phone is geared towards
selfie lovers the 2,500 milli ampere now
a battery meanwhile should keep going
for a day if you're careful about what
you're doing with the phone although the
Ascend p7 is certainly skinny and it's
not too expensive its unimpressive power
and sometimes awkward interface makes it
an acceptable
albey
a bit of an uninspiring choice if you
can find the p7 on a subsidized contract
with a good deal it's worth a look but
some of last year's flagships could be a
better choice for the money
I'm Andrew coil for C net and this is
the huawei ascend p7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
