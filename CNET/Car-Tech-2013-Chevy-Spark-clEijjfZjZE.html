days they say it's their first true mini
car no Camaro DNA here no CD player
either let's drive the 2013 Chevy spark
and check the tech so what is a spark it
is the new small car bottom of their
line very small but still four or five
inches longer than a Fiat 500 you to
some idea
it's a 5-door as you can see a fairly
roomy front row a back row that is too
seating what a middle finger up raised
is today talked in the back you lift the
hatch this is the only way the car is
available by the way and you've got a
very shallow rather tall cargo bay all
right now I'm not being unnecessarily
dickish when I tell you that I feel like
I'm on a riding mower in this thing it's
actually pretty roomy for the footprint
of the car but there's something sort of
upright about it and this whole wheel
and pod have a very forward presentation
that makes it feel like it's right in
your face so that makes it feel a little
bit odd in here but let's talk about
this pod you've got a mechanical
speedometer and over here you've got a
digital LCD screen for other ancillary
things right you see attack and odometer
and your fuel level things like that in
the 1 LT and 2 LT trim levels those are
the number 2 and 3 trims from the base
you get this head unit Chevy MyLink a
new interface we've never seen before
good-looking thing isn't it Audio of
course takes you to your audio sources
which you're going to be surprised by
look at my list what's missing no CD not
standard not optional not possible am/fm
no HD radio satellite radio I believe
you get three months complimentary maybe
it's a month but there's a little taste
there iPod hooked up through USB you
have a standard analog aux bluetooth
streaming nice meta tags as well and
they come very quickly now here's a
really cool part about this system with
our attached smartphone we go to
smartphone link
three apps were supported right now
Pandora of course we'll get you your
streaming radio that you know well
thumbs-up thumbs-down a customized
Pandora interface nice album art there
as well if we back it up you find
stitcher the podcast application and
again very common interface when we were
on Pandora you have to have those apps
installed on your phone by the way
they're not part of the head unit the
way Toyota does it in end to the last
one here is bring go as of our shoot
today
this is still TBD but it'll be coming to
the cars as an optional add-on for 50
bucks you get this support built-in and
that becomes your nav there is no native
nav built into this head unit it's got
to be through your smart phone so the
power and the guts and the connectivity
is here and of course bring goes a
connected navigation solution you've got
some Google search for places you've got
live traffic it's a nice advanced system
but again you've got to bring the
horsepower and pay 50 bucks for the app
integration up here in early 2013 the
spark will also add support for Siri
through an iPhone 4s or five including
an eyes free mode that keeps the iPhone
screen dark during Siri sessions giving
you no reason to take your eyes off the
road and look at the phone
now the engine on the spark was here a
minute ago ah there it is 1.25 litre
inline-four tiny without put numbers we
haven't seen in this country since the
80s 84 horsepower 83 foot-pounds of
torque nothing in the triple digits zero
to 60 almost certainly the car weighs
about 2,300 pounds and you're going to
get 30 to 38 mpg with the manual because
it's a five-speed fairly modern get the
four-speed automatic which they must
source from John Deere and your mpg
drops a lot down to 28 37 okay when you
set off in the spark you obviously don't
expect much from a car with single-digit
power and a pretty cheap price but I'll
tell you what this is far from the worst
ride quality I've experienced this year
in fact I can think of a couple cars
that cost more than twice this much that
were much harsher to ride in which
brings us to the power a short subject
there's not much there as you can tell
from the numbers and you always feel
like you're about 20 percent shy of the
power you really need especially when
you're trying to accelerate onto a
freeway or make some kind of a maneuver
at full throttle and you do get to full
throttle a lot in this car it's never
risky because alright much going on
there good visibility in this guy
because you've got those nice deep
windows back there they don't have any
tinting on them that's a big old
backlight on that hatch as well and
these little quarter peekaboo windows
here just give you a nice big greenhouse
it's one of the things that little cars
can do to do themselves a favor
as far as shifting the clutch and
gearbox are actually just fine they're
not bad at all
shifter is a little long I'm not sure if
I'm moving gears or churning butter but
it works ok this price our Sparky little
friend 13 eight base that includes
destination then you've got the 1lt and
the 2lt trim levels 1lt is a given 1,600
bucks for the MyLink head unit remote
control locks on the key fob yet that's
optional
and cruise control 2lt I can live
without leather seats in these alloy
wheels automatic transmission 9:25
you'll want to live without that it does
nasty things to acceleration and mpg all
in CNET style 15 4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
