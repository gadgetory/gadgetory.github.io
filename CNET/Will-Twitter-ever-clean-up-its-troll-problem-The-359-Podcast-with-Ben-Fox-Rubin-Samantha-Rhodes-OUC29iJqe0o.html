everybody but Sam has been very kind to
join me on the podcast today otherwise
we would have been alone yeah I would
have been well brian is always here yeah
who dutifully help me out we're going to
be talking today again about Twitter
trolling some more interesting news that
came out about that the iphone 7 which
is expected to come out pretty soon in
September and then also a was a jetpack
golfed card yeah it flies through the
air right I'm not entirely sure what
we're gonna say about it but it's
totally boss so we will just check it
out if so so Bryan we can ask people to
ask us questions yeah I'm in the chat
room right now okay so there's a chat
room you guys can send us questions or
comments what have you obviously we're
going to be talking about trolling so if
you guys decide to troll ice fair game I
mean I so kind of yeah i mean like
that's not very nice but still entirely
expected considering the subject matter
and right and it's YouTube so I guess we
can we can get started and yeah we'll
try to answer your questions when we're
done with the podcast afterwards so wait
four minutes enjoy three minutes and 59
seconds right exactly not for a minute
under okay audios recording to speed
let's kick it off in three two welcome
to the 359 where we talk about the top
tech news of the day plus whatever crap
we want to throw in I'm Ben Fox Rubin
I'm Samantha roads first up Twitter
trolls the micro-blogging site
permanently banned one of its most
notorious trolls get a butcher this
guy's name me lo e Annapolis yeah you
novelist he goes he goes by the handle
Nero after he helped lead Twitter mob
against ghostbusters star Leslie Jones
with racist and misogynist tweets so
Sam is Twitter actually going to be able
to stop this type of trolling from
happening I mean like are they even in
control of their own microblogging site
I think it's difficult to tell because
you get into a sticky area of free
speech and so you know can you actually
tell someone not to say something who
knows but they're starting to do a
little bit more yeah do you think that
this okay I totally get the free speech
angle however people don't want to be
bullied on site so they don't actually
have to go to like I don't have to go on
facebook i don't have to go on twitter
how much does this hurt them if you know
the whole situation like like twitter
mob can turn against you and say a bunch
of negative things and kind of make your
life hell for 48 hours or even longer
yeah i think it could be awful i mean
she left leslie who was attacked just
left twitter and it could happen to
anyone in the fact that it was over
nothing yeah that's well that's what
yeah that's what's kind of unexpected
about this situation is that it was it
when when gamergate happened that also
happened on Twitter and there was at
least an understanding of why it was
going on I'm not suggesting that it was
actually good it was actually pretty
horrible but what happened there there
but also a lot of anti-semitic things
that have was set against journalists
that have written critical things about
the Trump campaign that was also
problematic but at least the targeting
was in a sense expected or that you knew
it was happening but with Leslie Jones
it just seemed to come out of nowhere
which creates this really problematic
situation that you can just incite a
Twitter map to go after one person and
it makes you think it could happen to
you any day yeah like so who wants to go
on twitter if that's the situation so i
don't know i have a bit of a knock
against the whole First Amendment thing
because you know it should be you
shouldn't allow for bullying I think
especially that kind of stuff on that
site oh yeah anything i know i agree i
think they need to crack down a bit more
because you can't just let hate speech
run wild yeah I mean no one's gonna go
in the platform anymore if they do
definitely all right let's let's lighten
it up a bit what else do we have so ten
percent of us phone iPhone owners so
they were only ten percent say they were
likely to get the next iphone upgrade
because there really aren't
many cool new features right now granted
that was that was down from like twenty
five percent right so it's still a
relatively small number but that's like
a really small amount comparatively so
we're obviously a little nervous here at
cnet that the iphone 7 is going to be a
horrible died by now saying somebody by
see hopefully iphone sales sink actually
for the first time in the first quarter
of 2016 and so people are just i mean i
guess they're just not that excited yeah
yeah it's too bad and we've been seeing
that a lot this year and lastly we also
wanted to get to a ridiculous story to
continue to lighten the mood some guy
created a jetpack golf cart it's pretty
awesome and we have a video up on the
website that you guys can check out so
first of all not some guy it's bubba
watson bubble walker oh ok that's a guy
okay fair enough i don't know that much
about golf so how did you I ok it's a
big name but yeah so he used he made a
hovercraft golf cart this is a jetpack
the video is actually hilarious he's
just flying through the air instead of
you know going on the normal path he's
literally above it's pretty cool yes
that would actually get me to start
golfing which I never ever do my father
in law wants me to do it and I say hey
you can take me mini golf yeah mini
golfing yes he immediately loses respect
for me so yeah yeah I don't know the
only thing is like what if you drop a
golf club on someone's head that would
be kind that would be bad you imagine no
no but okay either way anyway you want
to read more about these stories check
out check them out on cnet I'm Ben Fox
Rubin I'm Samantha road thanks for
listening and that's a cut on the
recording slightly rusty on the on the
dismount but I managed anyway realize
that while we were tied iddin write it
down i usually have a script for the end
part though was okay i realized i we
were talking i was doing some of my
hands and it made a very weird that was
the backup of just in case Sam did
something weird over their hands so just
ignore it um anyway yeah honestly you
should watch the video they have you
watched the entire thing it's no no no I
checked out just to sit just enough to
be able to talk about it for 30 seconds
but um yeah I think I think it's
important to mention that I
youtube by the way I've also seen a lot
of like really truly stuff that goes on
on youtube so yeah and I think that
Google has been trying to improve that
situation I'm not really sure that they
have but YouTube definitely has that
reputation too so it's it's going to be
interesting to see where the line is
going to be as far as like First
Amendment versus you know actually
getting people to like come on because
like I think a lot of people like going
on Facebook because Facebook is like
safe for Grandma to go and like if I'm
going to post a picture of like my kids
and a bunch of people are gonna like
spout like night baby yeah that would be
that would be pretty tame no that
happened to one of our cnet writers
think that would be a view exactly on
facebook no where was it I don't know oh
I don't know either yeah yeah you could
just read about that okay well that kind
of stinks totally horrible so yeah but I
feel like that happens less on facebook
because you're as you discussed before
the show because your face is on it
exactly your faces on it and on Twitter
it's just you know a handle it could be
anyone people knew who Mila was anyway
we have questions not really I the one
thing that happened is the the minute we
started talking about spam and trolls
somebody just started repeatedly
commenting spam spam no ma'am I never
said spam I said troll but there's a
there might be confusion in the audience
right now between what spamming and
trolling is because people are saying
like yeah I've got lots of problem with
bots like that's a gun oh yeah I'd say
that's very different trolling to long
as an address human being bad if there
was a troll bot that would be pretty
interesting actually I don't think I've
ever actually seen one before I feel
like somebody could be made of her
rather it is a lead yes well that's the
thing is when they you know when the
First Amendment came about and we
adopted free speech no one thought of
Twitter when that happened yeah no one
thought of the Internet I mean didn't
exist look I'm a reporter obviously I
feel like people have have the right to
say whatever they want to say but I I
think these are it's it's there needs to
be like a finer like a better line drawn
as far as like not harassing people so
yeah and and like Twitter right now so
used to be too much of like a wild wild
west because like this guy Nero can you
know shut down is his account and then
potentially like open a different one
obviously Twitter said they're going to
fight against that and try to make sure
that it doesn't get back on the site but
yeah I think it's too easy to like
create varying accounts on Twitter and I
mean you could just keep making them
with any handle and any name in any
picture and then no spew hate speech I
guess so yeah and let's try to avoid
spamming people by if we don't have any
other questions I guess we could call it
I just thought it was funny is it's like
really that's the peak of your
creativity is writing the word spam over
and over I would have expected somebody
to say I mean when we talked about
Donald Trump on Monday we got at least a
nice that we got a largement pill badge
and stuff like that's that's that's what
spam supposed to be that is def not just
for words spam yeah um cool no trolling
it's like when people are actually mean
to each other right yeah it's basically
boolean so all right am I supposed to I
have to well somebody says you can say
whatever you want but you don't need a
law to tell you that Twitter did the
right thing because that guy just
spreads hatred and bigotry and I think
that kind of goes with our tango in
exactly to your point there's a big
difference between as saying having an
opinion and just being a jackass right
and I'm standing by that word because
there's no other word like you pure
jackass right i mean that goes way
beyond being a jackass but yeah fair
enough but there are some other select
words that i might not want to say total
under the scene at moniker i think yeah
look even more broad than this it really
conveys the fact that you know social
media is still a very new medium and it
gives people a lot of opportunity to say
different stuff and i think maybe we're
taking we're still learning how to use
the tools properly well what do you
think is going to happen first is
something like the cesspool that is
twitter to borrow your word will cave in
on itself because that's something I've
I saw since day one it's like it's two
entirely possible i mean and i don't i
don't think that that is out of the
bounds of reality I don't think any of
these networks are invincible sure but
at the same time with Facebook you have
an agreement that I'm going to talk to
you or trance
perrin see right and now you can just go
around that people do get bullied on
Facebook but people get bullied in the
real world too yeah but it's not like
real were less bullying yeah oh yeah
actually you can't say that because real
world bullying it could be next level
stuff yeah falafel yeah but Anya on
Facebook your face is tied to it and
everyone else is seeing your comment
with your face writings it is makes me
wonder why more of these agencies
haven't adopted that kind of thing where
there isn't some verification well do
you think are they going to it is
Twitter going to cave in on itself are
we going to be forced into this kind of
verification or are we going to outgrow
this immature face what's going to
happen first I don't know but like I
think that the point is is that Jack
Dorsey who's the CEO of Twitter really
presents himself as somebody that tries
to be very altruistic and positive and
you know views the world in this very
optimistic light so i would think that
like he's probably very disappointed
that this kind of thing happened to
Leslie Jones he directly reached out to
her on Twitter to ask for her to DM him
just to say like hey like can we talk
whatever so I don't think he's happy
that that's happening on his medium and
hopefully that means that he's going to
make some changes to because like Dorsey
has a reputation to maintain as well so
yeah well he needs to find the answer to
the questions that we're currently
asking yeah that's that's a while while
running another a completely different
company to ya called square so now this
show get lucky or see yes the got
real um yeah that's what you get when
you have me on oh sorry ah alright that
will be a good time for me to end it if
you liked what you saw comment check us
