guests today we're very excited to have
him he is a writer a comedian art
gallery co-founder a podcaster and he
has a new book called Kanye West owes me
$300 which is not just a snappy title
welcome Jenson carpet guy thanks for
being here thank you for having me it
can't be a snappy title it has to
legally be true that's why it's the
title oh okay lawyers told me that over
and over as long as he technically owes
me $300 we're fine so he technically owe
you through her no he does let's start
with that let's just get that right well
when I was 19 years old I was pretty
much like Los Angeles's biggest battle
rapper which is weird cuz I look like an
accountant but I was killer like I could
murder anybody and that turned into a
million dollar record deal Interscope
with Jimmy Iovine and they like that it
was like the Yankees of the music
business yeah sure and so I recorded an
album with them and it was recorded with
Redman and fabulous of DJ Quik and DJ
Clue and Mya
Sugar Ray which is less impressive but
one of the people I worked with was a
young Kanye West we became close friends
he's not sort of the guy you know now he
was a very kind of quiet somewhat humble
guy a little strange
not Kanye West 2020 no not like no not
ranting about jogging sweats now like
he's a sort of a monster now but at the
time very sweet God we became friends
hung out movies dinners all sorts I
couldn't do that you know me as a person
at this point couple minutes in I could
not hang out with this version of him
that you know and so one of the things I
did was we wanted to record we record a
song together and as a producer not a
rapper no one really knew he was a
rapper and he wanted he had to leave he
had to go to his mom's house trains
about to leave waiting so you made a
record with Kanye West yeah where you
were the rapper well no one no one knew
his rap I just think that's such a cool
story yeah yeah managers would never
even admit he was a rapper like when he
told me was a rapper was like a secret
really that's crazy like I know one he
was being pitched as a producer you
couldn't really be both at the time yeah
so it was just he's also like a big dork
he had like adult braces and stuff and
so like people weren't stoked on him
being a rapper sure but I have the right
look at the time oh yeah or like yeah
his fervor was so like it was too
excited it was like very hard to
understand even right and everyone else
and so we recorded
he said he need to leave I said listen
I'll get a car service for you the label
gave me way too much money and he said
no I'll pay you back and I don't want it
you know and even text me two ways at
the time he would chew me every week
about this $300 I didn't even want it
but after a while when someone does that
you're like yeah yeah check and so we
kind of lost touch around a couple
months after through the wire after he
got in the accident and we haven't
spoken since but it is my biggest
outstanding debt that I have in my life
it's the largest debt and I feel like
now I can for it I would assume I guess
we're all a little questioning when he
said he was fifty three million dollars
in debt but I figured was three million
and three hundred he's like it's 50 to
seven but then I remembered that car
that Jenson got me and I'm gonna throw
that in yeah maybe who knows but no I
have not had much conversation with him
so who knows and since since that time
you have kind of done a little bit of
everything so you have a podcast yeah
that's on Earwolf Network yeah and
you've got you do is do you still do the
show with the baby we did a show with
the baby for a long time we got a show
called baby talk in Los Angeles Dan levy
and I and we would interview six to
eight year old every month at the
meltdown theater with three of our
comedian friends so if you ever looked
for Billy Eichner tlf off to a
seven-year-old we had the perfect show
for you but we have our core audience
actually people looking for that on
Google well they're all on YouTube we
have like Blake Griffin John Mulaney
with so many great comedians come
through and do it there's like nine
episodes on YouTube sweets called baby
talk and then you also go 500 an art
gallery yeah that was right after the
rap career one of the greatest art
galleries here in Los Angeles many times
already a gallery 98 yeah and so
basically when I left the music industry
it ended up sort of bad terms which
you'll read in this book and I needed to
find somewhere where I could sort of
wholeheartedly curate not worry about
someone else telling me something to do
and a gallery's perfect for that like
you can put whatever you want on the
walls and you can live and die on your
decision you choose and and luckily we
got we 13 years later we're still in
business yeah I mean the gallery isn't
exactly a sure thing or on Melrose
that's very regional but eternal yeah
it's a turnover rate of about three
months so we we had 13 years we're
pretty much one of the longest-running
businesses on the block now that's
pretty awesome and you do a lot of like
pop culture
stuff too which is really cool yeah and
directly with the companies a lot of
times like we've worked with Breaking
Bad and lost and the Oscars and the
Avengers and we just did the force
awakens with JJ I have a number of
things that I purchased they're on the
walls in my home you love it yeah a
bunch of Ghostbusters stuff I do stirs
event was amazing but so all of this
stuff all of your very eclectic life all
these different endeavors that you've
been part of our in this book this is
this snow this is just the rap career
just the right yeah this is basically my
my childhood in Woodland Hills
California which is not quite a city of
much minority sure mostly just whites a
lot of Whole Foods and Trader Joe's and
I came up it was the path my passion
since the first moment I heard it and I
became very good through training what
was the first rap you heard was the
thing that jump started it all this is
this group called third base not
necessarily a big famous group but they
were three white dude or two white dudes
really as the rappers and they spoke to
me it was they didn't try to appropriate
the culture I knew even at that age not
this wasn't my music I knew to love it
and to understand it but not to sort of
steal it I heard that through Motown and
things that I studied and so these guys
third base made it their own and that
was the first time I heard it when you
know what I can do this and that was
what I was into yeah that's cool and
then it ends the last day I decide to
rap wow that's cool and you and you me
too
you start of your career just
extemporaneously are sitting down in
writing for the book or for rapping for
rapping writing really first I mean I
mean like sixth grade so like that and
it's still kind of good I mean I look
back at the sixth grade stuff and I'm
like oh this is this is pretty funny and
it's in the book I put some in lyrics
from sixth grade and they're decent and
then freestyling miss Finkelstein no I
was rough I was definitely claiming to
have sex with 6% rap was about yeah I'd
studied long enough that was at the time
at the time and so yeah I knew what to
do and so yeah and then I became I liked
battling battling is what I wanted to do
especially cuz comedy was so engrained
in me and so that's free selling at that
time so that's how I got into freestyle
battling is that I wanted to use comedy
and music and that was the easiest way
do you still rap not much in the last
ten years I've the Clippers asked me
that I'm a huge Los Angeles Clippers fan
they asked me to do a song two years ago
for half time and that was the first
time I'd rapped
on our microphone in a decade so they
put that at halftime and then since for
the book I've put out a couple things I
did a song with Mike Shinoda from
Lincoln Park which we just released for
the book and then I have a song with
Nova Rockefeller from Canada so there's
some things I'm doing I put out a
freestyle for the book so some things
I'm doing to promote and I still have it
so in the book there are a lot of these
sort of interesting like factual
encounters with people like one of my
favorite things that you mentioned in
that you have a trailer for your book I
do it listen if you're not sure about
buying it like go watch the trailer on
trailer we'll sell it it's great no it's
right here and you talk about how mark
McGrath threw you a 25th birthday party
first the 21st birthday party I'm sorry
threw you ochio party and then you never
spoke again we've spoken I've never seen
him again he actually tweeted the other
day I did not send him a free book he
tweeted himself reading the book
congratulating me I was like thank you
so much I hope you like your chapter
with like a heart Oh cuz he was very
nice to me we had a song together and he
was a friend and then after the the he
got a I mean I guess I could spoil this
he got a humungous Virgin Mary tattoo
that night because he was so drunk and
he got a Virgin Mary tattoo on his neck
and then he had it removed shortly
thereafter so no matter how crazy I
think my 21st birthday I did not beat
Marco grass they're like the bull or the
Virgin Mary the Virgin Mary's fine baby
yeah it very much sounds like this was a
not to use a book metaphor but a chapter
in your life that had a beginning middle
and end and you are past it now
absolutely and that's a lot of therapy
that's that's fine there's a therapy
because when you're 19 and you sign a
record deal for a million dollars and
they tell you're gonna be on TRL and
they tell you you're gonna work with
Timberland and they tell you all these
things and then that doesn't come
together as much as that sounds like the
smallest violin in the world it is not
it is very painful for a child it's
alright yeah very hard at 36 I'm a grown
man I'll take any of your disappointment
my parents are divorced I'm fine
when you're 21 and you are you know this
is your job and also I want to
College I graduated I could win another
route I was a sitcom writer by trade
like I could have done those things
instead I lost two or three years
because of rapping sure and it's my
passion but I was promised a bunch of
things and those did not come through
now I feel good but at the time is very
painful yeah I'm sure that's really hard
so what do you think now about sort of
the landscape of I mean obviously we
talked about this with Jackie to people
who are independent able to get their
music out there regardless of you know
labels and things like that like do you
think that if you were doing that you
were rapping now at that age do you feel
like you would have gone through maybe
like a YouTube or a sounds like you have
to feel like you would have done indie
or would you have gone for that record
deal oh look at me I was made to rap on
the internet especially because at the
time you have to understand no one looks
like me in 2006 or sounded like I've
never I've dressed like this I've
sounded like this my whole life it in
2016 it's hard to find a white rapper
who doesn't look like he belongs at
Pacific Sun where like the I was the
first of that mold and I listened to it
back then and went this feels like even
I heard and went I'm it's I'm trying
because I can't be anything else I can't
talk about guns I can't talk about
jewelry I did not live that you have to
be me and it was startling now I
listened to it 2016 and I'm not even
really that creeped out by it it's just
the way the world has evolved and the
internet being a big part of it because
if you're selling realistic rap from a
kid who grew up in a middle-class
suburban home the strongest way to put
that out is the Internet and I didn't
have that at all when Napster barely
started when I got out it's true
democratization of media yeah it helps
it and get to other audiences it creates
subgenres within a larger genre and and
I didn't have that opportunity and I'm
still happy with what I did but I I my
project was made for what would later
become the Internet
do you have a lot of time to listen to
or like look around for up-and-coming
musicians that you're really into is
there anybody online that people should
be able to sing to right yeah I mean
that's what our podcast is called get up
on this and it's me getting people up on
musicians apps movies TV shows anything
and I love a group out of LA called
villain Park no one truly knows who they
are yet they're kids they have some
connections one of their brothers was a
90s underground rapper like I was but
they're incredible and their kids and I
don't even know how many probably a
thousand followers 2000 followers but
they sound like like
back group 90s farside sounding but
their heads yeah Wow in part Dylan Clark
I'm publicizing them they've never
emailed me I've never said you're the
mark McGrath of villain parks life right
let's make it a little nicer
I appreciate the metaphor but so what's
what's the next after the book like I do
want to write more books do you want to
do I mean because you do a lot of things
yeah and so what's what's next for you
well I'm writing right now I'm writing
the ESPYs the ESPN Oscars it's my third
year in a row this year we have John
Cena so I'm super excited about that as
a host are you gonna go for the meme
wait hold on there are a lot of memes
are you talking about John Cena yeah
yeah I'll have to tune in
I'm so jealous because I feel like he
would be my best friend and reason I
mean he would get a lot he seems like
the cleanest guys why I used to write a
pro wrestler I wrote Monday Night Raw
was my first right oh yeah need to have
you on just what I could just talk to
you about that I'm a best huge for us
yeah I did six months in 2005 and I was
a great experience not something I
wanted to do ever again I quit very
easily did you get those crazy Vince
McMahon phone calls where he was like no
change at all no yeah well I didn't get
those calls existed they didn't call the
new kid to do that he was very nice to
me and very sweet and John was always a
bright spot he was the guy who like
walked up to my mother and like
introduced himself when she came like
he's that guy in charm parade Oh through
and through I got politician and so I've
been so stoked to be reunited with him
and be making jokes with him and he went
and bought my book in a store yesterday
don't seem too walked in and bought a
book in my book store bag did anyone see
John Cena but it's been fun and then I'm
