pay for a new car maybe over the
financing and then you forget all about
one of the key components what's it
gonna be worth when you get rid of it
I'm Brian Cooley with the top five cars
2015 models that are rated by their
residual value
now I'm taking our pickup trucks here
because those are just a very different
market and they're often company trucks
so these are 2015 cars and SUVs ranked
by the definitive KBB projections of
residual value five years after first
save number five the Subaru WRX 49.4%
left after five years the WRX has a cult
following I mean can you imagine one
being sold on the use market to someone
who's ambivalent about it you buy a WRX
because you love WRX is and that does
wonders for your residuals you're
selling a religion not just a car number
for the Chevy Corvette forty nine and a
half percent residual the new vet is an
amazing bargain to begin with for its
degree of performance and that does
wonders for its long-term value being a
two-seat car though does limit its
market options the only other one in 58
cars surveyed is the Porsche Cayman and
it came in seven points lower number
three the 2015 Honda CRV 50.8% here we
have now crossed that 50% margin a nice
psychological place to be after a
handful of years the CRV is the
best-selling compact crossover in the US
and some part of that would certainly be
buyers knowing that they're going to
have such a nice residual down the road
number two the Toyota 4runner 54.3%
residual value what do you have to say
about this guy it's a classic and a
rugged way that you feel is gonna last
forever
before I get you to number one the five
worst cars for resale value after five
years along with their miserable numbers
the Audi a5 and Audi a7 virtually the
same Audi comes in back-to-back on the
list it's just the wrong list then
you've got the Toyota Avalon at 36.2
Chevy Impala and then the king of the
stinkers the Mercedes S Class a mere
thirty three and a half percent residual
value after five years if you have one
of these and didn't either
lease it with company money or have us
US taxpayers subsidizing it you're an
idiot
by the way the best overall brand for
value retention is Subaru think about it
they're built tough they're capable
they've got very clear attributes few
gimmicks and also have a cult following
like the WRX within the brand that's
marketing 101 on wheels the number one
vehicles for residual after five years
are the Jeep Wrangler and Wrangler
Unlimited these are the real jeeps to
many people their SUVs that combine a
low price with serious off-road cred and
in the case of the Unlimited there's
plenty of room to bring a couple of city
slickers along on your rock crawling
exploits and being an American icon
doesn't hurt either or top five lists to
