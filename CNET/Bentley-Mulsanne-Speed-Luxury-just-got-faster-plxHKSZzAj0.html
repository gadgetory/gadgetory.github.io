plethora of amazing driving experiences
but some of them are not designed for
the driver some of them are meant for
the person set back here Oh every moment
was painted in gold we were made and the
touchable Souls living life on the edge
no regrets no can't die you know no yard
Bentley finds itself at a crossroad with
one foot firmly planted in its future
but another in its past one part Jekyll
one part Hyde on one side is their new
sporty aggressive look that came in this
century with things like the Bentley
Continental GT and the speed six concept
we saw this year and on the other hand
is their legacy from the 20th century
where speed and aggression were not the
watchwords luxury comfort stature and
firmly under that description falls this
the Bentley Mulsanne
people will sometimes oversimplify the
difference between Bentley rolls-royce
by saying you drive a Bentley you're
driven in a rolls-royce but that's
simply just not the case you don't buy a
Rolls Royce Wraith to be driven in it no
one wants to have to have the driver put
the front seats down so you can clamber
into the back of your luxury car that's
a driver's car equally the Mulsanne is a
hugely long limousine car it's designed
for you to sit in the back this car
alone the gadgets it has in the back are
phenomenal the comfort level back there
has been as much if not even more
consider than anything up here in front
so to say that Bentley's our drivers
cars over Rolls Royces is simply not the
case
but this speed this Mulsanne speed
changes things up it adds that extra
power it gives you that slightly sports
your edge on a car that's not meant to
be sporty in the first place and then
confuses the hell out of me because who
is going to buy this car the Mulsanne is
hugely popular in China one of its
largest markets is out there but they
don't predict that many of these will be
sold over there
these have been targeted at the European
market someone who wants to buy the
Bentley you buy if you want to be driven
but who also wants to drive that car
brass tanks the Bentley Mulsanne speed
has a six and three-quarter liter
twin-turbo v8 engine upfront delivering
five hundred and thirty brake horsepower
and eight hundred and eleven pound-feet
of torque as over a thousand Newton
meters that is a phenomenal amount of
grunt what's even more incredible is
that that peak torque is at seventeen
hundred and fifty rpm right low down in
the range and it stays pretty much flat
all the way up to 4000 rpm
this is a different kind of speed this
is a different kind of delivery of power
this is not built for a track but this
is built for the Autobahn
if you can get an open stretch of roads
and the chance to put your foot down
this car will not disappoint the brakes
however have got one hell of a job to do
they've got over two and a half tons of
car that they somehow need to bring to a
halt and for something this heavy going
that fast that is a difficult job
the hood ornament which in addition to
being a great status symbol is also the
only thing you have to indicate where
the bonnet ends which is usually in a
different postcode to where you find
yourself sitting a five and a half
meters long this isn't the easiest thing
to weave around small Bavarian towns
I've said though right here and now I
can't think of anything I would rather
be in on the exterior there's loads of
little touches which differentiate it
from the standard Mulsanne like on the
Continental GT Speed there's a rifled
exhaust and chrome details around the
headlights which are nice little touches
and if you're down the pub with your
mate ooh also owns a Mulsanne but the
standard one you can point those out as
evidence that you have the more
expensive and faster car but unless
you're an absolute Bentley nerd those
things were largely unnoticed
Bentley maintained that this is a
driver's car they maintained that all
Bentley's are real drivers cars but
really if you're buying a Bentley as a
driver's car is this the one you buy
probably not if I really really want to
drive a Bentley and frequently that
feeling does come across me I would go
for the Continental GT Speed for several
reasons in our previous Bentley film I
went into a lot of detail but why I love
the VW w12 engine I've seen the
Continental GT Speed a phenomenal piece
of work I'm in the minority most people
prefer the v8 but I love that engine
that's not available in this car it's
faster has a higher top speed is faster
260 and it's lighter enough that the
brakes feel like you have more control
over the car than this does now it's
well known that Bentley put huge amounts
of detail into the work and go to great
efforts to create the best-looking
interiors using the finest materials and
the finest artisan techniques and that
is true for every Bentley from the
cheapest Continental GT all the way up
but in the Mulsanne is taken to that
extra level the quality of the finish is
at that premium Bentley style but every
little detail has been considered our
car has fully loaded I pad desk trays
that come out you have at your disposal
a mini office in the back of this car in
fact if you're in the market for an
office this actually might be a more
efficient way of doing business in fact
we should move the ex car office into
the back of the Bentley
there are touches on this car that do
hint at it's more sporty nature or at
least sporty intentions one thing I've
always complained about some Bentley's
are the flappy paddles which have always
been these plastic sticky-outy things
there have been set up for 10:00 to 2:00
driving which always to me indicator
that really no one was ever going to use
them they were not in the right place
for if you wanted to drive fast on the
speed however there at a quarter to
three and they have this wonderful
gnarled metal feel on the back now they
control the 8-speed ZF gearbox which is
one of my favorite gearboxes is
absolutely phenomenal and then the
Continental GT Speed it was unbelievable
and certainly if you plant your foot in
any gear it drops to 3 gears no problem
in a heartbeat this is as good as any
dual clutch gearbox you can get anything
from Porsche Bentley is clearly moving
forward in my opinion if rolls-royce had
never taken them over in the 30s
Bentley today we'd be on a par with
Aston Martin or Porsche for incredibly
fast exciting sports cars but because of
that 20th century run under rolls-royce
it's a different beast now and although
with things like the speed 6 concept
which we saw Geneva this year that
clearly is a drive to become even more
sporty more aggressive lighter sports
cars there is the heritage that's been
brought up over those years that they
would be crazy to throw away you still
see that in the finish of all of their
cars across the range the wood the
leather the effort the attention to
detail is absolutely phenomenal and they
don't want to lose that and they
definitely shouldn't but the Mulsanne
really is a car of its past
we'll Bentley continue to make cars like
this in the future will the audience
that loves these ever dry up possibly
not but is that a shame is that holding
back Bentley from really committing to
being what it really always wanted to be
there's no two ways about it the
Mulsanne really is a reflection of
Bentley's past but that's no bad thing
that history was built on the tradition
of the highest quality engineering and
design but it's not where the mark is
going this however the Mulsanne speed
adds those lessons it's learnt in the
21st century to create something that's
truly the best of both worlds where
performance and speed have been married
with the highest level of comfort and
luxury it might not be the ultimate
drivers Bentley but speed has never been
this comfortable
