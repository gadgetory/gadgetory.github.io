gathered here today to pay our respects
and last tributes to all the technology
that died in 2016 we start with the
tragically short one day life of
Microsoft's first AI chat bot teenager
teh to teach it how to speak like a
millennial Microsoft sent a free on
Twitter on March 23rd but the Internet
is a horrible place and it was only a
matter of hours before people corrupted
her and taught her to say racist things
Microsoft took Tay offline later that
same day another piece of Microsoft's
tech went up in smoke
on 4/20 the company announced it would
stop making the Xbox 360 game system it
had a good 10-year run before facing its
final boss and succumbing to the
ultimate red ring of death on May 10th
gamers faced another tragic loss Disney
announced it would discontinue the
Disney infinity game no amount of pixie
dust and clapping could bring back this
Skylander style game in more than a
hundred figurines which toy stores will
still gladly sell to you for $15.99 a
pop social media lost the hero that
started the live broadcast video on your
phone crazed meerkat paved the way for
periscope and Facebook live in 2015 but
it was crushed by the competition and
removed from the App Store in September
before meerkat had its 15 minutes of
fame vine was giving everyone their 6
seconds of fame in October Twitter
announced that it would kill off the
mobile app for the short looping video
clips the news hit us like a whale of a
duck army but if it wasn't for vine we
wouldn't know about eyebrows on fleek of
course the most gruesome of all gadget
deaths this year was the samsung galaxy
note 7 which was recalled replaced and
recalled again after the company
realized it could not save the phone
that was prone to spontaneously catching
fire ashes to ashes dust to dust
