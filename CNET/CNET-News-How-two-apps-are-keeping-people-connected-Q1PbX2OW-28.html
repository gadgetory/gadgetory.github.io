play and live so it's only natural that
residents are turning to technology to
make them safer and friendlier local
neighborhood watch programs now have a
new tool an app designed to help prevent
crime you can report suspicious people
abandoned vehicles or abandoned property
the app isn't for emergencies 911
remains the best way to report crimes in
progress but it does provide a direct
line to law enforcement the app was
built with 30-somethings in mine first
time homeowners who are comfortable with
tech they wanted instant communications
something that would further connect the
citizens to us in law enforcement
technology is also connecting people who
may be strangers but they share an
important bond geography next door is
yet another social network but it
differs from Facebook it only connects
you to your neighbors it's really more
about utility not social things it's not
about status updates and photo sharing
it's about solving problems getting
together with your neighbors to solve
problems and those problems can be
anything like I need a new drycleaner I
need a new plumber I need a new
electrician next door which launched in
2011 and has grown to nearly 20,000
neighborhood since uses a few techniques
to verify a member's address if they
have a landline we can do what's called
a reverse directory look up and call
that landline with a special code if
their mobile number is attached to their
physical address we can send them a text
message most next door posts follow
under recommendations when you're
looking for a local mechanic asking your
LinkedIn or Facebook connections all
over the world may not be helpful but
the family living three doors down could
know the perfect person another popular
post category crime and safety
accounting for about a fifth of all
posts we got an update from someone in
our neighborhood that there was a woman
who had broken into a house and had
taken a shotgun from this house and was
out on the street waving it around and
it happened to be the same street that
our babysitter takes our son out on when
she's taking him for a walk and so that
was a particularly critical use case Bob
Graham
a resident in San Francisco's haight
ashbury is grateful to next door for a
totally different reason it helped him
find his lost dog they allowed me to
send an urgent message to all of my
immediate neighbors and a longer message
with a photo of to Lulu to the 19
neighborhoods around us a next-door
member spotted to Lulu in a park 2 miles
from where she went missing next door
may be creating online communities but
it's proving to have very real offline
benefits in San Francisco I'm Sumi das
