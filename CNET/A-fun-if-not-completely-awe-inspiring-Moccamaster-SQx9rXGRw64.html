it and we're taking a look at the
technical or mocha master KBG 741 AO
this product is essentially the same as
all of the mocha master line of coffee
drip Brewers the only thing that's
different here is that it has a hot
plate
so it'll warm your coffee keep it hot
after it goes through the brew filter
it's also available in lots of wild
colors like pink as you see here it also
brews coffee in under six minutes which
is very fast you get a lot of the
performance that you expect you have the
design is very similar you've got the
same very easy to remove and clean parts
like this you could just pull them in
and out the major differences with this
machine and the other mocha Master
machines is that it has a hot plate
which is something you don't really see
that often especially in the US so the
automatic brewer will stop the brewing
process and stop dripping coffee from
the filter the minute you pull the craft
out of the hot plate so that's a pretty
nice feature another feature that this
machine shares with its mocha master
siblings is that it has this very cool
clear water reservoir and when you start
the brew process it'll start shooting
bubbles all the way up through this
glass tube and over into the furring
funnel and it's very mesmerizing process
very cool to look at you're going to pay
a little more for this about $30 more
the only problem is this machine brews a
slightly bitter little harsher brew than
the regular mocha master models we've
tested I also notice that the carafe
actually doesn't pour as well as the
thermal carafe that you get with other
mocha master models it has tendency to
drip if you don't know what you're doing
in some cases I have to open the lid a
little bit and crack it open just to
make sure it doesn't drip as it's
pouring if you really want a mocha
master machine that has a hot plate as
well as an automatic drip
Bruce stop then you know this machine
would make a lot of sense and if you're
willing to pay $30 more for the snazzy
color then by all means this is the
machine for you
I'm Brian Bennett for CNN and we've just
taken a look at the technical mocha
