smartphone that's gonna help keep you on
your budget you don't want to sacrifice
any high-end features and I highly
recommend taking a look at the pantech
discover 480 I'm Jessica Dahl court from
CNET and I'm gonna walk you through this
phone now the discover has just about
everything you're gonna want of course
it's got 4G LTE also runs Android
unfortunately it's only Android 4.0 at
this stage but they are looking to
upgrade it's got a really big HD screen
4.8 inches and that's 720p HD it also
has a dual core processor on here and a
twelve point six megapixel camera now I
know that a large camera megapixel size
doesn't always necessarily translate
into good photos but in this case so far
I was pretty pleased with the pictures
that I got outside in the light the body
of the phone is also really nice this is
something pantech usually does really
well there are these crazy 3d speakers
on the side and they kind of remind me
of ears for the phone one thing I like
about them other than the fact that they
seem to work pretty well with sound is
also that it gives the phone sort of a
unique look and feel and I can always
identify the phone in my purse by
reaching my hand in and feeling those
speakers on the side I also think that
it looks kind of cool the design of the
phone is also really nice you still kind
of have a slab form here and it's still
black but there's this nice kind of
textured soft touch finish on the back
that is a little bit unique and the
shape of the phone and some of the
accents make it a little bit different
still definitely looks like a pantech
phone now on the software side it is
Android 4.0 as I mentioned but pantech
has added a couple of its own extra
features so it's got a little bit of a
different menu system it also has this
thing it calls easy experience that it
has on couple other phones too the easy
experience as it's called also gives you
a much more simplified interface for
using your phone now in order to take
advantage of the speaker's there are a
few extra music apps on here like MOG
and it also comes with 18 T's Drive app
which will turn on and help keep you
from texting while you drive the feature
said on the pantech discover is an
absolutely top-notch doesn't have the
quad
processor doesn't have the full 1080p HD
screen however for what it does have
you're only asked to pay $50 with the
new two-year service agreement that
makes the pantech discover one of the
highest value smartphones that you can
get on the market and that's something
that pantech does time and again done
very very well with CNET I'm Jessica's
