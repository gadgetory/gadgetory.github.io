more like a Google product I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your scene that update
microsoft is working on getting
developers more interested in
programming for windows and not just
Windows 10 but also mobile devices one
way it's doing that is giving Microsoft
Office the ability to integrate with
outside apps mobile apps like the car
hailing service uber can work inside of
Outlook all on your iPhone at a
conference for developers Microsoft
showed a demo of how you can use an
Outlook calendar appointment to book a
car pick up from uber Microsoft is also
showing off extensions for LinkedIn so
you can see more information about the
people you're emailing and Cortana the
voice assistant can execute commands for
other apps so you could tell Cortana to
send a text to someone using viber but
back to over maybe someday soon you can
also use the uber inside of your outlook
to order lunch you see that's because
the on-demand car service is expanding
its food delivery service to Chicago and
New York City the same app that you use
to order a car to pick you up can be
used to order an instant lunch delivered
to your door but from my experience you
may find this more of a disappointment
than a convenience goober only gives you
a couple of choices each day here in New
York this week I could pick from a
sandwich or a salad both were about
thirteen dollars I ordered a salad which
came in about six minutes by a delivery
guy walking around with a rolling cart
of food in cooler bags he handed me a
salad and a drink and well that salad
sure looked more filling in the photo
than it did in person it sure wasn't
worth the time savings for thirteen
dollars but if you're in a pinch instant
lunch is possible uber is not alone the
ride-hailing app get also said is
planning to add food delivery to its app
in July but it will go beyond just food
it could also be used to order instant
massages manicures even book a handyman
for home repairs in other news google
has created a new weapon in the fight
against phishing attacks
if you enter your Google password into a
non google website you'll get an alert
that you should change your password
because maybe you just entered your
password into a fake site pretending to
be Google to get this morning you have
to use the chrome web browser and
download the password alert extension
the program stores an encrypted version
of your password and the warning goes
off whenever you enter your Google
password on a form to another website so
this also serves as a nice reminder to
not use the same password you have on
Google with other logins that your tech
news update you can head over to
