world of micro consoles Razer has the
forge TV this is it it's an Android TV
connected device gaming system it cost
$99 use a Snapdragon 805 processor and
Adreno 420 graphics 16 gigs of on-board
storage and what does it do well you
remember the Nexus player and Android TV
what connects to your TV allows you to
stream videos use apps and play android
games this is an Android game asphalt 8
and you're playing on your TV using a
servo controller which is a Bluetooth
controller that Razer is also selling
separately for $80 or you can buy a
bundle for 150 now you can also connect
four controllers to this and play it
once we're using Android games but
that's not even the coolest part
this little forage TV can stream PC
games in 1080p and 60 frames per second
with your PC and you don't have to have
a high end PC to do it this should work
with any DirectX 9 equipped PC including
any that uses AMD or Nvidia graphics so
if you got one lying around with a bunch
of games on it including anything that's
running on pretty much any gaming
service you could connect it to stream
to this there's also a lap board a
turret lap board that is $129 and for
the serious pc gamers this thing is
based on the razer Orochi gaming mouse
it's got a gaming mouse and sort of
magnetically attaches there you unfold
it in your lap and connect with
Bluetooth or 2.4 Wireless to your PC or
to the forge TV using bluetooth so you
could play PC games streaming you could
take it with you as a PC accessory it's
sold separately this is all coming out
soon connected micro consoles with PC
gaming added on it's potentially a
really affordable way to play your PC
games on the big screen affordable tiny
little PC micro consoles
