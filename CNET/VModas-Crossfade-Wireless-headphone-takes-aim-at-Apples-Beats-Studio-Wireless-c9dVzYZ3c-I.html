mission to make a Bluetooth wireless
headphone that would sound as good as
the company's flagship over-ear model
the crossfade m100 which earned AC net
Editors Choice Award back in 2012 on the
surface at least the crossfade Wireless
looks nearly identical to the crossfade
m100 but some changes had to be made to
accommodate the rechargeable battery in
the left ear cup that battery livers 12
hours of battery life which is pretty
decent for a wireless headphone the
headphones wired mode may be as much of
a selling point as it's wireless mode
that's because the crossfade Wireless is
designed to work unpowered as an
analogue headphone and sound as good as
the standard and 100 perhaps even
slightly better thanks to some small
improvements V motors tuning team has
made it launched the headphones come in
a couple of different color options but
the shield's on the ear cups are
customizable and they do come in a
variety of materials and can be 3d
printed to your liking this headphone
isn't the lightest at ten point three or
292 grams but it's really well built has
metal parts and comes with a protective
carrying case it's worth noting that
unlike the crossfade m100 the crossfade
Wireless doesn't fold up it's missing a
second hinge and only folds flat so the
cases are different like the em 100's
this model offers good clarity and
plenty of base and good base at that and
as long as you like a lot of base it's
one of the better sounding Bluetooth
headphones out there but it still sounds
slightly better used as a wired
headphone v-moda would like to siphon
off some of the people buying beats
popular studio wireless headphone and
has made a conscious decision to
undercut beats with a $300 price tag I
think the beats is a more comfortable
headphone but the v-moda is better built
as a wireless headphone some will say
the v-moda sounds better but others will
prefer the sound of the beats alas with
audio sound is somewhat subjective and
sound quality particularly with a
wireless headphone very
with the type of music you're listening
to I'm David Carr night from cnet.com
