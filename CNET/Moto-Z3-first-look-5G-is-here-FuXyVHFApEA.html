phone this is the Moto XIII this is
going to launch as an exclusive with
Verizon at first selling August 16th in
the US this is part of the Z family
which means that it's got these magnetic
pins on the back of course you can use
it with any of the existing mods that
will help customize the look and feel
but the most interesting thing about
this phone is actually that it is all
ready for 5g of course 5g networks
aren't ready yet
but in early 2019 you'll be able to buy
a 5g moto mod that will work with
Verizon's Network and that will bring
incredibly fast 5g speeds to the phone
so imagine downloading 90 songs from
Spotify in 10 seconds that's how fast
we're talking this mod you're seeing now
is not the 5g mod that's not ready yet
but it will work exactly like this
however you're not going to be able to
get that until early 2019 so here is the
phone that you have now it runs the
latest version of Android at the moment
that's Android 8.1 it's got the typical
moto take on the operating system which
I really like
including a new optional one-button
navigation so you can swipe and press
and hold to get around instead of using
the three typical on-screen controls
you're looking at a six inch Super
AMOLED display with two 12 megapixel
cameras on the back and an 8 megapixel
front-facing camera now the cameras on
the back are interesting because in
addition to taking portrait shots one of
those lenses is monochrome so you are
able to capture black and white shots as
well there is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835
processor inside pretty large battery
and a 15 watt turbo power charger now
there is no headphone jack but you will
get a USB C dongle adapter that will
work with that port the phone isn't
fully waterproof but it is splash
resistant and if you want wireless
charging you will need to get the Moto
MOT that supports it the Moto Z 3 will
sell for a reasonable $480</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
