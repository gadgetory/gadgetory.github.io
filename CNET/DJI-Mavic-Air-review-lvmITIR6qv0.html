drone it combines features from to the
company's other drones the entry-level
spark and the higher-end Mavic Pro it
has features all its own though that
we'd like to test out we can't do it
here in the city with all the buildings
and people and stuff so we're gonna go
someplace really special New Jersey
so here the basics the Mavic air is
eight hundred bucks its arms fold up for
easy travel it has a stabilized 4k
camera it can fly for up to 21 minutes
and it has obstacle avoidance with every
new drone comes a new camera so we came
out to the Great Falls in Paterson New
Jersey to show just what it can do
this one shoots at up to a 4k resolution
at 30 frames per second or you can drop
down and shoot it 120 frames per second
at 1080p for a nice slow motion video
even with the strong winds over the
Falls the three axis stabilizer kept the
camera steady and the video smooth and
the quality is generally excellent with
much better detail than the spark and it
also comes with two new quick shot modes
which are basically really easy ways to
take selfies with your drone the new
asteroid quick shot combines a tiny
planet panorama with a droning while the
boomerang gives you a fresh way to do a
reveal shot those are joined by rocket
circle drone II and helix that carry
over from the spark DJ I added gesture
controls that originally showed up on
the spark those controls allow you to
push and pull the drone away from you
take off and land with just your hand or
wave it around and have the drone follow
you in a path it's called smart capture
and unlike on the spark you have to
connect the Mavic air to your phone
first in order to switch into the
gesture mode once you're in there though
you can take off and land just by
putting your palm out in front of you we
might have to do it on the dirt I don't
know there it goes
I can move it around fly it back and
forth it will track my hand as I move
and then if I walk toward it it'll go
away from me and then if I want to stop
and have it walk back with me it can do
that too now if I want to take a photo I
just put up a peace sign next to my face
the controls have gotten much better on
it so you can actually just wave your
hand back and forth and it will move
with your hand you can push it away from
you by getting it to recognize two hands
and then slowly separating your hands it
will move away from you now if I wanted
to go up I just put my hand up put it
down and then I can start the video
rolling just by making a gesture like
that in front of my face so now it's
recording video I can walk with it and
it'll follow me when you're ready to
land all you have to do is put your hand
up get it to recognize you and then
slowly lower your hand and stop
but that's not all the Maverick air also
has sensors on the bottom and back that
the Mavic purlins spark don't have those
sensors work with the new a pass system
which stands for advanced pilot
assistant system which keeps it not only
from colliding with objects but it's
able to go over them or around them so
that it can keep moving with the a
passing gauge I'm just gonna fly it
toward the waterfall and it should go
toward it and up and over it
so having something this small of course
it comes at the sacrifice of battery
size it's got a pretty small battery
pack it lasts up to about 21 minutes
with us under ideal conditions cutting
into your battery life along with flying
fast or high winds is the temperature we
were flying at about 30 degree
temperatures today and we got a warning
on the screen saying it's too cold for
your battery it's gonna have to warm up
so something to keep in mind if you're
gonna be flying out in cold temps look
if you want a small simple drone for the
occasional selfie or aerial shot go with
the spark if you want a 4k camera on a
3-axis gimbal longer flight time greater
range and obstacle avoidance and front
and back get the Matic air</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
