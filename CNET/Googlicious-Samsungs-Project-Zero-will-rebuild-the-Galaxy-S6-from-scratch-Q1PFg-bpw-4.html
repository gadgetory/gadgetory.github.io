Google issues for everything Google that
we can pack inside of a show now the
Nexus 9 is on sale this week and it's
getting solid overall reviews with its
refined construction and design it's the
first tablet to run Android 5.0 lollipop
one of its high points but it's still a
little sluggish performance wise with a
price point aim to compete directly with
the iPad starting at 399 with the same
resolution and aspect ratio for its
screen now for Android users this is one
of the top options for a tablet right
now especially if you're a fan of pure
Android but the best feature has to be
its front-facing speakers and it's about
time that every company do this with the
tablet alright now for the Nexus player
review there's not as many good things
to say about this guy hopefully it will
be more significant as time goes on but
right now it's lack of apps and
developer support hurt it a lot
especially when you compare it to the
Roku Apple TV and the Amazon fire TV so
if you already have one of those
streaming boxes and I'm guessing you
might have a chromecast on the side
already I just don't see the need for
you to add this to your collection at
all for now and the new things from
Google how about their new calendar app
and lollipop that's also coming to
Android 4.1 and higher devices in the
next few weeks now you might not think a
calendar app is that sexy I can but look
at this thing the way it creates new
events with its schedule view and its
imagery make it the slickest calendar
out there now I can't believe I'm
actually excited about a calendar app
and it's also going to be coming to
iPhone users in the future and don't
forget about the nest Google owns the
smart thermostat company is getting a
new software update that provides
improved auto scheduling and a cleaner
interface with faster access to info at
a glance
now nest also recently acquired the home
automation company revolve and it's been
building its works with nest program to
include Dropcam which nest also acquired
back in June now it's not getting the
most publicity yet but quietly nest and
Google are making a push to become your
smart home platform before
competitors alright let's switch over to
Samsung and after steadily declining
revenues and profits in recent months a
report from Sam mobile says the Korean
giant is reshuffling its priorities and
developing the galaxy s6 codenamed
project zero from scratch in a push to
make it it's best flagship phone yet
now you'd like to think that something
every company is always doing some of
the preliminary specs from their
insiders reveal their next phone will
adopt the trend of using more metal on
the device for a premium feel a quad HD
display with no actual screen size
confirmed yet they are still deciding
between a 16 and 20 megapixel camera
that will use the same IMX 240 camera
sensor found on the note 4 and the brand
new Exynos 7420 octa-core 64-bit chip
now there's a lot more specs being
thrown around here and there but they're
all still unofficial and we'll keep you
guys posted and what about the Galaxy
Note edge if this is the phone you've
been waiting for the official release
date in the US will be November the 14th
on all major carriers starting at 399
with the two-year contract now honestly
I don't know how successful this product
is going to actually be and it's really
up to developers to take advantage of
that curved edge but this is hands-down
the most innovative product of 2014 for
me whether it succeeds or fails alright
if you like hanging out at coffee shops
and you want the best Wi-Fi speeds
possible your best bet check this out is
these Starbucks in Kansas City Missouri
at the corner of 41st and Main Street so
what's so special how about up to 100
times faster than usual Wi-Fi thanks to
its Google Fiber connection yes
it's now the fastest Starbucks Wi-Fi in
the US and you can put that into the
Guinness Book of World Records since
really there's a record for everything
now and we end things on a high note it
was recently the 86th anniversary for
the Japanese national tradition of radio
calisthenics now for 86 years people in
Japan have started their days with a
short calisthenic routine that's
broadcast on television so Google
decided to get in on the fun with the
letters of the Google logo to create
their own doodle celebrating this
tradition
oh no potato a snowball it's come cheap
now I also have my own set of personal
stretches in the morning but see net
would not allow me to show them to you
all right that's gonna do for this
week's show you can always email us at
Google issues at cnet.com or tweet me at
Brian Tong and I'll answer them when I
can
thanks so much for watching and we'll
see you all next time for some more of
that Google ishes do you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
