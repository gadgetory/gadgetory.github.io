you might be choosing between the iPhone
10's max and the galaxy note 9 let's
break down the specs and work out which
of these premium phones is right for you
premium phones of course come with a
premium price as you'd expect in the
u.s. the iPhone starts at one thousand
and ninety nine dollars for the 64
gigabyte model but can cost up to one
thousand four hundred and forty nine
dollars for 512 gigabytes the base model
of the note 9 has more storage at 128
gigabytes and costs $100 less than the

Tenace max it's a 6.5 inch OLED screen
and has a resolution of 2688 by 12 42 at
458 PPI Apple's phone comes in space
grey silver or gold while Samsung's is
blue or purple in the US apart from
deciding between iOS or Android
ecosystem your next big factor is
whether or not you want to stylus the
note 9 has the S Pen which you can use
to write on the screen and navigate plus
it also has bluetooth so you can use it
as a remote for some functions like
taking photos the iPhone doesn't have a
stylus processor wise the iPhone uses
Apple's latest a 12 chip while the note
runs either a qualcomm snapdragon 845 or
samsung exynos 9 8 10 depending on the
country both phones are rated as IP 68
which means they're water-resistant but

on the lighting conditions the telephoto
lens is at F 2.4 which is the same as
the iPhone both cameras on both phones
