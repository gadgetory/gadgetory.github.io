carriage in the shape of a horse a new
video revealing just what Unreal Engine
4 can do and you won't believe what
happens next that is deeply upsetting
and a planetarium in London that's
inflatable that allows city dwellers to
look at the Stars very cool yay super
our daily
pretty citizen through the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I'm your
host Ashley Skeletor Denise always the
man who always throws me in the middle
of those cold opens Kayla nagas look I
know that we don't use clickbait so I
always wanted to just like just do well
I just it's just like cold open bait
yeah well yeah but it's yeah you can
guess so it's cold open day you threw me
on that one I wasn't expecting to hear
you'll never guess what happens next
and I wanted to start laughing and I
couldn't don't never guess what I'm
gonna say next
yeah I think I can guess what I'm gonna
say next which is uh if you were looking
for episode 102 one to yesterday oh yeah
we gotta just mention this we got a
little housekeeping here if you're
looking for episode 120 it is published
actually at the exact same time this
episode is going to publish we had an
issue where for whatever reason our
TriCaster decided to go on vacation for
the second half of the show and not
record any audio but fortunately because
producer Logan is so great at his job he
made a backup and so that actually
worked so I have to go in and re-edit
the show and everything which means
you'll get it 1:20 the same time as
today's episode 121 so really sorry
about that
it was up long enough for a couple of
people to respond to the hashtag of the
day and then we pulled it down
immediately well that's good because
yesterday's was the best episode we've
ever done ever of all time and it's
gonna make this episode look like crap
it's gonna make it look like garbage so
if you're binge watching hopefully your
binge watching your binge watching let's
hit the head I don't
now you caught me off guard
just do your news story there's already
too much talking okay um Kayla you
haven't seen this video yet and I I am
dying to see your reaction to it okay
this is probably the best worst robot
I've ever seen in my life and I really
truly mean that this comes from a man
who is a Chinese farmer his name is su
daocheng he likes to make kinetic
sculptures this guy's like really into
making kinetic sculptures and he has
made himself a horse robot a horse robot
um but it looks like it might actually
look really cool when it starts going it
but it's so like charming and adorable
that I wanted to show it on the show
because this to me is amazing this guy
is a Chinese farmer of all the people in
the world you'd expect to just be making
robots this guy probably not at the top
of your list and yet here he is making a
robot like anybody can make robots you
guys if this guy can do it anybody can
so he okay it looks really difficult to
right it looks like it's terrifying
rights gas-powered as well um which
there's an irony in the fact that like
we started we made the car to get away
from using horses to get around in and
now this guy okay anyway he says he
built the horse supply was fields and
honestly did he I really I don't think
he's gonna I don't it's gonna take him a
really long time to get back to his
field he rides his horse all the way
home but I really love the fact that he
also makes other kinetic sculpture so he
also claims to have made a helicopter a
homemade helicopter for his fields I had
I looked and I couldn't find video of
that I'm really sorry you guys but I
really love this video and the sound we
didn't play the sound but it sounds like
a garbage disposal full of dump trucks
flute filled with spoons I don't know
any other way to describe the noise you
know what this is and no offense I love
this is great it's Joe it's amazing like
I said if my grandfather made this I'd
be I'd be like you're the greatest
grandfather of all time this is the most
bleak look at future tech on this show
I'm gonna be really sad this is scary
sighting for sure scare sightings super
scares I think but I like you know they
look at how nice the horse's head look
yeah I was gonna say that
super good I was gonna say that it's
it's a work in progress it's gonna show
but it is so charming embrace iam
whatever is he moving I just it's so
funny to me it really looks like it's
gonna fall apart at any second and again
I'm not trying to be yet so charming and
I'm so proud of and he tonight to be
leaked and judgmental on this show guys
better than we can do because if I had
to make a horse who probably be about
eight times worse than this I don't want
to say it anymore
we accidentally showed you a picture
from the story three that was not part
of Story one but like I said I actually
do think even though it is hilarious
looking to us I'm the Internet it is
actually super amazing that a Chinese
farmer of all people making robots out
there not a guy you would expect you
just take the initiative doing it
himself
and for that kudos my friend kudos good
job you can only get better you can only
get better that's all right tell me we
got unreal for that's great I'm sorry
okay so today released today actually it
was released yesterday now at least
yesterday was this video showing off
what you can do in the Unreal 4 engine
and it's unbelievable if you're just
listening to this podcast you'll watch
it and you'll think that you're just
getting a tour of somebody's housing and
real an employment for saying we have
seen we have seen footage from the
Unreal 4 engine for PlayStation and we
have that check this out ok so yeah if
you see this yeah it looks it looks
amazing it's unbelievable but it looks
like a video game it does look like a
video game and it also exists in kind of
like an imaginary world so it's hard to
kind of lock it to reality ilysm but in
this footage if you can show it again
it's actually of a population a Parisian
apartment now what you're gonna want to
notice is the the the creator Bay no but
I'm sorry but no Derek Daru
okay that's where he was saying who is
he try that CG generalist and level
designer he focused if you want to look
for the detail he focused on light
textures and reflection that's what
that's our bidding
yeah there's reflection the Lighting's
coming in to reflect perfectly um but he
said that this demo is not optimized for
like gaming it's more about just to kind
of show off what it can do and but we
look at it as the future of video games
yeah this is I mean when we think about
what we saw when Xbox 360 and
PlayStation 3 came out we were like wow
this is incredible and I can't wait to
see what its gonna look like at the end
of its lifecycle well like that's the
stuff we're gonna see at the end of the
lifecycle for like Xbox one and
PlayStation 4 so let's talk about what I
always like to talk about which is VR
all right I talk too much but let's talk
about it okay so now immediately both
you and I were like well this would be
amazing let's just live like in this
world or live in that nice apartment
well a user named Chris Jones this guy
has his own channel he actually was
already got the demo he did it he got
the demo because it was out yesterday
it's gonna come out again and he put on
that oculus rift and used the Omni which
is a motion tracking thing so you can
walk around and that he got a chance to
actually walk around the demo okay can I
just say this is awesome because if you
live in a little fleabag apartment now
you just need an oculus rift you look
like you've live in a really nice place
and you can forget all about living in a
terrible apartment if you have a lady
over and she's like your apartment is
garbage put this headset on you were
going to Paris we're gonna go live in my
other apartment my other apartment pair
if you want to check it out they have a
1080 60 60 frames per second one on Ben
OD Rouge channel and then also if you
want to try out the demo he's gonna have
it up on his site he said tomorrow on
Ben no darou comm delay I'll be able to
check it out yourself and walk around
and not crap off the shelves
yeah I'm max ever very that's super cool
okay so that's hash tag of the day
worthy I think and I think the hash tag
of the day should be TD unreal because
not only was that built Unreal 4 engine
but it was also unreal to look at it's a
little bit too realistic I know what
old-school game would you want to see
remade with Unreal Engine 4 okay you go
ahead are you gonna say something like
missed
well I was gonna say you know
because I you love to talk about virtual
reality and I love to talk about grim
fandago hit Logan look if someone
already did it they remade parts of grim
fandago with the Unreal Engine 4 and it
looks stunning looks super good they
remade the Department of Death
the DoD hmm but yeah they redid it all
was unreal and then they made like a
teaser trailer and I was like I want the
whole game like that I know I'm asking
way too much like every time I'm like no
I need more I know it's remastered now I
want it Unreal 4 uh-huh anyway what
about you I think go Zelda Zelda welcome
eyes beautiful force and see like
fairies and stuff and then although Hank
answers I would also like 11 the 11th
hour or 7th guest I wrote down another
one but I forgot what it was yeah I
don't remember what it was but anyway so
yeah that's I like Zelda though that's
right up let's go by the master sword so
TD unreal and then our last story is
really interesting actually this
happened back at the end of November and
I don't know how we missed it because we
never we don't tend to miss these things
but um this is so cool
so this London does this annual night
called light night Canning Town and so
they bring an artist and other designers
to create these like huge art
installations that have to do with light
that sounds amazing and apparently it's
it's in its second year and apparently
it's very popular enough to keep getting
annual year's like it's - okay so it's
new ish and this was the second year
back in November and there was a company
a design company called loop dot pH and
they brought this insane 30-foot tall
inflatable mylar like bubble and it's a
planetarium so people could crawl into
it it was like inflated underneath the
freeway so you could see it like as
you're driving and then zips closed and
then here so that's it looks like at
night like from outside and then from
the inside you can see they're like soup
they're getting everything ready and
here comes a person inside of it they
bring them in and it's all laser
projected stars it's like so you can
look at all of the constellations in the
sky as if you were the earth wow that's
incredible yeah it's really really neat
and it's like I said it's made of mylar
it's a huge bubble it's like 30 feet
tall and they said that they tried
really hard to get a
close replica of the night sky but that
it's not perfect so they said you know
it's not perfect we it's it's close but
it's not perfect because obviously it's
a giant ice one yeah but the thing is is
there is um they have like a
sub-headline for this that the actual
installation is called Osmo but they the
sub headline for this is like a
beginner's guide to the cosmos or
something like that so I really liked
that it was sort of like it might not be
a hundred percent accurate like you know
to scale whatever but it got people into
like going in and stargazing as it were
and especially in a city like London
where there's so much light like you
don't tend to be able to stargaze the
way you would out in the country so I
thought this was really awesome and now
I want it to come travel to the US I
feel like it should I feel like that
should be one that hops for Museum to me
here so you can check it out it feels
like you could really its mylar so
there'd be travel you roll it up like an
old balloon and then just like shut it
out of a backpack or just drop it in
front of here I come down the street can
I get it on prime blah I'm gonna inside
of Planets area mellow yeah yeah I did
that and I thought that was really cool
and I wanted to show that to you guys
yeah awesome so that is it for our
headlines we're gonna take a quick break
we're gonna be right back with another
run of into it because it's Thursday and
then of course we have your your
important yet not quantity wise it's not
a large amount of users if you look
rattled and then we are gonna see our
photogra for the day so don't click away
tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show we've returned
hopefully you can hear audio this time
I'm gonna double check just to make sure
yeah kale actually is also in black and
white so if you're seeing him in color
seek medical attention immediately
that's cool it's Thursday which means we
get to tell you about the stuff that
we're super into and fittingly this is
into it yummy you go first
I don't know it doesn't I don't think I
don't think either informs the other at
all well I may just mean like a setup to
okay I don't know that's fine so I'm
really into face-off
it's like one of my favorite realities
really oh well I love the chunky Brock
who doesn't love face off movie okay
Nicolas Cage is a national treasure see
what I did there
all right so face off the television
show reality TV movie makeup I love
movie makeup I think if I had not gone
into hosting I would have really enjoyed
doing makeup and you know special
effects and I just I dig this whole
world and so the fact that there is a
reality show that sort of shows you kind
of the how to's of you know how
everything comes together is super
fascinating me and I really enjoyed and
the one thing I really like about face
off is generally speaking on each season
they're all friends with each other like
they're it's not a bunch of weird
backbiting like you know how you seen
some reality shows people like I didn't
come here to make friends
oh wait here it's so we're on reality
you know I didn't come here to make
friends I didn't come here to make
friends I came to win
like there's those people this is not
that show yeah go to mine go ahead if
she's gonna get all in my face I'm gonna
take her down kale style there that
would be perfect great reality TV trope
I really like that so for me it's I
really like the camaraderie amongst all
of the the groups and I do like I love
the judges V Neil is you know where my
personal heroes and the owner team
industry she's just super fascinating
has a lot to say about it and then Glenn
Hetrick looks like a vampire which is
exciting start
he also uses own schools make up school
and everything and then I love Neville
page
I really I miss Lois Burwell she was
great last season but they don't have
her back this season but yeah it's it's
been super enjoyable I highly recommend
it if you have sci-fi and can watch it
it's it's super fun and I just I really
like seeing what everybody creates in
such a short amount of time it's really
impressive they put together have you
used any of their tips for your own
makeup yeah yes this is actually just
FYI this is it actually just a full
prosthetic I actually don't have a face
you know
Madonna's character and Dick Tracy that
she plays blank face yeah that's that's
what I look like normally no but have
you actually used like tried because you
said you were gonna get into it no I
like I used to do funny weird side story
I used to do modeling at a at like a
makeup school so people would do like
special effects makeup and stuff on me
like that was really fun it was like
when I was like 18 19 so I get to be
like Cleo crazy like futuristic
Cleopatra and then there was like an 80s
punk rock look there's a lot of beauty
makeup but there was a lot of special
effects stuff in there too so anyway
what are you into this week I'm into
wearing t-shirts to say night party oh
and also knife party I'm nice I'm going
and it's like a really crazy
dubstep band I mean EDM oh wow
formerly the band of formerly the band
formerly the producers I pendulum
created this this other side gig like
band and that is this night party and
I'm actually gonna go see them on Friday
night I'm very excited their last album
is what they're on tour for the last
album was called abandoned ship and it
is basically mostly a parody of the EDM
genre okay
that's interest they mock themselves
they mock the whole genre it's just
every song is a free jokey on it but at
the same time as I like to say
face-melting because when you go to one
of these concerts it's the most intense
experience in a very jarring way but I
your ears are gonna be balloon
I'm gonna go to an EDM concert I'm gonna
go to one that rattles me to the core
and there and is one of those ones where
you're like oh you survived so yeah you
let's so if you don't see kale on Monday
you'll know what happened not everybody
likes knife party I like I'm well aware
especially pretty someone everyone lives
through knife party really the producer
Logan is is not as a fan of everything
yeah cricket noises he just likes not a
nice party not a party so there you go
I'm excited awesome right that's what
I'm into well now that we've talked
about what we're hnu we're going to talk
about what you guys are into which means
it's time for your user feedback before
the audio went out yesterday we had
asked you guys to use the hashtag TV vr
film and tell us what you would want a
movie of in oculus like so oculus studio
but again our video would didn't go up
so we didn't get a lot of them well it
went up for short amount of time until
we realized that there wasn't audio in
the second half of the show so some
people saw it and they we got some
feedbacks of two pieces of feedback and
Jim wrote to us and said I want to
experience a flood and bridge collapse
during a violent storm similar to the
movie of mathematics
I like this concept of experiencing
something super dangerous they'd
probably kill you in real life and being
able to go through it in virtual reality
like Pompeii yeah okay like I'm like
yeah you watch a volcano erupted right
in front of your face and then you get
melted but it's not really just take
your headset off and then Stefan wrote
to us and said a recreation of Lord of
the Rings for VR would be epic yeah nice
job Stefan good choice it'll be a choose
your own adventure where you'd like you
have the ring and you're the you're
Frodo and you have to just find your own
way through I wouldn't give it back I'd
use middle-earth well now I was gonna
say you find your own way through
middle-earth you just be lost you be
walking for years years like this movie
of literally lastly some people wouldn't
mind walking through the world Lord of
the Rings
that's however if you had a chance to
just summon the Eagles and then just
ride to Mordor it seems pretty legit
over I really like that there's a you
you've seen that right the the fury that
Gandalf kept trying to tell them to use
the Eagles like when they were in the
mines of Moria and he
he falls and he's like fly you fools
they chill I keep trying to tell them to
use the Eagles and they never do I got
like this theory damn theory I want I
want to know more about you Bart about
that there afterwards it's it's actually
a pretty like compelling interesting
theory it makes me laugh every time I
see if you did whatever you had waked if
you meant like fly you fools and they
were like oh he wanted bird it's actual
flying oh my god we couldn't figure it
out hello Panthers so it's time for a
last piece of user feedback for the
entire week it's our photogra for the
day so john h wrote to us and he said
longtime listener first-time submitting
i listened to the podcast while driving
to various job sites so i missed out on
all the videos and phone to graphs but i
just but saw this in my drive about the
time you were asking for them I'm using
an iPhone 6 with no special apps or
filters this is near Smith's Ferry Idaho
and it's what an early thaw looks like
on the river here should be frozen solid
but I guess all the cold weather went to
New England this week love the show
thanks okay so for those of you
listening we're gonna describe these
features in detail for you so that you
can feel like you're right there with
John as he's listening the show this
picture right here is a beautiful blue
sky partly cloudy got some trees in the
background in silhouette and then lots
of ice over water and it's all kind of
broken up a little bit what does it look
like it looks like the shots you'd see
where you see a sad little polar bear
going like help me I'm its melting well
that's bleak like no it's it's crazy
because it's all the ice is all broken
up into different layers and and and
different sizes it's giant chunks of ice
like it's really neat I like the
pictures a lot I mean it's that's super
interesting and I feel like I am cold
just looking at the pictures I like that
we don't get a lot of seasons here now
Los Angeles so it's really cool to see
like emergency seasons where it's like
flooding oh yeah stroke fire yeah but
even then we overreacted yeah exactly
hey stroke it's 90 degrees out heat
watch that's pretty cool yeah I
appreciate all the people that are just
listening yeah we do and if you ever
wondering what we look like in case you
