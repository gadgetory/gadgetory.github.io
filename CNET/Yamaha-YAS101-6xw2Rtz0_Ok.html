we're gonna take a look at the Yamaha
why is 101 soundbar now there are a ton
of budget sound bars on the market right
now and they can all start to look the
same but the Yamaha here is actually
worth checking out it's two hundred and
fifty dollars and Yamaha made two smart
design choices with the why is 101
the first is along the back it has a
built-in IR repeater so if your sound
bar is blocking your TV's remote sensor
the Yamaha actually shoots the signal
out the back to your TV now that's a
great solution to a problem that a lot
of people have with sound bars and it's
actually the first product we've seen
that has that kind of feature the second
smart move is that the Yamaha has a
built-in subwoofer instead of a separate
sub that cuts down on the clutter even
more because even though most sound bars
have wireless subs these days you're
getting rid of another box in your
living room and even without the
separate subwoofer the ye-es 101
actually sounds pretty good when you
compare it to other budget sound bars we
had it stacked right up against the
energy power bar which has a separate
sub and while the energy did make more
bass the Yamaha actually sounded better
overall especially on movies and TV
shows a budget sound bar is never going
to replace a real home theater system
but it does make a big difference over
the built-in speakers on your TV and for
a lot of people that's going to be good
enough the main drawback on the Yamaha
is connectivity there are only three
digital inputs on the back there are no
HDMI inputs and no analog audio inputs
now you can still use devices that only
have HDMI or an analog audio connection
but you're gonna have to route
everything into your HDTV first so the
Yamaha is not going to work if you want
it to make a direct connection it also
doesn't have any wireless audio
streaming features like bluetooth or
airplay which are showing up on a lot of
sound bars now so if you want to stream
music directly from your smartphone or
tablet you're gonna need another device
to use with the Aloha still those
shortcomings are pretty minor and
overall the Yamaha ys 101 is one of my
top sound bar picks that solid sound
quality the hell
full remote control signal pass-through
and the convenient built-in sub all for
250 bucks which is a pretty great deal
I'm Matthew Muscovy AK for CNET and this
is the Yamaha YS 101</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
