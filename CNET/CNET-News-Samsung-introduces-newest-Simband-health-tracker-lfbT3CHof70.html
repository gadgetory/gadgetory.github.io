integrated with the world most advanced
sensor modules and this is available for
the research and developer community for
developing different sensors algorithms
and applications around digital health
it is not a commercial product but a
reference designs to advanced digital
health basic sensor modules that we
include we sim band is what we call sim
sense so what we have in here are a
couple of sensors on the optical side
over here you have multiple LEDs
illuminating light in different
wavelengths into the wrist when I'm in
the monitor mode 100 times a second all
of the channels is being transmitted to
the cloud and that allows scientists to
interface with it in the cloud don't
have to worry about hardware and devices
and go analyze the information as a
result we're able to extract things
obviously like how tight but also
extract other variables like spo2
of co2 so the combination of all of
those together with temperature as well
as acceleration in motion let's
researcher develop some of the most
advanced algorithm synthesizing and
combining the different information the
electrical information with the optical
information and that enables them to get
much deeper insights into actually
what's happening inside of our body the
other part in here is something that we
introduced it's a whole new concept
called spot-check and when I activate
the spot check this is like the electric
version or the 21st century of the
nurse's station I'm telling it I'm
standing and it's simply asking me to
hold my hand aim stationary for about 20
seconds I have to keep the ball in the
center and now we are taking this
stationary information which is
consistent and high-quality and send it
over to the cloud for developers to go
analyze it
stress level for example we usually have
about a two thousand nineteen hundred in
my case that I've been tracking very
nicely and interestingly before you go
on stage I've found a number to almost
double
you will go offstage it went all the way
back down looking at my blood pressure
throughout the day seeing how it changes
seeing how many how tight and the tenth
of the day it changes has been giving me
very interesting insights around the
small things that really affect my
health like the SS special that I was
taking earlier or my weakness to all the
desserts so there is the insight and
being able to take this information
presented to the user in change behavior
that's the biggest potential of the
technology and that's where you want to
take</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
