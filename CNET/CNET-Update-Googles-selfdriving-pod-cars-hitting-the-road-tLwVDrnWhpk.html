self-driving car project I'm Bridget
Carey this is your scene that update
Google's fleet of fully self-driving pod
robot cars are hitting the road this
summer Google's taking the program to
the next level of testing when we talk
about self-driving cars there are really
two categories ones that take on the
design and mechanics of a typical car
you're familiar with like this Lexus SUV
a driver can flip a switch to take their
hands off the wheel foot off the pedal
and give the car control google has been
testing a fleet of these SUVs on city
streets but now it wants to test a fully
self driving car with no wheel or petals
Google built 25 of these prototype pods
from scratch these will write on city
streets in California this summer
racking up about 10,000 miles of
experience every week and if a human
needs to take over the drivers can
attach a wheel and pedals we may hear
more about the progress of these pod
cars at the annual Google developers
conference coming up on May 28 the
conference known as Google i/o is where
google introduces new software for
android chrome and executives also show
off new products remember this is where
Google glass made its debut and although
we may not have skydivers this time it
could be hints to the next phase of
glass but then again Google may spend
more time talking about smartwatches a
week after google's event comes apple's
conference to showcase new software
updates last June Apple unveiled
something called home kit on the iPhone
and iPad it serves as a central hub to
control smart internet-connected devices
around your home that means you can even
control something with voice using Siri
apple says the first gadgets that can
work with home kit will come out next
month but another company wants to take
smart home controls away from your phone
the tech startup scenic created the new
me oh it's a disc-shaped controller that
rotates to control different Bluetooth
devices such as your smart lights your
music players or thermostat think of it
as a universal remote but for smart home
gadgets the company is asking for
funding on kickstarter with plans to
release in October there are so many
smart home gadgets these days lights
ovens coffee makers air conditioners but
we don't have smart trash cans yet the
genie cam project on IndieGoGo is trying
to change that you attach a barcode
reader to the side of your waste bin and
scan the barcodes of items as you throw
them away so it automatically adds that
item to a shopping list if you think
that idea is rubbish don't forget
Amazon's tinkering with something
similar the Amazon echo smart speaker
lets you create a shopping list with
your voice commands I remember those
dash buttons for instant reordering
makes the genie can look downright
genius that's your tech news update you
can head over to cnet com for more from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
