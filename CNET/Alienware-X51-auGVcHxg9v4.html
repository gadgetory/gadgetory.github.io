CNET today we're gonna take a look at
the Alienware x51 so this is alien wares
new slim tower gaming PC it starts at
$6.99 a review unit goes to $9.99 though
it has the three gig Intel Core i5 CPU
an nvidia geforce gtx 550 v graphics
card terabyte hard drive and eight gigs
of memory so we know Alienware is
generally a higher-end boutique gaming
vendor but with this system they're
trying to bring it's sort of unique
styling down to the mainstream prices so
this is one of the first slim tower
desktops from Alienware it's also one of
the first to start at under a thousand
bucks it can stand upright or you can
lay it down on set you can make the logo
look right and overall this actually
looks like it could fit into a home
entertainment system it's got a slot
loading DVD drive that's a pretty nice
feature although we wish should have
blu-ray there are some slim towers in
the same price range from other vendors
they actually do have blu-ray perhaps
the most unique feature about this
system though it's here in the back
there's a full height dual slot graphics
card most other slim towers land
half-height cards and i have to be very
low power because of the constraints of
heat and power management that come with
these small cases Alienware those done
some pretty good work in making the
system fast but also pretty compact so
over here on the back we'll take a look
at the ports real quick you can see
there's a couple USB three Jack's USB
2.0 7.1 audio digital audio output of
two different kinds HDMI integrated into
the motherboard although it's disabled
because it has a graphics card installed
you also have an Ethernet port inside
the system those where it gets really
interesting
so there's one screw here we have to
undo those little connector here for the
lights that light up to and where eyes
on the side so there's actually a video
of the whole process of disassembling
the system already we encourage you to
take a look at the review where you can
see us do that this daughter card here
goes from the graphics card down to the
motherboard so that bridge is the PCI
expansion slot and that's how only where
it can do this graphics card full height
going along the side of the PC otherwise
it's pretty straightforward there's a
mechanical hard drive underneath the
graphics card we've got memory down here
and here's the optical drive the CPU of
course is underneath the fan right here
so in our testing we found this is a
pretty decent gaming PC at least for its
price it'll play battlefield 3 at 19
with high detail and pretty good speed
there's no real slowdowns that we
noticed overall it's a pretty solid
gaming system that said it's CPU
performance wasn't that great if you
want to spend a little bit more you can
upgrade to a core i7 chip so that's a
nice option
now this x51 does have a 330 watt power
supply in here which lets it use the
faster graphics card but it probably
can't use a much faster card than that
which you can certainly get in a
standard mid tower all that said I
actually do like this PC and recommend
it to anybody who really does want to
compact gaming system so I'm rich Brown
this is the Alienware x51</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
