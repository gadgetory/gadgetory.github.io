the LG home ba now we're testing the
newest version of that same robot vacuum
and in the three years since then not a
lot has changed it's the same basic
design the same set of features and the
same sort of mediocre cleaning results -
what's new is the coat of paint is black
now not red it's also got a new
accessory that lets you use it as a dry
mop Swiffer style cleaner and the price
is also up it was 800 back in 2013
now the asking price is up to $900
that's more than our favorite robot
vacuums from Nieto and Roomba both of
which I'd recommend over this one the
reason really comes down to that
cleaning performance in all of our tests
the LG home box at at the bottom of the
rankings did not do as well as the neato
Roomba and Samsung models we've tested
it does offer a good variety of cleaning
modes though you can set it to zigzag
across your carpets or break things into
cells or even steer it around the
perimeter you want and have it clean
inside those bounds that's a nice mix
but the other cleaners that it competes
against have caught up they have a lot
of nice features of their own including
smartphone apps now and laser sighted
targeting that can have you point to
where you want it to clean this cleaner
can't do any of that it's got nothing
new to offer to keep up with the curve
in the end the LG hom bot square is a
competent cleaner that will clean your
floor's
fairly effectively but not nearly as
well as Roombas and nito's that cost
less than it will so for that reason I
really can't recommend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
