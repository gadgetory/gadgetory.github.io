we're talking about battlefield hardline
it's the latest installment in the first
person shooter series from visceral
games and EA now hard line moves the
action away from the battlefield and
brings it to the streets it's a campaign
that play is more like a cable TV cop
drama but it's a claim multiplayer mode
remains intact to get another opinion on
battlefield hardline I'm joined by the
host and producer from GameSpot mr.
Chris waters thanks for joining me sir
my pleasure Jeff how's it going buddy
it's going real well I've been told by
our friends here at CBS interactive that
you are a battlefield veteran is that
true and if it is true what do you think
about the newest entry battlefield
hardline uh yeah it's true I've played
uh probably more hours than I care to
admit of the battlefield series over the
years uh the hardline is it is a fun one
it's interesting because it's it's a
real big sion oh it's a split off the
series because the single-player
campaign is a cop drama the multiplayer
is it feels kind of familiar but you're
you're cops and robbers you're not
soldiers and even in previous sort of
balances away from the main military
thrust of battlefield it was always
military now it's like a civilian yeah
it's weird and not only is it not really
on a battlefield anymore it's also very
stealthy right there's parts of
battlefield that aren't shooter II at
all i'm sitting down and play a
first-person shooter and I'm kind of
first-person sneaking you totally are
yeah cuz you're in the main campaign
your you play a cop and you're like on
the straight and narrow so you don't
just want to go around popping dudes
heads off nobody totally can but the
game really encourages you to sneak to
like wait until dudes are alone then
flash the badge then they'll put their
hands up you can arrest them you get
bonus points and you don't trigger any
alarms people don't start shooting at
you and yeah I mean even from like a
basic gameplay mechanic they have the
vision cones which is like a very
else game thing to do right I never
understand how anyone can like put that
into a map vision cones but we won't
split hairs there and you're right so so
part of the game is you flash your badge
and you can sort of juggle three
criminals at once as long as you keep
your your gun trained on their face they
won't go for their gut it always makes
me feel like the rookie cop who's
freaking out like comes up to the season
bad guys if you like fries don't nobody
go like all the rest of you all of you
like it has this kind of desperate feel
to it which is kind of neat that they've
captured it i mean it's also pretty
silly in some ways because you're with
your partner and sometimes your partner
will just be walking by and the guys
don't detect her when she's running and
they're only going to be detected by you
but you know the sort of these these
words still flaws aside I it it is kind
of refreshing what did you think of the
sort of like overall like cop drama like
the characters in the pace like did the
story like interest you it did it did
more so than any other battlefield game
I play before probably any shooter
whether it be call a duty or anything
like that if it felt like it was just
enough for me to care and to not skip
ahead all the cutscenes and just be like
all right this will do this wouldn't do
if I were watching the shield or or you
know a show on FX or something like that
but this is just enough and I mean it's
funny there's a lot of quote for you
yeah just enough for me to care hey
battlefield hardline just enough story
they got benito martinez from the shield
and he was in sons of anarchy to he's in
the game so that made me suspend my
disbelief a little more like I cared
just what was about just what was going
on in the game in terms of the cop drama
it feels a little cheesy some of the
stuff is you know really low-hanging
fruit but it was a little just enough
and I think the presentation also pushes
it a little bit towards that just enough
state you know the way it's like episode
by episode and you get it previously on
and I whenever you start it up and a
next on whenever you quit the campaign
and when you finish an episode it has
this like totally Netflix s like next
episode coming up in 20 seconds so just
really Prime's you to have that kind of
TV watching mentality which i think you
know sort of subverts kind of what
expectations you're going to have coming
to a battlefield campaign let's switch
let's switch gears to online play
battlefields uh hasn't done so well
online last couple of times that's I
guess that's an understatement I've been
a little rocky at launch for some of the
battlefield games in recent memory
that's for sure but I think I mean I've
been traveling this week but uh from all
Twitter indications reddit indications
heartlines multiplayer has launched
smoothly uh for the first week we'll see
what happens this weekend when you know
everyone who is working or at school
gets to like just settle in and play a
bunch but so far it's looking good yeah
that'll be a true test of whether or not
they can handle it but men isn't it
weird that we're just satisfied it works
it works it works congratulations you
pass um what about anything new in the
multiplayer modes is there anything
that's really grab your attention uh
well yeah so like the thing about
battlefield multiplayer is well
especially in hardline is like the core
stuff that I've always really loved
about battlefield is still there you
know the way that you can play different
classes of soldier and you've got
different stuff you can do besides just
shooting nudes faster than they can
shoot you you can heal or revive your
teammates you can repair your cars you
can put down spawn beacons you can you
know do all this different stuff that
not that helps you contribute to the
fight without making you actually have
to fight so there's it's like a feels
like a diverse kind of an action scene
and I really like that for sure I'm a
guy who you know I got pretty good i
call a duty online but whenever I try my
hand at battlefield I just get my face
punched in it's just not a pleasurable
experience to know that I could somehow
help the cause in a different capacity
maybe by you know I mean I think that
for me you know I've never you know I I
love playing games but I'm not like an
ace twit shooter guide like I love
playing shooters and you know there are
kids that will light me up all day every
day but like one of the new modes for
hardline which i think is a really neat
twist on past hardline or battlefield
notes is called hot wire and in this you
basically there are five cars on the map
you have to hijack the car and drive it
at speed around the map in order to gain
points for holding that car so it's like
conquest which was like grab this space
defend this one space but it's more
kinetic it's more dynamic so there's no
like well I cleared the enemies on this
zone now I'm just gonna like wait here
till more show up people don't really do
that they like to run around and so
getting in a car and then like you could
get in a van and then like your buddy
joins it opens the side sliding door
he's waiting there blast someone the guy
in the front seat is using the blowtorch
to like repair your broken windshield
and then you have dudes hanging up
actually remains at anyone who's
following you it was really fun why what
is with the blowtorch preparing I want
you we reflected I Sarge it solves
everything it's science-y tired don't
you're gonna melt the tire more don't
blow torch it they did that in FarCry 4
also that was ridiculous I understand
that yeah what do you want you want like
some wrenches like a little screw gun my
god or no I want home there's not a tool
belt or like some sort of triple-a guy
you know if I don't know I my
expectations are being under achieved
with this whole blowtorch thing I don't
fair enough but you can't kill people
with a blowtorch so that's kind of fun
yeah I've seen some videos of that
that's pretty impressive stuff um Chris
