first look today at the huawei ascend y
for US cellular now this phone is basic
android and it's running android 2.3
gingerbread so if you don't mind which
version you have then this one could
still be in the running it's very
compact it's got only a 3.5 inch hvga
screen so it's not going to be super
bright and crisp but it will be just
fine it's also a little small if you've
got larger fingers you might find that
the virtual keyboard is a little bit
cramped in terms of the way that the
phone looks it's actually pretty nice
while we did a good job here sort of an
accent on the back little design element
and the finish is a little bit rubbery
so it feels pretty gripa bowl camera
specs are on the low side there's a 3.2
megapixel rear facing camera no flash no
autofocus and no front-facing camera
either so it's very simple I wasn't
thrilled with photo quality so you don't
want to ditch your standalone camera
just yet there's an 800 megahertz
processor in here it's probably okay for
what you get with the phone the phone
also comes with a 2 gigabyte memory card
and there's an external slot that takes
up to 32 gigs of memory phone has a
little bit of a smaller battery so don't
expect terrific life on this the pricing
is really nice it will cost you only a
penny in US cellular's 3g network area
and will cost you 29 99 in the 4g area
that is of course with a new two-year
service agreement i'm personally not in
love with this phone at all and i would
recommend other options however if you
are looking for an inexpensive starter
android smartphone and you might want to
check this one out I'm jessica's all
core for CNN this is the huawei ascend y
with US cellular
