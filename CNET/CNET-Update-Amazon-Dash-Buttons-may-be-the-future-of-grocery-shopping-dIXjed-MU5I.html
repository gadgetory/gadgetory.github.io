money on Amazon I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your CNET update Amazon's
one-click ordering is taking on a new
meaning now it's one button click
ordering with a gadget called the -
button the idea is that you'll put
several of these around your home for
different products you could have a
Maxwell House button by the coffee maker
a Bounty paper towel button in the
kitchen a tide button in the laundry
closet and when you're running low press
the button to automatically order more
Amazon Prime members can program the
button to order what they want now not
everyone can try it all at once you have
to request an invitation to the program
which is tied to many popular brands and
products that - button can be a
dangerous thing I mean what if they
start making buttons for other things
like instant Taco Bell now if that
happens we are all doomed
in other news Google is expanding its
operating system and no not Android I'm
talking about Chrome OS which powers
laptops and desktops there's a new
gadget that can put the Chrome operating
system on your TV it's called the chrome
bit this stick plugs into an HDMI video
port to turn any screen or monitor into
a computer you just need to connect to a
nearby Wi-Fi network and you're off the
chrome bit stick will cost under $100
and is coming out this summer there are
also some new Chromebook laptops coming
out the Asus Chromebook flip has an
all-metal design and it's a cross
between a laptop and tablet it costs two
hundred and fifty dollars high sense and
Haier also announced new Chromebooks for
one hundred and fifty dollars these are
designed for students available for
pre-order now Chromebooks are great if
most of your work is done online
remember it's not Windows you can't just
download any Windows program on it
Chromebooks make up about one third of
the education market now in the US but
window still holds on to the majority
with thirty nine percent of computers in
classrooms jay-z's title music service
is making a splash with the support of
more than a dozen big-name musicians to
better compete with Spotify it now is
offering a $10 monthly subscription
that's the same price as Spotify title
stands apart from Spotify in a few ways
there
no free version in fact there's a more
expensive version $20 a month less
Ustream higher quality audio it's
similar to CD quality also musicians are
part owners of title not just jay-z and
Beyonce but we're talking Madonna Kanye
West Alicia Keys Daft Punk and usher
just to name a few title wants to change
the tides so to speak on attitudes about
pain for music because not all artists
are happy with the state of streaming
today but unless they launch songs
exclusively on title there's not much
reason to sign up over Spotify that's
your tech news update and there's always
more on cnet.com from our studios in New
York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
