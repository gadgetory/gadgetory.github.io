standing here beside the time machine
now this is not a DeLorean this is not a
device that's gonna send you back to the
future but it is a machine that promises
to save you time in the kitchen it's a
rice maker it's a slow cooker it's all
sorts of things in one mostly rice
though it's got distinct settings for
white rice brown rice it also promises
to cook that rice faster than other
conventional rice makers now the time
machine promises to save you all this
time by doing a lot of the thinking for
you it's gonna figure out how much
you've got inside of it and how long it
needs to cook for we tested it out I
cook some lunch for my colleagues made
chicken and rice and asparagus a very
nice hearty lunch put all the
ingredients in steamed the chicken and
the asparagus on top and the included
steam tray and it came out fine and
thought about it for a while it told me
when 10 minutes was left and the rice
came out cooked very well the chicken
was moist and tasty the asparagus was
just right everybody liked what I cook
which is not something that always
happens when I cook so I was pretty
happy about that now the time machine is
currently seeking its capital on
Kickstarter it's already passed its goal
it's done very well and it's got about
two weeks left it's expected to ship out
to backers by Christmas as this year
which is coming up so that's a pretty
aggressive timeline this is a company
that put out appliances before and they
were already able to send us a working
prototype so we feel pretty good about
that date it'll retail for about $70
once it's out on the market if you catch
the Kickstarter before it ends you might
be able to get it for about 10 bucks off
the time machine won't however ship
outside of the US right away at least
the company tells me that they are
looking into options for the voltage
requirements of different countries
where there is also interest in this
cooker so stay tuned for updates on that
front thanks for watching be sure to
check out my full first take at cnet.com
along with the rest of my appliance and
smart home reviews for CNET appliances
