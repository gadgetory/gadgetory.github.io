car tech team is what car should I buy
I'm Brian Cooley with a pretty decent
answer here are our top five 2014 model
year cars that we've reviewed as of the
midpoint this year number 5 is a time
the Cadillac ELR and the BMW 428 i they
both got the exact same CNET score but
these two have little income and
otherwise aside from fifth-place and
charting new directions for their makers
the ELR is Cadillacs sporty upscale
Chevy Volt if you will while the 428 is
BMWs way of slicing the 3-series just a
tad too thin the other difference is the
4 is selling like hotcakes
while a two-year supply of VL RS is
sitting on dealer lots number 4 the BMW
m6 Gran Coupe a sort of gentleman's
hotrod both with four doors and
performance beyond your abilities inside
the advanced M Drive settings nicely
counterpoint the connected infotainment
system and it plays out on a huge 10
inch wide screen for what is perhaps the
best single car at doing what BMW does
for a living and isn't it great to walk
behind one and not see a really ugly but
number three the Infiniti q50 S Hybrid I
might say hybridized to be weaponized
pretty good tag line huh Infiniti did
not drop in the electric motor here
solely for efficiency shall we say it's
largely there for go fishin see it's
also got more cameras than a press
conference and an electric steer by wire
system that launches a new era in
production cars inside gobs of tech
you'll use and a fair dose you want
number two is Mercedes 2014's class when
Mercedes set out to rewrite the s-class
they didn't just get out of clean sheet
of paper they grew a new forest to make
the paper from what emerged is a big
fast limo with cutting-edge self
steering technology a vast swath of LCD
everything in the dash but not a single
filament light bulb in the whole thing
it's better in every way
than the s before it and that's not easy
our number one rated 2014 car so far
this year is the Audi rs7 it's actually
my favorite car we've reviewed in years
it helps you get around the track in an
awful big hurry
but then settles down to become this
cosseting daily driver on the street now
Howdy's connected cabin tech needs no
introduction it's really good and the 7
is perhaps the only four-door they make
that people routinely call beautiful
nice car
hi-tech cars and modern driving that's
all we do at CNET on cars.com i'm brian
