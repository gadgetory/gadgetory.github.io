right for you I'm Dan Akron and this is
Samsung ativ book 9 now let's name
samsung is used on a lot of laptops what
makes this one different is that it's
got a 12 inch screen as opposed to a
larger screen and it runs Intel's Core M
processor and it's very slim very light
and it has a 12 inch better than HD
non-touch display if that all sounds
very familiar that's because it's pretty
much essentially the same as this guy
that came out at about the same time
apples 12-inch MacBook again another 12
inch laptop higher res non-touch display
Intel Core M and again just about 2
pounds the difference here is because
this guy is running Windows and this is
running Apple's OS 10 operating system
and of course Apple has very famously
restricted this to a single USB type-c
port while samsung shows you that even
though you've got something that's very
small and weighs the same they actually
managed to fit in one full-sized USB
over here at a headphone jack and a
second full-size USB over here and a
micro HDMI port and that shows you that
you don't necessarily have to strip all
the ports out to get something you know
this small and this light what you what
you don't get is that big extra wide
face keyboard that Apple has on their
version this is a standard Island style
keyboard certainly feels a lot smaller
typing on it then the Apple version but
you get more of that kind of deep
satisfying click because the keys are
actually deeper touchpad is fairly big
but without a touchscreen you really
have to rely on those multi-touch
gestures that don't work as well in
Windows as they do in OS 10 usually on a
Windows laptop like this use a touchpad
for some things you may tap on the
screen occasionally but again here
that's not going to happen
performance is certainly good enough
just like on the macbook version for
casual web surfing netflix streaming HD
video these are not really going to be
all day everyday systems because that
Intel Core M processor the biggest
difference here between them is that
this guy ran for about seven and a half
hours on our battery tests showing you
that that Core M Jeffrey you know
doesn't usually drive all day laptops
Apple however managed to squeeze 11
hours out of pretty much the same
hardware so if you're doing a lot of
like cross-country flying when I have
the coffee shop all day that's something
the key
in mind our other big issue is price
Apple very expensive $12.99 for eight
gigs of RAM and a 256 gig SSD the
Samsung version for the same specs is
actually a hundred dollars more $13.99
but you can actually cut that down to
four gigs of ram in a 128 gig SSD for
$11.99
so sometimes it's less expensive
sometimes it's more expensive I'm Dan
Akron and that is the Samsung ativ book
