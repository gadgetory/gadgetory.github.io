amount of joy
I love the immediacy I feel riding a
bike through a city and stopping off to
explore shop or cafe the downside to
such adventures is needing to lock my
bike up and even that doesn't guarantee
that it won't be stolen
last year latus released the elipse
smart bike lock packed with sensors
batteries a solar panel and Bluetooth
that connects to your phone there's no
key instead I lock and unlock it using
the ellipse app on my phone or touch the
keypad built in to the side for basic
locking and unlocking the app works
simply enough I tap the big blue button
on the screen and voila it's locked
tap it again and bam it's unlocked the
built-in keypad has four arrows button
and it feels like touch technology from
ten years ago I found a painfully slow
deliberate touch work best to enter the
passcode the ellipsis forged from
hardened steel similar to other premium
bike locks the shackle is flattened to
make it more difficult to cut off I wish
there was an option for a longer shackle
because it was near impossible to get my
frame wheel in a parking meter pull
within the ellipse and close it though
the smaller design is pocketable and use
the lock was okay though I definitely
had some struggles using it for example
trying to hold two pieces of the lock
together and my phone and tap the screen
was tricky I felt it was only a matter
of time until I dropped my phone which I
did
hence the cracked screen however the
ellipse app does provide a hands-free
alternative called
auto lock and auto unlock when these
settings are on I closed the ellipse
around my bike in the rack and then as I
walk away the app triggers it to lock
the same thing happens in Reverse to
unlock it this works pretty well but is
not consistent sometimes it takes a
while for the phone to detect the lock
also I wish the ellipse could be
integrated with Apple watch or wear OS
to free up your hand for locking but
since the ellipse is smart it has
built-in batteries and there are two
ways to charge through the micro USB
port or via the cleverly designed solar
panel during the months I used a lock it
always had a charge thanks to that solar
panel though I'm curious how long these
batteries will last over years of use as
far as protection my bike wasn't stolen
when I was in Bluetooth range and had
theft detection on it notified me when
it thought somebody was tampering with
the lock
there's also crash detection which sends
an SMS to a person you choose I have the
ellipse on my handlebars while riding
and the bumpy streets shook it enough to
trigger a crash detection notification
lattices approach to design is spot-on
but the execution doesn't hold up well
in real-world use it's inconsistent and
frustrating the app needs some
improvements too especially the sharing
feature for 199 dollars in the US it's
hard for me to recommend this lock</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
