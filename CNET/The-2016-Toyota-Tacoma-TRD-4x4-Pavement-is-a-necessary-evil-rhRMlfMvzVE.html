is excellent offroad I mean people bomb
these things through the desert but you
know often you got to go on the pavement
to get to the dirt so we're gonna test
this truck unlikely places
and from the street you just might make
some head turns cuz this is one mass
looking truck the Tacoma has got a new
front fascia with the taller hood
streamlined headlights featuring LEDs
and new for this year is an easy touch
tailgate you've also got an available
locking bed cover for securing all of
your gear and the TRD off road gets a
few touches all its own including a
special 16 inch wheels and a chin
spoiler delete because really who needs
a spoiler eating into your approaching
under the hood I've got a 3.5 liter v6
but a 2.7 liter is available on the
lesser trim models however this larger
engine is going to knock out two hundred
and seven eight horsepower and 265 pound
feet of torque
now when the truck is not in four-wheel
drive power goes to the rear wheels via
a six-speed automatic transmission but
get this you can get a six-speed manual
and it's sixteen hundred dollars less to
vote yeah if you've already combined a
for the automatic are twenty miles per
gallon and what of the trademark laundry
basket rating well I've got a five foot
bed here and that includes a light and
check it out
it's a hundred and 20 volt outlet right
here so I can plug in my hair dryer and
fix my hairs after all this windy day of
shooting behind me I've got five longer
baskets this one makes six and that is a
most excellent trademark laundry basket
rating inside the cabin it's a pretty
comfortable place to be for an off-road
truck my heated seats are most excellent
I've got a multifunctional steering
wheel front and center here is a little
digital display where I can scroll
through to see things like a compass a
pitch and roll monitor my speed my radio
but what I really like is the in tune
system because the inputs are super
crazy quick I mean check it out I can
get myself to Disneyland thirteen
thirteen okay harbor H a r B o R I mean
check that out super fast very very
responsive to my touch I also have
satellite radio iPod connectivity in
terms of driving aids there's blind spot
monitoring which is really great to have
on a tire truck like this and there's a
wireless charging system which
unfortunately my iphone is about a
thousand years old but all you need to
do is put it down here on the platform
and it will charge right up
this is the operative model so you do
get a fair amount of offered goodies
like a locking for active you get a
train select system for all control and
Bilstein shocks but does that help her
hinder me when I'm on the road well I
got to tell you the Bilstein shocks it's
set up really soft right if you ever
seen a trophy truck out in the desert
and the like the Baja 1000 and the
wheels are just going like this and the
cab stand straight of course this isn't
quite that extreme but the suspension is
set up very very soft so it's so Chuck
the bumps very nicely here's what I
don't like about it and that is the
transmission I've got a 6-speed
automatic and it's just searching all
the time it cannot figure out what gear
it wants to be in now I can shift it
manually which helps because then I am
in complete control of the truck but I
feel like this truck should be able to
work on its own in the transmission I
really should only have to use the sport
mode when I really really want control
of the truck not in everyday driving
situations acceleration on this not
quite so good and that's fine for
offroad where you're really feathering
the throttle but on this like if you're
trying to get on to the highway you
really do have to give it the beans and
oftentimes the transmission just can't
handle it what I do like about the
Tacoma is the steering it's got a great
on center feel it's got nice build up as
you get up to speed and it's very
precise I mean you know exactly where
you're placing your wheels which is
great for off and on road one thing I do
wish this truck had is a trailer backup
assist you can't get that on the Ford
f-150 can't get it on this and as
someone who knows how to drive a trailer
forward but maybe not so much backwards
that would be a big help in this truck
there is a fair amount of competition in
the midsize pickups the Chevy Colorado
and the GMC Canyon are both just dying
to take a bite out of this taco the 2016
Toyota Tacoma TRD 4x4 off-road double
cab new starts at thirty three thousand
seven hundred and thirty dollars but our
optioned up vehicle is just over 37
miles now for me I really love the offer
of capabilities I love the looks just
not in love with the transmission so I'm
gonna go ahead and go with the six-speed
manual that's it for today I'm Amy Hall
thanks so much for watching we'll see
you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
