Bridget Carey at cnet com and it's time
to get loaded today's tech headlines are
chock full of rumors and anonymous
insider sources and I normally don't
report on speculation but this is
Valentine's Day a time where mystery is
somewhat romantic causing the most buzz
today is the Wall Street Journal
reporting that the next iPad will
support 4G wireless speeds from verizon
and AT&amp;amp;T and it also reports Apple is
currently testing out a smaller eight
inch iPad also expect the ipad 3 to be
announced the first week in march
according to all things d and when you
round up all the other rumors if they
are true the next iPad will also have a
faster quad-core processor and higher
resolution front and rear camera you
might start seeing PlayStation games on
HTC's Android devices sony entertainment
network announced last year it would
allow for early PlayStation games like
crash bandicoot to be played on non Sony
devices but a new report from the
website pocket-lint says HTC has made a
deal with Sony the announcement could
come at the end of the month the next
xbox game console might have a
controller with a touchscreen at least
that's what xbox world magazine is
reporting the control there could look
something like the PlayStation Vita with
a touchscreen in the middle of the
control pad this next Xbox controller
would double as a TV remote a web
browser and display for game information
the concept is pretty similar to what
we're seeing in nintendo's new console
the Wii U which also has a touchscreen
in its controller and other gaming news
don't expect much work to get done today
because angry birds is now on facebook
the game is free and includes an
exclusive Facebook level as well as new
special effects and power-ups those
power-ups like sling scope for laser
targeting bird quake for shaking things
up and supersedes to supersize your bird
they all cost one dollar 420 uses and
you can gift the power-ups to others
because nothing says be my valentine
like a king sling and windows lovers I
hope this doesn't break your heart but
the colorful windows logo will likely be
retired windows 8 will say goodbye to
the red green blue and yellow flag for a
solid color for pain flat
window that's slightly angled Toy Fair
is going on this week in New York and we
spotted quite a few cool new tech toys
mattel is coming out with a whole line
of figurines including Barbie Hot Wheels
and Batman that interact with ipad games
there are even figurines that are made
for existing games like fruit ninja and
angry birds Barbie now has a digital
camera built into her for designing cool
graphic tees and the force Flyers an RC
helicopter that is controlled by a glove
with a built-in accelerometer so it
moves with your hand gestures those are
your headlights for today I'm Bridget
