cloud-connected smart speaker with an
artificial intelligence named Alexa
packed inside along with streaming music
and reading headlines and giving you the
weather forecast Alexa has a growing
role in the smart home to controlling
smart gadgets like Philips Hughes
color-changing bulbs and Belkin Wemo
switches but Amazon echo also has a
channel on IFFT a free online automation
service that helps you sync it up with
web services and other smart home
gadgets and now you can actually create
custom voice commands to control those
other gadgets let's show you how to do
it
first you'll need to set your Amazon
echo up just plug it in and download the
Alexa app to your Android or iOS device
and you'll be able to walk through the
pairing process in just a couple of
minutes next you'll want to go on to its
website and if you haven't already
create an account once you're all signed
in you'll be able to activate that
Amazon echo channel now it's time to
craft a recipe that'll have Alexa doing
our bidding
once you're all logged in you're gonna
want to click on my recipes on the IFFT
home page then click create a recipe
you'll see the if this then that
template the if this is the trigger part
of the equation that's the thing that's
going to trigger your recipe and that's
going to be Amazon echo so click on the
blue this and then select Amazon Alexa
that's the channel for Amazon echo
you've got a number of different trigger
options it can be when the timer goes
off or when you add something to your
to-do list but the one that we want is a
specific phrase so select say a specific
phrase as you're triggered so for us
that's say Alexa trigger my recipe so
I'm just going to write my recipe on the
computer now that we've got the Amazon
echo trigger setup let's go to the then
that side of the equation that's going
to be our action the thing that happens
and we tell Alexa trigger my recipe for
our purposes let's go with the Nest
Learning Thermostat I like this one
because Amazon echo isn't a works with
nest advice it doesn't have a custom
thermostat integration that's where it
really shines
it helps devices that don't normally
work together work together I'm going to
go with turn the fans on for 15 minutes
but there's plenty more you can do to
you can browse through all the channels
on it to get some inspiration all using
Alexa all thanks to IFFT i'm right chris
for CNET appliances for more summer
