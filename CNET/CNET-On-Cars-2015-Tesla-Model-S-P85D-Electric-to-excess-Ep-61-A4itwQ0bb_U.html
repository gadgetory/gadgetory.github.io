mind of its own
hacking cars is it really that easy and
the top five reasons you might want to
buy a new one it's time to check the
tech we see cars differently we love
them on the road and under the hood but
also check the tech and are known for
telling it like it is ugly is included
at no extra cost the good the bad the
bottom line this is CNET on cars
welcome to CNET on cars to show all
about high-tech cars and modern driving
i'm brian coulis well the last time we
had a Tesla Model S sin for a deep
review I had a few things on my wish
list more performance was not one of
them but that's what we ended up getting
with the new p85d a performance model
with dual motors has also got an early
taste of Tesla's vision of autonomy
let's drive it and check the tech
for all its advancements the Tesla Model
S was missing some pretty basic things
all wheel drive and any kind of driver a
sixth I just got caught up let's drive
2015 Tesla p85d check the 10 rather
quickly
now on the outside as you can see these
nudie model Tesla Model S's are very
familiar it's what's happening
underneath in two broad areas first of
all the details you've got dual motors
which also rolls in all wheel drive
secondly a whole new wave of autonomy
driver assist to the degree of
self-driving even is coming in phases
let's start with the drivetrain though
now a Model S traditionally had a single
motor at the rear driving those wheels
these new D cars add a second motor at
the front to drive those wheels to the
tune of 188 horsepower at each end if
you get a P or performance model like we
have the rear motor gets bumped way up
to 470 horsepower and the front a bit
higher to 221 for a massive 691 total
that gets this nearly 5000 pound car to
60 in just 3.2 seconds range is down but
only slightly from a standard rear wheel
drive model S overall charge time
doesn't change much in the new car with
a single charger that comes built in
about eight and a half hours option the
dual charger you get that down to about
four Tesla supercharger gets you 170
miles of range in 30 minutes and if
their battery swap stations come to
fruition you'll swap the whole pack in
just three minutes
now all wheel drive comes in many
flavors of course there's that which is
aimed very much it dealing with tough
conditions and that which is aimed at
performance this one is clearly looking
more like a performance setup though
it's certainly going to help you when
you've got lesser traction then there's
the new autopilot which is what Tesla
calls their driver assists that means
adaptive cruise that maintains speed and
distance to other cars along with the
ability to come all the way to a full
stop and resume to be honest nothing
other cars didn't have a couple years
ago ditto this cars new ability to read
speed limit science and alert you to the
correct speed now highway lane changing
is interesting you can do it by just
signalling our car currently just does
the acceleration part for you but
automatic lane change steering is coming
as well self parking and a Tesla means
the car not only parks in a spot that
you pull alongside of but eventually
will bring itself out of that spot into
you at least on private property now
inside the Model S nothing has changed
on the p85d
a quick refresher these cars are laid
out differently than yours
here is the giant Center LCD that can be
used in one or two modes you see Google
Maps is one you'll commonly have up
here's one that may be an eye-opener a
live web browser that even works while
you drive over there in front of the
driver is an all LCD instrument panel
with your main sort of speed range gauge
in front of you on the left you'll get
navigation when you're under navigation
and then on the right you've got about a
handful of very quick shortcut menus
that largely replace things that are
buttons on other cars and the media
choices on these cars are similarly
monitoring of am/fm HD radio of course
then standard they include streaming
radio like slacker and tune in through a
built-in 3G radio interestingly optional
is satellite radio only with a pricey
audio upgrade and of course you've also
got bluetooth streaming and a couple of
USB ports for mobile devices
now screens that show the new features
of this car under the controls menu
first of all if you go to driving here's
one that's very telling acceleration can
be sport or insane that takes full
advantage of both motors at full tilt
and under settings you've got what Tesla
calls their autopilot technology and
that adaptive cruise control by the way
should be able to take us all the way
down to zero and then back up to full
freeway speed as traffic conditions
warrant ok I'll be honest with you if
I'd done a top five improvements I
wanted in the existing Model S greater
performance would have been number six
just listen on my list these are all
good performing cars however this is now
one that has notable performance as you
saw in the zero to sixty numbers these
PID fives by the way there p models they
also have an improved sport suspension
that is also highly variable in height
so combine all of that with the fact
that you've got that big old belly full
of battery keeping this thing planted
and low centered and it's just an
amazingly grippy stuck to the earth
performance sedan it always takes me a
little time to get used to the
fact that I have 86 knees no drive
controls in this car you just have the
pedal on the right and that's it no
sport mode no Sport Plus no need me need
to get this in that dialed in you just
step on it harder it's amazingly elegant
but we're so used to having gadgetry
between us and that it's a little
jarring when you drop this thing into
insane mode like I showed you it's
insane
how could a car that weighs nearly 5,000
pounds do what that thing just did
however it's also a bit of a head-fake
I would trade all of that insane mode
nonsense and all of the seconds they've
shaved on it zero to 60 time for a
vastly shorter battery charge let's not
lose the real fact on electric cars
these p85d which are top of the stack
performance dual motor models are coming
in at around a hundred and six thousand
base and then we would add about another
eight thousand dollars in options but
due to the almost $10,000 in tax credits
available at least here in California we
end up actually below the MSRP but still
not a cheap car this technology will
also be very interesting as we see the
all-wheel drive get much more accessible
in the coming Model X

p85d top of the stack for Tesla at cars
dot cnet.com you've probably noticed the
other guy's headlights a lot more in
recent years that's because technology
has made them brighter and made them
move in a moment we'll find out if they
really are blinding you or if you're
just imagining that when CNET on cars
continues
adaptive front lighting systems or these
swiveling headlights that some cars have
have been clearly linked to lower
insurance claims on cars that have them
and also been proven to give drivers
earlier detection of objects ahead on
the road yet a lot of folks think that
these swiveling lights create more glare
when the other guy has them and they
still remain pretty rare on a lot of
cars
let's find what's going on in October
2014 the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety had 20 sample participants few
cars with oncoming headlights of
different types and rate the visual pain
if you will on what's called the Devore
visual discomfort index now
high-intensity discharge headlights are
really bright white ones like we have
here rated higher than standard
headlights as you might imagine on that
discomfort scale but not in the realm of
being unacceptable what's interesting is
the swiveling or adaptive front lighting
system headlights did not rate
meaningfully higher than ones that are
fixed dead ahead another finding by the
IIHS is that these swiveling adaptive
headlights can allow a driver to spot
something as soon as a third of a second
sooner on a curved road that can
translate to let's say 15 feet sooner
detection of a pedestrian let's say when
you're driving at 30 miles an hour BMW
and Lexus were among the first brands I
encountered with these adaptive front
lighting systems almost 10 years ago
back in the 2004 model year now 10 plus
years later they're still kind of rare
as of 2014 14% of models of cars that
were offered in the market had them
standard 22% had them optional still in
the minority of the market so adaptive
front lighting despite its documented
benefits and apparent livability still
remains in the luxury tech category not
the you must offer it safety tip
category next time you buy a car it pays
to double check if it offers these
headlights that give you a bit of an
edge
welcome back to CNN on cars coming to
you from our home at the Mount Tam Motor
Club just north of the Golden Gate
Bridge well think about all the ways
your cars connected these days yes start
with that Wireless key fob that's one
form and now look at the apps in your
dash maybe your car's pected through
your phone or it's got its own built-in
data radio 3G or 4G and soon cars will
be self-driving but then they have to
talk to the infrastructure of the
Internet and to each other what about
the hacking potential a number of you
have written in and asked about the
landscape and here's a car Tech 101 that
has some thoughts on that
as recently as five years ago reports of
cars being hacked were out there but
they were viewed as either apocryphal or
just unlikely to scale then this
drumbeat of headlines began March 2011
UC San Diego and University of
Washington teams they're able to hack
into a mainstream production car via its
cellular data connection getting access
to drive system May 2013
nitsa establishes its first team to
monitor car hacks and develop standards
against them that are still pending
August 2013 Charlie Miller and Chris
valasek get into the backbone of a 2010
Prius and 2010 Ford Escape in a
demonstration that they do through the
obd2 port which is in every car mate
since 96 they get access to steering
braking displays and more
summer 2014 a teenager spends 15 bucks
at RadioShack and is reportedly able to
remotely unlock and start a car at the
Battelle cyber Auto challenge apparently
not much of a challenge for him August
2014 prowl LinkedIn and you'll find job
listings like this one from Ford that
reads almost like one from a defense
contract in February of 2015 in
Sausalito California a thief appears to
walk by a locked car holding some kind
of device that isn't the key but it
still unlocks it and he steals a fifteen
thousand dollar racing bike from the
back a typical new car today has maybe a
hundred micro processors in it networked
together by Al and teaming with a lot of
shared information that passes by most
of those chips all of this given shape
by up to a hundred million lines of
software code these are cyber physical
systems so effectively when you're in
your car you're in a computer with
wheels but what is the robustness and
the resiliency of that entity probably
far less than the laptop that you can
sitting on a table at home Mary Aiken is
a cyber psychologist and real-life
inspiration for the new show CSI cyber
that CBS just launched on Wednesday
nights I'm a cyber cop her concerns
underline four things going on in the
connected car the processors and
networks increasingly control important
stuff a car systems are increasingly
interconnected get into one part of the
cars electronics and you may be on your
way to getting into the rest third these
systems are increasingly exposed to
wireless interfaces from a wireless key
that can remote start your car to
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi for streaming and
hotspots and built-in cellular radios
that power the car's telematics or
concierge service and finally the
internet as with everything else
connected via it it's a non proprietary
shared infrastructure intoxicatingly
powerful efficient and scalable but
shared is shared that means good guys
and bad and unlike our personal
computers
we're just about no two are alike with
different software settings security
software configurations and so many
parameters vehicles tend to be pretty
homogenous add to that waves of cars
heading to showrooms this year with
apple carplay or Android auto installed
potentially setting the table for yet
another layer of common hack efficiency
hack one the fear goes and hack them all
and with cars on us roads currently at a
historic high of eleven point four years
old average whatever vulnerabilities are
going out there will likely remain me
for a long time in a moment whoring your
car a cocktail which could also end up
being one of my top five reasons to buy
a new one
CNET on cars continues
the iconic British vehicle some people
want to modify them and put lots of
blingy bits on and other people just
like the off-roading some people never
take them off road and they're so
adaptable
everything's bolt on and you can just so
easily change them into what you want it
to be buy more from the ex car team of
CNET UK @c Netcom / r welcome back to
CNET on cars i'm brian coolie here's the
part of the show we take one of your
emails and this one comes in from
gearhead drew he writes I just saw your
excellent episode on the 2014
mercedes-benz s550 which had a great
diesel engine and gave excellent
insights on modern diesel advantages and
improvements his question is could we do
a little spot on octane in gasoline that
would educate the average consumer on
the myths and confusion of what octane
is and what it does and he also adds by
the way can my car run on Jim hmm okay
first of all draw him please to say we
have covered octane it was a while ago
though so you may have missed it it's
back in our episode 44 June of last year
of 2014
don't worry about digging for it I'm
going to put a link in the show notes
for this episode at CNET on cars.com we
did quite a deep dive on it but in a
nutshell if you've got a car that is
designed and says requires high octane
gas you should put it in there or you
are muting both its performance and its
efficiency not good it's generally worth
the extra money to buy the better fuel
on the other hand if you're putting
high-octane gas into a car that couldn't
care less you're wasting money it
doesn't make that engine more powerful
or more efficient so don't do that
either basically give the car what it's
designed for you can't goose it either
way by going up or down the gasoline
quality ladder now ask to your more
interesting question can you run your
car on gin no not the car you have now
however there was one car that did to go
back in the 1960s the Chrysler Turbine
car a low production but production car
that had literally a turbine engine
running it incredible rpm to drive the
wheels and this was a vehicle that was
able to
gasps kerosene perfume just about
anything you could dump in there it
would find a way to burn because it was
an extremely high compression engine you
could run it on gin because the
apocryphal story is the President of
Mexico had one and ran it on tequila
from time to time but unless you find
one of those no it's just not a
combustible enough fuel so add an olive
and use it yourself now not only are we
at a time of particularly low gas prices
here in the US we're also at a time of
very old cars on the road because we
haven't been buying them in such great
numbers in recent years partly because
of the recession
partly because cars are made so well
they don't beg to be replaced as on and
partly because Millennials seem to show
a little less appetite first rushing out
and buying a new car when they get their
new license however if all those are off
the plate and you're in the market or
wondering if you should be here my top
five reasons why you should buy a new
car now I'm looking at technology and
engineering see changes here I'm leaving
out the financial piece and the simple
factor of new car lust those are up to
you let's go number five is
upgradability I do put this one low
because it isn't real common yet but car
makers are beginning to make the most
recent cars with software that can be
upgraded after you purchase them
particularly for the head unit Tesla is
famous for doing these updates over the
air Ford has sent out millions of DIY
upgrade USB drives that you plug in and
do yourself and many other car makers
will upgrade your software when your
car's in for regular service you could
end up with some nice new features on
the main screen the results can be great
or sometimes not but without a late
model car you can't even find out number
four is lighting from high-intensity to
automatic high-beam to headlights that
steer themselves front lighting has
really changed test drive a new car at
night and then get back in yours it's
like driving by candle light and for the
oncoming car it's like being
interrogated
number three is LCD touchscreens
now I put this in the middle of my list
because having an LCD screen with touch
or a controller isn't necessarily better
than
additional knobs and a dot matrix
display see my Ford touch but in general
you'll get more choices more control and
more information available on an LCD
than any number of old-fashioned knobs
and buttons though Honda and Acura try
pretty hard to overload you with both
today all but the least expensive cars
are shipping with at least a color LCD
in the center step number two is
connectedness but you say your current
car already has an iPod connector and
satellite radio aren't you adorable
today it's all about USB ports built-in
Pandora tune in and Spotify streaming
apps wireless bluetooth streaming from
your phone and maybe even connected nav
and destination search these are things
you'll use every time you drive but only
in the most recent years of cars now I
still don't make these number one
because your smart phone can graph most
of this onto an older car with at least
an aux jack and a windshield map before
I get you to number one two recent car
tech trends that I wouldn't even make
number 10 voice command and rear seat
DVD systems why because they suck come
on car makers get voice to work at least
half as well as my phone and DVDs still
really the number one tech change that
is going to affect you everyday in a new
car its turbo charging and direct
injection this is the dynamic duo that
have changed automotive power usually
found in combination di and turbos have
meant a wholesale move to cars with
smaller engines with fewer cylinders
that still deliver more power better mpg
and lower emissions and this is the
innovation on my list that you will
literally appreciate every second your
car is running
