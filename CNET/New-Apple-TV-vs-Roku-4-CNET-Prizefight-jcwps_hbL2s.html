in the battle for streaming box
supremacy never stops it's a prize fly
put out between the new Apple TV and the
Roku for our judges for this fight our
section editor David the gun show chats
Meyer and you-know-who reeling a ding
dong we'll take each round score and
average them out to the nearest tenth of
a point the final prize fight score will
be an average of all rounds using the
same system let's get this party started
round 1 is designed Apple TV brings the
same Apple TV design but this time it's
taller it feels more solid and they've
ditched optical audio its touchpad
remote has a high-end feel to it with a
rechargeable internal battery and that
touchpad navigates as smooth as butter
the Roku 4 brings an all-new design with
a thinner but much larger footprint and
it's optical audio is still here the
remote is still the same with its d-pad
and its buttons that directly launch
apps you'll need to eventually replace
its batteries but it's nowhere as sleek
as the Apple TV's the Apple TV takes
this round with a perfect 5 and the rope
who gets a 4.3 next round is user
interface and navigation Apple has
improved its UI with a glassy
transparent feel that's speedy the
touchpad remote feels excellent to
navigate with and it's the smoothest UI
on a streaming box you'll find scrolling
through video to the very second with
the touchpad makes all the difference
when you're watching series voice
control can really drill down to be more
specific
but it only applies to TV shows and
movies action movies from the 90s it's
not integrated into Apple music or
really any other major apps and you'll
have to learn what it can and can't do
the top row on your home screen is also
now fully customizable unlike the
previous Apple TV's now the UI and home
screen for the Roku 4 hasn't really
changed that much it still has the same
look and feel and it's just as
customizable as before but it feels
stale compared to what Apple has done
this time around video channels on the
Roku 4 can look very different
stylistically and it's visually jarring
and just not as elegant Roku's my feed
lets you follow upcoming movies TV shows
and actors and notifies you when there's
new content its voice search is linked
to its Universal Search that
shows you all the absent prices to find
that content Apocalypse Now but you
can't drill down to something like funny
Jim Carrey movies from the 90s with
Cameron Diaz or you could just save the
masks Apple takes it with a perfect 5
and Roku gets for dr. Abdul two rounds
the new Apple TV leads round three is
features if there's one killer feature
on the new Apple TV it's the App Store
the touchpad remote is great Siri is
pretty good but needs support across all
the apps you can still airplay content
from other Apple devices and it supports
bluetooth headphones and gaming
controllers it even supports 3d gaming
with a 3d TV out of the box and yes
there is still no 4k support but it
always comes down to the apps this new
Apple TV is like getting an iPhone
connected to your TV and although there
aren't a ton of apps right now the ones
that are here are enough to show its
huge potential and really it's just a
matter of time for the developers
now the Roku 4 brings features that you
can use right now it has 4k support with
a video section that features content
and movies that are viewable in 4k but
we're still not at the point where it's
a standard in the household its
Universal search is still tops the
headphone jack directly on the remote
for private listening is still brilliant
but they went another step further with
a remote finder feature that lets you
press a button on the Roku box and a
sound emits from the remote so you'll
never lose it the Roku takes round 3
with a 4.8 and the Apple TV gets a 4.3
next round is content content will
always be king and if you're locked in
the Apple ecosystem you can't go wrong
here but you'll also be missing a whole
lot that's outside of Apple's walled
garden it has the core of Netflix HBO Go
Hulu and YouTube like everyone else and
airplay can help make up for some of the
services it's missing the App Store will
be huge in the future but is just
starting out and there's still no
streaming TV subscription service in
place now the Roku 4 has been the king
of streaming boxes because of its 1000
plus channels of content Amazon Vudu
sling TV crackle Spotify Pandora RDO and
more you won't find any of those
on the Apple TV and there's also this
app called CNET that I really like
now Roku takes another round with a
perfect 5 and the Apple TV gets a 4 so
after averaging 4 rounds the Apple TV
still leads by a hair the final round
that decides it all in value the applet
Eevee starts at 149 and it's the most
expensive streaming device on the market
right now with Apple's premium price if
you're an Apple fanboy or fangirl that's
in the ecosystem it's a better value for
you now the Roku 4 is $129 you're really
paying for the 4k compatibility and it's
the most expensive Roku to date but the
judges still think it's a better value
in the final round the Roku 4 gets a 3.8
and the Apple TV gets a 3 so let's
average out all 5 rounds and after Apple
took the first 2 Roku came back strong
taking the final 3 and barely takes this
battle 4.4 to 4.3 and is your prize
fight winner now seen it actually rated
the Apple TV slightly higher but this
always comes down to what you're looking
for if you're in Apple's ecosystem the
touchpad navigation and the potential of
the App Store makes it a no brainer but
if you want the device that brings the
most content possible on planet Earth
that's jam-packed with features then the
Roku 4 is for you
I'm Brian Tong thanks for watching and
we'll catch you all next time for
another prizefight
