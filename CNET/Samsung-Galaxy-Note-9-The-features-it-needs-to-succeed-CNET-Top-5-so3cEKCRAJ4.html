to see in the next samsung galaxy note
the note has served as Samsung's send
the experimental line for a while the
first one had a huge screen compared to
other phones on the market at the time
it had a stylus then it got an edge the
note eight was pretty great but it was
essentially a note seven do-over after
that hole exploding battery thing here's
what we want to see out of a note 9 and
number five is the little things hey
Samsung Heat the little things that make
the note excellent keep the headphone
jack the waterproofing the wireless
charging and the expandable storage let
me tell you the story of the Samsung
Galaxy s6 for some reason the s6 did not
have water resistance or expandable
storage this was after the s5 which had
both of those features
hopefully Samsung does not get rid of
the little things on the note 9 coming
in at number 4 is a remappable Bixby
button honestly we would like that on
any Samsung device that has a Bixby
button now I'm not saying that Samsung
should give up on its assistant dreams
I'm all for competition however it would
be nice if Bixby was picked by users by
choice and not because it's the only
option and number 3 stylus improvements
the S Pen is the defining characteristic
of the note
it already has 4096 levels of
sensitivity one strange thing is you
can't just turn the pen around to erase
you press a button on the side to
activate the eraser let's get a racer
functionality built into the top of the
S Pen number two a three-d front-facing
camera yep the iPhone 10 has it yep this
would be copying Apple and yeah it's
still a good idea it would make
intelligent skin which is on the galaxy
s 9 a more secure plus it would improve
Samsung's weird AR emoji take a look at
how Samsung's current generation of
cameras handles those animations not
exactly smooth also a 3d front-facing
camera would be useful in other of
mented reality applications and the
number one thing we want to see in the
Galaxy Note 9 is notches maybe include
five little notches essential phone
style or maybe one really long notch in
the middle of the phone bifurcating the
phone screen now that that would be
awful
really want to see it's a fingerprint
sensor in the screen we've seen the tech
and a vivo phone already the fingerprint
sensor on the note 8 is in a slightly
odd spot the galaxy s 9 moved the
fingerprint sensor to a better location
and in screen sensor might be the best
option and we want to see that in the
galaxy note 9 that does it for us thanks
to Gestalt court for helping us out on
this episode what do you want out of
your next phone note or not squeezable
sides 14 cameras in the back maybe just
better battery life let me know am i as
actor i'll see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
