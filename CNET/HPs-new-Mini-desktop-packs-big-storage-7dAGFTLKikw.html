can top the Mac Mini I'm Dan Ackerman
this is the HP Pavilion Mini I guess if
you're making a small desktop you want
to have the word Mini in it it's one of
the few small form-factor desktops
that's a new design that we've seen in a
while it's actually smaller footprint
wise than the Mac Mini although it's
still thicker now this starts off very
low-end for about $300 a little bit more
you can get a Pentium processor we have
an upgraded version right here with an
intel core i3 and a one terabyte hard
drive so that's fairly hefty considering
this thing cost 479 dollars now if you
add $20 more you can get the actual
entry-level Mac Mini which is this guy
right here that seems positively huge by
comparison but again a little bit a
little bit shallower for $500 you get a
Core i5 CPU so but faster but you also
get a smaller 500 gigabyte hard drive
and if you want to use this as a you
know a media server and hook it up to
your TV you might want more storage
space without spending more money I
found that in benchmark test both of
these systems we're actually just about
as quick they're not superfast but for
watching movies online and even doing
basic office stuff and an even basic
Photoshop they'll both work just fine
this is especially well set up as a
media PC because it has HDMI and
DisplayPort outputs it's got plenty of
USB ports and unlike the Mac Mini 4
you're slightly under $500 you actually
get a keyboard and mouse you don't have
to buy those separately and they're
wireless we do have to of course bring
your own monitor or TV I'm Dan Akron and
that's the HP Pavilion Mini</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
