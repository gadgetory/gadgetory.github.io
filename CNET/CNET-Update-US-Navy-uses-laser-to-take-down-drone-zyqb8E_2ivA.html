I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update the US Navy announced plans to
put the first laser weapon on a ship the
laser can set a drone on fire and send
it crashing into the ocean as seen in
this YouTube video from the Navy the
first prototype is expected to be put on
a ship by the end of the year what's
interesting about this weapon is that
each time it shoots it only costs about
a dollar and energy to power it but
lasers might not work well in bad
weather like rain or fog next up for the
Navy getting sharks with laser beams
attached to their foreheads the full
review of the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is
now on cnet and this is the tablet
that's going against the ipad mini our
editor said it was a stunning tablet and
Samsung's best yet but the fact that
it's four hundred dollars is a hard sell
it's seventy dollars more expensive than
the ipad mini and it's not as thin or
light but it does come with a stylus pen
so artists and those who like to jot
notes down might say it's worth the
price selling it for more than Apple
shows Samsung's confidence these days in
its products and customer base it goes
on sale thursday april eleventh in the
last update i reported on rumors that
google was in talks to buy the messaging
app called whatsapp well perhaps it's
not true an executive at whatsapp told
AllThingsD II that there are no talks
with Google but there have been previous
reports of the app talking to Facebook
about an acquisition so it's not the
first time we've heard this popular chat
app might be for sale if you've been
inside of starbucks you know about those
free itunes app songs and ebooks that
you can get on a car near the register
well they're called pic of the week and
now there's no card required to redeem
the free downloads starbucks visitors
can access the freebies from the
starbucks app when connected to the
in-store Wi-Fi network starbucks is
launching this new feature by offering
the angry birds star wars game for free
here's some cool science Japanese
scientists say they have a way of
telling what you're dreaming about just
by looking at brain patterns during
sleep so for example if you dream about
a cat your brain will show the same
pattern the next time you think about a
cat what if you dream about being in a
dream
ception android users will notice that
the Google Play marketplace app has
gotten a makeover the layout is cleaner

new things to download faster so you
