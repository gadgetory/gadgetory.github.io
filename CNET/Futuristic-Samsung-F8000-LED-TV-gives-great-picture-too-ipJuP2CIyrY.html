this is the UN f8000 from Samsung it's a
55 inch LED based LCD this video review
will apply from 46 all the way up to 75
inches in the series this is Samsung's
best led-based LCD for 2013 and
basically the best I've ever tested from
the company it's superb in a bunch of
different ways including significant
feature improvements as well as really
slick design and the capper is excellent
picture quality again the best I've seen
from Samsung in a number of years will
start off with the design though this TV
is beautiful on the exterior it's got a
really really thin bezel you can barely
notice anything around the edge what
makes it look even thinner is that it's
black right adjacent to the screen it's
a little bit of silver underneath and
the stand virtually disappears behind it
it's kind of an arc-shaped one of the
downsides however is that the stand is
wide enough that you really need to
encompass the entire width of the TV
with your table top so if you have a
slightly narrower table top it will tip
over that actually happened to me so
trust me you really want a nice wide at
least the width of the television
tabletop with this TV of course you can
always wall-mounted and get that super
minimalist look from the side the TVs as
thin as anybody to expect from an LED TV
it's got this little bulge on the bottom
here but really all told it's again
extremely thin and light another nice
faster the TV's design is the Samsung
logo is incredibly small you can even
turn off the illumination so again one
of the nicest looking TVs I've ever
reviewed Samsung's 2013 smart TV suite
is among the best in the business it
does have the ability to control your
cable box via this on TV selection
there's also recommendations that the
system will use to recognize and
recommend shows it thinks you'll like
really not big not a big fan of that but
I do like the fact that the TV can
control your remote so potentially it
can replace your cable boxes interface
in practice however if you use a lot of
DVR commands like play fast forward
you'll find that your DVR remote is a
lot more convenient that's because
Samsung's remote really doesn't have
that many buttons a lot of the stuff is
stashed on a virtual remote here so you
actually have to summon the virtual
remote drive to the command you want for
example play or pause and that's the
only way to control the DVR so if you're
a heavy DVR person it's really not the
best system but if
really like to watch TV live it really
might be a nice thing to have those
recommendations going the rest of smart
TV suite is a little more standard it
includes a social aspect there's also a
whole bunch of different apps Samsung
has more apps than anybody I really like
the new design it's very clean and you
can navigate very quickly a lot of that
is thanks to the quad core processor on
this TV there's also the ability of
course to access video on demand and you
have a search Samsung includes its voice
search as well as just your command so
you can press a little button on the
remote and summon up the voice search
and it worked relatively well limited
testing also appreciate it again that
you can make limited gestures but again
with this TV it's not nearly as good as
having that remote control but of course
we do misplace the remote you can always
control your TV by waving at it new for
this year Samsung has a little pop-up
camera so it's not always staring at you
so you can hide it if you're not a big
fan of that camera you just want to
maintain as much privacy as possible
other notable features on the f8000
include four pairs of included active 3d
glasses they're about twenty bucks
apiece so that's a pretty good deal
there's also a plenty of inputs on the
back of this TV including 4 HDMI there's
three USB and a couple of analog ports
so really nothing goes missing in the
connectivity department as I mentioned
the top what really sets this TV apart
from other LED TVs we tested is the
picture quality Samsung includes a micro
dimming scheme on this television that's
different from it's less expensive model
that allows the TV to control different
aspects of the screen increase or
decrease the brightness that's known as
local dimming on some other televisions
and it works very well in this case it
produces really nice deep black levels
plenty of contrast and there's very
little blooming or loss of shadow detail
compared to some of the other local
communities you tested color accuracy is
also excellent as is the video
processing picture uniformity which on
previous Samsung's was an issue is
excellent on this TV as long as you
maintain the correct local dimming
settings and you can't see any of those
blotches at the dimming is working
properly so I'll told the UN f8000 is
pretty expensive but if you're in the
high end of the TV market and you're
allergic to plasma which offers even
better picture quality it's an excellent
alternative that's a quick look at
Samsung's best LED TV the year the UNF
8000 series I'm David Katz meijer from
cnet
