but with Hoda and what sort Hoda and
Kathie Lee yeah what else we're not that
Joe okay hello to get to the very
beginning you guys have heard of the
ipad 3 right we've talked about it a lot
o thing it's called the ipad 3 and I
apologize for ipad saturation but at
this point and we were going to give it
a break arrest except for that the
internet and the world and fate doesn't
want to give it a rest because it seems
that there has now been consensus among
the Internet community that the ipad 3
is going to come out in March let's
trace that like we talked about ipad 3
rumors all the time but in the last week
it's been every min
of the day yeah every single one of them
is like aha we agree it's march on how
we greet smart every publication that's
talking about it so that seems like it's
a pretty big deal oh here comes the
first champagne burp sorry it just
implies that there's gonna be many watch
out thank God you guys are listening in
ok but so if we trace this rumor about
on the ipad 3 coming out in March
forgive me it goes to all things digital
is the latest and most high-profile
person to kind of put their weight
behind this rumor and what they said is
that the ipad 3 will be coming out
indeed in March citing anonymous sources
anonymous sources drink up your
champagne or your metaphorical champagne
and the details are a little bit scant
that this source revealed but they
insist that the ipad the next generation
ipad will have a better chip so
presumably the a6 which is what we've
been saying all along um although there
had been some speculation that the a6
wouldn't be ready until June so I don't
know about that and improved graphics of
some sort and bumped up resolution now
the all things digital rumor did not
specify whether bumped up resolution was
going to take it all the way to the
level of resolution resolution that was
the retina display the return of DS dead
exactly um and everybody talks about on
the show before there have been some
talks about how difficult it is for
Apple to kind of figure out the
technology of making an a Retina display
that would be big enough to be on the
iPad and they've had some manufacturing
setbacks and they've been like speeding
up processing at in China to try to
figure it out and going back and forth
with which way they were going to do
their LEDs is that because they don't
want it to be like if they put this
technology in there they don't want it
to be it'll be too thick is that the
bish it'll be too thick and in it
thicker I guess which is already tooth
and it's about the density of pixels and
so in a smaller place it's easier but
once you create so much more space you
have to get all of these things into
what bigger screen and then with the way
that the LEDs in the background are
worked out it there just wasn't a
precedent for it gotcha um so there's
the first rumor now I'm going to just
give like
by rumors about ipad 3 right now because
there's been so many of them uh the next
one is playing off of this March release
date except for then it's totally
deflating everybody's bubble bursting
everyone's joy which I love this is my
favorite I mean and this one makes the
most sense honestly um and that comes
from at the New York Times the old gray
lady my absolute favourite newspaper of
all time and very reputable and the New
York Times sites yes an anonymous source
but not just anyone not just a friend of
a friend of a friend of whoever they met
at a cocktail party but rather an
anonymous Apple employee they claim so
maybe he's drink yeah I mean who an
anonymous in the blog post they say oh
and the Apple employee would like to
remain anonymous because as you know
Apple frowns upon leaks obvious
understatement your diet they literally
get fired and not open to me to get
fired but shunned yeah to a different
planet like they get yeah they're like
shipped off to Siberia to work on that
gulag that's the factory um anyways so
the New York Times says yes it does this
anonymous employee does indicate that
it's going to come out in March however
this anonymous employee suggests that
the ipad that is in production and
that's wandering that's floating around
the halls of Apple and that people have
seen looks exactly like the ipad 2 and
it's not going to have a large redesign
but so now what they say it will have
are all the things that we wanted to
have which is this person says yes a
Retina display a better battery which
already has a pretty good battery so yes
the span a long time even on my first
generation ipad is like I leave it on
for weeks and weeks and weeks on it
never die do I have one that I use for
work to help program or iPad app and I
literally have not because I barely ever
use it and it's just here in the office
I haven't charged it in two weeks and
you leave it on I bring it on yeah it's
good because the screens never used so
it never loses battery but so this
anonymous employee says it will have a
Retina display better battery and
improved camera thank God if that camera
such a piece of crap by whoever me I
mean really the facetime que ya 5
semaines I don't I'm not gonna go to a
concert and be that douchebag who's
holding up my iPad taking a picture with
the back camera ever like yeah nobody
that's like holding up your lappy only
time that I kind of thought it was a
little bit awesome but it was kind of
awesomely horrible was well also this
whole thing was a horrible incident but
there was the time when the protesters
in Oakland got pepper sprayed in the
face and in the video of it there was a
man holding up now and he was using that
camera yeah me see how dekaney exactly
at that moment it wasn't intended for
that purpose but he got he caught that
whole scene right cuz of his eye
ninety-nine percent is he holding up and
I exactly really protesters you a
ninety-nine percent let me take out my
five hundred dollar device and just
throw it I mean not to get completely
sidetracked but that also is a
commentary about the state of america
because we are the ninety-nine percent
and yet we put an ipad on our credit
card because i want it exactly on our
meetings very true part of the credit
card is the ninety-nine percent exactly
i'm only way of life exactly yeah
looking as someone who has debt I'm big
debts over here so sorry and whatever my
dad let's all turn for our own good God
Stephens like my dad but I don't we have
a lot of credit card yeah I have a lot
of help oh good boy makes me feel so
much better because every time I look at
my credit card statement I'm like oh man
I'm the only one who has this much debt
but then all my friends do too so we're
all just I know but then we can't we
shouldn't enable each other way but we
also should be smarter we also shouldn't
hate each other our sake don't hate
ourselves exactly each other like have
intense incessant stressed nightmares
about it like okay anyways so it'll have
a Retina Display better battery and
improved camera it doesn't actually say
anything this rumor does not say
anything about the a6 chip which is
possibly an indication that they would
save it for the ipad 3 because this
rumor is suggesting that the new ipad
that's coming out of march is the ipad 2
s which would make
so happy because I because I feel like
that is how that is because then I feel
like I'm inside of apples mind because I
know them and i feel like i said this
like five shows ago or whatever that
that is how they're going to get more
people to do it do the test track and
the normal track and so people who are
have an ipad one and want to upgrade
real fast are going to get a to ask yeah
and then the people who have an ipad 2
are going to wait for the three and then
we'll and a couple who don't have
earlier and then what anyway don't have
any of the 2s exactly so many friends
who've been asking me who don't have a
tablet at all who are like um i finally
decided that i want an ipad i finally
decided that i want a tablet should i
wait for the ipad 3 and I don't know I
mean I round up the rumors but I don't
actually know what it's coming out I
think I have a gut instinct about it but
it's not it's not fact and so I've been
saying to them like I don't know if you
want it just get the ipad 2 because it's
good enough it's wonderful that's funny
because um david carr know he had a
story recently that we did the exact
opposite doc opposition said that his
friend just bought an ipad tune he's
like what are you doing like it
announcement is literally in two weeks
but i might put to my own credit i will
say that that story came out once the
the March rumor was already sorted it's
true so like in january / like you could
still be coming out in September I was
saying like if you need it don't wait
till sep tember just get it but this
makes way more sense look at the to us
though they'll run out and get it in
droves so that seems like it would be
disappointing and also likely oh but I
mean that the iphone 4s is not a bad no
and once everyone got over themselves
and stopped complaining about how it
wasn't called the iphone 5 right and
everyone was happy about it i mean yeah
okay yeah i don't know i choked on my
chimney she's crying okay so sad about
life and she was that and in love with
apple's iphone or ipad for us idea um
yeah so I but that's true if they would
have called the iphone for us the iphone
5 it would have been like Harold is like
the greatest invention of all time and
I've mentioned this once before but when
I have a friend who works on iphone team
at apple and who shall remain anonymous
oh and he told me that when they were
working on it they really thought they
were working on
iphone 5 and it wasn't ya later so maybe
all these people think they're working
on the ipad 3 and then there ya it was
like the marketing team who said to them
actually that this is gonna be called
iphone 4s and they who had developed it
were like really ok yeah whatever what
are they can yeah they're like it's
still awesome zillion-dollar okay and
I'm gonna run through this really fast
because we're running out of time and
I'm totally bogarting at all the next
rumor it in regards this comes from
Macotakara our favorite favorito and it
is an image potentially of what they say
is the new Retina display if you look at
that image if we can pull it up it is uh
that's it yeah what is that I I have no
idea I cannot decipher that flicker you
know what I saw that picture too and I
was like is that New York at night yeah
it was totally and desirable I mean
clearly like that's a little bit of
birds what is the hack otakar says that
the bottom of that is the motherboard
and it looks like the motherboard that's
in the ipad 2 that's right next to the
retina display I don't know I can't
speak to it but there it is the next
report um comes from ventureBeat
reporting that I more which is another
of one of the Apple focused blogs on the
internet that is cluttering up the inner
tubes and that I'm ever heard of the
editor-in-chief of which says that he
has a reliable source who is anonymous
that claims that the exact release date
of the ipad 3 will be march seven I mom
so I'm totally in the market for an ipad
3 and if they put out a 2 s I'm not
gonna get it I swear to God see you're
well one of the one your scent cuz do
you already have an ipad 2 no I don't
have any ipad at all oh so you anything
you might as well wait for their you
don't whisper through my hairy I got a
tweet from somebody I forget what that
person's name is sorry but they said
that it's coming out March 7th because
it's going to be a 9.7 it like it's
something with the seven like that's
where they got the seven in the march
seven was because seven be a seven-inch
seven-inch or nine point seven or some
point whatever and then I said maybe
it'll be a 3.7 and it's actually going
to be an ipod everybody would and then
everyone's head would explode okay then
the two other rumors up
I really just want to mention really
quickly is that there's some supplier
chain chatter that points to a smaller 8
inch iPad that's one rumor that's
happening that also came out today and
another one is that the ipad could have
4g man it better that is a big deal um
first of all it would mean it's on
verizon probably oh no verizon in the
rumor is verizon and AT&amp;amp;T would sell a
4g ipad um who does this come from an
anonymous source of course another
person briefed on the matter who would
be briefed on the matter come on um I
actually think this is likely because 4G
adoption is picking up there was a lot
more 4g spectrum out there and the
current iPad has 3g so if they can get
on 4G why wouldn't it be great I don't
know how many people buy the 3g ipad
compared with the Wi-Fi ipad i mean like
i wonder if that's such a big market
because or the 4g I numbers no numbers
on that because I feel like when we
recommend buying the ipad to get the
Wi-Fi one because usually use it you
don't use it necessarily on the bus or I
guess you do me you see some people
using someone's and I read on it on the
bus whatever whatever but like there's a
very small segment of the population
that is using it outside of the home or
outside of a coffee shop or someplace
that has Wi-Fi anyway even Bart even our
public transportation here has Wi-Fi now
yeah like the needing to buy a separate
contract for it forth IG seems I also I
wonder how many people are actually
using none of that I also think that
like if you have the ipad as you're
saying most people who have it also have
a smartphone which has internet
connection so if you need while you're
on the bus to look something up or
whatever and your ipad can't connect
even though it can play movies play
songs and you can read books and all
that stuff you can just do it on your
smartphone although I have to say that
like even this morning I was running
late and I wanted to continue doing work
and I needed to get into our like
in-house cnet tools and I was wishing
that on the bus my ipad would connect
even though that sort of been so
embarrassed yeah to sit on the public
muni with my ipad i would have been
mortified
and then I would've been like its work
issued that's true and so now some
people in the chat room are saying that
they don't think that they will launch a
4g ipad before an iphone that house
porgy that's very interesting and then
whatever the iphone is just on a
different release schedule right that's
true and then then another person said
that um GPS would be nice to happen that
you can it would be fat though that is
what use 3g yeah because I don't think I
mean the mini go outside you don't have
anywhere hello anyway okay there's also
somebody in the chat room called rumor
doesn't have it just now thanks a lot
remember wasn't a vase i also had Corey
Feldman in the chat room so whatever
they even you my so hot okay let's move
on to rumor number two because we're
running so late I remember number two
also has to do with Apple of course
citing anonymous sources drink drink
drink I'm going to keep talking a 9to5
mac says the apples and talks with Sam's
Club which is like Costco I think but
it's always been our exams that I've
never seen a sams color and that you
have that in the Bay Area there's
someone in the bear their ROI noble I'm
a costco member so I guess you wouldn't
necessarily be a member for both it's
overkill avi twenty five rolls of toilet
paper but a membership only chain right
that's what Sam's Club is to expand a
current partnership with apple and the
expansion of apples presence at the
wholesale retailers chain would be a
special note given that Apple split up
with costco a few years ago the two
companies costco and Apple decided stop
doing business in 2 2010 because a
restriction that kept costco from being
able to sell apple products online so
Apple was like you can't do that you
can't know and then kostos like pencil
it online we don't want it in our stores
so I've never been inside a sam's club i
don't know i i'm not sure what whatever
if it looks anything like a walmart
looks I think that an a mini apple store
with its sleek white cool lines inside
of a walmart with its bins of like socks
and whatever and like taller product it
would be the funniest juxtaposition of
two entities in the world because of Sam
you know like a mini apple store inside
of like this like mess that is a costco
or sams
class seems so weird it would be so
impossible cuz it's supposed to be this
like sanctuary of like beautiful sleep
then your sol and touch everything and i
think i can cause I'm Sam Scott I'm not
sure Sam's fellas likes costco but you
probably like sure you have like you
know food samples and you're walking
around with your greasy like mini hot
dog fingers touching the ipad leg feels
so god this is engrossing so I thought
of those fingerprints and touching
everything yeah I already feels so dirty
and it was a full point at an apple
store is to be able to touch everything
play with everything and you know
otherwise if it's behind class why would
they be selling apple products in bulk
is I think I don't know if it's in bulk
I think it's like how they do like the
Playstations or the axioms where they
bundle it with another controller in a
game or whatever so maybe they bundle it
with a case and that whatever and
whatever whatever I mean I'm really
interested in what they would or not or
it's just another location for going by
TVs and stuff in in costco just a better
combination yeah I doubt that apple will
drop the price I think they just want to
make their presence more known you know
yeah java Cosmo the thing is is that an
apple store should have an apple genius
Manning it now my experience with like
mini apple stores inside of like Best
Buy or whatever I guess that's not i'm
not sure if that's supposed to be at
apple store but lake not only is there
not a genius but there's not even a Best
Buy employee like nobody oh you're
literally I'm part of you have a
question and when you find them they're
only an Xbox Kinect yeah and they're
lady because knows only be found so the
point of this is so weird but so I don't
know I think whatever it I see it as
like a separate room that they would
probably build it's good wow maybe like
it so we can begin to the eye doctor in
costco sorry right and it's like a cold
a separate area and the worst not I
doctor with an i like ipad by dr. life
quite cheesy cheesy so I don't know so I
it seems weird but on the heels of this
which i think is really funny speaking
of retail stores and add this list of
why the hell which as we talked about
last week was that Amazon was thinking
about both like a brick and mortar store
is that google is planning to open a
retail store in dublin and when i first
read this i thought it was dublin the
city and the east bay there's a little
city next to right over the san mateo
bridge called w valley yeah in the
tribes Oh funny that you thought oh it's
literally like I mean it's homes it's
very residential and there's like a mall
but I was like a centuries-old capital
of a nation yeah or there's dublin
ireland which is where they were gonna
build that because google has you know
one of its european headquarters or the
European headquarters whatever is in
Dublin so in November the search giant
google filed a plan to open a retail
store at its headquarters in Dublin's
mont a vetro office block i am a robot I
can't read according to Bloomberg which
discovered the document on the dublin
city website and based on the plans that
appears google is considering opening a
store that would span about 1,300 square
feet Google all are ready opened a brick
and mortar store in London it was called
the chrome zone oh yeah the vomit
like-for-like chromosome yeah I don't
know if that was literally the name or
what they were calling it like the
internal Numa just men to the chromosome
the crew likes of danger
doo-doo-doot-doot it we're going to mess
with you old body so I don't know if it
was um only leading up to I think it was
only leading up to the holiday so it was
like a pop-up store so people come
whatever I wrote so much on this I did
so much research on this I'm gonna cut
it short because we're running out of
time but here's a quote from Google's
rep we already have an online store
selling things like Google t-shirts and
pens we have that we have the option of
a small space doing the same in our
Dublin office but we've not made any
decisions it's simply planning an
application they're going to open the
store to sell
hens and t-shirt can I what in the hell
the point of that I thought when I first
read that that it was going to be like
oh sorry I'm totally running no no no I
Millie things say like maybe they're
gonna like open the store too so people
can play with Chromebooks or do
troubleshooting like it like a Google
genius bar whatever so no Nexus or sell
a their own photo yeah the the Nexus
you're right oh that's like their own
thing but there's so many thought that
this would be so hard because there's so
many versions of Android there's so many
phones running it like they're gonna
have to have an expert for everything
whatever whatever and then I realized
that all they wanted to do with sent
petzl pens and t-shirt as the Spencer
yeah and like your little droid guy and
like what ridiculous the only reason
that Google and Amazon even care about
opening a brick-and-mortar store is
because they are competing with Apple
who actually did a good job opening the
door can you keep with Apple here I'm
sorry I'm pouring myself more shampoo
yeah please do so you can't compete with
Apple by selling t-shirts they're not is
your company so all they want to do is
open this store just to say that they
did it was so stupid and lame I just cut
them out get rid of the middleman and
offer directly to you our fans our
washers our listeners I actually have a
google shirt that's never been worn
that's from a Google employee and if you
guys want some schwag I could add that
to the schwag bag and I don't have to
wait for this w store we'll just put a
slice seanut sticker in it yeah you
could say that you got it then when you
wear it you can be like oh yeah I got
this in Ireland yeah and I went on my
trip to Ireland Adam Scotland in our
chat room says that he went he says I
went it wasn't great yeah I mean I'm not
surprised oh you know I not surprised
that it wasn't great I mean it's just
the concept of it the concept that
they're only opening it is making it so
obvious that they're only opening it to
compete with Apple which is I mean just
stop I mean have you seen those
microsoft stores that look exactly like
the Apple stores yeah oh he's at least
are nice like I noticed cuz it's good
exactly in those serve a purpose they're
not just selling Microsoft t-shirts
which is so dumb and get that online and
don't bother me with this brick and
mortar I totally agree lady totally all
right now we're gonna move on to the
next room
her and there's a perfect segue to it
because it is a google rumor but it's
sad one gosh and it's really just
conjecture coming from I'm sure you guys
know about our mobile expert mark Maggie
Reardon she is just so smart about
everything to do with mobile and she's
been looking at the trends to do with
Google and she believes that it is
possible that Google Wallet this much
ballyhooed technology that they have
been pimping since last year is actually
on the way out and is going to be the
next big Google failure I'm not gonna go
into all the reasons why there's like
she has a detailed analysis and I urge
you to go and read her story which is
really interesting yeah we'll put a link
in the blog post later that will post
later absolutely but the gist of it is
basically that Google developed google
wallet which is based on NFC technology
and it's an app that goes on your
android phone and could be potentially
built into phones that run android that
allows you to make purchases and stores
using your phone so you don't have to
carry your antiquated old wallet with
that adorable little paper money and
those quaint little plastic credit cards
that are so last century instead you
could use your phone and just swipe it
over that thing at the checkout counter
and it using like a laser or whatever
our laser i don't really know um will
recognize your phone and access your
account and blah everyone when it was
first coming out was really concerned
about security like nobody wants to have
their all of their credit card
information all of their financial
information so readily available on the
phone which as we know is able to be
hacked able to be tracked is often lost
and left in taxicabs and then people can
just be making purchases google said
that they worked out all those kinks and
yet here's the problem it has not been
adopted by major phone manufacturers
it's just really slow to catch on and
people like verizon has refused to pick
it up because they have their own NFC
technology that they're developing and
they don't want google to take all the
thunder and make all the money so they
don't want google's version i have a
question you know when you go to a gas
station and you have you can either
swipe your credit card like this or you
can just tap it to the thing uh-huh does
anybody do that I don't because I was
like I've never done that either exactly
I'm like what's the point of tapping it
or swiping it and putting it whatever
and so maybe the
same thing with google wallet it's like
path like everybody's so used to doing
this yeah and I think you're right like
it what it is it's like it's as though
they believe they're answering a problem
but it's not a problem people don't mind
using credit cards you'll don't mind
using cash the invention of money and
credit cards is so that we can have an
ease of transactions like it's already
pretty easy especially cash has its
caveats it's hard to have it you've to
go to name but having a credit card
earnings or a debit card is easy right
but I feel like I'm already carrying my
wallet anyway because that's my ID as a
business guy it has like the stuff in it
what what is the point to having one
more credit card who cares I totally
agree if it could replace your actual
wallet as the name implies if it could
be Google Wallet whirling with your I
drivers I changes on your phone and it
says fine then you don't have to carry
wallet it's you know totally it's easy
that's not what it is yeah and so it's
so it's really slow to pick up and then
the thing that happened last week which
Maggie thinks may be the death knell of
google wallet is that they had to take
it offline because they found this
intense security problem with it and so
it's flawed and no one wants it and no
one's adopting it and though everyone's
excited about it and some of the rumors
about the next iphone event it'll have
NFC technology and all the next phones
are touting that they're going to have
it and it would make sense for Google to
take the lead on it it's just not
working and as we know Google actually
has a history of failed products part of
reasons because it's so innovative and
right like it's like a t-shirt store and
Dublin yes but also those horrendous
horrific things that you'll remember
google buzz oh yeah and the google TV
they're kind of flops which is still
doing on me there's some rumors i got
fish dying on the riverbanks on yeah
that's not what a fish dying on the
riverbank sounds like oh okay no it
doesn't leave anything i can't do a fish
dying on a riverbank um but and that
idea down okay but also there was Google
Health I don't even remember that google
labs which was actually awesome because
some neat things came out of it but they
shut it down all of those things are
failures so will Google Wallet be the
next failure well bed upon fat in one
second hey now let our news
our new segment we've got 11 minutes
sorry it's going to be so boring this is
the analytical segment no but listen
okay watch this graphics and this week
ago and analyze the analysis check the
analysis check the analyses the annals
of analysis
okay so for our first ever analysts
corner this is a new segment where we
are going to profile the top tech
analysts who are the people who are
responsible for a lot of the rumors that
were bringing when they're not from
anonymous sources and these are people
who whose job it is to work for
investment firms and for think tanks and
look at the market and trends and
predict which what is going to happen
with certain stocks are they going to go
up or they go no down and why not just
is Apple going to go up but is it going
to go up because it's about to introduce
a new app macbook pro or a 15-inch
macbook air and so as is fitting from
our history our first analyst that we
were going to profile is none other than
eugene monster himself and that is
because it is Valentine's Day and Emily
well upset I once said that he was a
tall drink of water and I will stand
behind that statement he is a very
attractive me is and he is a Fame he's
one of the most famous analysts because
he's all over television he's on see it
CNBC MSNBC he's on all of the financial
shows he's one of the most sought-after
analysts to come onto television and
tell people this is why you should buy
Apple this is why you should wait this
is what we're expecting and it's not
just people who invest in the stock
market who listen to what he says it's
also accessory makers who want to know
when the ipad is coming out and want to
know if it an apple TV is coming out and
it's also up buyers and consumers who
want to know should i wait for the ipad
3 or not so i'm going to give you just a
little rundown on who this gene munster
fellow is gene munster aka the top apple
analyst AKA tall drink of water aka the
apple guru is a senior researcher at
piper jaffray in minnesota which is an
investment brokerage firm which
basically handles people's money and
takes care of their investments and you
pay them for them to tell you what you
should do basically they you pay them to
take your money and make it into a lot
more money and the way that they do that
is by employing people like Gene Munster
who look at the trends and know where to
invest things because they have a hit
they look the precedence and they have a
gut instinct for it munster joined piper
jaffray in 1995
with a bachelor's degree from the
University of st. Thomas which I
originally thought was in the Caribbean
and so sounded like a party school I was
like gene that's gonna drink together
but then I did a little bit of Google or
research and it turns out that st.
Thomas is actually a private Catholic
school in Minnesota and it doesn't sound
like a party school at all and what Jean
does is he watches Apple and Google and
Yahoo and a bunch of other Internet
companies and predicts where it's going
in why he made a name for himself by
aggressively betting that things were
going to go in a way that nobody else in
the field was thinking he thought that
Apple was going to rise astronomically
high and what's happened is that he was
right um I'm gonna go over now a
prediction that he made that was correct
then apparition that he made that he got
incorrect and his most recent prediction
great as fast as I can perfect cuz then
we solved a vote okay hahahaha my
prediction that he made that was correct
which is a big one in September in
September 11 2006 he predicted the
iphone oh shoot gene munster was a
genius and he believed that Apple was
primed to enter the phone market because
all of these other phones were coming
out the touted music technology and such
as at the time the LG chocolate and at
the time he said that if Apple with its
ipod prowess was able to enter the phone
market it would have the potential to
sell up to 10 million iPhones yeah that
was a very another woman but he
low-balled that but so then now here's a
part that he got wrong once the iphone
was announced gene munster predicted
that Apple could sell up to 45 million
of the devices in a year this is an
example of him being incredibly bullish
and believing that things were going to
go amazingly well then he got mocked or
not mocked but people said he was
incorrect because that first year Apple
only sold 20 million iPhones but if we
fast-forward in history to now in 2011
apple sold 47 million iPhones a year so
when he predicted that they had the
potential to sell 45 million iPhones a
year
he was right he was just early what is
gene munster predicting now um an apple
television as you know yeah he's been
predicting it front for a couple of
years now and it's gotten a lot more
attention ever since that Isaacson's
biography has come out and he believes
that that is happening but then also
this most recent prediction of his as
you know Apple stock is soaring above
five hundred dollars a share at this
moment ground-breaking lehigh stock and
muenster predicts that it is going to go
as high as 670 a stock which indicates
that he wants you to buy Apple stock he
says if you have five hundred dollars
lying around right now go and buy an
apple stock so my idea if you guys want
to possibly play along is we could pool
our very limited funds like in the one
dollar range each and as a podcast we
could buy one share of apple stock and
we could track it and see how gene
monsters doing and let me know if you
want we can make 150 bucks yeah I don't
know but if you guys want do that as an
experiment we could all be co-owners of
one share of apple stock he also
believes that it's going to go so high
that is going to pay a dividend to those
who own it which is pretty amazing and
there you go that was Gene Munster and
in one little moment I hope that you
feel that you've gotten to know him
check the medicine check the analyses
endless corn you love us some graphics
all right let's do speaking of graphics
let's do our voting graphic all right
and I'll drink while this happens round
20 okay ready we'll do this fast because
I'm a bunch of voicemails and bunch of

kind of like it we think it's funny but
we're never going to play it on the show
so that's right yes try okay I'm gonna
play the mp3 first okay hey whats up
guys its Josh from Maryland I almost
forgot this but I was listening Android
Atlas and it reminded me when I was at
CES I was talking to a Google engineer
about Google TV and I was asking him
about the trend with going into motion
controller gestures and voice control
and if we would see that on Google TV
and he kind of hesitated and backtracked
and said um that's an interesting idea
and I said are you guys working on that
now and he said I'll leave it at that's
interesting so he kind of hinted that
the google TV engineering team which he
was on is doing testing with some kinect
type controllers so maybe you can add
that as a rumor or a even the idea that
next hard the next-gen hardware for
Google TV is coming out all right love
the show talk to you later Thank You
Josh the the thing I wrote back to Josh
in an email i said if by interest that
is interesting unless by interesting it
meant that you actually gave them the
idea to do that in which case they're
like that guy is going to something is a
genius we're not gonna give him any
money for that idea
pretender cars and just say it's
interesting so anyway so that's fun
alright our next one our next is from
Riley yes play Riley O'Reilly ah I love
Riley David me too Riley you're so sweet
golden if Riley Davis has ever in San
Francisco he is coming on the show
actually got that voicemail while I was
on a date with my boyfriend and I was
listening I started playing it he was
like who is singing to you so jealous I
know it's it's awesome alright we have
one more with one more voicemail how we
do my god good time rumor has it this is
Davis from Nebraska and guess what
there's a perfect product for guess who
Emily sits on your last show that's
somebody like moving their TV and guess
who just released the removable
television at GES sharp you can take it
right from the living room onto the
dining room table without even
unplugging it perfect another show
that's pretty awesome the thing is what
um Davis from Nebraska Nebraska doesn't
realize is that I not have enough money
for a new TV so I you know what you can
also move any TV if you just unplug the
cord from the wall take this to me up
every TV is movable but I like your
where your head is Davis I like it yeah
