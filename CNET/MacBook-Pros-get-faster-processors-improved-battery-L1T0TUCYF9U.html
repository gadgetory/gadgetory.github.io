press event where they have announced a
very anxiously awaited update to the
macbook pro line of laptops first it
came to macbook air earlier this year
then very recently to the imac now the
macbook pro at least a version with the
retina display has Intel's
fourth-generation core i series
processors sometimes known by the code
name as well and that means they are now
up to date along with most of the other
premium laptops that we've seen in the
second half of 2013 now what these Intel
chips give you is marginally better
performance better integrated graphics
than you had from previous generations
but more importantly better battery life
in our benchmark tests with already
released systems that have these new
CPUs prove that you do get much better
battery life in fact the 13-inch MacBook
Air ran from the same 12 hours on our
battery drain test apple says that the
13 inch version of the retina MacBook
Pro is going to run for nine hours and
the 15 inch version is going to run for
eight hours and of course you get
largely better performance you do get
that super high res screen you get a
bunch of the up other updates that we've
seen come to both macbooks and some
other laptops this here 802 dot 11ac
I've got the faster PCIe version of your
SSD memory so that's a little bit
quicker you've got Thunderbolt 2 in the
13 inch version of the macbook pro with
retina display you've got an Intel Core
i5 processor yet four gigs of RAM in a
128 gig SSD and in the 15 in person they
bumped that up to a core i7 and a 256
gig SSD which they chiefly described as
a quarter terabyte of storage space one
very interesting thing they did the same
thing with these models they did with
the 13-inch MacBook Air they actually
cut the price it's now 12 99 for the 13
inch version and 1999 for the 50 inch
version and these guys are available
immediately I'm danocrine and that is
the new macbook pro with retina display</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
