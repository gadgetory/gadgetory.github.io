season that's right intel has announced
its latest third-generation core iSeries
processors and lo and behold lots of
manufacturers are trotting out their
latest ultrabooks in fact a lotta
manufacturers that hadn't made
ultrabooks before are introducing them
now such as Sony who is debuted the VAIO
T now does this look familiar it should
in fact it looks a bit like a vo S or of
ioz this has been around for a while
this is last year's Sony Vaio Z and it's
their top-of-the-line
super lightweight super fast laptop and
quite expensive too now the VAIO t
steals a lot of that design and is
nearly the same size but it costs a lot
less this is $7.99 what you're getting
though is that lower voltage core i5
processor now it is a third generation
so it's a little bit of bump up in terms
of speed a little better at multitasking
and it's got better integrated graphics
than last year what's also interesting
about these new ultra books is that
instead of an SSD storage which is fast
but limited in capacity you're getting a
500 gigabyte hybrid hard drive here now
what that means is you're getting 32
gigabyte SSD in addition to the 500
gigabyte hard drive which provides some
faster speeds and access but it also
means more storage and the funny thing
is right now a lot of laptops are
offering that 500 gigabyte hard drive
for less money more storage less money
maybe slightly faster speeds but it
seems like a pretty good compromise
right now and it helps this laptop get
in at $7.99
now $7.99 is not cheap for a laptop but
it's pretty cheap for a Sony Vaio which
usually tend to cap the top of the
market it's also the entry price last
year for the Sony Vaio
s now here's where it gets a bit tricky
because Sony makes thin laptops and now
some companies have never made a really
thin laptop and an ultrabook is their
chance to show off now in this instance
this is pretty similar in size to an S
as well and the ass has got an optical
drive DVD drive and sometimes it's got
integrated and dedicated graphics and ok
it's getting pretty confusing now right
that's the whole thing
this line is getting a little bit
confusing what you're getting here is no
optical drive you're getting that core
i5 the 500 gigabyte hard drive
integrated graphics and it's pretty
portable three point four pounds thicker
than a MacBook Air but about the same
size and it's a pretty nice system good
battery life but this keyboard is really
shallow I mean really shallow it almost
looks like it's been painted on and it's
not backlit now that's sort of the same
as the VAIO zzz keyboard so if you've
seen that before you've seen it here now
and the trackpad however is a lot bigger
on the T so that's nice I'm Scott Stein
and that's a look at Sony's new
Ultrabook</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
