seven D and finally Canon has delivered
with this model it's called the 7d mark
- my name's Lexi savita's from Cena this
is a first look at the brand new camera
now looking at the 7d mark - you might
think it looks strikingly similar to the
5d Mark 3 even though that's a
full-frame camera if you put the two
side-by-side you see that there are a
lot of external similarities at the top
it's got a nice GPS unit here integrated
on top of the pop-up flash unit which
obviously the 5d Mark 3 doesn't have on
the side you get microphone inputs
headphone input and also a new USB 3
interface inside though this is the
camera for action and sports shooters
being an aps-c sensor it's 20 megapixels
and has a crazy 10 frames a second
continuous shooting speed that is up
from the original 8 frames on the first
7d to give you an idea of what this
sounds like take a listen to this that's
pretty crazy indeed other features of
the 7d mark to include dual CF and SD
slots so one of each as well as a couple
of additions that really will help
sports photographers and people who like
to tweak their AF at the back there is
an AF selection dial there's a little
toggle here on the back now if you flick
this it will switch in the viewfinder
between AF area modes so you can help
get the right one for each situation
also in terms of your AF points you're
getting sixty five and these are all
cross-type also in terms of the
viewfinder you now get an intelligent
viewfinder and this will give you
displays of all the options that you
normally get on the top panel of the
camera here such as your white ballots
and your shooting modes in terms of
other features if you want to check out
the full spec sheet you can have a look
over at CNET right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
