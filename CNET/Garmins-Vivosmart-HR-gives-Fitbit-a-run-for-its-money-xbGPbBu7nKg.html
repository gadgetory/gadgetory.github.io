fitness tracker and I have to admit I
kind of like it
the vivosmart HR is comparable to Fitbit
charge HR and is offered for the same
price $150 in the US that gets you a
tracker that can measure steps distance
calories burned floors climbed active
minutes and heart rate throughout the
day it can also automatically track your
sleep at night but Garmin's device has
two notable advantages it can display
notifications from your iPhone or
Android device and it can be worn while
swimming or in the shower I'm also a fan
of the large and always-on touchscreen
display which is very nice for quickly
checking the time and viewing activity
progress in addition to notifications
the vivosmart includes widgets to view
the weather and control music playback
right from your wrist but it doesn't
show any information on the song that's
playing or the artist which is a bit
disappointing I'm also not the biggest
fan of Garmin's mobile app it has a lot
of menus and could be a little confusing
to find and change some basic settings
and while the band can collect an
impressive amount of data I'm left not
really knowing what to do with it I walk
10,000 steps so what I always slept six
hours is that bad
I wish there was some sort of coaching
or personalized feedback sort of like
what jawbone offers with its up activity
trackers the vivosmart also isn't as
discreet as the charge HR as for battery
life you should get about five and a
half days which is pretty standard for a
device with continuous heart rate
tracking overall the vivosmart is
definitely worth considering especially
if you're interested in receiving
smartphone notifications on your wrist
but not yet ready for a full-blown
SmartWatch for more information check
out my full review over at cnet.com I'm
Dan Roger escena and that was a first
look at the garmin vivosmart HR</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
