iTunes I'm going to tell you a few
simple things you can do to improve your
audio experience first off
invest in some better headphones there's
no miracle that's gonna make V sound any
better scene it has a roundup of great
choices under $50 that will provide a
night-and-day difference in audio
quality a good in ear headphone or over
the ear headphone will also help lock
out external noise so that you can hear
details in your music and not have to
turn up to full volume to drown out
distractions
if you already have headphones figured
out try the sound enhancement setting in
iTunes open up iTunes preferences and
select the tab for playback you'll see a
sound enhancer box that you can check on
and adjust to your taste moving the
slider up seems to make the stereo
effect a little bit more dramatic
audiophiles may turn up their nose but
if you like what you hear just go for it
while you're here you'll also notice a
box for soundcheck that will
automatically adjust the volume between
songs so that you're not racing for the
volume control every time a quiet song
comes on personally I keep this off but
if it fixes a problem for you you should
use it it's especially handy if you have
music playing in your office I should
also mention the iTunes equalizer you
think this would be in the playback menu
but it's actually over here under window
open it up and you'll see a 10-man
graphic equalizer that you can tweak to
your heart's desire you can start with a
list of presets like rock hip-hop or
classical or you can make a manual
adjustment to any of them and dial in
things just the way you like now one
cool trick that few people know about in
iTunes is that you can actually assign
different EQ presets to different songs
if you know that you want a little extra
EQ when Led Zeppelin comes on here's how
to do it select a song or group of songs
and then select get info from the file
menu under the options tab you'll see a
setting for equalizer preset along the
drop down menu of all the different
presets hit OK and now whenever those
songs come on they'll sound just the way
you like so there you go those are my
tips for fine-tuning your iTunes audio
