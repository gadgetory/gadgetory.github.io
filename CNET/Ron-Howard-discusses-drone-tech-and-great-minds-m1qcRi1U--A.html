well I'm not a very technically a
student person but it was my first time
really being around the drones and
dealing with him and of course i was i
was amazed and we actually used the
drones in two ways we use them on camera
to be that prop that's chasing robert
langdon through this 16th century garden
but but we also used it as a camera
platform as and so we had drones
shooting drones and then to be digitally
more sophisticated there were times when
we simply couldn't shoot with a drone
and we and wish and in the shot so we
would use the drone to shoot the shot
and then digitally put in a drone so you
know it was a very high tech scene in in
every way
well I absolutely did because you know
Dante was inventing a new language was
applying a lot of things that he felt
even petty grievances to this greater
idea of good and evil and he defined for
Western culture hell and then you know
Botticelli working from Dante's writing
gave us really the first horror show I
mean it's like it's like a horror movie
those images are absolutely shocking in
there and when you read them in detail
there everything that you've kind of
come to expect to be startled by in a
cool cutting-edge horror film so Donna
pays a genius those technical you know
those tech leaders they're geniuses you
know and and this is a story in fact I
think about four geniuses who are coming
on a kind of a collision course dealing
with this vacuum that's being left by
society because they don't know how to
deal with the overpopulation issue and
that's what geniuses do is they they
identify a bathroom a gap it may run to
it and you know it's it's up to society
to help define the ultimate choices that
are going to be made in terms of
addressing those problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
