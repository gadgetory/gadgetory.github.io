this is the Apple watch from last year
you're not going to see a difference on
the outside series - is all about what's
on the inside this which we can't demo
right here in the room has built-in GPS
it also is swim proof I can't jump into
a pool at the moment but this is 50
meter water resistance which is very
rare on a lot of smart watches also
brighter display which I said is going
to be much more visible in bright light
a thousand nits now the original Apple
watch is going to get upgraded to a new
dual-core processor that's also on the
Apple watch series - so you're looking
at more of a feature boost for sports
and this has a new finish ceramic you
can get an aluminum stainless steel or
ceramic it's $369 available September
16th and you know the designs the bands
this is the same Apple watch look so if
you're looking for something that look
different
you're not going to get that but if you
wanted something that performs
differently and lasts in more sports
conditions standalone runs and again
swimming this will be a model worth
upgrading to however for a lot of other
people the original Apple watch which is
going to be 269 starting price looks
like one that's still going to be fine
for most uses so that's the new update
to the Apple watch really kind of an
iteration here at Apple in San Francisco
