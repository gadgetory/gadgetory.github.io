the kitchen historically the
refrigerator has been a showcase for
photographs artwork and reminders but
with stainless steel finishes much of
that functionality disappeared leaving
the refrigerator to serve simply as a
place to keep our food fresh well we're
about to change the game I'm pleased to
introduce to you the Samsung family hub

appliance revolution it allows you to
communicate with family members manage
and prepare food and enjoy entertainment
