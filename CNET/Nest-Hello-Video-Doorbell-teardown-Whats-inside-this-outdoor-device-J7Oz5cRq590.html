Jason Heiner with bill Detweiller and
today we're gonna crack open the nest
hello video doorbell so bill tell us
what we're gonna do yeah so this is
really kind of a cool doorbell unlike
some other doorbells that are
battery-powered this one requires power
so there's a little more installation
involved and say if you have one of
these nest in door cam yep
this one actually requires a power
connection on the side of the door so
you either have to have a digital or a
mechanical doorbell already installed
and there's a few tricks to the
installation to ensure that it's getting
the right amount of power not too much
not too little just right so we thought
it would be really interesting to crack
it open and kind of see what's inside
let's do it now all right cool all right
so our first step in taking this thing
apart is trying to find out where we get
into the device and on the nest there's
actually a really thin a really thin
faceplate here that's plastic that
covers the front so if we very gently
insert a guitar pick or another plastic
tool you can use a metal tool if you're
careful not to break any of the
components we slide it around you know
we get a little bit of resistance you
can see how the faceplate doesn't cover
the doorbell button at the bottom here
so we're gonna keep working our way
around be trying to be gentle I can feel
some resistance from the double-sided
adhesive I'm gonna be really gentle here
and eventually this should hopefully
come loose and there we have it so we
get our first look inside the nest hello
video doorbell I can see one Phillips
screw there we're going to try and
remove this screw I'm gonna look for any
other screws that are still underneath
this adhesive and then hopefully this
will make a little bit easier to remove
the outer shell in the case
all right so now we have our first look
inside the nest hello video doorbell go
alright alright so here we are with our
first sort of look inside the nest hello
video doorbell we have the guts removed
from the plastic shell here one thing
that's really kind of interesting inside
the plastic shell there's a couple
things to look at we have our speaker we
have the contacts for the power leads
that come from your existing wired
doorbell and then we have this really
interesting sensor here that I'm not
sure what it does it at first glance I
assumed it would be a microphone of some
kind but I'm not sure yeah you would put
the hole for that on the back it also
doesn't appear it doesn't look like any
microphone I've seen before in these
types of devices and there's basically
some type of membrane here a metal bar
attached to that and then that depresses
a physical button or a contact here so
I'm assuming it maybe is some type of
pressure switch or setting to detect
when the camera is actually connected to
the door or what's back there I don't
know but that's one of the things that
makes taking these devices apart really
cool is you get to see these components
that you didn't expect inside of it they
sometimes don't tell you all the sensors
that are inside these devices they just
tell people how they work true and with
the Internet of Things devices that's
one of the most interesting things that
we find is all of the different sensors
they're always adding new types of
sensors so that you can measure monitor
manage things that you never could
before and when you crack these open and
look at them we get an idea of the full
capabilities of the product yeah yeah
it's really cool so we're gonna keep
taking this thing apart we're gonna take
the screws out connect disconnect these
cables take the circuit boards apart and
see what
we can find all right go do it
so here we have the nest hello
video doorbell completely taken apart
Jason some of the things that I thought
were really interesting we talked about
a few of them earlier that yes sensor
that I still don't know really what it
does yep but a few of the things that we
found also that we're interesting the
camera sensor here's the camera sensor
and the lens are basically two separate
parts interesting oh I haven't seen that
most of devices like cell phones or
other IOT devices
you know integrated yeah they're
integrated together they have a cell
phone basic camera inside of them so
this was pretty interesting also
interesting the chips the main chips
that are on here
this looks like an Amborella processor
it looks like a kingston memory module
here it's got a skyworks
wireless chip there okay a lot of the
same kind of processors a lot of the
same kind of chips that we've seen in
other devices you know it's it's really
interesting to see the construction of
these things this is the device also
that's designed to go outside yes so we
see and so it's designed to be a little
more waterproof than perhaps a cell
phone or you know older cell phones or
even you know devices cameras meant for
the inside of the house so it does have
an additional gasket there's a rubber or
silicon gasket here around the outside
to help with that there's this pink
material that's inside that fills the
gaps that around some of the I sees that
are in it it doesn't appear to be it's
not normal like heat sink or heat
conducting foam it seems to be something
else so I'm not sure if that's more for
water protection
or if it's more for to protect it if it
falls if it's shock protection I mean it
could be heating I just usually don't
see this inside devices so it's really
cool a lot of surprises inside the nest
hello it's really interesting the sensor
and the camera lens being separate
because what that shows is this is a
more sophisticated deal and the extra
sensors we talked about the fact that
Internet of Things is all about sensors
so yeah we've as always we've learned
some
some interesting things yeah making this
thing open so if you have other devices
you would like to see us crack open then
leave us a note in the show notes we're
always looking to crack open the the
best and most interesting technology
that you can find if you'd like to see
more of our cracking open videos go to
CNET where you can see all of our
cracking open videos if you want to see
photos of the things that we crack open
go to our sister site TechRepublic
where you can see galleries of all of
these things in all the gory detail so
I'm Jason heiner for Bill Detweiler this
has been seen as cracking open we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
