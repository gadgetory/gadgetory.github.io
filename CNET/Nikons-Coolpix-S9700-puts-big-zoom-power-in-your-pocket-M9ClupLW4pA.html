expect from a pocket camera these days
it's a lot more zoom range it used to be
10 times zoom was a lot than 15 and 20
and now we're at 30 times zoom with the
Nikon Coolpix S 9700 I'm Josh Goldman
with CNET and if pocket ability a long
telephoto lens and modern features like
Wi-Fi and GPS and shooting options like
full HD and high-speed movies easy pan
and shoot panoramas and filters and
effects are what you're after
you'll want to check this out Nikon also
added semi manual and manual modes for
those who want more exposure control and
photo quality is excellent in daylight
good indoors if well late in your
subject is still but not great in
low-light without a flash because of
this you'll want to limit your use of
the zoom lens indoors and even
fast-moving subjects like kids and pets
can be tricky outdoors that goes for
most cameras of this type though so more
something to be aware of in general a
potential deal-breaker with the S 9700
is the flash which is prone to getting
blocked and despite being able to bend
back can't be fired in that position
also while the audio is generally good
one of the stereo mics could potentially
get blocked or even just rushed over by
your fingers battery life is good as
long as you're just taking pictures but
doing anything more than that will cut
things a bit short you can read the full
review on cnet.com but this is certainly
a very good way to put big zoom power in
your pocket
I'm Josh Goldman and that's a look at
the Nikon Coolpix S 9700</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
