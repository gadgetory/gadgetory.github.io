the right place to be for research and
development to be close to our customers
so we made this large campus investment
here it's about 1.1 million square feet
so we're ready for the next 30 years and
beyond
and we really wanted to be close to
customers we really wanted to be this as
an RD Center that have labs here that
actually do design and so when we did
built the building it's actually an open
structure so you don't see walled
offices that you normally would see in
the center you see very open space all
our conference rooms are all glass and
the building itself the entire interior
is full glass what's full transparency
and so there was a lot of thought that
went into how we actually connect people
how we work together and then how we
could use it as an advantage to create
great ideas and collaborate with
customers right here this is our
semiconductor and our display businesses
that are here and so we do everything
from memory chips to SSDs to processors
LED chips and then display panels LCD
and all that we have a little over 700
employees that are here and the building
is actually designed to have up to 2,000
so we've really designed this for
long-term growth and so actually the
public could come into the space which
is very unusual for an R&amp;amp;D facility so
we have secured areas and to get into
certain parts of the building of course
you need badges and to be able to do
that but if you live in the area and you
want to come visit you're able to do
that we're setting up retail shops that
are going to be in here and we work very
closely with the city to really draw
this area to be a place where people
could live work and play</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
