executive editor for cnet.com and I'm
here with you
parrot Zik headphones these are a
wireless Bluetooth model and they're
probably the most technologically
advanced headphones out there they're
loaded with features they have
everything from noise canceling to touch
sensitive controls on the earpiece they
also have a jawbone sensor as well as a
motion sensors though so that when you
take off the headphones your music
pauses parrot is a French company and
it's better known for its AR drones here
in the United States but it's teamed up
with Philips Stark again to create these
headphones and you can see that they
have a very striking design they seem
well built they have a removable battery
in the earpiece and that cover adheres
magnetically so you just pull that off
and you pull out the battery the battery
life is decent not great you get about 6
hours of battery life with everything
turned on you can increase the battery
life by turning off some of the features
these are fairly heavy headphones they
weight point seven to pounds so they're
not too light and they're not great for
mobile use they will make your ears a
little bit steamy but they do sound
excellent for Bluetooth headphones the
app allows you to tweak the sound a bit
and you could also listen to these as
wired headphones but I really didn't
notice the difference in sound when you
use these in Wireless mode versus wired
mode there's a lot of digital processing
happening as headphones so you really
probably want to just leave them in
wireless mode when you're using them
they have nice lushly padded ear cups
and they are comfortable where I
wouldn't say they're super comfortable
over a long period of time but they are
comfortable quick thing about those
touch sensitive controls you simply
swipe your finger forward on the
headphone to advance tracks you can also
raise and lower volume by simply swiping
up and down the one issue I have with it
was that when I went to adjust the
headphones on my head a few times I
accidentally touched that
touch-sensitive panel and the track
either went forward or the headphones
actually paused if you just tapped the
headphone it will pause like other
bluetooth headphones this
can be used as a headset I didn't think
it performed great as a headset but
there's a built-in mic here there are
actually several built-in mics for the
noise cancellation which is also very
good but all in all a very interesting
headphone very nicely designed and it
performs very well for a bluetooth
headphone I'm David Connery and those
are the parrot Zik bluetooth headphones
with noise cancellation thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
