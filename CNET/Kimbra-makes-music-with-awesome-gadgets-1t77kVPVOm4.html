show you my rig I started learning
guitar around talks around the age of 15
I borrowed a boss eight-track from the
high school music room
I wasn't taking music at school but I
was really fascinated with you know
gadgets and that became the first tool
for me as a producer you know to learn
about what I could do with the voice as
an instrument after that I invested in
like the boss RC xx which has started my
journey with looping and then I guess I
got into Pro Tools you know on the rest
is history so once you're on computers
it's kind of hard to go back live we use
Ableton them I think a Ville turn has
definitely improved itself to be like
the best tool for live setups because
it's just such a good connector in terms
of like being the master of all the
different you know gadgets on stage and
its ability to be quite easy to map you
know a lot of these controllers are
talking to Ableton and instead of having
what I used to use which was a role in
this before for for all of my effects we
now have a much higher quality effects
unit because it's running straight from
the computer and I'm able to manipulate
everything on stage
I guess this is the first piece of gear
that I owned the TC Helicon just kind of
became a bit of a like poster girl for
that because I was using it so much and
they actually even helped ask me to help
develop the you know the second unit
which is this ones I remember the big
thing I wanted them to integrate was
MIDI sync at that time it didn't talk to
MIDI so if you were doing looping you
just have to be doing it free time
nowadays you can sync the voice live to
many and that gives you the ability of
course to you know keep better time with
the rest of your band
I don't rely on it for looping as much
as I used to the chaos units have now
become kind of exciting for me as voters
as well so I've integrated them and you
may ask why I have to which is a little
bit ridiculous but basically they do
different things you know the surprise
is my name's rate so I can use my finger
to control my delays life I find that
this has the nicest sounding delay
unfortunately that preset didn't come
with this kb3 so you have to build you
know you can't quite replicate the very
same thing so this one I find is better
for for looping and for sampling things
so get used to what this can do which is
about five different kind of effects you
can apply it on samples but you know
like every one you get kind of tired of
doing those things all the time so the
chaos gave me this new instrument and
new range of effects that I can now
apply to the sample right
The Voice life can do similar things of
course filter anything I do here it can
be effective privacy but I kind of think
that's built into this you know so it's
not yeah
anyone can build a rig of a fix with
Ableton and you just kind of choose the
effects that you might like I kind of
like to do by the intros and that's
exactly what this is about is every
night is different you know as I hit yes
and if I hit this we're gonna get the
whole track in repose which is a whole
other thing to know to know using it up
up to them so you know depending on your
mood you can decide to sing the song
with a certain effect so it's I mean
this is just all about like staying
playful with it you know I think the
moment that I become too over rehearsed
or used to what I'm doing it becomes
less fun and then I'm listen gauged
emotionally you know as all of these
things help me to feel connected to to
the music so now I'm pretty happy I feel
like I got a good little space you're
going on and it's just all about keeping
it exciting and keeping up with where
technology is going you know those
things are moving so fast and I think
it's up to artists to kind of stay in
the loop with that you know and kind of
push the boundaries of all of these
various instruments I think that's also
how the developers learn to improve
their shape as well is when they see
people using them on having limitations
with them you know I love that dialogue
between people in the tech world and
artists I think it's really important
I'm Kimbra thanks for tuning in
check out my new album it's called
primal hot follow me online
keep in touch while I'm doing hope to
see you at a show in the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
