trainer box they've invented a robot
that spits out ping-pong balls the robot
and the app used to control it on
Kickstarter right now and this is me
Jeff I like to think I'm pretty good at
ping pong these guys and they're really
good at ping pong so the trainer bot
essentially lets you play solo it's
pretty simple to use you mount it at the
other end of a ping pong table and then
load it up with about 30 balls you then
activate trainer BOTS with an app that
lets you customize nearly everything you
can tell it what kind of serve you want
the style Direction spin the location
even the frequency between serves okay
so enough talk let's try this out so
here I am destroying this thing on
Normal difficulty oh come on robot
you're gonna have to do better than that
okay now here is crazy mode which means
only a crazy person will be able to keep
up with the amount of insanity aha
but I eventually became crazy enough to
best the trainer bot that's right humans
prevail so all-in-all trainer bot is
actually pretty cool
I love for there to be a way for the bot
to auto load the balls you hit back to
it some kind of net solution or
something like that and the price is
also a lot they're asking for around
three hundred and thirty dollars as an
early bird price on Kickstarter but the
retail price is going to go up even more
from there that's a lot to spend on a
ping pong robot but if you're passionate
enough about the sport it might be worth
it to you it does seem to be a seemingly
infinite number of ways to play with it
so the replay value is definitely there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
