and then you've got the s7 edge and
already a lot of you guys have been
asking me what's the difference between
the two phones which one should I buy
and if the s7 edge worth the extra money
three things the edge and it depends on
your map so you're ready to break this
down let's break it down the s7 edge is
the s7 only more so that means it has
Android 6.0 software a microSD card slot
and a great camera oh and did I mention
it's water-resistant
here's the more part it's bigger than
the s7 with a 5.5 inch display that
gives you more space for watching and
reading larger means that it's more
awkward to hold than the s7 if you have
smaller hand like me but it's slightly
smaller than big big phones like the
galaxy s6 edge+ and the Nexus 6p the
edge has a sexy display with screen
curves on the front that make it look
more immersive and more awesome than any
other regular phone out there also there
are some cool shortcuts to things like
your favorite apps and people there's
even a ruler and a news ticker if you go
through the setup process there's also
an interesting trick where you can go
directly to a task that is ordinarily
buried a little bit deeper into the menu
you can get to these edge display
shortcuts from any screen but if you
can't find what you want right away and
you might waste some time scrolling
through your choices that is more
expensive of these two because it's
larger and has that curved screen and
this extra navigation but it's also the
one I would personally buy myself
mostly because I can't say no to that
immersive feel that you really have to
see in order to believe edge more
interesting s7 more affordable I know
which one I want you don't have to have
the edge but believe me
you'll want it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
