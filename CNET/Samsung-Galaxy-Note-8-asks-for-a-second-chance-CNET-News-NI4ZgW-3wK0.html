Galaxy Note 8 satsang wants customers to
give them a second chance with the
Galaxy Note 8 the successor to the
disastrous note 7 none of us will ever
forget what happened last year while
never specifically mentioning the two
separate battery flaws that caused some
note 7 phones to catch fire in 2016
Samsung's president thanked the
customers who stuck with them like the
Galaxy s8 launched earlier this year the
note 8 is covered by Samsung's eight
point battery safety check so this is
really important because it is the
company's first chance to go out there
and prove that it can make safe new
phones as well as a six point three inch
screen with curved edges the note eight
has a stylus for writing navigating the
phone or translating text on-screen it's
also the first Samsung phone with two
rear cameras one camera has a wide-angle
lens for capturing big scenes and the
other has a teller lens with two times
optical zoom so you can get closer to
your subjects without sacrificing image
quality Samsung's virtual assistant
Bigsby will also be available on the
phone as a competitor to Alexa and Siri
I can press the bixby button and say
food photo the note 8 comes just weeks
ahead of when Apple is expected to
reveal its 10th anniversary iPhone I
think for people who are on the fence it
does make sense to wait and see what
Apple has offered to try to win back
former note 7 owners Samsung is offering
them up to four hundred and twenty-five
dollars when they trade in their current
phone for a Galaxy Note 8 the note 8
goes on sale September 15 in San
Francisco
