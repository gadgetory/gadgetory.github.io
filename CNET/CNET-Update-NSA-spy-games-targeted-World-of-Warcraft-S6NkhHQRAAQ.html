I'm Bridget Carey and this is your scene
at update it seems no area of the
internet is safe from government spies
even online worlds of dragons and magic
the Guardian reports that the National
Security Agency and its counterpart in
the UK the GCHQ have monitored activity
on popular online games like World of
Warcraft and second life and it also has
tapped into Xbox Live all in the quest
to spy on alleged terrorists this plan
to monitor online gaming began in 2008
according to records obtained by The
Guardian from Edward Snowden and based
on these records it seems no terrorist
plots were stopped by eavesdropping on
games but the NSA was able to tap into
gamer profiles and go as far as to
listen in on the voices of xbox live
users it's unclear if these tactics are
still used today this news comes on the
heels of other reports on the NSA
including that it's tracking the
whereabouts of cell phones around the
world collecting 5 billion records a day
on hundreds of millions of devices and
that's according to the Washington Post
eight major tech companies are calling
on President Obama and Congress to limit
these government surveillance efforts
including Apple Google and Microsoft
kids and teenagers can get a free one
hour programming class at their local
apple retail store on wednesday december
11th the free tutorials are part of a
global event called hour of code it's to
encourage people to learn computer
programming kids need to make a
reservation for the Apple class but
anyone can find free online tutorials at
the computer science education week
website which is CS ed week dot org a
new report out says Google TV could get
a reboot next year under the name Nexus
TV that's according to the tech news
site the information we might hear more
on this from google during the consumer
electronics show in january
if you're still on the hunt for a cool
tech gift for the holidays here's
something unique for some smartphone
owners it's a case that lights up when
someone calls the flashing case is made
by a company called vandy and it doesn't
take any extra power to light up you see
many phones have a setting to flash the
LED camera light when there's an alert
or when someone calls this case can
cover the light to redistribute it
across the clear shell so it appears
that it lights up on the back and on the
sides and you can slide that cover open
again when you need to use the flash
these are 20 bucks each and are sold for
the iphone 5 5s and 5c there's also a
version for the galaxy s4 that's your
tech news update but you can find more

studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
