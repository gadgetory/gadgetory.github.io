machine for you but if you want to
create a 3d model step right up
dream box is the first-ever 3d printing
vending machine located on the UC
Berkeley campus it was built by a trio
of recent grads who were frustrated by
the lack of access to the technology
it's existed in research labs and it's
existed at big corporations to do rapid
prototyping and that's as it remains
today so it's sitting in a couple labs
on campus and to get access you need to
be a PhD student to be a researcher you
need to be a grad student
the creators hope to democratize 3d
printing and ultimately have these
machines in public places like shopping
malls or copy centers this prototype
cost just under ten thousand dollars and
took about five weeks to build we have
the heart of the machine which is the 3d
printer then we also have an arm a
robotic arm to remove the print from the
platform we have a distributor mechanism
that will choose one of the four drawers
stand up into to get started you'll need
to register then upload a design of your
own or choose an object from the dream
box store you can pay using PayPal the
cost usually under $15 less than 24
hours later you'll receive an email with
an unlock code enter that on the dream
box and it will unlock a drawer so you
can pick up your model roughly half the
models printed are for personal projects
but figurines from video games and shows
like Game of Thrones are popular too
what you can't print is a gun in recent
weeks pro-gun groups have produced
firearms using 3d printers and
successfully fired them one was created
relatively cheaply using a desktop 3d
printer that sells for seventeen hundred
dollars and about twenty-five dollars in
raw materials the dream box creators
told us their policy strictly prohibits
users from printing firearms
what's more the dream box printer
couldn't handle the intricate parts of
the gun dream boxes print queue is busy
thanks to a steady stream of orders
which is why customers must wait a day
to collect their models even
most designs can be printed in under an
hour the tricky part now is minimizing
maintenance we remotely monitor a
machine using a couple of different
tools we can essentially do a remote
desktop into the machine that's actually
in the vending machine the computer in
there we also have multiple cameras to
keep track of quality as well as how the
printer is running currently the
dreambox can't print anything larger
than a loaf of bread and all models are
created from a single material plastic
but 3d printing is evolving rapidly and
could do much more in the near future
where we're going is printing metals so
printing custom jewelry or printing
essentially custom pieces that are
actually used in machines you could
feasibly print a replacement part for
your dishwasher for your washing machine
imagine instant appliance repairs or
phone cases that perfectly match your
party attire all on-demand
