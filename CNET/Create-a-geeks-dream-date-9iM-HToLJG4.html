editor and today resident tech love
doctor if you found the geek of your
dreams or even if you're still on the
hunt you should know how to tap into the
latest tech trends to make this
Valentine's Day extra-special because if
you want to find true nerd love you got
to step it up beyond the average flowers
and candy so when on a date you want to
start off on a good foot by getting the
mood right these Star Wars lightsaber
candlesticks do the trick nicely and the
based attaches so you can bring it on
your next sci-fi convention date and
instead of sending her flowers that are
expensive and end up dead in a few days
send something useful here's a USB port
hub of tulips and nothing turns on a
girl more than a glowing power button
necklace it's called the eye necklace
and will pulsate for 72 hours ironically
there's no on and off switch so you'll
have to take the battery out to make it
stop but a perk is that it's open
sourced all the codes and schematics are
posted for you to modify and hack it now
if you're showing your love by giving a
device like a camera a game system or
tablet give it some personality you can
order a personalized covering to fit
almost any gadget through jealous can
calm or skin it calm you can pick a
design or upload your own and prices
vary depending on the size but expect to
pay between 15 and 30 dollars also if
you order an iPad or iPod from Apple
they'll engrave a personalized message
on the back for free now if you're more
the crafty type or just low on cash send
a surprise on a cute USB Drive fill it
up with poetry photos a romantic
playlist or even a sweet video message
and now for the entertainment for a
night in there are games like Fingal on
the iPad for finger flirting well um see
what I mean for yourself
yeah so if you're going out instead of
staying in but didn't plan ahead the
open table app will help you find a
restaurant and make a reservation and if
you're feeling adventurous you might
find something interesting on Groupon
now deals unlike normal grew bonds these
are deals for outings or restaurants
that are only good well for right now
for a short window of time every day it
changes so you never know what romantic
possibilities you can find on a discount
and after all who doesn't love a cheap
date for cnet.com I'm Bridget Carey
happy Valentine's Day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
