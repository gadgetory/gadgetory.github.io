live coverage of CES 2014 it is day
three of the show I'm Donald Bell she's
Bridget Carey and this is inside scoop
our daily news roundup of everything you
need to know for yesterday and today yes
mostly was still looking back I mean a
day three really everything that has
needs to be announced as been announced
right there's no we're still just kind
of scrambling to catch up all the little
sleeper stories it gives us time without
having all those big announcements to go
test things I'll get hands-on time with
all the quirky products on the show
floor didn't do the analysis too
sometimes it's just just like a
scattershot of stuffing thrown at us for
the first couple days and then we
actually kind of can tie the themes
together some stuff that did happen
yesterday of note or at least the first
thing that happened yesterday of note
was t-mobile's announcement that not
only are they breaking into a tease
parties to see Macklemore but they are
also going to buy you out of your
contract if you want to leave your your
carrier to come to t-mobile they will
erase the pain of breaking you're
breaking your contract it was early
termination fees they'll give you the
money for whatever it costs up to six
hundred and fifty dollars provided that
you also turn in your old device as a
trade-in you're probably sick of your
old phone anyway so you're going to get
a new carrier new phone right and and no
pain in terms of determination pieces i
think that's always the kicker is like
when you're you're in six months into
your contract with like a verizon or an
18 teen like ah this is killing me or
you learn about something new and you
feel like you just can't even make the
switch because she's not worth the cost
but they're trying to they're being
really edgy here this and this has got
to hurt the other guys i mean yeah i
feel like t-mobile's whole roll aside
from being like the badasses of the
carriers you always has a leather jacket
it just disrupt the whole i mean in
terms of the there their whole
prepayment for by the way that you're
buying your phone through t-mobile by
paying upfront for breaking up the cost
so you're not locked into a contract
with t-mobile but then also just this
being able to like actively poach the
customers for
they're from other carriers to try to
get them to come over to t-mobile I
think it's smart John ledger thinks he's
Batman you know is you know he's always
trying to be crazy and disruptive and
this is the year that you know they're
going to see if it all pays out it'll be
interesting year okay also we saw
yesterday the razor project christine
this is a for gamers for like pc gamers
mm-hmm this is a serious tower computer
where everything is modular right you
can pull you can swap out the drive you
can swap out the interface you can swap
out the all the system but they're like
hot swappable kind of like a one side
like that like the hard drive storage
systems where you can just kind of swap
out the yes even if you don't know how
to build your own pc it's just kind of
like stick stick the piece you on into
the slot you want to upgrade something
or upgraded another piece of it it's
also interesting it's all cooled by
mineral oil I'm like that's kind of like
unique to now this is a nice aroma yeah
this is something that's a project you
know that's not gonna probably go out
yet but be interesting to see fake post
to another level next CES cuz razor does
show us a lot of gaming projects every
other year or so yeah i think the drobo
is what i was making of its kind of the
swappable drive deals that look cooler
than they do they really are but it
looks neat I mean it's for for as little
news as we get out of the tower pc space
it looks like a cool product we also saw
the avocado if we saw a lot of wearable
tech for your face Oh Edwin yes a lot of
Google glassy and kind of everyone
should put some sort of glass thing on
your face yeah and this avah got is kind
of like a two in one it's a headset but
you take the headset down and put it as
a visor and suddenly you have a movie
screen in front of you and the screen so
good that it could even do 3ds you wore
this yesterday yes I did came by the
booth and I just solid Bridget sitting
here with this hunter face that's a
thing and I felt like God Stein next
we're just talking about it but like I
was at a Star Trek I would say that I
was surprised at how crisp it was I
didn't feel like I was trying to focus
really hard or go cross I trying to see
this because in some iterations of this
kind of technology it gives you a
headache you get you're prone to get
dizzy not this
also looks a little bulky I mean I'm
very fit on your head if the headbands
on at the top there's like a smaller
headband it kind of keeps its kind of
hidden in scotland's hair and the extra
but yeah what when I had it on I mean I
had a kind of you know hold it up it
wasn't exactly all tweaked to the size
of my head but I hope that they have a
model that's a little smaller because it
is a lot of tech just sitting on the
bridge of your nose is a lot of trust
that people aren't gonna like knock you
over when you have that on your face
yeah I imagine you might want this when
you're sitting on a plane for a while a
train but yeah I hope no one like you
can't see anything around you so I hope
no one like sneak show off with your bag
or something but it's a lot of trust all
right we also saw an interesting hybrid
laptop from Toshiba a proof of concept
may come to market may not but the cool
thing about this guy was that aside from
opening up that and having a tablet
touchscreen it also had a detachable
keyboard secrets and that detached in
such a way that when you flip the base
underneath it you can kind of have a
separate keyboard you must have like a
yes and yes you we've seen a lot of
these hybrids were it's part tablet it's
part laptop whatever you want just take
unclip it take it with you you know kind
of started with like you see that in
surface and other products sums that
like a yoga that can fold in different
ways this one folds all the way and also
the tablet has a stand so III think it's
an interesting trend where people who
are buying pcs right now don't know
where they want one or the other they
can have best of both worlds and here's
an example of when a tablet separates
you can still stand it up yeah I mean it
was still remains to be seen if people
are going to still be buying pcs I me it
feels like as innovative as this might
be this is still doesn't seem like this
is the thing that's going to pick
people's attention up from actually
buying a new laptop this year like
everything's been on the decline for
this market yeah as sexy as this product
might be well it's because it's hoping
to get that group of folks who go I
don't know if I want a tablet but I
don't want to get rid of the keyboard
its market so is every PC product that
came out in 2013 yeah this one for as
great as it is it's awesome it's lacking
a trackpad to like it has a little one
of those little thinkpad know
no nubs no no no you're not going back
to the neck I know I can't go back to
the nubbins but yeah maybe we'll see
this it's an interesting product that's
probably for better or worse maybe one
of the more interesting laptops we saw
from CES 2014 but I think that's
speaking a lot about where PCs are right
now yeah not exactly a lot of big jumps
in differentiation points speaking of
hybrids here's an interesting one I
don't I don't think I've ever seen
before is it very unique a mobile
hotspot from ZTE and it's also a
projector also a projector it's also a
battery charger also a tablet in also
yeah for screen android portable tablet
screen i mean ZTE i mean they're their
phones when we hear about them they're
usually the middle of the road kind of
phones they had to kind of hit every
carrier for like a mid-range model but
you don't see a lot of quirky stuff out
of this company this one looks
interesting this is very innovative so
it's about a five by five inch inch box
very lightweight and once you pop a sim
card in it so you're going to need your
own data plan for it yeah it can be its
own hotspot for up to eight devices and
then because it's Android inside you put
any Android app in it whether it's
netflix or anything you would do on a
android device like your powerpoint
presentation and then just display
mirrored exactly what's on that screen
onto the wall you can so you have
families on a trip you do video that way
but also for work kind of like the work
play aspect if it has an hdmi port so if
you don't have a television for your
xbox you can plug it in there and
display your game that way it's the use
cases i still don't buy yet but like
it's one of those products where I'm I
feel like the whole the whole thing was
like we can make this product now we
couldn't make it before I don't know if
anyone needs it but isn't it cool that
we can make it and I yeah behind it i
would like to play around with it you
don't carry so many things around with
you if you're a business traveler that's
the sweet spot yeah it's not a projector
projector though it's like well well
actually it gets up to 120 inches I mean
we didn't get to see it I feel like it's
the projection
would have to like show a movie inside
of a tent while you're camping like yeah
that kind of thing like for a kid but
interesting product NZT not usually want
to come out with things that are
exorbitantly expensive so if it does
come out probably something you could
actually yeah yeah hopefully hopefully
all right that'll do it for today's
inside scoop thanks Bridget because you
were not going to be joining me tomorrow
right you're you're getting out of here
I'm going back I'll be back tomorrow
