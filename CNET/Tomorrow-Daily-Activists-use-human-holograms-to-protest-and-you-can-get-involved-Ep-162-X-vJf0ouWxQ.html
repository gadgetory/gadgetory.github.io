using Holograms to protest if you're as
big a fan of animation as me your mind
is going to be blown when you see this
animated short that's only made from 3d
printed objects so cool and also Boeing
patented a very interesting bag pack
that they think will help you sleep
better on a flight it also looks
ridiculous tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the Internet to
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I'm your
host Ashley scare the join bees always
killing orcs I do like that you kept it
real you at least admitted that it looks
ridiculous oh it looks okay lately
ridiculous alright completely ridiculous
uh but you know this first story we
might get a little we might uh we don't
khodet oh we're gonna fight on one
minute no I don't think so but let's
just let's get into it let's hit
headlines so we're not gonna politicize
this because it would be easy to but I
want to explain what's going on in Spain
right now cuz I I think this is crazy
and it opens up some doors and
capabilities that I never thought were
possible with activism and protesting
okay so uh late last year Spain passed
the law that I set up really heavy fines
for anybody who protested in front of a
government building which is kind of a
big deal like that's a little bit of
like government censorship yeah you
should be able to do that freedom of
assembly type stuff so um people were
very angry about that and activists set
up a way to protest with kind of a
futuristic bent and there was actually a
demonstration that happened this past
weekend in front of Madrid Spanish
Parliament what those are hologram
people protesting in front of Spanish
Parliament look like ghosts they do look
like oh so good protesting ghosts so
they're saying that these Holograms it's
symbolic that Holograms have more
freedoms of protest then people do an
actual physical people so a really
strong message there and it's called the
movement it's called the no somos delito
movement which means we are not crime
and it had over a hundred participating
organizations all come together sort of
put this a hologram rally into action
and they're hoping more people around
the world will join in by get this
uploading a picture of their face to
their website and then they're going to
add you into the rod do that oh yeah me
too I want to be there wait wait that's
a little scary because they may just put
you in a protest you won't be a party
yeah exactly say okay so we're gonna
we're going to get some acts this is I
think this is a really interesting
conversation so I think it's interesting
that maybe for example if you see we're
in California it's tough to get to let's
say the ran at the rally for sanity that
Jon Stewart did a couple years ago in
Washington DC yeah I would have loved to
have been there unfortunately a little
bit cost prohibitive to fly all the way
across the country get a hotel room in
Washington DC like it's expensive is
this now like maybe a viable way to
appear at a rally that you feel very
strongly about but maybe don't have the
funds so you can do like the million
hologram march million hologram march
maybe it's coming who knows and you
might have even more people than that
show up if it's hologram and people
could upload their you know out of their
pictures I don't there's there's two
sides of this first of all I don't think
it's gonna be as effective to not have
bodies bodies like that's real protest
is about we're here and we're like we're
present and there is something we don't
anymore bears no more bears and the
sacrifice of paying that money to fly
across country and be there because you
have to be there in person because it's
so important this in whatever issue is
you look out your government building
you know stroking your cat and you see
new to all these human beings that are
like me that's me but on the flip side
of the coin maybe the visualization of
the hologram of just how many people
like you can sign a petition to get a
million signatures but it just looks
like a bunch of papers but maybe you can
project all those millions of faces
outside their bikes okay real human
beings kill anonymous nasty skater are
out there they've got horse bodies but
still yeah there's a million of them at
like a centaur but I'm out there yeah is
it but I so I think that's really
interesting so maybe someday we might be
able to sort of take a picture with the
cell phone upload it to you know some
website that we feel strong about
they're gonna have like an event or
whatever and then you would be seen
there but I do that is interesting I do
find it very important that you
mentioned you know there are some like
image use rights like can that chem that
organization then use your image for
other rallies yeah you know in the
future because you've uploaded your
amazing race let's save the whales one I
don't want to say the will
you're likely as well Zartan get them
out of here put them somewhere else
terrible no but I mean you could it
could be something like something
politically you don't want to be
involved in but ya know it's it's very
interesting it's very interesting I
thought was pretty cool so uh obviously
we all want world peace I'm not going to
pull it a size this by making the
hashtag of the day where what rally do
you want to go visit right now and yes
there's a lot of what do you stand for
there's a lot of terrible things going
on in the world that you could obviously
protest against so I figured we would
give this a tomorrow daily twist so the
hashtag of the day today it would be
really funny the hashtag of the day days
TD protest and I want you to tell me the
pettiest most trivial thing a protest
that you would send your face to as a
hologram like first world problems like
just like I am going to go protest the
fact that we don't have pumpkin spice
lattes all year round uh sir oh I got
one like just petty and it's dumb and
funny or it could be totally imaginary
you can make up a protest okay so please
okay got a couple okay okay my first one
is I'd like to protest that there's no
hoverboards that's very of saying so I
want to go the girlfriend be live no
Mattel and just protest outside their
project that there I think of even I
hole because it's 2015 and they have
Holograms the second protest is I want
to protest at my house because my
girlfriend every time she makes coffee
she leaves a little Splenda like wrapper
on the counter and I keep telling her to
clean it up and it's time to needs to
stop time you need to stand up for this
make us no more splint on the counter
are empty splendid parative movie the
trash cans right here just go like this
boom it's in the trash I just every
morning every morning your girlfriend
goes out to make coffee and there's a
hologram kill it's like no just with
like with a kinda just what their sign
like stop oppressing me I with your
splenda pack I assume yours is better oh
well that was one of the big ones of the
pumpkin spice latte thanks I mean like I
said all day just put me out oh it's so
basic setting you have a projection of a
bunch of basic ladies a bunch of basic
ladies give me a bunch of basic basic
bees out there basic bees and then I I
think the other thing though is I would
protest
little dog Jenkins as you will know
likes to bring snails in the house I'm a
protest my dog no more snails in the
house cuz it's gross and you're leaving
their bodies your strip the bodies just
strewn all over our Florence I'll say
this your dog would love that because
you would be a home all the type that's
so true you just made your dog happy I
did all right and put my foot down my
hologram foot down I want you snail guts
is so gross so okay I am a huge fan of
animation did no transition I'm a huge
fan of animation that's a stop motion is
always so charming and so amazing my
favorite and the time that goes into it
and the fact that it's such a unique art
form well if you wanted to if you
thought that that was difficult this guy
made like a stop-motion animation with
3d printed like characters and whatnot
oh but what I mean by that is it he
printed out of character and then moved
it frame by frame no each frame is a
different 3d printed character a three
different 3d printed motion it took him
two years to make this so let's get a
little bit this is a short this is a
short film it is a short film computer
years oh gosh look at that so all right
so the guy that did this is French
animator named Alexander disks god is
how I'm assume it's going to pronounce
it's called chase me it is about a
little girl that's walking through a
magical forest and her shadow keeps
changing into things see what you're
saying is every single little rain thing
that it like it if she takes one step
it's that's another 3d printed thing yes
sent out it's incredible it took over 80
litres of resin so he had like.he had
went through a lot of resin 2500 prints
and over 6,000 hours of non-stop
printing time see Wow bigger and smaller
depending on if she gets closer oh my
god didn't even think about that yeah
when she gets closer to the screen name
iron mochi they had a 3d print the
environment uh so yeah every time every
time there was a movement or anything
and it looks beautiful it's corn this is
gorgeous look it's art it's unbelievable
so right now he's not he hasn't uploaded
it you can't like
watch the thing yet this is right
there's only like trailers and looks at
it okay because he wants to enter it
into competitions oh well since I love
to see I can't look even though is
moving is there hair like Swayze win
laying around oh this is unbelievable
took two years again the guy's name is
Alexander dis god i would recommend if
you get a chance go and just be blown
away that this is 830 yet chase me it
just be blown away by the fact that
somebody put so much time it is it's
it's incredible and it looks it's
charming yeah sorry as an animation fan
i always go to animation film festivals
and i'm always looking for someone to
try something new and this is just
unbelievable you would probably for me
you probably won't see anything like
this again for a while and this is a lot
of work so i can't imagine I mean I'm a
really big stop motion animation fan I
have two Nightmare Before Christmas
tattoos so definitely do um and I know
the process that goes into making that
and so I can't even imagine adding
adding time to that process cuz it's
already so painstaking and so intense
and and specific to add the fact that
like you were saying like 3d printing
these little tiny like characters they
get bigger and smaller as you go it's
like man I can't even I can't even begin
to imagine the heart it's incredible
Alexander well done great work few years
well I hope you win some awards I'm
looking forward to seeing it I was yet
this is awesome so cool so so very very
cool using tech and 3d printed you
actually do some art so cross them all
right now that we're done freaking out
of her amazing stop motion animation ah
I got to talk about this weird this
weird chair back oh it's lovely chair
okay it is really ridiculous but boeing
patented this I kind of contraption that
they think is going to help you sleep
better on a plane so obviously sleeping
on plane is a nightmare this this video
patent yogi does these great videos
where they see patents that are that
come out and then they they animate them
and show you like what how it would work
in real life so this is really cool that
they did this um so this is a bag pack
and then basically there be these straps
you hook them to your chair you hook
them to your little little chair buckles
or whatever and then you flip up the
back and it's a head cushion
and what you do is you lean in and
there's like a massage table like sort
of thing with a cutout whole you push
your face into it and then you have a
chest cushion is the main part of the
bag pack and then you sleep you put your
whole weight into it and lean forward
and you sleep just kind of like
suspended in midair like what is this so
oh they're they're making a gag about
Tom Cruise hanging out the side of the
window off the side of the plane for
Mission Impossible well that was a quick
turnaround yeah very very weird um but
yeah so this is the this is the the
contraption that they have sort of
figured out they think that this is sort
of the way to like get people to have
comfortable sleep in planes especially
considering you know those first class
like layout beds are so expensive on
long-distance flights that this might be
something that people passengers would
maybe want to use at some point in the
future sort of get restful sleep without
you know your neck hurts or you got to
buy those weird things and then you have
to figure out how to like stuff them
back in your bag like while you travel
and everything so a really weird patent
but i think the creepiest part about it
is the name that they gave it which is
is the cuddle chair no good boeing no
super weird um what people don't like to
cuddle like it in public not on an
airplane they're not an airplane I don't
know thanks so um but the nice thing is
is that if you were really worried that
you might have to use one of these
sometimes soon that's probably not the
case because but a Boeing spokesperson
said quote they file many patents every
year but that doesn't necessarily mean
we ended up pursuing them so they filed
a patent for this but we don't know
exactly if they will ever actually use
it but it is still really weird that
they're even thinking about this you
ever seen sky mall or camels gone now
bankrupt rest in peace and sky Molly had
one where it was like this inflated one
that you set on your wedding table the
weds and you like plop your head into it
yeah like dude like that i don't know
but that's actually how I sleep on
planes I just get a like my hoodie or
whatever I take it off I wrap it in like
a circle or the neck thing I actually
don't use it like around my neck I just
put it on the tray table and then just
put my face in it like you're in a
massage table and then I just you know
like your student you just put your head
down you go to sleep that's how I sleep
on a pole not not that this conversation
needs to be extended any longer but they
have on the back of the chair these
little things that you can bend inward
so that it holds your head kind of in
place and they can just close your eyes
and go to sleep see but for me those
don't work I was oh you your head is too
heavy my head and brain to be no no no
it's just my head and it's empty for the
most part nothing Legos keep Legos like
a Clementine sized brain in there
somewhere so but anyway that's what
Boeing is thinking about and we're gonna
take a quick break and find out what
that terrible noise was outside because
I think somebody fell off of a ladder
and we'll be right back but you are then
a donut in space
welcome back to the show fortunately no
one was I don't think harm we just sort
of listened against the door we didn't
actually open it I was too scared I
thought that maybe there might be like
yeah he's okay I thought maybe those I
thought maybe those like dog things from
ghostbusters were out there like eating
people oh my god I remember the name
either I just said no gatekeepers wait
master in the gatekeeper I mean I know
that but that was like uh anyway so no
one was hopefully injured I don't know
are you ready to talk about cool stuff
that people made that we really like no
okay well we're gonna do it anyway all
right my spot all right graphics still
pretty cool I love it uh so the Apple
watch is coming out next week 24th
officially pre-orders already sold out
you can't get one in till like May or
something Oh Brian talking has like five
of them he he ordered eight for each arm
it's just really exciting in each he
ordered everybody bling out every skew
he just got one of each um just to be a
walking hi phone what's up guys hey guys
i'm brian Tong um so I wondered brian
Tong ever watches these he's probably
like no that's why hey that's no that's
why I do it's cuz I know he doesn't want
but I love I even laugh and I even
razzed him in one of the in the comments
of what of his video be my bride talk so
uh good guy if you don't want the Apple
watch maybe you're thinking you might
want something a little more retro this
is awesome it's the Apple to watch so
let's get old school and let's check out
the Apple to watch but some awesome
video of this this guy instructables
contribute or la alligator 777 made this
Apple to watch that's a little watch by
the way gonna see how it works um it
works which is so cool that's actually
a 1.8 inch TFT screen look at what yes
it's a TFT screen and a made it
monochrome it even has a little digital
crown right there so you can scroll
seeds over the scroll he's got the
little floppy drives what fake will
floppy drives that you can you can fake
put in there and it's not going to load
anything but still funny and yeah it's
so awesome so he 3d printed the little
case he designed it 3d printed he got
little stickers made little vinyl
stickers and everything spray painted it
and you can make your own open-source
instructable he's got it on
instructables com you can actually uh I
didn't know this about instructables but
they have a thing now where because I
it's been a while since I've been there
they have a thing now where if someone
has 3d printed parts you can actually
either download the 3d model or there's
a button that says buy it on whatever
printing 3d printing site so you don't
have to have a 3d printer if you want to
build one yourself now you can buy the
3d printed pieces get them shipped to
your house and then and then do all the
other stuff cool awesome yeah so uh he
was basically he he put this all
together and even Steve Wozniak's office
and posted about it on Facebook and said
this I might be biased but I would buy
one and wear it he should send him one
I'd yeah send was that watch dude
because that I mean and if you don't
send it to watch send it to me cuz I
would rock that watch like that's a
tough choice to either you or the co
Creek Road co-founder of Apple I mean
either either choice is a good choice
but you know I will understand if you
pics pic was cuz woz is pretty awesome
so yeah this guy I like that he didn't
want to keep the design to himself I
he's like nope anyone wants to make one
you're more than welcome they legally
couldn't um well could keep it to
himself he could he could just say well
I'm not releasing the design but the
thing is is like it wasn't he thought I
hope he wears this watch around so T
like is such if you wore this your party
like a conversation piece yeah hey you
want to check out the new Apple watch I
have the apple to watch I actually I'm
gonna go ahead and say this I like this
better than me I detail Apple I want one
of these so bad and listen if any what
do you think Brian song if anyone out
there
makes one of these and doesn't know what
to do with it I'm not joking just email
me and maybe i'll buy it from you hmm i
don't know if it's it I don't lie to say
no there's a microphone mic I know might
we'll do it off the record do it do it
like this and then do it with your right
no that's it yeah all right I think
that's as much as I pay that's that I
think you'd have to go more than the
herald of woe couple time little pep
that that seems too much it's a way to
handcrafted sorry Jess all right anyway
it's an outrage uh all right guys
speaking of use if you're listening I'm
late audio pump you got to be so
confused you're listening so are you
crashed into something trying to listen
to what we're saying uh you guys are
pretty amazing and every day you send in
great feedback so let's talk about it
tease your feedback before we get into
our TD Robo cook hashtag I just want to
let you know that uh roll is the girl's
name yes alright we're slowly figuring
out all the characters names of megaman
thanks to you guys to viewers wrote into
its role because his name in Japan is
rockman megaman zero classic rock and
roll so it's rush roll and megaman yeah
I feel like there's another character
missing though I feel like there's
another one that was like part of his
group doesn't know that's a professor i
almost said Robotnik wily nily dr. wily
dr. Wylie um ok so TD Robo cook yes by
the way you guys are so awesome uh te
robo cook we asked you guys to write in
about and Daniel wrote in and said hey
guys I love watching the show for TD
Robo cook I would want the robot to make
me sushi every time I came home from
school thanks that's you we're on the
same page Frank wrote in and said I'm a
buyer if that robot can cook like
hashtag walk with yan um which I love
you put it on this shirt yeah is it TD
Robo cook um and then Matthew wrote in
and said I've never had turkish delight
from Narnia and it would be a real
surprise delight to try that oh good
what magical stuff wouldn't even think
about that that's good
I pick a bunch of stuff from Harry
Potter like the little chocolate frogs
and stuff yeah that'd be Debbie creepy
it would have to be jumping around uh
Rick Rhoden said combine this robot with
the robot bartender from that cruise and
the waiters from the Japanese hotel you
get your own future restaurant you go
you don't need friends anymore no you
have robot friends you have they have no
soul mm-hmm and then lastly so a little
bit of side we talked about digit ox the
watch the add-on thing earlier this week
so Richard wrote in and said here's my
take on digit ox I have a job where I'm
constantly moving and working on
electronics I've worn a watch since I
can remember and I have a SmartWatch now
I don't really think this is pointless
here's reasons I wear bluetooth
headphones for music and I get calls
constantly in text this helps with being
on my back working so maybe he's like a
mechanic or he works on things where he
has to like kind of be precision working
like he's like laying on his back
looking up at something and so he says I
can't access my phone when my boss calls
so using my SmartWatch answer my phone
and my headset to talk i can continue to
work and answer questions i also love
the fact that if you leave my if i leave
my phone somewhere it alerts me that i
have been disconnected and i also can
use it to find my phone when I lose it
between the couch cushions so in final
this is ok if you aren't productive and
then you deserve to get the vibrating
email alert that you're fired however I
wait a minute I feel like he's adding a
lot of features that we didn't mention I
think he's talking about just smart
watches in general Oh smart watches yeah
that's fine yeah I think there's you
know but digit ox is kind of interesting
because it's like using your analog
watch and adding kind of notifications
to it yeah it's just it's just a
vibrating notification right it doesn't
like it doesn't act as a I can't talk to
answer a you can't program it to do
anything else but vibrate but he does
say I would love the SmartWatch industry
to really get into the design industry
and produce a market of watches with the
smart part and the classy look so I
think he's hoping for maybe a SmartWatch
that looks more like an actual like
timepiece as opposed to like the screen
yeah i think that sort of the like two
years from now well there's the there's
the Withings activity pop which looks
like an analog what a name the huawei
watch looks really good what another
name yeah there's like a whole bunch
always huawei um but yeah
there's there's some good ones and he
says love the show i watch every episode
he also said he wants a pair of
smartwatches that are linked together
that one sport and ones dressed so that
you can switch them out no matter what
you're doing is just go James Bond is
that what we're doing we've gotta
persuade you yeah both um but okay all
right so I thought that was a good email
is that really um had a lot of good
reasoning in it so well done if you guys
want to send Oh actually we should do
phone toggle for the day first okay all
right our dear viewer and old friend not
really this is no new friend parth wrote
in and but now you're an old friend
