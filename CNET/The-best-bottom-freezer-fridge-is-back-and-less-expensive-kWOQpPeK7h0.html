refrigerators list you'll see an LG
model under the bottom freezer heading
and this is an updated version of that
fridge it's the LG LDCs 2 4 2 2 3 s and
it's replacing that model that we liked
so much last year in LG's bottom freezer
line now this is the biggest bottom
freezer in that LG lineup it's got 24
total cubic feet of storage space 16.4
of which are up in the fridge that's the
same as last year's model and everything
that's really the same here in the same
design the same interior the same
shelves all of it even the power
consumption is exactly the same but one
big difference is the price this one
sells for 1600 which is $200 less than
last year that sounds like a pretty good
deal but let's take a look at the
performance to see if it holds up last
year's model was super consistent very
very nice results in our puling test and
this one did a good job as well but not
quite as good if you take a look at this
heat map of the default setting you can
see that the body of the fridge is nice
and consistent but a few degrees above
that 37 degree target and those crispers
are a little warm there orange for a
reason because there are about 40
degrees that's not bad it's a decent
result but it's just not quite as good
as last year still I willing to forgive
a slight step back in performance given
that the price tag came down $200 among
bottom freezers it's going to be tough
to beat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
