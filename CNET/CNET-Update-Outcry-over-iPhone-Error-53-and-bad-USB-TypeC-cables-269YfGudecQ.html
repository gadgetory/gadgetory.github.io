value Assisi cables I'm Bridget Carey
this is your C net update hey kids
pop quiz what happens when you try to
charge your devices with a bad quality
cable the answer is something one Google
engineer had to experience the hard way
when a bad USB type-c cable fried his
Chromebook pixel laptop Benson Lee Young
was testing various USB C cables and
posting reviews about them on Amazon
he's come across plenty of cheap junk
but when he used a model made by a
company called surge tech it destroyed
his gadgets he took a closer look and
saw the cable was completely miswired
which is very dangerous USB type-c is a
new type of charging and data transfer
port it's appearing in more and more
devices Apple put it in the new MacBook
HP Spectre x2 uses one and the latest
Nexus smartphones have them like the 6p
but you need to be skeptical and not
instantly trust any company that makes a
cable or adapter for this new port use
the cords from the gadget maker or read
online reviews very carefully and use
the same caution with any of your cords
bad third party charging cables have
been known to roon phones or worse cause
battery fires now let's say a bad cord
isn't your problem your phone works but
you just busted the screen while Apple
stores change the policy and will now
take back iPhones with broken screens or
cameras giving you a store credit an
Apple spokesman confirm the new policy
after it was first reported by the site
9 to 5 Mac but if you break the home
button with the touch ID fingerprint
scanner just go directly to an Apple
store to get it fixed do not go to an
independent repair shop iPhone 6 and 6s
users who got the touch ID button
repaired are complaining that their
phones are completely bricked and
useless after downloading the latest
software update so if you did get your
phone fixed do not download the new iOS
update if you haven't already the bug is
called error 53 and there's nothing that
can be done to reverse it Apple
confirmed that this happens as a
security measure to discourage tampering
of the touch ID by someone who wants to
steal information and some people are
arguing that this is Apple's way of
imposing a monopoly on
hairs that's it for this tech news
update but there's always more to
explore at cnet.com from our studios in
New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
