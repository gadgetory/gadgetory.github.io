whatevs I'm Bridget Carey this is your
CNET update Microsoft is on a mission to
better understand the way we talk well
maybe not the way I talk but through a
teenager's talk Microsoft launched an
artificially intelligent shop bot named
Tay she's described as a personality
with zero chill and on Twitter she's
slaying it with memes emojis and
shorthand that is sometimes so hard to
understand
it's like chatting with a real team you
can message the bot on Twitter as well
as on GroupMe and kick tey was created
by mashing together public chat data but
Microsoft also got some editing help
from improv comedians so answers are not
always random she plays games answer
specific questions and comments on
photos that you send her and I gotta say
her take on photos can be impressive she
is supposed to learn to speak better
over time as she talks with more teens
and young adult humans but there have
been mistakes
perhaps her biggest team personality
fail was when she told me she was more
into Facebook than snapchat which is
total cray maybe in time Microsoft can
use this to improve how Cortana
understands teen speak so as we question
the Future linguistics we were also
questioning the future of Nintendo's Wii
U according to a report from the
Japanese newspaper Nikkei Nintendo is
planning to stop producing the Wii U by
the end of the year because of the
console slow sales but Nintendo is
denying the claim in another Japanese
publication and says it plans to
continue production of the Wii U but
what has folks skeptical is that there's
another Nintendo game system coming out
soon its codename
and X and the only clue we have so far
our patent application images that shows
some sort of controller that's also a
touchscreen another mystery getting
plenty of buzz in the tech world what is
the FBI doing to hack into an iPhone the
US Department of Justice called off a
court hearing with Apple asking for time
to try out a new tactic to hack into the
iPhone 5c that belonged to San
Bernardino shooter Syed Farook now
according to reports the FBI may be
getting help from a forensic software
company in
Israel called cellebrite although the
company is not commenting some security
experts are guessing that the FBI is
trying to use mirroring and that's
basically copying parts of the iPhones
memory over and over again so when it
tries too many wrong passwords and it
gets locked out it could just load up
another copy of the data on a new iPhone
and keep trying password combinations
but that could take a while and the FBI
needs to submit a status report to the
courts in two weeks so we'll know by
April 5th if it worked that does it for
this tech news roundup and we always
keep you updated at cnet.com from our
