and today you know summers coming here
in the northern hemisphere at least and
but we're still stuck on our screens
we're not the type that are you know
gearing up for for baseball season too
much we've got season finales that are
wrapping up around this time of year and
we're also trying to get ready for what
seems actually like a pretty lackluster
blockbuster summer season it's more of a
lackluster season than a blockbuster
season I guess so we'll talk a little
bit about that and also give you an
update on how you can crowdsource a
science fiction novel which were in the
midst of and Kelsey will test it is the
project that never ends but it's cool so
we'll get into that um so but let's
start uh with with TV and we do have one
season finale going down tonight it's
the finale tonight of the flash right on
CW yeah and so Kelsey and Jeff you guys
are the resident flash fans your
flashers yeah well not anymore anyway
they're a flash mob oh so many marketing
hashtags that need to happen
all right talk flash yes staring at each
other this guy he runs really fast okay
faster it's a question um no I'm looking
forward to seeing what goes down tonight
I've actually fitting Jeff yeah guys
guys gonna build up to it I so I'm gonna
do full disclosure I broke up with flash
a while ago ah because the characters
really kind of annoying me all the
girlfriend characters or the will they
or won't they type stuff happening so
I'm not I'm not caught up in this latest
season so as a person who hasn't caught
up what would you say is the most
exciting thing that's happened this
season I mean it's not been that
exciting as oh okay they've been too
many episodes where we spent a lot of
time just talk it Barry you know the
kind of guy you are yet we know we've
seen watching this show for two seasons
we know what Barry's like I mean that
there was some plot but they kind of
keep reversing it like oh we'll go over
to earth to then we'll come back then
we'll shake it off then we'll open it up
and look at me you know I don't know
Jeff yeah does it hook into legends but
other show the the day actually had
their their finale last yeah so how well
does that interconnector does it
interconnect much at all with arrow and
mosh just barely legends of tomorrow
right right yeah you remember the first
season had that great crossover with
with arrow and it was really good right
it kind of emotion I've really enjoyed
the crossovers between Supergirl and
flash I heard that was good haven't seen
it and now that super girls going over
to CW it'll be interesting how much that
changes if at all so so they're gonna do
a big ol for pickles for way Tara for us
I know I had never had to think before I
was don't talk about your fan fiction
Jeff it's not the show for that or maybe
it is i don't know uh yeah they're gonna
they're gonna have everybody cross over
so what so what happened on the season
finale then we still haven't talked
about Oh flash yes tonight well this
tonight so weird there's there's like um
what's the build-up what's the thing
relationship hours then he got them back
okay and zoom still the bad guy and
hahahaha did you take my stowed away
cause you thought I was doing product
marketing haha I just assumed cbs-owned
coca-cola at this point we met the evil
Black Canary Orion okay she's called
black siren why do they have to change
the name when the go evils that like
start Star Wars rules like when you go
to the dark side yeah it's like Darth
and maybe excited actors where everybody
has to have a different name I'm just
starting the database superheroes and
villains gotcha okay it's like the the
DC television version of having a goatee
that's how is it evil twin okay I get it
alright so in this segment is kind of
reaffirming a lot of my assumptions
about the show which is that it may be
its kind of fallen by the wayside of you
don't you don't hear about it too much
is that right is it losing momentum I
don't know I used to honestly but I'm
still watching I mean I've I've stayed
current with it I think every week are
you guys hate watching it are you like
no I just didn't like it through it it's
just it's kind of slowed down yeah i
mean i would subvert cliffhanger ii was
that even a word I just know that's
totally okay and didn't Jeff weren't you
saying you felt like Barry um oh I feel
like Barry right now is like one of the
dumbest smart guys on TV um cuz like I'm
thinking about like like the first
episode of flash where he's like you
know seeing tire tracks in his head and
he's like doing all this kind of numbers
he kind of thing I always thought of a
flashes Wesley Crusher of the DC like
boy genius but he's clueless and social
situations right so but then they've
been doing this thing with the Speed
Force where he just has no real short
term memory can't really concentrate
like he can speed read a book but then
he doesn't really retain much which kind
of explains why he's been letting all
the other scientists do all the actual
science for quite a while now yeah so
he's smart but he's just scatterbrained
which you know that's a thing yeah I
mean maybe they should test him for
dyslexia at this point I don't know like
that's just I know I've never I'm not a
DC person I'm a Marvel person aside from
wonder woman i'm not in batman I'm not
DC person so for for me its agents of
shield so in agents of shield did their
season finale last week I was all over
that do you guys watch agents of shield
or by the only one talking about it no
III missed out cuz that's on a different
day I don't why don't what I don't
have actual cable i watch everything
online so here we see Daisy so it's a
I'm just gonna go straight into agents
of shield do it I loved it except grant
Ward so this is grant Ward taken over by
Hydra the whole concept I'm sorry hi if
the whole concept thank you the whole
concept was that he could kind of
brainwash people different in humans and
agents of shield to do what he wants but
he brainwashed him in a weird way that
he could have possessed them in a way
and it hit their endorphin so they were
super happy clearly Daisy's not happy
here and she's fighting grant Ward /
hive what was his hive name what was his
like else say us or something at
something weird it means high five okay
the cool David ok so there's cool things
and they're not cool things about this
season finale in my opinion I'm gonna do
some spoilers if you haven't seen it yet
you should probably close your eyes and
ears for a little while but the thing is
really kind of weird was his face reveal
on agents of shield so he's kind of
good-looking here as grant Ward its face
cuz that's the body he took over but his
real in human face kind of looks like
Davy Jones from Pirates of the Caribbean
he has tentacle face oh i thought you
lose face monkeys not from the monkeys
differently you're sold yeah i think
cool is actually a bit older if we're
gonna be yeah it looks more like an
elder God than anything when he shows
his real face but in this fight which
was actually really good fight
especially when you realize that Daisy
is super tired she's been drained of
most of her blood and she's going
through withdrawals because she finally
got him out of her system um you can't
kill him it's very hard to kill him so
she just stabbed him like four times and
he just stared at her hey let's see
whose body has been taken I'm sorry this
up in I really never mind we're here to
get super nerdy come on oh just hairy on
do it micro bees and they're like
rebuilding and smashed nano nano tech in
a way no bits biological spy own and
I've by own Daniel by microorganisms go
on please this way i love you here cuz
you came onto the show to not be on a
show it's crazy yeah
good I love it I'm like a wicked
microbiome or something yeah here's the
other thing that I'm in this season
finale I still here grants voice hang on
okay in the trailer I'm like only crap
it's just as easy to the cross see the
cross that just went through the air
like that the necklace yeah so the thing
the whole problem the whole premise of
this and it was a two-parter finale was
that Daisy's trying to get him out of a
system so she's going through
withdrawals in the meantime I've wants
to in fact the entire world with this
virus that could decide whether or not
humans become these weird in human type
well it wakes up any potential in humans
and turns the rest of them into kind of
servitor yeah like weird and you face
head things oh there's our imminent in
the this is a very very very very end
odd six months forward after they take
down the you know the operation blow up
the earth within human virus uh and we
find that Daisy is now gone rogue and
she has like a weird goth outfit now and
blah blah blah blah not being super
rugby wearing a lot of me okay so the
thing I wanted to get back to you so
that cross necklace that was flowing in
there what happened was Daisy touched an
inhuman that who's in human ability was
to look into the future but she only
gets bits and pieces of the future so
that's all she saw and then she saw a
patch of a jacket that she thought might
be that Jack okay so that jacket so she
doesn't know if that's her she is she
thinks it's her but we find out later
it's not here's the thing that it's not
just the future specifically flashing
forward to somebody's death exactly so
the problem with this idea though is
that there's this whole idea of
self-sacrifice and the cross and I got
super jesusí which I was not expecting
in a sci-fi show to go super Jesus eat
okay can I just point out so Coulson has
this line here where he's like well yeah
it's times like this that I realized why
other people pray because like he
doesn't pray because he's too cool for
that this is exactly like this thing
that happened in one of the worst
episodes of season one um where sky is
all you know I'm not a Christian but if
I were this is how it should be god is
love global you know so it's like
they're
trying to have it both ways they're
trying to lecture us about Christianity
while pretending that they're not
actually Christian which they obviously
are um I think it's obnoxious I I think
it's odd like I I was kind of like where
did this all come from I'm glad you
brought up that episode because I
totally forgot that episode where she
even talked about that and I'm like um
are there no other faiths in the writer
room right now and also it's just I mean
I get it having faith and your comrades
or your crewmates or your agents is a
good thing self-sacrifice there's
something wrong with that and there's
nothing wrong with being Christian it
was just jarring moment in sci-fi where
you're like wait what what's going on I
just rejected the dishonesty of it you
know like have a Christian character
like yo-yo for example and that's great
Mac whatever that's their faith but
don't pretend your other characters
aren't but then put these words in their
mouth that's what it also don't treat us
stupidly like we know the story of Jesus
you don't need to throw across interface
and go so sacrifice like we know
everybody even if you're not Christian
you know that story so it's like you
don't need it to be part of this huge
plot line I thought it's funny they
picked Lanka's the figure 2 because um
cnet colleague eric franklin really
hates him sorry Eric he just thinks he's
really weak I mean this is a while ago
maybe he loves him by now I don't know
but and we were talking about it anyway
he was saying like what's the point this
guy's got no chemistry with Daisy and
it's like no that is the point of him
he's like the tiger beat boy he's
harmless he is that's the whole he is
he's a Lisa Simpson with it didn't what
comic did she's to read the
non-threatening boys magazine zactly
yeah he's good non-threatening whereas
clearly grant Ward was the bad guy or
bad boy that she was finding herself
attracted to but didn't really know how
to deal with that but you know so she
liked having the non-threatening boy
yourself I was bad for lightning but I
just call him lightning boy I would feel
bad for lightning boy because it seemed
like oh this guy's going down he's
disposable so anyway so then that
happened a couple episodes before this
they did a very horrible shout out to I
guess agent Carter's dead because they
show a newspaper clipping of agent
Carter debt because she shows up as an
old lady in Civil War right um no and
that's she shows up in Winter Soldier
Winter Soldier that's it yeah has an old
lady in civil where they just announced
that she's alright and then they
announced he's dead I read
china home was complaining that we
didn't get to see her die I'm on camera
which I personally think it's sort of
morbid like she was already out of the
story why do we need to well I want to
see her die too I feel like if you're a
big superhero or your big character in
the superhero franchise you deserve a
good death well you don't bothered me
her funeral the only picture they have
of her is when she was young like it's
all about steve and what she meant to
steve it's not actually her funeral I
mean she lived this really long like she
did all these things but but none of
that matters except the fact that she
used to be young and pretty yeah that
would be like if wonder woman died and
they're like hey you know she dated an
astronaut that's right picture of a
store not like them kissing a horrible
holding hands just like yeah that's that
bugs me too so I I don't know and then
agents of she'll get cancelled which we
all kind of even know a lot of us love
that you are not agents killed agent
partner agent Carter agent Carter sorry
decreed a heart attack on Facebook life
our new partners um no agent Carter got
cancelled me also cuz Hayley at Will's
on another show yeah not that that's
impossible there are many actors these
days that are doing two shows at the
same time but I think that they just the
ratings weren't there or maybe Marvel
just didn't think that the ratings were
there I loved the show I thought it was
great ABC makes it really hard to watch
their shows I don't you know like
something like the CW will actually
upload and update that same night so
yeah I shouldn't talk about it people
the next day ABC even if you pay money
you can't get some things sometimes for
a couple weeks sorry I'm bitter about
this no I am going to because I think
ABC and fox are like the Grim Reaper's
of cable television where they met they
always they don't reek of shows really a
chance to find themselves whereas CW is
very nurturing and yes UW's canceled a
few things here and there right off the
bat but for the most part they're
nurturing so I'm glad to see Supergirl
moving over there for sure I really
wanted netflix or CW to save agent
Carter unfortunately that's not going to
happen and then most wanted was supposed
to be the spinoff from a she lands and
Bobby right and that didn't even get
greenlit that pilot was made and
everything and they didn't even greet
Lynn it which is weird because we all
thought it would so maybe those two
characters will come back on two agents
of shield now that they're not going to
get their own spin-off because they were
disavowed as
agent which was also one of the most
depressing uh episodes ever of them
doing the cheers at the bar and things
like that so anyway so that's kind I
guess that's sort of the Marvel update
as far as TV and our super update
Netflix is definitely not happening for
agent carter i don't think so i wrote an
article about it being cancelled and
that there was a petition in the
petition to save it got over a hundred
thousand signatures already so there's
definitely a pattern of people that want
to see it survive somewhere but again
the lead character the lead actress
who's in it agreed to be on another TV
show so if it is gonna go anywhere it
would have to be Netflix it would have
to be Netflix fall Netflix is gonna be
like the only place right well the
problem with Netflix and Marvel Marvel
already well Marvel already has a
strategy with Netflix and that doesn't
include agent Carter that includes
jessica jones Luke Cage defenders I mean
that's what that is so I don't know I
wish I could save it if I was a
zillionaire I would have my own channel
called agent Carter TV and just do agent
Carter programming the whole time but I
might be am I the only person that's
observed though that when shows get
cancelled by networks and then they are
saved by online whether it's like you
know amazon netflix yahoo whatever the
the the second resurrected version is
not as good as the first I'm thinking
like Arrested Development and there you
think immunity what about well yeah when
it goes on to another network it changes
a little bit like Mindy project got a
saved and put on hulu right I know
you're a huge mindy project fan there um
but think of family guy how many times a
family guy get cancelled and brought
back to life it's like yeah but it's
always the show that never dies yeah but
Fox did try to get rid of it a few times
oh yeah number time I mean I don't know
I'm still bitter about Firefly get fired
and then Castle got the axe as well
speaking of firefly actor Nathan Fillion
but there was some talk about half the
cast well not half the cast two major
characters getting taken off the show of
course women I don't know if that means
anything but the main lead that was his
wife was taken off the show and
the forensic doctor was taken off the
show so i don't i don't know it's just
weird that's and castle was a good show
i mean had strong ratings um strong fan
base so I I don't know I never know why
certain things get canceled because it
was a police procedural police
procedurals do really well if you look
at our lovely sideshow on cnet of all
the new shows that are coming out quite
a few of them were police procedurals
and there's two times time travel shows
oh yeah that's right so what were you
saying about the time travel show that
low when I was watching timeless right
yeah the main a Stargate type vehicle
they used to go back in time looks like
what well I just I was only half paying
attention so I might even have the wrong
show no but when I was it would they
were serving up as an ad like on hulu or
something and I looked up and I'm like
wow that kind of looks like the CBS I
and I'm like is this a cbi show because
that's you know yeah no apparently it's
on NBC yeah it's like the eye of sauron
CBS may go but not so there's that and I
don't remember the other timeless I'm
sorry the other time travel show uh a
timeless might take up the agent Carter
void I feel for missing the 40s so I
don't know cuz they go back in time to
the 40's assuming it's more I mean
realistic than the DC legends time
travel I know I feel like time travel is
that the new zombie thing now yeah
they're even doing in a game of thrones
there's a lot of time travel happening I
feel like time travel as a zombie it's
either police or visa is either police
procedural zombies or damn your history
so maybe if they do other one making
history so maybe if they just combined
all those maybe if it's a zombie time
traveler I'm down with seeing guys we
were here when Bonnie found her pitch
the show that i'm watching that i'm
looking forward to the end up for this
season has none of those elements am i
the only one watching silicon valley on
HBO in this group yes yes oh I don't
know is there a zombie or werewolf or
vampire I said there's arguably several
zombies I think several characters or do
that but it's super fascinating I'm
season especially because one of the
writers Dan Lyons who used to be a tech
journalists at Newsweek he's got a he's
got a book out now that I just finished
it's really awesome and it's uh it's the
book is called disrupted and it's his
memoir of of leaving tech journalism
while actually getting laid off when
Newsweek went under and then he wouldn't
worked at a start-up actually in Boston
for a couple of years and it's so much
of the show it is also in his in his
memoir although i don't know if that's
on purpose or not but anyway I highly I
mean if you follow Silicon Valley at all
i'm guessing people that are watching
this because they're on cnet they
probably do it's just hilarious and it
nails you know so many characters I mean
you'll recognize characters real-life
characters in this show and does it take
place now or is it the beginning of
silicon valley like halt and catch fire
is no it's no no it's now is now ok yeah
this halt and catch fire just makes me
feel old so when I watch it I'm like oh
I remember when cable internet started
and I remember when social media started
and I remember when we saw the first Mac
kind of snuck in to Comdex like so to me
that's like old person Silicon Valley
cuz we're all remembering that but I've
been hesitant to watch Silicon Valley
did you highly recommend it for all
viewers or is it more bro kind of show
no no it's just I mean if you know if
you know anything about tech culture at
all which obviously all of us do I mean
you'll get you'll get a lot of the jokes
okay cool it's just well written and
then totally funny all right tsarni with
that that's my pitch GP that's all I God
ok so the one show I'm not looking
forward to is that weird hanna-barbera
wanna be a half animated half in real
life who framed roger rabbit titled
again i have a video cron no not cron
it's like some weird it's kind of like
he looks like he man or the dude from
thunder not thunder the barbarian yeah
it looks like thunder the barbarian but
he's like in the real world around real
humans it's live action but then it's
this 2d animated character on top of it
and I feel like that it's going to have
the same type of humor or trying to have
the same type of
whereas like Archer but I don't reminded
me more of like space ghost coast yeah
maybe that's what they're trying to go
for I don't know I thought it looked
kind of funny okay well then I won't be
too judging I know bad I know this is
all based on like you know like two
minutes of C yeah I mean how do you how
can you judge a show based on a trailer
and I well that's that's what the
trailers for no that's what I do
actually that's that's my post well
these are the covers of the budget
you're judging I don't know like I I
don't know I all sound like with Kelsey
I don't want to invest in shows are
gonna be cancelled like after the first
season cuz I'm not wasted a year
watching a show that I'm never gonna get
the ending too so I don't mind that I
just having to wait a couple weeks for
every new episodes illustrating it's
what i was talking well how about we
judged some upcoming movie haha that's
what we've got Star Trek yes Star Trek
so we were just talking about how
there's not too much hype around this
case I'm not next month well I've barely
watched anything but I covered the new
trailer came out on Saturday it was an
event in LA for Star Trek beyond where
they had the actors there Adam
Mythbusters Adam Savage was kind of like
the guy that was interviewing people JJ
Abrams was there he's the producer and
is that Justin Lin is the director from
Fast and the Furious he's directing this
so if you see this being a lot more
fast-paced than usual that's because the
dude that does all those fast and
furious movies is directing um and Simon
Pegg co-wrote it so think about that
when you're watching this that's good
this has totally been off the radar I'm
gettin excited cuz i've seen all I've
seen the other two that Abrams I'm
excited because I'm excited because
honestly they're going somewhere but
here's the problem i have with the
trailer and one of our viewers on our
one of our followers on twitter also
commented on this and you're going to
see this in a minute what I'm about to
say these little swarming things by the
way if your star wars fan you're
probably going to remember those as buzz
droids all right anyway these buzz
droids attack the ship and oh guess what
they all have to leave in little pods
oh and I guess the enterprise blows up
again and one of her viewers was like
why don't they just rename it the exit
prize because it never stays in one
piece but we got cool warrior female
character um there's that yeah by the
way he can't there's no way Simon Pegg
can hold on to one hand I'm just putting
that out there I can't even do that when
I'm getting out of
yeah I'm again I'm getting pumped
watching this yeah at least we see her a
fight some more which is great uh cuz of
her uh this one he'll fight her oh and
yeah she's a girlfriend Sulu the BMX
action fax me up that's what's really
start back you know I've really come to
love the like new the new generation of
in the movies not the next generation
the new generation with Chris Pine I
really like this cast quite a bit yeah
they work here's the thing if I love
Scotty but he just reminds me pretty
much of Benji from Mission Impossible
but that's okay because I mean Simon
pigs awesome I think the cast is amazing
I'm a little annoyed they're trying to
keep that romance thing going between
her and Spock I don't care about it and
it bugs me that they keep doing that to
poor who aku she's amazing as a
character and they shouldn't just keep
girlfriend in her up and i'm pretty sure
chris pine is probably gonna have
another sex scene because he has to
because he's Shatner and shatner can't
be depicted in any new movie without him
like in bed with like a bunch of alien
ladies so but they didn't put that in
the trailer at least where they did with
the other ten movies a shatner shadows
shatner shadow so i I'm excited I I even
know it's not exactly what I would do
I'm excited just because it's something
that's not Star Wars for a little while
even though I'm a huge Star Wars fan I
didn't see Star Trek get up there and
also at this event that happened in LA
where they released the poster they
released the trailer that you just saw
they're going to do a world premiere the
movie at san diego comic-con with the
san diego symphony doing the music so
sort of what they did last year with
Star Wars they're doing it this year was
with Star Trek and they made that
announcement which I think we also had
on cnet about how they Paramount's not
going to sue the fan oh the fans for
their vm movie and cling taking Klingon
away from the fans and all that so which
is good JJ said that's you know not how
you treat Franz you can't take away the
stuff from the people that are giving
you free marketing you don't want to
take away your audience by being mean
right
a movie comes out too so I just wanted
to say that i think in Abrams reboot of
next generation would be hilarious I
know me too the woods what's going on
with a new TV show that is on CBS Star
Trek new TV show you saw the teaser yeah
well it was it was just we saw the logo
and that's it okay we don't know the
cast yet no okay are we at all
uncomfortable with the level of
influence that one JJ Abrams has over
both Star Trek and Star Wars franchises
I mean do we have like any kind of geek
culture antitrust suit that we need to
bring that's like a little much I'm not
ready like we had this debate a few
years ago yeah no it's did we yeah we
yeah i mean i don't know he's like the
male shonda rhimes sorry he's dead did a
good job as far as I'm concerned no I
don't know I mean every thurs critics of
him and then there's people that
absolutely adore him I just wrote about
Chewbacca masks mom and you know that
woman that has the number-one viral
facebook your business with her obsessed
with her because I have that mask I
should have brought it oh you do I
should have brought out tiger you're
like that could have been me no no I
don't want it to be me I did not want
that level of Fame but she was also on
James Corden last night he usually does
the carpal carpool karaoke with singers
but says she had her on cuz her laugh is
pretty infectious but you could tell if
she's annoyed pretend annoyed this is
great right no I know that you're happy
to baffle to philly back all right
there's a sound like Chewbacca Nina does
cubed a little late you missed it
there's JJ Abrams that's why I brought
this up cuz he was on what are you doing
here been here the whole time can I give
you one directors note yeah yeah yeah no
it's less like this
and it's Marcus by the way that's more
director notes in George Lucas ever gave
in all three movies no I dare anyone
that has a carpool to do this cuz I
would love to see I mean maybe not while
you're driving cuz I don't know what the
visibility is on these masks but uh you
have to admit that is pretty funny so I
don't know she's you know she's milk in
the 15 minutes but she deserves it cuz
she's like one of those Star Wars fans
that everyone appreciates because she
genuinely like Star Wars and she's
having she's having fun with it what she
said in that video that she put on the
mask and taped a videotaped her putting
on the mask you just come out of a store
after she bought it and she didn't not
to become famous she did it cuz she has
kids she's a stay-at-home mom and she
did it because she had kids and she
wanted to prove in video form that the
mask was hers and it was for her and not
for her kids so when her kids tried to
steal it front for themselves she could
go oh no you know this is mine so she
just did it on a whim she was super
excited when i hit a thousand viewers
and then she went to bed and she woke up
and it was a million viewers now it's
140 million viewers it's actually a la
most popular facebook live video and i
mean aside from this one right numbers
numbers are not in yeah i know i should
wait and see how the crave cast I should
have brought the mask I didn't even
think of that like I should have brought
it for this but Jeff doesn't mean what
you were do it oh no I can't do it on
the spine ah that's better than mine
everybody can do it anyway so you could
check out that video and cnet I wrote
about last night because I was I
couldn't sleep and I saw it I thought it
was cute so they real quick that show
you're talking about with the he-man
looking guys yeah son of Zorn upset and
I have it right that's it thinking about
what I can't get him where I'm from
longueuil all mom says you got a job and
I think it looks kind of funny nice I
would never watch it but it looks
interesting exactly like a woman he
carries a purse you say what happened it
is supposed to be more like Space Ghost
I think you're right job that's bound to
happen one what was that adult swim show
that was very psychedelic with a similar
looking character
it was just one extreme really really
not narrowing it down oh you mean metal
aqaba no no it had like a really funny
name that I was just like on going to
psychedelic I bet you faced someone in
the charm I'm sure if someone in the
chat room is saying it it's not brac his
brac was a spinoff from I was like ah
forget it was had like really weird name
too anyway seminole come on name
everybody and robot robot chicken get
renewed so if we're talking about adult
swim that's another thing wow I feel
like adult swim can't ever cancel robot
chicken because like their flagship
that's their flagship show it's like
there's CSI Oh which reminds me uh CSI
cyber got canceled so those people that
were watching it and like myself who
were hate watching it and turning it
into a drinking game and I normally like
the CSI shows but the CSI cyber was so
hilarious it's like whenever law and
order SVU does something on internet uh
harassment and you're like that's not
really how that works but whatever yeah
but anyway I hate to break it to you but
CSI cyber is gone ah I know I maybe
they'll do CS ivr you don't know I'm
hoping they will like it's just I like
those cop procedural shows when they're
so off base when it comes to tech that
you can't help but watch it like happy
hour show like I want to say like the
early early nine years yeah well there's
a mere five or something there's a
murder she wrote episode with we always
bring this up because it's always always
bring this up because Jessica Fletcher
Angela Lansbury and her you know oculus
rift thing that wasn't really oculus yet
cuz it was the 80s so I don't even know
what they called that VR at that point
everything's vector so it's like Tron
that's more yeah there we go it's really
she's the nintendo nintendo power gloves
on like it's just you know and then when
they demand more gifts from that yeah
it's it's you know it's actually on
netflix right now so if you have netflix
look at Murder She Wrote I don't
remember the name of the episode but is
hilarious and she has to find out her
murder miss like the murder clues in the
vector Tron spy
so I think I think based on my extensive
research i typed it into google a
virtual murder that's it that's it
that's it so I i highly recommend anyone
who wants to go back into the VR
nostalgia file that's season 10 episode
5 thank you well cuz if you're gonna be
looking through Murder She Wrote that's
a lot of season that's like twelve
twelve seasons yeah there's more than
magnum p.i I know that much and there
was no Magnum prv our episode sad that's
like a good name for a video game
virtual murder I know anyway I'd watch
magnum VR that becoming I know I think I
get to be the mustache Magnum be the
mustache so zen of you what else we're
supposed to talk about Eric we're like
rocketing backwards through pop culture
I am sorry I'm waiting for the disco VR
so three more movies that I had on my
list for the summer the lame summer of
2016 is the one that's been talked about
way too much and it seems like it should
about nine months ago which is Billy the
Ghostbusters reboot but I feel like
we've been talking about forever how are
they doing one of those yeah haha well I
mean people that hate the new one that's
coming out just so you know they just
announced that they're gonna re-release
the original Ghostbusters and theaters
yeah for like a weekend or weekend so
everyone who hates this can at least
pretend I mean they're early reviews
have not look so hot right I don't know
well it's just the trail at really they
just made too long of a trailer honestly
the news isn't even about the movie
anymore the news is about the people
reviewing the movie yeah okay I do a
search and you'll see there's all these
like articles that either people really
really hate it they're gonna boycott it
and then there's people that are really
excited for it and they're gonna go see
it twice to make up for the boycotters
so I know yeah that's so stupid people
really i'm a boycott the movie is there
like the dumbest people yeah they do
know boycotting really means nothing
yeah oh I will tell you the new ecto
hi-c came out alright and I drank it and
it a delicious you didn't bring any oh
yeah when I only own one can
what the hell are points are a visit
green there you go slime yeah uh so yeah
the ghostbusters I mean I guess it's
like the opposite of what's going on
with Star Trek beyond I mean feel like
that one's been way overhyped we've
heard nothing about Star Trek and
another one that I don't think we've
heard very much about that I'm excited
maybe this isn't quite our little
demographic slice of Americana here but
the bfg anyone roll every time I see
that I just keep thinking of one of the
big guns from doom and then I no no no
look I stork insurance library so yes
Eric I know what you're talking that
what does she do John I have no idea
what a big friendly giant it's a roald
dahl book same guy who did Charlie in a
chocolate factory he's a very dark more
betrayal okay yeah and doll was had a
very interesting life so you should look
up his biography or at least read
Wikipedia because he was watch the
episode of drunk history were they cuz
he was a spy wasn't he oh yeah yeah he
was like it better than bond you don't
get a whole lot from from this trailer
but you know if you're into the kind of
like creepy children genre which is what
he was all about this should be a good
one James and the Giant Peach is a melon
it's animated is some of it like stop
motion or anything like that just to
actually to CGI yeah the Giants I think
CGI go bad also what do you mean I
thought they didn't build a giant I wait
a second wait a second this is this
looks exactly like never ending story
what's happening here no it does not
know god I wish they'd week make that
never yeah kajagoogoo needs a worker kid
looking at identical with glasses harry
potter what in the dark harry potter s
don't swing a pink dress is completely
different what don't get me started
don't be gender bias dudes can wear
dresses to bed if they want I didn't say
that that wasn't a dude i said it's
completely different cuz that's where i
think dressen sebastian wasn't basket so
this away OE and also sleeping beauty
trailer right i have that one to play
okay so we good we did an article Oh
site squad I don't even know what did I
care more about the back stories of how
Jared Leto is creeping everyone out and
the
more than I care about everything the
fact that he's always in character in
movies you don't want a guy who can't
get out of the in character Joker I mean
I guess he pleasured was always in
character too but yeah method acting and
comic book villains don't seem like they
would I don't think method acting is
acting anymore I think you just have
become a person thanks social media so
Luke did Luke Lancaster and Australia
did a piece on how they tried to make
Suicide Squad look really fun and funny
and guardians of the galaxy esque but we
suspect that that's not really the movie
is actually made and that they're just
kind of cutting the trailers to look
like that and I feel like it's a cross
between like suicide girl video and
seven it's gonna be so violent and there
was i mean i don't know maybe they're
trying to dead pull it up well rumor has
it that because dead people was so
successful they're trying to kind of
recut this to make it funnier and
lighter but who knows one suggestion
from the YouTube chat room Maurice
Thompson says he's looking forward to
dr. strange anyway oh yeah duh I mean I
tried to go through a Comber cleanse but
I'm right back drinking the cumberbatch
kool-aid sorry I can't help it like the
only thing I don't like is I wish they
kept his british accent because i don't
think it really matters at this point if
it's british or not I mean they you know
hey if Marvel changed a villain in iron
man 3 from female to male then let
Cumberbatch have a British accent if
we're not going to be accurate with the
comics and who cares he should have kept
his british accent and they changed the
ancient one to tell this one yeah i mean
well yeah that's a bit of hollywood
whitewashing though to be honest Tilda
Swinton could play anything I mean you
could she could play a cardboard box and
get a Academy Award for it so I'm
excited for dr. strange because it's
such a great story and great comic we
should develop that pitch what Tilda
Swinton is behind sweat and cars work
hahahaha the tag went what did the ball
super box
yeah all right she looks like a strange
not all November so we got a while for
them yeah it's it's a while I mean I'm
still I still I still watch Buster's go
it's kind of I mean I you know I like
watching scruffy batch there's nothing
wrong with that but it's interesting
because if you know a lot about
Cumberbatch soul patch patch if you like
so much batch there's so many batches if
you like dr. bad should be like twittg
batch like in German injured batch you
think scrappy that would be an excellent
co-star first winter bucks dude weird
like young long beard hair batch right
there yeah i mean that's bad that's bad
weed beard that's fo beard and then I
think it's funny I think Cumberbatch's
so good at playing injured because he's
been injured so much in Sherlock but you
know that some of the photos that we saw
that were happening in New York when
they were filming it were pretty amusing
and he went into a comic book shop and
actually as Doctor Strange dressed up
the bada dr. strange comment till the
sugar tried writing a check that would
have been oh I know right doctors
handwriting is the worst too and it's
very inception like the trailer I mean
if you look at the comments of our
articles that we've I did a I did an
actual breakdown of this trailer scene
by scene by scene on cnet as a gallery
because I'm obsessed obviously
that's cool but it is it looks great
thanks for bringing it up I totally
forgot about it cuz im so it's for angry
right now so some people in the chat
room keep asking what the what the
google doc is that that i referenced in
the the preview pose for the show people
demand google docs people to back google
doc news ah can't wait for that movie
well you never know so no but that let
us do with the the crowd-sourced sci-fi
novel that we've been publishing for the
past couple of weeks here on Sina we've
talked about on the show since I mean
this is be going on so I feel like it's
been going on since last year in
November is when we threw a Google Doc
online with an outline of a sci-fi novel
and we asked everyone to help us
crowdsource it and then a few months
later we did actually have a semblance
of a novel and then um Kelsey and I and
a few other people have spent the last
few months editing and endlessly editing
the thing I came to a story not edit any
of this that was you and your wife I've
read it rereading okay comes baby
proofing providing feedback um keeping
my big question on this is when it gets
optioned how are you do writer credit is
the screenplay going to be then
crowd-sourced as well I feel look so the
way we did this you want to get the
gritty of it is we put the google doc
online and it's still actually there and
anyone can still go edit it and play
around with it that's actually cnet com
/ crowd sci-fi that takes you right to
the google doc we're talking about and
that google doc is over a hundred pages
that is all creative commons meaning
anyone could build upon it take it and
you know change something else make
crowdsource fanfiction I don't care do
whatever you want like it but it's
amazing to me about this is it was not
just completely filled with porn and you
know trolling and how did you how did
you avoid that there was I mean there
was a couple of instances but you know
sorry about that by the way I don't like
it is now
I'm amber batch surprising to me too
actually is that yeah I mean there may
be one case of vandalism and then there
were a few scenes of like maybe so
erotica although they actually miss me
they weren't actually that bad they
didn't make they didn't make the final
call at my tentacle paragraph later um
but you know i don't know i mean i'd
like to compare it um you know to like a
jigsaw puzzle where we just kind of put
this jigsaw puzzle out on a card table
at a party and then people kind of like
would stop and do a couple of pieces or
maybe do an entire like section of the
puzzle and over a couple of months an
actual narrative did emerge and kelsey
you know it's been kind of interesting
when you asked hundreds of people to
write a book you end up with obviously
different writing voices and different
writing styles so we did have to get a
little creative to figure out a way to
kind of preserve the crowd source nature
of it I didn't just go in and like edit
everything so that it sounds like I
wrote it because then what would be the
point of having crowd-sourced it so it's
worth checking out it's uh cnet com /
crowd dash control and that's that's
where it lives and there's ten what yeah
we're on ten right yeah we have tan
installments up now and the next one is
going to come out tomorrow I'm also
working on kind of a few lessons learned
posts a little behind the scenes stuff
and if you go into those installments
that Stephens showing you right now i
also posted some screenshots of like
earlier versions from the google doc so
you can kind of see how people discussed
the shaping of the story along the way
and how things were edited and it was it
was really like interesting interesting
process I don't think it I don't know
that we produced a Pulitzer Prize winner
but I mean it's a co-created work with
literally hundreds of contributors
behind it so it's was an interesting
experience to know I think I'm gonna be
figuring out what we learned from it for
all years in advance it's gonna take a
long time to digest it's kind of like a
an exquisite corpse kind of concept
where except with this exquisite corpse
I can
like that uh you don't get to see what
someone wrote before you whereas this
I'm assuming everyone got to see
everything so it wasn't quite a surprise
or a mystery when people were writing
stuff but I love this concept I think
it's really cool and I've read a few of
installments I was super impressed the
hell how well it read like I i agree
with you like when you have that many
people writing you never know if it's
going to sound kind of weird and like
schizophrenic it away or if it actually
makes sense and it's it's been really
entertaining to read it so thank you for
even thinking up this concept it's been
really fun it's a it's kind of actually
I mean it's almost like an exquisite
corpse in Reverse and what I mean by
that is because you know people would
would hear about it then they go into
the google doc and they kind of start
you know you start on page one and they
start reading through it and it started
like copy editing and adding some words
or some passages here and definitely
just because it grew to over a hundred
pages you know not everyone makes it to
the end of those hundred pages so what
we ended up with was you know the first
like half of the book has been read and
edited and rewritten probably ten times
as much as the last chapter wow I
thought chapters very short and probably
still need some work so is there been
any like talk in the comments of people
casting it because I know when I read a
book of fiction I always have to kind of
visualize who I would cast in those
characters so I can visualize it better
so has there been any talk of people
going oh I think this character would be
great played by this or my thinking to
Hollywood about it I well I have we've
talked about this if we talked with this
kelsey do you have any thoughts on any
of the main characters i have a few
literally asked me who had cast as meta
and i said tom hiddleston cuz he's got
like the long black hair the chiseled
cheekbones this nearing superiority but
she pointed out that that's um probably
the wrong race and also much too old and
I was like it's Hollywood ha ha ha
that's the extent of our conversation I
was thinking Adam driver for that role
ok so um Cumberbatch have a spot in this
movie thing come on cover bachelor I
could see Harrison Ford in one of the
rules if that helps which one uh
probably Charles are there any lady oh
sure ok are there any ladies you would
cast me
women um yeah and I'm trying and I can't
I can't think of the names of some of
the actors that I would yeah I mean you
don't have to I just do this when I read
books I do two things and I read books i
generally cast them and then of a book
is boring i had a werewolf whether or
not i should really just like her alive
yeah this place the werewolf um they're
like a david not in werewolf is he was
ok that's playing Aquaman Oh Jason Momoa
yeah he always with pro werewolf for me
I need to say that more neutrally what
does that movie come out that's in
production isn't it it must be it has to
be yeah they announced him a long time
ago like I feel like a year more than a
year yeah yeah its volume production I'm
gonna chartoff when all these movies
come out somewhere but I don't feel like
looking at well here's the other thing
is that i would think we did I don't
know if I'm pretty sure we did seen an
article on this about the shake-up at DC
that was happening to after Batman vs
was at Oh Superman Batman Batman V
Superman ah didn't do so well and so
there was a huge gentleman I'd like one
bazillion dollar yeah well I know it was
no Deadpool so Marvel and DC are always
gonna be battling it out in the movies
and that's that's a thing it's like you
can love both just like you can live
Star Wars and Star Trek yeah but uh
it'll be interesting to see if that
shake-up actually does anything to the
Wonder Woman movie that has yet to give
us the Wonder Woman movie we have a
trailer but i love how Kelsey ziying
Jeff I'm waiting for it something to
happen were you waiting for Jeff to say
something I'm like me time oh I think
everybody's just waiting for me to just
like snap start bitching number two
Superman again oh yeah you're right
that's what I wanted yeah yeah the
superman/batman I I didn't get to aight
i don't remember seeing it I must have
seen it because I wanted to see wonder
woman that was the only reason so I
don't know that's the problem when you
have superhero fatigue cuz there's too
many movies with superheroes in them and
then you have to kind of like parse it
out and go watch an episode of Columbo
as a palate cleanser no I started
watching food watching a new shows but I
can watch Colombo and drag net in the
adam-12 I and they're all on a lot of
them are on netflix i mean Colombo's on
netflix and then
Gary Whitta Hugh is a screenwriter he's
in he's based in San Francisco and he
worked on some Star Wars properties as
well he's trying to get this whole
hashtag campaign to get mark ruffalo to
play Columbo and a remake which I told
really could see that so I'm just
putting that out there in person and so
if any of you want to take up that
hashtag campaign go for it cuz I think
because that's how things happen in
Hollywood right you just whine a lot
recent petitions final edition Hollywood
my living room and how it works sign a
petition for the the name of the actress
I could remember is a Lupita Nyong'o
sorry yeah I didn't want to get that one
wrong yeah okay fine uh that's that's
who i will add toys on one of the
leading roles in the in that crowd
source to book can we talk about
florence kasane by for a moment sure
okay I'm done I know nobody wants to
talk about it so who would direct the
crowd source novel would be David Lynch
would it be Tarantino is there a
dialogue is that more action so there's
it's it's kind of a talky 1j might
Robert Altman in there just to really
crazy yeah I know what if you want you
can also take Werner Herzog's film class
that I talked about on cnet and Werner
could do something with it though i
don't i don't know if he would which has
he ever done any action movies other
than the documentary like grizzly man's
not really an action movies a good
action type I feel like he's the
documentary got like the David Lynch of
documentaries which I'm sure everyone in
the comments is about ready to kill me
for saying I don't know like I always
want to see different directors do
things with sci-fi and we always
generally get the same kind of directors
or we get action director like the
kenneth branagh did that Thor movie and
it was so good oh my kind of things are
pollination oops but no I'm good okay
good I can't wear towels they would be
willing we'd be willing to have meetings
with any of the above yeah call us here
here's here's Eric smack twitter twitter
yeah David Lynch come on David you may
yet work with Eric hit me up do edge
yeah a deal it haha I think I think
we're way over to
alright we gotta go and wash some old
silent Charlie Chaplin movies you know
the one where you does VR so all right
that's it as always please check out
everything we talked about today vast
majority of it is on cnet com forward
