companies are testing pop-up television
ads I'm Bridget Carey and this is you're
seen that updating it's been a bad week
for Samsung not only is the company
dealing with concerns of its Smart TVs
listening in on conversations but now
there are complaints that the Smart TV
itself will show you pop-up ads when
you're watching a movie some owners
noticed a silent ad for Pepsi
interrupted streaming video when using
two apps one is Plex which is software
that lets you stream videos stored on
your computer the other is Foxtel Play
that's an app that installed on some of
Samsung's Australian televisions Samsung
apologized and says the problem has been
fixed but this little glitch doesn't
come out of nowhere
Samsung has been working with Yahoo to
create TV pop-up ads and it all
complicates consumer fears of Samsung's
spying on living room conversations by
sending voice command recordings to
third parties
Samsung clarified that the third-party
is the software company nuance which
converts spoken commands into text let's
hope that third party doesn't someday
become an advertiser and this wouldn't
have blown up if Samsung was more
transparent in the first place about
what it does with voice data in fact we
could use more transparency about data
collection in all sorts of areas like
cars a US Senate report released this
week found that automakers are
constantly gathering information about
drivers using on-board location tracking
systems that includes where the car has
traveled and how long it is parked
companies are storing that with outside
data centers sometimes with little
protection the report also highlighted a
lack of strong cybersecurity policies to
protect drivers from hacking attacks and
speaking of hacking the White House is
creating a new cybersecurity agency to
track cyber threats and attacks it's
designed to share intelligence from
various departments to better crack down
on cyber terrorism and espionage
President Obama made cybersecurity a top
priority after the crippling attack on
Sony Pictures and the multiple hacks on
retailers and tech companies last year
don't forget 80 million people now have
to worry about fraud after
security numbers and other personal data
was stolen from health insurance
provider anthem and that data by the way
was not encrypted but here's some good
news
at least when it comes to physical world
computer crimes the number of stolen
smartphones has declined in three major
cities since phones started coming with
kill switches the number of stolen
iPhones dropped by 25 percent in New
York by 40% in San Francisco and 50% in
London and that's over the past year
since Apple added activation lock to
iPhones if your phone is stolen you can
prevent it from being reused there by
discouraging thieves who want to resell
it
that's your tech news update there's
