universe I'm Ashley together and I'm
Jeff kanata we're recovering from e3 but
we still have headlines for you we do
targeted drone strikes are a
controversial topic to be sure however
what if we were talking about targeting
bugs meat Agri drone a collaboration
between saga university saga prefecture
an IT company opted him in Japan Agra
drone was created to use less pesticides
on crops in a recent test it used
infrared and thermal cameras to hunt
down around 50 different kinds of pests
at night doling out a precision strike a
pesticide to take out the bad bugs after
locating them if you're into more
traditional methods Agra drone can carry
an electric bug zapper around your
fields at night too
there's still some work to be done in
Agra drone but honestly we think this
would be a great way to eliminate using
a lot of chemicals on your crops it's
kind of crazy it feels like they're
individually targeting targeting bugs
seems really inefficient to me but
zooming in but but then you don't have
to soak a whole crop in chemicals I
appreciate that not even eating the
pesticides Blue Origin created an
emergency on their rocket on purpose did
it work it sure sounds like it did the
commercial space company launched new
Shepard for the fourth time this past
weekend it reached its target altitude
and then the team created a problem for
its crew capsule only two of the
capsules three parachutes opened forcing
it to make a hard landing around 23
miles per hour the rocket re landed
without any hitches and the capsule hit
dirt and stayed intact Blue Origin will
now spend time examining every inch of
the capsule to see what kind of damage
might have occurred and how serious it
might have been I guess this is how you
do it you you intentionally create
problems but it's also you came through
with flying colors yeah it looks like it
did alright I know they want to do pilot
driven trips next year and then the goal
would be actual commercial space tourism
in 2018 I hope it'll create problems for
the pilot driven Trish I mean I guess
you would write you would want to do
that in simulations at least
yeah I would imagine so but not uh not
not intentionally crashing yeah not
intentionally deep parachuting one of
your crew capsules that seems pretty
intense oh okay listen you're gonna get
in the capsule we're gonna DEET we're
gonna drop one of those parachutes
that's gonna be real bad gonna be real
rough but we just want to see what
happens look what do you want to talk
about we might we may or may not do long
show this week guys we're not sure yet
so because of VidCon there's some
scheduling stuff and it's all crazy
crazy week if we did I like I kind of
like the targeted bugs
I like that targeted bugs too it's weird
a pretty cool way of using drones maybe
we'll talk about both I don't know it's
a short week we'll see if you guys want
to talk about the show today you can use
hashtag hey TV on Twitter yeah just let
us know if you have any feedback about
either of these stories or which you
would prefer to hear more talk about we
like that she used that hashtag and then
will incorporate your discussion into
hour-long show if we have one yes and
we've that being said let's check out
our phones are for the day
today's photography comes from met who
did not in fact give me the name of his
device but I'm gonna use this picture
anyway because one it's a selfie and two
he says so in a not so much historical
episode but also not your most recent
you guys said folding fitted sheets was
an impossibility I'm not entirely sure
how serious you were but I'm emailing it
kind of most because I did it I cut the
frozen cheese if you will I don't know
what that means but you did fold a
fitted sheet and for that my friend Matt
we salute you that's impressive
if that is indeed a fitted sheet I'm a
little skeptical it looks like a pillow
he sent met multiple photos of the
fitted sheet and I have to say I am
impressed and and Matt you're better
than us that's basically it yes Matt
doesn't need a robot to fold his fitted
sheets for him you know what even if I
could fit a could fold a fitted sheet
would I want to if I had a robot no of
course not so if you guys want to send
in your phone tog Rafi the theme this
month is selfies we're almost done yeah
it's awesome it's been a fun one month
of selfies but we appreciate those send
them to us tell us what device you took
it on give us your name tell us how to
pronounce it give us permission to use
it on the show and tell us a little
story but I took that picture we like
finding out about fitted sheets and such
yes feel free to get creative with your
stories that is it for today's show
we'll be back tomorrow with a brand new
docket of science fact meeting science
fiction into the most delicious science
heed tech sandwich you've ever eaten
your life but until then be good humans
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
