built out its typhoon camera drone
lineup to include three versions one for
use with the GoPro another with a 1080p
camera and this the top-of-the-line q500
4k with a camera that captures at
resolutions up to 4k at 30 frames per
second and 1080p at up to 120 frames per
second for slow-motion clips the camera
is operated straight from its controller
and unlike competing copters that rely
on a separate smartphone or tablet for
your first-person view from the camera
this has a built-in 5.5 inch touchscreen
the props spin up and wind down at the
press of a button but you'll have to
handle takeoffs and landings on your own
which really isn't a problem since it
stays very steady in the air it's a big
quadcopter and comes with a case for
hauling it around so if you're looking
for something to stash in a backpack
this isn't it the size does make it easy
to spot in the sky though and it is
noticeably quieter than smaller quad
copters and flies very smoothly also
while you won't find autonomous flight
options like Waypoint navigation the Q
500 does have follow me and watching the
options that will keep tabs on whoever
or whatever has the controller at speeds
up to 22 miles per hour and there's a
dynamic return to home at the flip of a
switch and you also get this the steady
grip slide off the camera from the quad
and attach to the grip and you have a
camera completely stabilized for
handheld shooting you can read the full
review on cnet.com but if you don't mind
its size and don't need things like
Waypoint navigation this is a very
compelling camera drone with enough
features to make it worth your while
I'm Josh Goldman we've seen it and
that's a look at the unique Typhoon q500
4k
