the dacor renaissance 30 inch double
wall oven and this is an oven that
promises powerful performance and
flexible cooking and we put it to the
test with all sorts of recipes and
indeed it makes some delicious food
everything we made in this oven just
tasted fantastic it tasted much better
than anything else we cooked in any
other oven it was in a league of its own
throughout all of our tests now that
level of premium performance doesn't
come without a premium price tag and in
the case of the Renaissance that's a
whopping five thousand dollars this is a
very expensive very luxurious oven but
you are gonna get really good tasting
food I just can't stress that enough
so aside from making great dishes let's
take a look at what else the Renaissance
has to offer as an oven it's got two
chambers and you'll be able to control
them both independent of each other up
here from one design the Renaissance
also promises not to leach flavor from
one cavity to the other and we tested
this out by roasting garlic in the
bottom chamber while baking sugar
cookies in the upper chamber no one can
tell that I had baked them at the same
time as that roasted garlic there wasn't
any flavor crossing over it did a great
job in that test if you take a look
inside the oven we'll see that it has a
pretty roomy 4.8 cubic foot capacity and
that's the same on the top and the
bottom
you'll also find this glide rack you get
four of these and they have ball
bearings they come out really smooth and
easy if you have a heavy dish on them
it's no problem to pull it out makes it
a lot easier but I will say that taking
these glide racks in and out of the oven
which you're gonna need to do when
you're running a cleaning cycle or when
you're rearranging things it can be a
little difficult you sort of have to
Jimmy it have to shake it a little bit I
don't like that because they're
expensive and I don't want to bend
anything but still a very good rack now
if we take a look in the back of the
oven we've taken the event off of this
fan and we can show you it's spinning as
we turn it on and the interesting thing
is is that unlike other convection ovens
this one actually pulls air in it
doesn't blow hot air out and Dacor
claims that that makes for more even
dispersal of hot air throughout the oven
it circulates air better it does a
better job at the performance boost that
you get from convection dacor performs
fantastic and if they say that's the
reason why I'm inclined to believe them
aside from that twenty two hundred watt
convection heating element in the back
you've got the broil element on top
and also the baking element in the
bottom and if you take a look inside
again the baking element is actually
hidden beneath this bottom of the oven
so if you spill anything if you have any
grease that drops or you drop a slice of
pizza whatever it is it's not gonna land
on your heating element on a set of
coils it's gonna be a lot easier to
clean all in all these features are nice
and add up to a very good oven but most
of them are features that you can find
in less expensive ovens the convection
fan the gliding racks the hidden heating
element those are all things that aren't
unique to Dacor the only really unique
feature is that reverse convection fan
but that said even though it's not the
most feature-rich or the most flashy
oven it just performs great that's your
chief concern if you want to have a
fantastic Thanksgiving dinner this is
enough and you really can't go wrong
with if you've got the money for seeing
that I'm right crest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
