you might remember last year when I
reviewed even human led this is a
color-changing smart LED from taboo that
you could control over your phone's
Bluetooth connection well this year
taboo is back with the Loom mini and
this is a smaller size bulb it does the
same thing you can control it over your
phone and automate it have a come on at
certain times and do a lot of fun things
when it comes to color now the Loom mini
is called the Loom mini for a reason
it's a smaller bulb and it uses a lot
less power just three watts but it does
a great job with green and blue and red
all the colors that you would want and
that puts it at a bit of an advantage
over Philips hue which we've seen
struggle to put an accurate green and a
bright vivid blue out one feature I like
that uses the Bluetooth well is that the
blue mini can sense your proximity and
so you'll see if I wake my phone up here
in the bulb the text and I'm in range
the color will change automatically to
red just like that once you've got the
lumen app opened up you'll be able to
switch to whatever color you like on
this full spectrum you'll also be able
to put on a disco mode that will flash
the light at different brightnesses and
different speeds or one of my favorite
features and they didn't have this last
time I reviewed the lumen bulb is you
can do a music mode in my test music
sync works really well and it's kind of
fun going through your music collection
and figuring out which songs worked best
one feature that didn't work out so well
was an incoming call sensor that'll
flash the light a certain color as your
phone rings I couldn't get that to work
and that was the same problem I
encountered last year with the lumen LED
one important distinction about the Loom
mini is that it doesn't have any white
diodes inside of it and that's a big
difference from the lumen LED which does
it only has that red green and blue mix
of light and so you can't get pure white
incandescent style light you can get
whitish light by mixing the colors and
you can get yellowish light that's also
sort of incandescent esque but it's not
going to be that pure perfect
incandescent replacement type light that
you're hoping for the loo mini relies on
bluetooth 4.0 to work so you're going to
need an iPhone 4s or better there's also
an Android app and if you have an
Android device that has Bluetooth 4.0
and Android 4.3 it'll work but keep in
mind that the Android app isn't as
updated as the iOS app at this point you
don't get the
music sink mode right now as well as
other features that you get if you have
an iOS device all in all this is a fun
bulb that does a good job with colors
and it's only $35 that is a great price
point if you're a casual lighting
enthusiast or someone who just wants to
experiment with color changing lighting
this is a much more affordable entry
point great for a party
great for syncing up with your music
it's gonna do all that just fine I say
that makes it a winner for CNET I'm
right Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
