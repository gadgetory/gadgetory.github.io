with our phones and watching the
network's get hoppin mad I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your CNET update you
messed with a major networks advertising
and you're asking for trouble there is a
battle brewing in court between the
major television networks and DISH
Network's commercial skip and Hopper gbr
now since dishes mascot is a kangaroo to
help illustrate this battle I like to
bring in the Roger family from tech and
the most famous kangaroo fighters the
fight centers around a feature in the
hopper DVR called Auto hop it lets you
instantly skip commercials in a show
recorded in primetime from the four
major networks no need for a
fast-forward button and this got the
network's angry Fox NBC and CBS are
suing dish arguing that commercial
skipping violates copyright and Fox
added another layer saying that this
breaks the license agreement for content
dish filed a lawsuit against all four
networks and is requesting a judge
declare that its DVR technology is
perfectly legal Facebook has come out
with an iOS app just for sharing photos
and it's a whole lot like Instagram it's
called Facebook camera it lets you
upload multiple photos at once and add
filter effects to your shots you can
also tag your friends and scroll through
photos posted by others in your network
considering there is already a Facebook
app you'd wish they'd just add these
photo features into the main app if
you're using Facebook's camera app
you'll notice that it requires you to
turn on location to access your photo
library it sounds creepy
why does Facebook camera need my
location to see my photos well no need
to fret if you are smart about your
location settings before you take photos
be sure to turn off location permissions
to the camera if there's no location
data tied to your photos than Facebook
or any other app won't know where you
took the photos you can now use people's
mobile payments at 15 new
brick-and-mortar retailers at
participating stores such as Toys R Us
or Foot Locker you can just enter in
your PayPal info into the touchscreen at
checkout or use your mobile phone to
scan items and pay for them through the
phone without needing a cashier to ring
you up there are more ways now to pay
