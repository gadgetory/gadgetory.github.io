first look at the live demo of the
project our headset and just like you
said all the compute all the sensors all
the cameras all included in the headset
to provide a completely untethered
experience right but there is a cable
here so let's talk about what that
little guy don't worry about that little
guy Brian so we're just using the one
video cable here so we could bring it up
to the big screen so you all see what's
really going on inside there so I go
ahead and put on my headset here and
well here's actually a very very cool
part is that a pretty standard VR
environment but you know normally VR
Brian is designed for either a sitting
type of position or we're able to do a
small mapped room sort of a thing
however with six degrees of full freedom
and the realsense cameras that are
automatically mapping the stage for me
which is really compute intensive so all
of that I'm able to bring together it
can actually track me so what that
allows me to do is instead of a gamepad
or something that I would have to move
around the environment well I can just
do something as easy as well moving my
feet so oh as you can see here Oh back
up a second for me Brian I don't want to
bump into you but here's something that
we really wanted to show this full six
degrees of freedom I'm able to go ahead
and move around in the environment
without any sort of restrictions but now
I want to go ahead and interact with it
so with the realsense camera that I have
in front oh my gosh I have hands this
for the first time inside a VR
environment my actual hands but these
aren't just for show we're actually
doing full depth sensing and five finger
tracking so if I go over to our virtual
x-ray machine here oh that's pretty cool
right that's really cool so here what
I'm showing is we're actually able to
show all five fingers in these digits
and for developers in VR that allows me
to do pretty natural controllers by just
using my hands and something that I can
go ahead and program to be extremely
accurate as well so but now that I have
these amazing hand controllers I'm going
to go over and get in front of my switch
here
and let's see moving away from me here
pardon I don't want to trip over my feet
here we go alright now if I go up to
this guy
well just press them over really quick
there we go come on buddy
I'm gonna go so I'm able to go ahead and
react to the actual environment itself
in a pretty cool way just by using my
hands right Brian
I see the lathe yep so we have the lathe
over here and so this is something we're
actually able to do full room tracking
so if I'm able to go ahead and move
around here and I'm going to go in the
into the new section I want to run it to
Brian but well okay so let's go ahead
and explain this is that well I can
actually see Brian coming into my
virtual world here which is kind of
weird however there's a lot of people
that are concerned about well bumping
into walls or crashing into their TV set
or injuring a CEO of a fortune 500
company this is the technology for you
so easily able to avoid obstacles in my
house and I don't have to step on my cat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
