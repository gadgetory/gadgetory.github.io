are at a neocon 2015 in Chicago we're
taking a first look at the brand new
DuPont Corian charging surface if you're
familiar with the Quarian synthetic
platform of surfaces for the home you
will definitely know that it's been
offered in lots of places lots of colors
lots of styles so what's different with
corian now is that it will have wireless
charging technology built right into it
basically you'll have the power Matt's
charging standard as well as support for
the Qi wireless power charging standard
built in you'll have hardware and
induction charging stations built into
the countertop and you'll be able to say
set up your kitchen or your bathroom or
even furniture with charging platforms
and stations built right into the
surface so if you have a nexus 6 or a
samsung galaxy s6 that has both power
mat and qi wireless charging support
built into the phone you'll be able to
just drop it on the surface and pick up
some electrons right into your battery
without having to mess with any wires or
anything like that
if you have an iPhone se that doesn't
have any sort of wireless charging
support built in you can get one of
these rings here it's a power ring from
power mat which enables you to plug in
to your phone via the lightning cable
and just plop it on to one of these
little rings here on the countertop and
you're gonna really start enjoying flow
of charge from the station directly into
your battery so you want to get your
hands on the dupont Corian charging
surface well that depends on who you are
and and what you plan to do with it if
you are an end-user and you want to say
put this in your own home you can go to
Home Depot or a licensed Corian
fabricator and basically get that custom
ordered and built to match your
specifications it'll cost about you know
a couple hundred dollars per charging
area on the countertop so you can expect
that kind of pricing it's available
right now as well for more check out
