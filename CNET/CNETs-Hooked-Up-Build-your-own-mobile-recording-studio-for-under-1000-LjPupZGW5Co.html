his recording studio so we wanted to
show you how you could create your own
mobile version on the go and really it
starts with the laptop this is really
the heart of this system so what we
recommend is a MacBook Pro 15 inch not
the Retina display and the reason why is
this guy comes packed with 500 gigs of
storage it costs $17.99 which is cheaper
and then you can bump up the RAM to 8
gigs which is what I would recommend
it's just a hundred extra dollars and
this really gives you a full system with
a big screen that you can use to create
your music now once you have that set up
you'll need an audio interface and this
is where we recommend the mbox mini with
Pro Tools Express Pro Tools is the
software side of it the mbox maybe this
is where you add all your instruments
something like a microphone and you
record through this box it goes to your
computer and that's how you start making
sweet music and that bundle costs $2.99
now once you have that set up you want
to check out a microphone really the
standard for a home recording studio
kind of a project home studio when you
just get started
we recommend the rode nt1-a this is the
condenser mic and it really sets the bar
in a great value at 229 for this
microphone setup and the next piece of
this puzzle is a keyboard so check out
the m-audio axiom 25 this is a 25 key
MIDI controller it also has a trigger
pad so you can punch out beats and also
put in some samples at the same time
this costs $1.99 but this really brings
everything together so let's break all
this down and assume that you have a
computer that's compatible what we're
gonna do is start off with the mbox with
Pro Tools that's gonna be $2.99 then we
have the rode condenser mic that's 229
and then the m-audio axiom 25 that
keyboard you have that's gonna be $1.99
but I like to throw in a little addition
you want some really great studio
headphones so check out the B audio
technica ath Pamuk 50 these are great
for mixing sound and you can get them
for around $119 on Amazon so I'm gonna
add all that up and it comes out to just
under $850 and there's your mobile
recording studio and that's how we hook
you up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
