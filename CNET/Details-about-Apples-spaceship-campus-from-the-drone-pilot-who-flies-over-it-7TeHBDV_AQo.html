little bit
since apple first broke ground in
cupertino drone pilots have been
circling Apple's new spaceship campus
trying to capture every last detail we
met up with my it hurts he's one of the
pilots who's been posting monthly
updates since october of last year what
kind of got you started I mean was a
hobby but what got you into this whole
thing I've made little videos just local
videos here and there like around
Cupertino and just little shots and
everybody kept asking me what's on the
other side of that wall he'll fly over
there go fly over there and it was just
kind of peer pressure and and I did it
one time and I got like a hundred
thousand views in the first day what
have you kind of scene and how has it
developed over time are their structures
or things that have really stuck out in
your mind they finished all the concrete
parking structure that's underneath the
ring and now they're adding the floors
on it and it is going so fast now is
that was that garage without that
underground garage that they kind of
alluded to is that what you're talking
about underneath the the ring itself I
guess there's a two-story parking garage
under there and then there's also two
like pill-shaped parking garages that
are near the freeway highway 280 alright
so out here we have all of your toys
kind of decked out some of them not all
of them right yeah sure sure this is my
the latest one this is the phantom 3
professional yep so it's got the you
know the high-definition video downlink
running an ipad mini 2 you get some
really nice video on that okay so they
do make I have the similar think this is
the phantom 2 vision plus which you have
this right here is a taro 680 pro this
one I built myself after I had purchased
the phantom 2 vision plus because I
wanted to be able to get have a better
camera on there so it's got a gopro
hero4 black on the front of it run an ND
filter you don't get all those
vibrations you don't see the blade
shadows and stuff like that this is a 6
rotor drone right here right a little
more consistency and you know redundancy
so if you know you lose prop or
something the chances are you're still
gonna be able to land it on one of the
Phantom's you lose a prop it's going
straight down to the ground I'd like to
keep it within line-of-sight keep it as
close to me as possible I don't even
like going farther than a thousand feet
yeah you know
you just don't know because it
technically it's a flying saw blade and
you could really hurt someone if it
drops out this guy and being a member of
the AMA you get insurance I have added
insurance on top of that liability just
in case so we know this is one of your
three children yes want to throw it up
in the area the phantom 2 vision plus is
already ready to go ok cool so we should
have enough satellites just kind of get
it out here and for people that don't
really see drones that much I think the
take-off is always kind of the funnest
part we prefer to call them multirotors
people are afraid of the word drone now
when you go over apple's campus I mean
we've got to imagine they're one of the
most secretive companies in the world
how do they react to seeing you flying
this you know multi-rotor device like
how have you had any run-ins with that
I've had them tell me actually that it's
illegal for me to fly over their
property which technically it's not what
i've read is that Apple has a claimed to
own the lower 83 feet of air space so if
I ever go over apples area if I ever
cross that fence line I make sure I'm
above 83 feet before you cross that
before I cross that fence line be above
83 feet and below 400 which is the FAA
limit I still don't like to cross the
fence too much just because even on the
sunday at 7am their security guys down
there there's people down there I would
hate for the singing fall on this guy
and hit somebody alright well you know
what thanks for your time thanks for
hanging out with this it's my it hurts
my dream on YouTube you can see all the
progress with Apple camps in the future
from you all right
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
