and Instagram blackberry filed a lawsuit
on Tuesday March 6 alleging that
Facebook is infringing on several
patents related to messaging services
blackberry issued a statement saying we
have a strong claim that Facebook has
infringed on our intellectual property
and after several years of dialogue we
also have an obligation to our
shareholders to pursue appropriate legal
remedies Facebook's deputy general
counsel gave a strongly worded response
that said blackberry suit sadly reflects
the current state of its messaging
business having abandoned its efforts to
innovate blackberry is now looking to
tax the innovation of others we intend
to fight so I trudged through the 117
page lawsuit to see what exactly
blackberry was suing over let's get
through some of it in the lawsuit
blackberry says that Facebook created
mobile messaging applications that
co-opt BlackBerry's innovations these
apps include Facebook Messenger whatsapp
messenger and Instagram one of the
patents covers messaging notification
techniques BlackBerry's patent covers a
way to modify an icon to alert the user
that multiple unread notifications await
take a look at BlackBerry's patent
figure and Facebook's way of showing a
similar thing
blackberry also has a patent covering a
user interface for selecting a photo tag
and a way to give the user a field to
enter a photo tag blackberry provided
images where it says Facebook infringes
on this patent and let's highlight one
more patent blackberry patented a method
for displaying time stamps depending on
when a message was received
if you received a bunch of messages at
once you don't see one timestamp if some
time passed it may see another timestamp
sounds familiar right BlackBerry says
that Facebook's usage of its patents
have succeeded in diverting consumers
away from black bears products and
services so here's a summary of what
blackberry wants if it wins the lawsuit
one Facebook whatsapp and Instagram
could no longer infringe on the patents
mentioned in this lawsuit two websites
and apps for facebook facebook Messenger
what's that messenger and Instagram
could no longer be made
used or offered for sale and three and
unspecified amount of damages does this
mean that Facebook's messaging apps are
dead in the water
not just yet this could end a number of
ways
Facebook's methods may not be covered by
black bears patents patents do not cover
ideas but specific methods and systems
alternatively the two parties could
settle out of court
Facebook could also be engineering new
methods to accomplish the same results
without infringing on BlackBerry's
patents this ought to be very
interesting keep it here at C net for
more coverage Amaya's act Arnall see you
