probably looking at something that can
boost the poor sound it produces if
you're not planning a wall mounting and
almost no one does then a sound base is
a great option
hi I'm typing debris and the Yamaha SRT
1000 is an excellent sound base with a
bunch of handy features and reel in
quotation marks surround sound
the SRT 1000 uses Yamahas digital sound
projector technology to beam sound to
the left and right and rear of your room
using these eight drivers on the front
of the unit the effect is much wider and
more effective than the surround of X on
most sound bars that the rear effect we
found wasn't very strong the unit
features a sturdy MDF cabinet with some
nifty additions including this rear port
access hatch and dedicated source
indicators on the front no more
complicated red equals blu-ray color
coding systems you can instantly tell
resource you're listening to the Yamaha
uses for different sound modes and
unlike some others you can slip it into
stereo only when listening to music in
addition it decodes DTS and Dolby so
blu-rays are no longer a problem
the Yamaha also accepts a bunch of
different sources including two optical
inputs though sadly no HDMI for sound
quality there aren't many competitors at
the price even though it lacks a real
subwoofer it packs a real punch during
movies and dialogue is clear music is
also surprisingly good for a product of
this type the only real drawback is the
price at 500 bucks is starting to get on
the expensive side but if you have a TV
worth up to $1000 or more this is a very
recommendable sonic upgrade this has
