only been three generations of Porsche
911 in fact this is the third and new
generation it's called the nine-nine one
let me point out to you the stuff you'll
need as a Porsche spotter first of all
the wheelbase grew four inches that's
axle to axle but what they've done is
shorten the overhang because the entire
body only grew by two inches which
you've got is a little more aggressive
look it's not a big difference but it's
a subtle sort of pushing to the corners
of the wheels you've also got a little
bit of a greater width in the front now
gives the car viewed from the top a
little more of a coke bottle shape again
part of a more aggressive sporty stance
you can spot this car mostly from the
rear let's go back there real big
difference now in the rear treatment and
these taillights in particular they've
got LED strings around them which
illuminate but you can see they're much
sharper point here and flatter that's
the most controversial and biggest
change on this car it looks a little bit
like an Aston Martin part but I'm not
the one who's gonna say that to their
face oh by the way the spoiler now which
lifts up here in the back and has been
electrified for a number of years now
works through software in conjunction
with the sunroof they balance each other
out depending where you've got them open
to create the optimal lack of turbulence
that's kind of cool another big
innovation is the world's smallest
engine cover look at this little guy it
used to be small now its miniscule dear
Porsche mechanics good luck in here now
as you can see this is the 3.8 this
guy's an S the standard car has gone
down to a 3.4 but picked up five
horsepower to 350 this guys picked up 15
horsepower in the bigger S motor to 400
on the nose interesting efficiency
technologies are being used here as well
you've got electric power steering now
so you no longer have another rotating
accessory with a belt dragging the
engine down you've got some limited
brake regeneration that's gonna build
back electricity to charge the battery
again taking load off the alternator so
it has to work less hard the more things
you can freewheel the less this engine
has to run those and it can spend moving
the car which is kind of the point on
one of these
now down here with this engine still
looks like an engine a lot of things
have changed many of them for efficiency
first of all you no longer have a
hydraulic power steering pump this car
has electric power steering you have
automatic start/stop when you come to a
red light or a stop sign that's a little
controversial in a car of this lineage
let's see you've also got some brake
regeneration hit the brakes and it puts
a juice back in the battery taking some
load off the alternator which takes some
load off the engine and they now have
adaptive engine mounts this is kind of
like adaptive suspension when you're
driving the car leisurely these electro
hydraulic mounts will be soft and the
engine can kind of you know bounce
around and be decoupled from the car
when you're really standing on it they
stiffen up in the end it almost becomes
like a stressed member of the whole
frame of the vehicle it's not as nice a
ride but when you're really on it you
don't care you want the vehicle to
tighten up very interesting technology
and as you can see big difference inside
they've gone to the kind of bigger
upward sloping Panamera style console
but I got to be honest they keep coming
back to the longer wheelbase on this
card intrigues me the most for a couple
of reasons one it's rumored not
confirmed that they kind of bumped up
the size of the car that way to make
room for a hybrid power plant Porsche
has been doing lots of hybrid stuff
around the fringes that wouldn't
surprise me but unusual on 911
also you've seen that ad campaign
Porsche everyday when you have a longer
wheelbase you get a more comfortable
ride I'm curious what the reception will
be among the real serious 911 fans and
this is considered a push toward the
more comfortable everyday 911 that they
may ask you but will probably sell like
hotcakes if it's a more comfortable
every driver either way we'll find out
soon February of 2012 the on sale date
for this car starts off at 83,000 base
for a standard 911 97 for an S there's a
lot of other improvements on the S by
the way aside from just the motor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
