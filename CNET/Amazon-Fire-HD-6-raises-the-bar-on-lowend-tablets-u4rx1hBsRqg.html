tablet ever is also its cheapest but
isn't any good
I'm Xiomara Blanca Christina here taking
a look at the Amazon Fire HD 6 the
petite 6 inch tablet sports a new design
it looks similar to the HDX series but
what plasticky and less angular the top
edge houses the headphone jack
microphone pin pool micro USB port and
power button with the volume rocker on
the left corner and a solitaire mono
speaker on the bottom edge it's
incredibly comfortable to hold in one
hand yet at point 6 3 pounds it's a bit
heavy the Fire HD 6 houses a 1.5
gigahertz quad-core processor 1 gigabyte
of RAM and 8 gigabytes or 16 gigabytes
of internal storage it ships with the
new Amazon sangria operating system and
it's very similar to last year's mojito
for casual use like checking email
reading and browsing the web the tablet
performed smoothly
sometimes it was slow to respond when
loading new magazines or books and it
was occasionally buggy when trying to
execute menial tasks but the kinks were
rare our review unit came with only a
gigabytes of internal storage but Amazon
also offers a 16 gigabyte model meant to
be used with cloud content the eight
gigabytes were spent quickly the pliers
don't offer expandable memory options so
juggling content between the cloud and
your device is necessary HD video looks
sharp on the 1280 by 800 pixel
resolution IPS LCD screen text is also
clear and easy to read unfortunately
there's no ambient light sensor so you
must manually adjust the screens
brightness the Fire HD 6 offers up a
pair of underwhelming cameras the
front-facing VGA shooter is fuzzy yet
meets the basic requirements for video
conferencing and the 2 megapixel rear
camera isn't much better though there's
a manual focus option photos don't come
out very sharp and colors are washed out
with a bluish tint to them the fire HD 6
starts at $99 for the 8 gigabyte version
or 119 for the
see and gigabyte model why would you
choose the six century over the Fire HD
7 aside from saving $40 for an 8
gigabyte model or $30 on the 16 gigabyte
model the HD six is extremely compact
and easy to use in one hand so if you're
looking for something to primarily use
on the go it's a small price to pay for
a small device for a more in-depth look
check out my full review on SEANET once
again I'm Xiomara Blanco and this even a
first look at the Amazon fire HD 6
