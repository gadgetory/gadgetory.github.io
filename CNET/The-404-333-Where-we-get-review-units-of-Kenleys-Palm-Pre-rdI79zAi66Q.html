good friend and listener Jessica Jessica
al deep she is not our that this is not
the first time % his food she also sent
us a bunch of candy before zygarde Uncas
she couldn't come to the meetup to think
of it she spent way too much money a lot
of money oh my get away we really
appreciate the vision cupcakes are no
shitty cupcakes either they're from
Magnolia Bakery yeah well yeah it's not
cheap but they're very good they look I
delicious so thank you jessica really
appreciate that you're like the team mom
of the 404 seriously always baking us
snacks I think you're starting a
movement to let's hopefully get some
more cupcake yeah we're not gonna deny
you if you send us food she's and
cookies if you send it if you to arrive
at about 11 then perfect you get on air
promo right unbelievable the timing of
that is is remarkable well she sent it
because you were having such a bad day
two days ago yeah I guess that's true
Devils lost and then you were having a
bad day yes yeah Wilson I mean this is
like the greatest thing this is totally
cheered up my whole week like yeah came
into the office kind of little bummed
this morning too right right but this is
awesome it is very nice it's a very nice
gesture we really think jessica for all
of her nice uh big time little gifts
there it's awesome it's cheering me up
because i had a really crazy night yeah
except anyone has a night oh so what
happened like so okay I know that people
are getting really sick
of hearing about swine flu right uh-huh
this is the last time because I actually
had a personal experience with it last
night some sleeping right with with a
vial of spine right amia babe were
cuddling and all of a sudden I get a
phone call it's my sister at four in the
morning right oh man and this is the
scary part she had been on vacation in
cancun for the last week Oh new mexico
for the last week she calls me up and
she's like dude I need mom's phone
number right now don't ask me why
shouldnt have our own mother's phone
yeah so that we can address that later
yeah but anyway so it shouldn't have the
phone I'm just like dude I need mom's
phone number I'm really sick I don't
feel good I'm like puking everywhere oh
my god and I think I have swine flu but
it's particularly scared you normally I
would dismiss it you know as but she was
in Cancun but she's actually in Mexico
and I thought that's where all those
kids in Queens got it right exactly and
so she was really scared what ended up
happening is she called my mom and she
call the doctor it's funny because when
you normally call the doctor's office
they don't care I you just talked to a
nurse this time apparently a doctor
literally like got up from bed and was
like FB yeah yeah yeah bunch of people
in hazmat suit send it on her house no
it was it was wild but I think it might
just be the stomach flu it's not the
official swine well here's the thing
like who goes to mexico and doesn't get
sick the problem is sort through life
that's true who's just a regular dirty
mexico sick oh no you shouldn't drink
the water by the waters revenge they
tell you nothing like the pool or the
place people that wants wine from mexico
for decades now we wouldn't have a name
but that's not scary you know like so
what is called a mexico flu that was so
messy oh god well then they try to call
it yeah they called it the Mexican flu
and a swine no okay no offense but to
appease the Israelis really ya know cuz
uh what do you know a fencing you know
is real they didn't want to be called
the swine flu yeah cuz if you got the
swine flu would be like you having
kosher yep the something pig oh well I
guess it does redefine kosher this is
episode so one of the health ministers
call it the Mexican flu and that
offended all-america to talk about bad
timing though could you imagine a worse
time
to go to Mexico right now she told me
she was gonna cancun was like really
wait wait so she knew that there was
like a possible pandemic starting why
think she bought tickets a while ago
still went after this was happening
that's a risk you gotta take that's
something about your deposit down i
don't know you got take that risk
registan talk to anybody wear that mask
on a jeff you were telling me a story
this morning about hi friends in
emergency room yeah I had a friend I
mean this really just goes to show you
it's a great display of the idiocy of
today right but are you calling yeah we
didn't know you sister clearly has a
reason to be concerned one she was in
Mexico to yes the symptom hmm uh my
friend was in the ER because yeah he was
he was having shortness of breath it
wasn't worth didn't think he had swine
flu he was just like oh man I might be
having a heart attack I can't breathe so
he was after a lot of strenuous activity
so he's in the ER and he walks into the
thing and there's literally it's 1130pm
mind you right and there's literally 50
people in there all with faiths face max
face masks on writing they all had swine
flu okay all with pigs heads alright so
my buddy walks up to the front desk at
the ER and the nurse behind the counter
is not wearing a face hahahahahaha so
he's like what's going on she's like all
these idiots think they have swine and
my friend is like all right well you're
not wearing a mask I'm not gonna wear a
mask uh-huh it's funny cuz you can't
even it's off in a subway car without
everybody just scattering and freaking
out really bad the deal with the flu
normally is like there's not really a
lot of treatments right you like going
to the hospital is probably not your
best case scenario to hurt anybody it's
more like your best case scenario to
infect everybody yeah I mean you really
just can't leave your house if you
really do think you have a swine well
yeah but right like I'm not even sure
what what the they're asking people to
take like Tamiflu now yeah it's working
on something supposedly there's a
vaccine right well they're working on
the texting and I was actually listening
yesterday to the radio that they're
they're thinking about making everybody
take the flu vaccine your home September
I'm not taking it yeah I refuse i'm not
doing it i'm not taking it i'll take my
chances I'll take my chances with a flu
oh I would be more concerned considering
that like they keep on saying that
everybody up until
now like there's a baby two days ago but
up until now anybody who has died has
been in the twenties right yeah so go
ahead and change my well the reason that
happened is because once we vaccine that
since there's been you know the human
body can't react to swine flu can't
really defend it what happens is people
who are healthy and have really good
immune systems their immune system
overreact and that's what kills you it's
not because you're you know you're too
strong it's you're too sure what it is
the fear though is really the biggest
problem right like my sister was telling
that she was on the plane right and geez
don't I feel sick then no they thought
somebody on the plane had swine flu
known her and so they had to turn a
toast and they almost killed that person
they didn't know what happened was they
touch down an area that way before their
destination and they had to escort this
woman oh but it was even more messed up
because a bunch of guys in like hazmat
suits and face masks actually had to
come on meanwhile none of the other
passenger passengers had face masks on
oh it was like oh like you people are
already screwed we're gonna touch down
to get this woman yeah and after you've
already been in the air with her virus
right so they took her off and they
continued to their destinations it's
very bizarre so what is the current
consensus on your sister right now okay
the consensus is that she has every
symptom of swine flu other than the
cough okay right so she's thinking that
it might just be some kind of stomach
flu that you can sleep off and look also
from the way it sounded like it sounded
like she you know she doesn't have a
fool you know when you have the flu you
feel like a key and yet like she feels
like she's just got a stomach thing
going right all right she gave birth to
a pig hey that's all normal though
that's the bottom line is if you think
you have swine flu go to this website
and check its www I have the swine flu
com do I have the swine flu con thousand
Joker this is real man if you that will
give you definitive as efendim answer
check out real recommendations yeah Jeff
you want to cut to my screen here this
is do I have the swine flu doc no no
enjoy the Seas stop worrying that's all
you know I got ya I've seen the opposite
of that as well I've seen a site that
says uh yes panic yes kill your end with
black text yes time to panic take it
from what it's worth all right let move
on no more than one dilute ah honey oh
man I you Sanjay Gupta one more time I'm
here looking at the pig that has swine
flu you kidding 0 it's a surgeon general
man yeah I know and now people are I'm
sorry we can keep talking about this but
now people are saying that it's a
conspiracy made by the government to I
don't know to have genocide I guess I
know that they say it's a conspiracy by
the government or by a medical company
that released the drug Tamiflu company
maybe and we aren't from the government
i would say that like a pharmaceutical
company is drastically different from
the government right i mean let's and
that's definitely not the case though
i'm pretty sure that was a storyline
from resident actually Vendetta Vendetta
thing has been pissing me off is
actually then blaming the the spread of
the epidemic on illegal immigration yeah
right i believe if you made it through
the desert over two weeks oh yeah with
just the clothes on your back in it
bottle of wine right probably you're the
reason why the country is going down so
it's definitely not spring break okay
good no did you not do not think not
think white people are to blame you know
i thought would it really be a bummer if
all those mtv people down there were
like you know stuck in cancun you know i
would kind of be down with that let's
move along this is from our own blog
crave yep talking about a radio shack
employee that was charged with punching
a customer now usually I don't take the
side of the radio shack employee but
I've been in one of these establishments
before I really likes decrease get that
from my Twitter I don't know
yeah that's plain the store get punched
in the face is that were you yeah
exactly that's why I look like this all
right so the story is that a guy goes
into radio shack tries to return
something and their employee this 52
year old employee would not let him
return it for one reason or another and
the guy just starts freaking out asks
for a manager right completely flips out
starts punching the customer meanwhile
this is a 52 year old male employee I
can't imagine how much damage this guy
could have done but he apparently got
taken away by the cops and arrested new
or just yeah no no that's assault it's
definitely assault but I mean come on
those things you're not supposed to do
but has it gone into a radio shack and
had to talk to this completely inept
employee and just seriously considered
maybe punching this guy that around who
has gone into a radio shack it's true
good you really will take it for what
it's worth though because I've been in a
radio shack where people asked some
pretty upsetting questions yeah about
about hdmi cable how to plug in your
head about like does this need batteries
ya know that's a plug you know like a
lot of stuff like that and I kind of
undecided with the radio shack yeah can
I return this shirt yeah what about this
though is well-liked might this answer
the mystery of how radio shack is still
in business you're just not allowed to
return it yeah yeah no it doesn't work
what do you mean we talked about this on
the show before why would anybody go
into radio shack time at radio shack I
really have no problem a lot of
yeah problem with it no one know what
they're talking it's fine but if you're
going to radio shack RC cars are all
they sell there are radio-controlled
cars you notice that yeah dude radio
shack is great and wires if you need a
cell phone cord look at charger you're
good thing there's a reason they call it
radio hack I mean like you can pretty
much build whatever you want the other
bomb from everything inside well why
don't you take it to the next level
there I wasn't saying that but you could
really my job hunting stuff that you
said like rocket kit tonight they did
they sell like little rocket engines
right yeah I don't I just don't
understand how they're still making
money in this book they have some budget
see I'm gonna back them up a little bit
it very fun to make fun of them but they
have like cell phones and mp3 players
the only people
everything everywhere and they buy ads
on cnet com the only people actually
ever seen a great are our engineers or
like IT people write like need a cat5
cable yeah some random resistors when
you need a red LED light and a
transistor in the morning where else you
gonna go radioshack 24-hour places
you're not gonna go include circuit city
yeah well no one's going to search you
so there you go radio shack let's move
along um this is weird this comes from a
reporter named Justin you very bizarre
Justin you blogged about this on
Wednesday headline mysterious superhero
of surfaces strikes fear into the hearts
of no one this is a story out of
Cincinnati the story actually aired on
their TV station apparently this guy has
surfaced calling himself the the way
whoa super hair super hair he's started
calling himself the super hair he's as
21 year old super self-professed
superhero that picture of wandering
awesome by the wandering the streets of
Cincinnati on foot in costume battling
crime yeah is he your life anybody know
as get him on the show I now look at him
with his fists clenched yeah he's got a
he's got a full-on mask and a cape and a
costume and he's going around defending
women children are you sure this isn't
you because that guy is like a really
skinny yeah I know we share the same
body type it's actually a little girl
yeah but no this is pretty funny real
life superheroes it's pretty good and
he's not the only one there's this group
of people calling themselves the
allegiance of heroes and find their
myspace i highly recommend checking out
the the blog post right watching that
video because there is sort of a cheer
they do that is priceless right it's
gravy one needs to see that because it
is some sorry sorry stuck up my number
one beef with this is come on shadow
hair really you're gonna choose there
that's out for a possible yeah like it
what's not say about the menacing
tortoise is that like come on shadow
know these other guys called ecliptic oh
in Pennsylvania there's another guy
called wall creeper in Colorado and mr.
extreme and Kyle
fornia I I cook to go I think is this
mystery man in real life now these guys
can't even solve crimes apparently this
guy actually broke his arm trying to
save a woman three rapes he did he
actually broke up that spaghetti saber
no savor this yeah the woman's still she
was murdered action come on that's not
funny well you jo-jo it's even funny
because this guy's on foot he doesn't
even have a car so I mean if you don't
gotta be a way the shadow hare mobile or
there's no shadow hare like helicopter
there's no hair signal I don't know the
hair signal you think if you were trying
to strike fear into the hearts of
criminals you wouldn't choose shadow
here you wouldn't choose like a wabbit
and beef up a little bit come on star
this guy is really skinny your juice in
her so I think anybody could take him to
be honest that old lady could have taken
him yeah sweet leotard bro yeah and
doesn't the wolverine movie come out
today that's right superheroes the
wolverine movie doesn't so now that I
know that you got an advanced screening
no no my friend Dustin us together Vince
greetings to the movie coming out on bit
torn did you hear about that I did
actually so yeah I mean the movie
actually comes out today so if you guys
want to see the actual finished CGI go
and check it out every advance review
i've read and said that this movie is
the crack oh it's absolute like its
first superhero movie if you're actually
like a Wolverine fanboy you're gonna be
crapping all over this way you know it's
funny I can't believe that you were
explaining things about it cuz you had
heard yeah and man they really just
don't care no no clear that they just
don't care they just picked apart all
the storylines none of the or it's funny
they call it x-men origins because none
of the origins are true dat ha yeah
those characters that aren't in the
comic they have skewed powers and stuff
should have just called it the new
origin right of Wolverine I'm looking at
like how upset you are like you're not
it's not about the movie or like they
were not authentic I mean it's a big
deal I was really looking forward to
gambit being portrayed on the big screen
you know they got gambit was the one
that always wanted to see in the x-men
movies yeah i'm looking at a slate
headline right now it says short angry
Harry Canadian yeah is Wolverine the
worst superhero movie ever yeah it's
really nice and Catwoman
but anyway will it's not yes is it
Catwoman bad like did you ever see kay I
never saw no Catwoman though was not
based on Catwoman from the comic no
that's that's the thing oh it's just
upsetting because it's really difficult
you know to mess up Wolverine he's like
the coolest superhero yeah all right

products because it's a pretty good cost
savings i know from dealing with the
geniuses that we here in my local area
that they're they're really on top of
those types of things yes if you get
applecare yeah refurbished or not it's
pretty much the best warranty going so
it's true no he's right that that
warranties on below applecare is great
if you drop it you do something to your
laptop right then yeah but then you sort
of say you didn't if you end up d
topping your own laptop back right uh

Apple to introduce more affordable max
sources say wait more photo max meeting
new models that are cheap Mabel in their

father his wife gave birth to a son
yesterday and he gave us a call while
his wife was giving birth yet have to
mcdonalds across the street right push
honey push and we suggested that maybe
his name is son after us yeah why not
yeah justice and Jeff Stinson sounds
pretty good to me it does sound pretty
good of a mouthful but I like it's great
to its really good do it a last story
for the day before we say goodbye for
the weekend we're talking about what
else Twitter oh we're talking about
twitting tweeting too hard calm just and
explain what exactly the site this is a
hilarious website and thanks to the chat
room for linking us to it it's tweeting
too hard calm it's basically just a
website that posts really arrogant
tweets that people make about themselves
right so for example one of them is um
went to the gym this morning as I left
everyone said that I was the best or I'm
punching way above my weight
everything nightclub was everything
except looks I think I'm okay on that
only I made it the world's greatest yeah
so self-indulgent tweets is where it's
at on this website on here like six
times you collect meeting douche bags
back ya feelin myself tweets dot-com wow
that's really upsetting yeah this is
kind of funny i think they just randomly
generate these and find them on how you
how do you exactly filter round to the
douchey tweet I have no idea that funny
as part of this website is that you can
actually vote for the ones that your
favorite now you're talking and they're
actually called back Pat's so you can
had someone on the back if you'd like
their tweet good job sir you contribute
nothing to the Twitter community you
know the only thing worse than arrogant
tweets is uh is uh complaint tweets yeah
they should have that I hate those you
know mean like what does everyone always
a little bug likes it too close to me on
the subway or like but you know just
complained Twitter well is this mine in
mcdonald sooo yeah it's terrible what
does always make that waste of bandwidth
yeah and this is why people this is why
twitter really gets a bad name yeah
because you people use it for all the
wrong reasons and this is not what it's
about the idiocy of today right I'll
take it from burn after reading so be
careful so if you're posting arrogant
tweets you might end up on this website
might get called out which waiting too
hard and then it's over for you actually
this is really cool i just saw this in
the chatroom visible tweets com2 it's
just a cool way to look at your
Twitter's like you can type in any
keyword and it'll actually search for
sit like tweet Twitter's with that word
in it and display them in a really cool
visual way it's totally sure don't they
have that search function isn't a
Twitter or it can't you just search
twitter normally yeah I don't know but
this is just sort of like a really cool
way to just keep Twitter's coming in
right I'll bring it up on the screen
right now if you want to check this out
I'll tweet the 404 and then you get like
a little cloud here with everyone that's
tweeted about interesting I guess it
sort of too bad only one person is
tweeted about the floor it's the same
message over and over again so they have
a little graphic that comes down and
displays the tweet like one minute ago
it's kind of cool it's more of novelty
again no one's actually going to use
this site to find out you know what
people are saying on Twitter right but
it's pretty cool you've got to check
it's visible tweets dot-com absolute as
the other side of the spectrum people
actually using tweet Twitter for
creative uses it's possible it is
possible but apparently it is possible
all right guys I think that's gonna do
it for us that is gonna do it if you
wanna leave a voicemail with your
favorite clips from the 404 email those
to us at the 404 @ sina com or yeah you
can leave a voicemail at 1 866 404 seen
it but we really want those clips cuz
we're gonna put together like a podcast
or some sort of supplemental thing you
guys can always check out the best and
what you lazy to do it ourselves yeah
now i'm sticking naps all day guys don't
forget next week will be the premiere of
the 44 on scene at tv.com so make sure
you have a party for that and tell
everyone and their mother about it yeah
because this is a big deal for us we
definitely want everyone watching live
who can yeah you a back pat and say that
you've been doing very good on the
switching well thank you yeah we need to
give Jeff like some kind of round of
applause or something like that so this
guy operates the switching and the sound
just congratulate my third and fourth
arm yeah that has somehow manifest you
know you can never take a vacation now
it's true now you can't do it you're
pretty much right here instead of the
404 hopefully next time this happens
