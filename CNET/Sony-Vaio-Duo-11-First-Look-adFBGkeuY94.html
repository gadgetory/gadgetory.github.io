CNET and this is a look at the Sony Vaio
duo 11 now with Windows 8 basically
having two different interfaces the
familiar desktop from Windows past and
the new touch friendly Windows 8 style
were likely going to be seeing a lot of
devices like the duo which give you both
a tablet and laptop in one package
hopefully though they won't be executed
exactly like the duo because its design
misses the mark so here you have this
11.6 inch tablet with edge to edge glass
ready to take full advantage of Windows
8 it's a full HD display with in-plane
switching technology so viewing angles
are very good and it's nice and
responsive but it's also a little
awkward to hold because of the wide
screen and the weight of the body which
is nearly three pounds using it on a
table or a lap is fine though and Sony
includes a digitizer stylus for writing
or drawing or navigation the dual could
then be transformed into somewhat of a
laptop but it's more like having a
tablet attached to a mediocre keyboard
the keys are small there's no touch pad
just this optical pointer and it's not
very easy to open either plus once it is
open you can adjust the screen angle at
all and it looks kind of cheap with
hinges and Springs and cables showing it
just looks unfinished but if you don't
care about any of that inside is a very
capable Ultrabook with a third
generation Core i5 processor 6 gigs of
memory and 128 gig SSD battery life is
good too at nearly 5 hours so basically
what you end up with is a good computer
with a compromising design
I'm Josh Goldman and that's the Sony
Vaio duo 11</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
