I'm not I'm Emily Dreyfuss surprise and
welcome to rumor has it the show where
we round up the week's biggest tech room
and then we vote on what sounds likely
and what's probably not true and
remember that you can vote on all of the
rumors too so keep your eye out for the
pull in the interactive player if you're
watching on cnet first up google i/o
begins this week and we've seen a swell
of rumors about what will be unveiled to
the show the 1 i'm personally most
excited about is also probably the most
predictable so nerds wearing Google
glass while live narrating the
experience of waiting in line at Google
i/o okay maybe it's the second most
reputable I'm talking about the rumor
that we're going to see the next
generation of the popular Nexus 7 tablet
a KGI Securities analyst says that the
tablet will have all upgraded specs and
components but the killer part is that
the price will remain the same at 199
see people love the Nexus 7 and if they
manage to make it faster and lighter and
more powerful while keeping the price
the same they'll have another hit for
sure yeah another rumors swirling around
Google's i/o conference is that Google
will revamp its Maps interface according
to the site Google operating system the
web giant will roll out an update that
takes away the sidebars and navigational
buttons and concentrates more on one big
interactive map how are we supposed to
navigate without buttons see I think
that the whole map will be one big
button okay so what is now displayed in
the google map sidebar would be overlaid
on the top of a full-screen map and
there would be new colors and icons but
the absolute worst part of this rumor is
my least favorite thing on earth google+
supposedly you'd be able to filter the
maps now using recommendations from your
google+ friends oh great that's really
all i need look I just want to buy a
huge bag of coffee at costco I don't
need my opinion ated Google+ San
Francisco friends telling me that I have
to get the handcrafted small-batch shade
grown organic nonsense from whatever
hipster panda poop local coffee place is
popular right now with a fixie bike rack
whoa lady calm down the next big rumor
is that Amazon is going to release two
smartphones sounds familiar right we've
been hearing about a possible Amazon
phone for a year but this Wall Street
Journal report adds a new twist it says
that one of the rumored devices would
supposedly sport 3d hologram images and
have a cutting-edge navigation system
that you use with just your eyes we saw
a computer navigation program like that
at CES and it was so rudimentary that
all you could do is play fruit ninja hey
that is not nothing it's like the only
game I know how to play of course this
rumor is sourced from anonymous people
familiar with the matter so obviously
take it with a grain of salt I for one
though think it makes sense for Amazon
to make a phone they're already in the
hardware game as we've said with the
kindle and more and more our phone is
becoming our ereader our tablet and our
television screens so they're not going
to want to be left behind but why would
it get all 3d gimmicky I don't know but
maybe it's because amazon wants to be a
content creator now with their new TV
shows and they're letting us vote on the
pilots and their publishing so maybe
this way they could make 3d games next
up Microsoft is holding an event on May
21st where it's presumed to announce the
next generation Xbox which we've been
calling the 720 but others are calling
the Infinity gamers feared that the next
console would require you to always be
online this fear was ramped up after
microsoft exec tweeted that having to be
online wasn't that big of a deal and
people should just hashtag deal with it
however that same exact then left the
company as a result of those tweets so
we can't draw much of a conclusion from
what he said now ARS technica is
reporting that a new internal email to
the Xbox team suggests the opposite that
the console won't always need to be
plugged into the web according to the
report there are a number of scenarios
including playing a blu-ray disc
watching live TV and playing a single
player game in which the console should
just quote work regardless of the
connection to the internet so not only
do you not need to be connected to the
internet but the next gen console will
also be able to play blu-ray and let you
watch live TV sweet what do you guys
think will the next gen xbox force you
to be connected to the Internet at all
times is blu-ray a given are you excited
about being able to watch live TV don't
forget to vote and leave a comment and
we'll check
with the cnet council the cnet council
is composed of five editors who cast
their votes anonymously their opinions
are not an endorsement by Cena or CBS
interactive obviously because these are
rumors folks and the scene at councils
verdict is no it's actually a unanimous
know our editors said that the next-gen
Xbox will not need to be connected to
the Internet at all times that's our
show everybody please share your rumors
that rumor has it at cnet com or call
set 1 800 750 cnet and tweet us and I'm
so glad you came back a week so glad
that I was able to guest host tune in
next week for more tech rumors don't
forget to vote and leave a comment and
we'll check in with the cnet council hey
nails really never really knew that I
really gave myself a strong donkey yeah
