here at cnet.com today I'm taking a
first look at the Kodak office hero 6.1
all-in-one printer the 200 dollar hero
six point one is Kodak's mid-range
multifunction device it can print scan
fax and copy and it's really built for
professional environments that will use
its advanced printing features otherwise
you will be happier with something a
little less involved if you don't need
those features but for small offices and
families shopping for an all-in-one that
won't break the bank on ink the office
hero six point one offers everything you
need to increase your productivity
there's an auto duplexer in the back
that thing flips over pages for
double-sided printing and you also get
an additional auto document feeder on
top here that's for scanning and copying
large document stacks it prints on a
variety of paper sizes as well the main
tray on the bottom for everyday printing
can hold up to 200 Suites of playing
eight and a half by 11 inch paper or you
can put 70 sheets of photo paper in
there but we wouldn't recommend you
print too many photos or you'll find
yourself spending a lot of money on ink
now that's because the six point one
uses just two ink tanks a single tank
for black and a separate five ink
cartridge for a pigment color so you'll
need to buy an entirely new set if you
do run out of just one of those colors
ink aside though the office hero 6.1
makes it pretty easy to connect to your
Wi-Fi network thanks to a simple Wi-Fi
Protected setup button and you also get
access to codecs free pick flick app for
iOS Android and BlackBerry devices that
app lets you do light edits of photos on
your phone and send jobs directly to
your printer at home now printing from
the cloud is perhaps the most convenient
feature of the here of six point one and
you get two really easy ways to print
from any computer with an internet
connection so Google Cloud Print is the
first way it's a free utility that lets
multiple users share your printer over
the web with a simple username
registration and a compatible device
running Google Google stores your
information for the device on its
servers to keep your computer clutter
free and it simplifies the process even
further by keeping the drivers and your
firmware up-to-date on those servers
you also get Kodak's email print feature
that releases the shackles of the print
driver by assigning a unique email
address to every printer that you can
use to send jobs from it to connected
device away from the unit so when you
email it to the printer you can either
attach the document as a file or you can
just paste a body of text into the body
of an email in terms of performance
however the Kodak hero's 6.1 performed a
little bit slower than the average
speeds for a printer in the $200 price
range it's not slow enough to be a deal
breaker but you may find yourself
tapping your shoes a little longer than
normal if you're printing large jobs so
you can read all the details of this
printer in our full review on cnet.com
but that's it for me I'm Justin you you
just took a first look at the kodak
office hero 6.1 multifunction printers
