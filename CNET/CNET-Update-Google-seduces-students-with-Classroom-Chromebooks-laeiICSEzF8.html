I'm Bridget Carey and this is your CNET
update you'll be hearing quite a bit
about Chromebooks this year
chrome is Google's operating system and
Intel is making a big push into these
cheaper computers Intel's chips are in
more than 20 Chrome machines coming this
year from different manufacturers the
new models have faster processors and
longer battery life Lenovo jumped in to
Chromebooks for the first time with the
n20 and the n 20p both of these are
small 11 inch screens but the N 20 P has
a hinge to fold the touchscreen back
300Â° asus also has two Chromebooks and
it made the second-ever 13 inch screen
Chromebook which you can pick up for 250
dollars in June Chromebooks are also
targeted for students google says about
10,000 schools right now use Chromebooks
and Lenovo and Dell are targeting their
new models to the education crowd but
there are also desktop versions the HP
Chromebooks comes in several colors you
may want to connect it to your TV when
it arrives in June there's also the LG
chrome base for 350 dollars it's the
first Chrome all-in-one desktop PC
chrome is a good affordable option if
you do most of your work online but you
can't just download any program to these
computers since it's not Windows or Mac
now along with a push for Chromebooks in
school google also has an online service
for teachers called classroom it's like
a Google Drive for documents just for
teachers and student assignments Google
says it will be free of advertisements
and it'll cost nothing for a school to
use it Google tested it with more than a
dozen schools teachers can apply to be
the first to preview it but it'll roll
out officially in September and today I
like to end the show with some helpful
tech advice about business cards let's
face it
business cards can be such a hassle to
manage your pile keeps stacking up and
then trying to find the one you need is
simply a nightmare well don't despair
you can use your smartphone to easily
save a card digitally the Evernote
converts a card by taking a photo of it
and Evernote just added a feature to
sync a business card with LinkedIn
profiles now once you scan a card you
can send a connection request to that
person on LinkedIn but keep in mind when
you send that LinkedIn request you can't
write a custom message it just sends out
that awful default line that says since
you are personal I trust I like to add
you to my network yeah well that's
pretty tacky so you may be better off
just sending them an email later
that's your tech news update you can
head to cnet.com for more details from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
