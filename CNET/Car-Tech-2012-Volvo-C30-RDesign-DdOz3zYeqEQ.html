friend of yours who has great taste a
great career but is an idiot about tech
let's check the 2013 Volvo c30 r-type
Polestar edition check the tech it helps
if you're a lot items got good looks on
the c30 fits in there as you can see
it's the spiritual descendant of the
very cool 1800 ES coupe wagon from back
in the 70s not as svelte or stylus as it
was in the 70s but then again neither
mind
you've got the signature all glass lift
up back door on this chisel but design
that gives you a loading space otherwise
the car is really a 2+2 the back seats
are cruel if not unusual now normally I
start these little tours at the cabin
tech here in the head unit but not on
this one I got to get something off my
chest first starting with the ergonomics
first of all what is this rake handle
sticking up here that's the emergency
brake it never really goes down so it's
always in my way when I'm going to grab
a shift to thought of that when it's up
I can easily rest on it look like Noel
Coward getting ready for his Hollywood
production shot but that's not why I buy
a Volvo then you get to this stalk over
here you've got a controller here that
I'm going to teach you about later but
when you go to use it you bang your
knuckle against the white and there go
the wipers and when you go to start the
car you activate the washers if you can
even get to the ignition God's sake and
put the wheel down to get the car
started
there we go but that's not good design
people now under the cabin electronics
this is not a remote for the rear seat
DVD system which there is not one in
this car blessedly instead it's one of
the ways you can operate that you don't
see it that that is actually a pop-up
navigation screen check this out you
turn it on by reaching around for this
inscrutable little controller back here
and once you think you have the right
button you press it now let's know the
groaning sound it makes
it's going to give you navigation
traffic that's about it nothing else
happens on that display you control it
with either this little stick and two
buttons here or you can also operate it
using this thing which is fine because
there's no other controller on the dash
so your passenger who wants to operate
that and by the way this car does not
lock out entry while you're driving
which brings us to the other screen
which dates back to the 80s that's this
sort of greenish gray monochrome LCD
it's not a pretty thing to look at nor
is it a very effective thing here your
audio choice is a single slot CD right
up there you've got satellite radio
that's optional on this car by the way
am/fm of course HD radios in here my aux
jack is in the glove box along with the
USB I can use for a stick or an iPod
it's nice to have bluetooth streaming on
this car stock of course but very
limited metadata I mean what's going on
here you could do better and if my final
concern is this doesn't look like this
Volvo does this nice blue finally Rend
your gauge design and this is a
different color a different typeface two
different everything it just looks like
it came in front of the car and that
looks like a game out of a third car
okay because we've got a Volvo things
are shall we say unusual in the front as
well it's a 5 cylinder they're one of
the few companies that do these in line
5 sitting sideways driving the front
wheels is no all-wheel drive on this guy
but it is a turbo in all trims 227
horsepower 236 foot-pounds of torque the
car only weighs 3,200 pounds so the
acceleration is good and the mpg not bad
21:30 with the 6-speed manual that we
have
you lose one mpg highway now if you saw
that little blue badge on the butt and
like me thought what the hell is that
it says pole star which means nothing
well turns out it's an engine tuning
chip that Volvo installs factory approve
that really improves your performance
you now have 250 horsepower and over 273
foot-pounds of torque
all without changing mpg or emissions at
all most importantly without screwing
with your warranty let's go see how that
works
first thing I notice getting in this car
is that it's very smooth that that damn
handbrake is in my way that one to shift
is annoying anyway I'll get over it but
the first thing you're going to pick up
on once you get out on the road is how
much power this car has it's
prodigiously powerful with that Polestar
chip in there that isn't the same as
being exceptionally responsive the power
is kind of in a two position throttle
mode either a little power or a lot of
power I don't find much in the middle
and I hate that the engine is real
smooth the whole car is actually very
smooth no matter where you put it on the
RPM the engine never sounds like it's
angry you're growling just determined
but where the car starts to let you down
or starts to feel like the $26,000 car
that it is is when you really get into
it in a corner and you get a lot of
torque steer or the front end rears up
and you get this little pigeon-toed
thing on the front tires and they start
to lose their grip you get this really
embarrassing kind of laundry traction
'less mess in other words Polestar puts
too much power into the platform so I
think I would skip it as much as I love
the fact that it's crazy powerful when
you got to overtake like that but the
car almost doesn't put it to the ground
right okay ac30 is about our $26,000
proposition delivered but you got a long
way to go after that twenty five hundred
for the art type kit the body kit the
wheels the sports suspension you want
that 1304 Matic transmission you may or
may not want that another thirteen
hundred for the Polestar package I think
I would skip it it's impressive but not
something I want to live with every day
finally forty four hundred for the
Platinum trim level that you kind of
want it has that doping to have system
you don't care about but it's got
premium audio the glass moonroof the
power and heated seats I think you
mostly want it more than you don't
