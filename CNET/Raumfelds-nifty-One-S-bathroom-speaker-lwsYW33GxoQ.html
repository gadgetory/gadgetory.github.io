multi room music standards that were out
there at the other day and I think I
lost count after 15 with so many
different systems to choose from and
most less than a year old how do you
know if you've got the right one for the
money one of my favorite so far this
year is the wrong Feld 1s from toy
falange ermine II this is a Wi-Fi
speaker which is humidity resistant and
designed to be used in kitchens or
bathrooms design wise it doesn't look
like much but it's well built and
thoughtful as well it even has a little
rubber stopper on the bottom to protect
the ports at $299 this is the baby in
their range and it extends right up to
the stereo l floor-standing speakers
which are $2,400 why choose raumfeld
over solos firstly performance when
compared against the Sonos play:1
the 1s has much better bass response and
can actually fill a small to medium room
very easily secondly it has better file
support if you're an audiophile the
raumfeld supports 24-bit files without
an issue whereas the Sonos card the only
downside is that rom feld is only
available online but the company does
offer a 60-day in-home trial period so
you can try it out also it only supports
a small number of apps including tidal
and Spotify and is really designed for
people to stream files stored on their
phone or network while there are plenty
of wireless speakers out there
the raumfeld is one of the better ones
and for CAD more streaming services it's
one of the first real alternatives to
Sonos this has been ty Pendlebury for
