windows 95 for some time it's new it's
different it's better and we have to
tell you even if you don't use a PC
whatever kind of computer you use you
will feel the impact of the release of
Windows 95 let's take a look at it a
trash can of excuse me
recycle bin and folders and applications
that can be dragged to the desktop and
look at this long file names and at the
heart of it all the system taskbar
showing what's open on the desktop and
providing easy access to any running
program you can move the taskbar to any
corner and resize it to the start button
organizes your applications into groups
and subgroups for easy launching that's
the notify area with time date and other
useful tools the briefcase is a new
mechanism for keeping multiple versions
of files in sync now your files on your
desktop machine can match the files on
your laptop with no hassles there are
customized desktops with their own
password logins so your five-year-old
can type in her name and password and
presto little Emily is presented with
her own folders and shortcuts to her
favorite games so that's the new Windows
95 interface simpler far more intuitive
not without a few problems though for
instance most of your present
applications can't handle those longer
file names and those names will also
give you problems if you try to put lots
of folders inside other folders but in
general a great improvement particularly
here you know how difficult it is to
install a card for sound or video now
inside Windows 95 is a new feature
called plug-and-play which should make
this a whole lot easier select add new
hardware and the hardware wizard gets to
work plug and play compatible devices
are installed automatically even those
non plug-and-play get handled with an
extensive database of devices that
assist you in the installation this clip
shows the sharper video that you can
expect from windows 95 multimedia stay
tuned for more happy days
and hover illustrates the capabilities
of the new game programming interface
game designers will now be able to
achieve a level of visual performance
impossible under Windows 3.1 this all
looks great but will your existing
Windows and dos applications continue to
work most of the programs you now own
are likely to run just fine under
Windows 95
they just won't take advantage of all of
its features until you upgrade which
means that your upgrade cost might be
higher than you planned on the other
hand Microsoft is throwing in some free
apps for example Microsoft Network
Microsoft network is a new online
information service that is bundled with
Windows 95 it's got its own special icon
on the desktop so your electronic mail
chat rooms news groups and home pages on
the World Wide Web are just a click away
the network is still in its infancy but
you can see much more on the horizon for
the Microsoft network while the program
might come free with Windows 95 but
there is a monthly fee to use the
Microsoft Network and if you use it more
than three hours a month there are extra
charges you might run up those extra
charges sooner than you think given how
easy it is and how tightly integrated
into the operating system another thing
to watch out for is some features of
Windows 95 that are actually part of a
companion software product called
Microsoft Plus that costs an extra 50
bucks
