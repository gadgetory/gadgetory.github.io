you know that and phones aren't perfect
either
but we want to make it make all of our
users happy
however we started getting some reports
of people having issues with the antenna
system which is a very advanced new
antenna system and the problems they
were saying obviously Gizmodo put their
video on the web people were touching x
marks the spot here and they were seeing
a large drop in bars and this has been
since dubbed antenna gate doesn't seem
like a good idea if you can touch your
phone one particularly grip your phone
in a certain way and the bars go way
down that doesn't seem like a good thing
well it turns out it's certainly not
unique to the iPhone 4 that was one of
the first things we learned you could go
on YouTube and see videos of Nokia
phones and Motorola phones and other
phones doing the same thing nobody'd
ever looked at him much before but I
think it's important to understand the
scope of this problem because what the
data says leads you to the conclusion
that this has been blown so out of
proportion that it's it's incredible so
let me tell you what we're going to do
the first thing we did yesterday we
released iOS version 4.1 that is now out
people are updating it it fixes the
wrong formula that we use to calculate
how many bars to put up for a given
signal strength and there was a nasty
exchange bug in there that a lot of our
corporate customers are hitting and
that's fixed as well so those bugs are
fixed iOS fours out 4.1 is out and we
recommend that every iPhone owner update
to it
secondly a lot of people have told us
the bumper solves this
signal strength problem consumer reports
this the latest one this week we've
heard it from a lot of people why don't
you just give everybody a case ok great
let's give everybody a case we've got
our bumper case here but we want to give
everybody a free case every iPhone user
is going to get a free case one for
every iPhone 4 if you've already bought
one we'll give you a full refund for a
bumper and we're going to do this for
every iPhone 4 purchase through
September 30th will re-examine this in
September and decide whether to keep
going or maybe we'll have a better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
