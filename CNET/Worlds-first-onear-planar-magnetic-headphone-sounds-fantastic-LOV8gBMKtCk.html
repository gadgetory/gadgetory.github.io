at $450 it's one of the least expensive
headphones that use planner magnetic
drivers which tend to sound very
coherent and spacious with low
distortion and with its close back on
your design it's one of the few planner
magnetic models optimized for mobile use
well it doesn't sound quite as open and
airy as odyssey's higher and open back
over your models it's one of those
headphones that sounds so good you want
to go back and listen to your music
collection to hear the little details
that lessor headphones don't reveal it's
just a great sounding headphone it's
also attractively designed with a
leather covered headband and ear cups
and sturdy metal parts it folds flat
into an included storage pouch the thick
tangle resistant flat headphone cord
detaches and iPhone users can swap out
the standard analog cable for a diseased
Apple approved cypher lightning cable
that creates an all digital connection
and has a DAC built into the headphones
remote that boosts the sound and sound
performance slightly while drawing a
little power from your iPhone that
lightning cable is included in the $500
bundle of the headphones we compare the
sign to optos 400 ollar pm3 clothes back
plan or magnetic headphone which we also
like a lot the slightly less stylish
Oppo has an over your design and is a
little more comfortable to wear over
long periods and perhaps that's the only
complaint about this headphone it's
pretty comfortable but not super
comfortable on the other hand it's a
little bit more forward and revealing
than the Oppo which means it'll make
well recorded track sound even better
but bring out the harshness and badly
recorded material and make it sound even
worse so it goes with really transparent
headphones and the sign is just that and
while it's pretty pricey at $450 it
looks and sounds like a $450 headphone
