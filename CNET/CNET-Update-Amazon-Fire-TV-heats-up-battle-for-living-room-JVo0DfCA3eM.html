heating up with Amazon fire TV I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update amazon wants to be the center of
your living room entertainment with a
new set-top box that streams video music
and also games it's called fire TV and
it costs one hundred dollars on sale now
it's not the cheapest choice in
streaming media to your television but
it does have plenty of perks to compete
with Apple TV Roku and Google's
chromecast the thin square box measures
four and a half inches across and it's
said to have three times the performance
power of the other streaming devices on
the market during a demo amazon showed
how it can zip through menus and if you
hate typing using the arrow keys on a
remote control amazon lets you avoid
that by simply speaking your search
query there's a little microphone inside
the remote it has dozens of apps to
stream video including Netflix Hulu Plus
ESPN and YouTube and of course it has
access to Amazon's digital library of
movies and TV shows parents can set up
kid restricted profiles with Amazon free
time and for an extra three dollars a
month kids get access to unlimited
programming from networks like
Nickelodeon Sesame Street and PBS it has
apps to stream music and get this it can
also show lyrics to the music you're
playing karaoke party anyone but the big
feature here is gaming amazon worked
with sega EA and disney to have tons of
games customized to work with fire TV
many games will be casual free apps like
the typical stuff you find in an android
app store but other games will cost a
few bucks and more than 1,000 games will
be free to play amazon is even making
its own games it created sep 07 dollars
but it does come included if you spend
an extra forty dollars on amazon's game
controller and amazon also throws in ten
dollars to spend in credits and here's
an interesting tidbit you can play music
from pandora while you're in a game at
$99 the fire TV is the same price as
apple TV and it's more expensive than
the roku or chromecast
but it could really set itself apart
with the gaming features then again if
you wanted a stream video you probably
already on a device that can do that
savvy consumers may go to Amazon for
when it's time for an upgrade and during
all this amazon news microsoft unveiled
the voice assistant Cortana it's the
windows phone version of Siri it's named
after the computer from the halo video
game it's still in beta microsoft also
announced updates to windows including a
new version of the start menu thank
goodness you can get more details at
cnet com and I'll cover that more on the
next episode from our studios in New
York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
