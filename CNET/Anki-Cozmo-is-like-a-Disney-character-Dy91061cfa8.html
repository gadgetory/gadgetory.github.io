Pixar movie come to life it's meant to
unki Cosmo is a fully autonomous robot
toy that's here for the holidays and
through a mix of animation design and
some AI it's made to look incredibly
cute Cosmo can recognize faces and can
recognize objects and distance with its
built-in camera it plays with three
included connected blocks it can be used
as a remote control robot and it plays
games with you warning it likes to win
it'll charm the heck out of your kids
too to make Cosmo work you need to pair
it with an iPhone or Android phone over
Wi-Fi the Cosmo app has unlockable
skills and some games some are available
now others are coming before Christmas
and Anki plans to add more abilities
over time a programming SDK will open up
later this year for those who know a
hack with Python and after that they are
planning a child friendly programming
update in the future but right now Cosmo
is more about discovery and playing and
seeing what it'll do and Cosmo is
expensive at $180 it's probably a lot
more than a lot of people would want to
pay for a robot to it a cosmo packs a
ton of tech into a tiny body and its
clever use of classic animation tricks
adds a ton of personality that's where
even larger robots in the real world
could start going next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
