taking a first look at the samsung
galaxy note 4 t-mobile we first saw this
enormous phone which some people call a
phablet phone tablet for 18 team this is
the t-mobile version there are a couple
differences right off the bat first of
all this one comes with ice cream
sandwich right out of the box second of
all it also comes with a couple
productivity apps that the original AT&amp;amp;T
phone didn't have so I'll show you those
in a minute it also runs on t-mobile's
fastest 4G network that is the hspa+ 42
network so you've got some fast 4G
speeds on this phone the screen is a
whopping 5.3 inch HD display and that
makes the entire phone rather large so
it's big in the hand really big huge in
the pocket it's big on your ear in fact
I think it literally covers half of my
face however there are some things to
like with a large screen it gives you a
great platform for watching movies for
playing games for reading things online
there are also the productivity tools in
here and the phone does come with a
wonderful little stylus I think it's a
little bit too small feels flimsy not as
comfortable to hold as the aftermarket
stylus but that will of course cost you
more however if you're the kind of
person who's very creative if you like
to take notes at meetings if you like to
doodle then this also gives you that
capacity so large screen plus
productivity / artistic features and
that's what really this phones draw is
beyond all that the phone still is a
phone it's an Android smartphone runs
android 4.0 ice cream sandwich as i
mentioned in addition to that it's got
an eight megapixel camera with 1080p HD
video capture and playback cameras very
strong as well it's got a 2-megapixel
front-facing camera which is really good
a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core processor so
it's pretty fast as well there's a large
battery in here battery life you know
depending on how you use any phone it
could be a lot longer if you don't use
it as often if you use it heavily then
you will need to recharge this everyday
you should definitely read my full
review for all the tips and tricks with
productivity tools but one thing I will
note is that in s note you can do things
like you can handwrite and it will show
up in typescript you can draw a doodle
of a triangle and it will show up with
perfectly measured sides also in the
settings you can actually tweak the
phone to move the keyboard off to one
side and that's called one-handed
operation so it will shrink it a little
bit move it over and then you can type
away with one hand and that's your
overview of t-mobile samsung galaxy note
the enormous 5.3 inch android 4.0
smartphone i'm jessica doll court for
siena you should definitely read the
