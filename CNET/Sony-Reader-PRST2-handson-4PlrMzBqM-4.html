cnet.com and I'm here with the Sony
Reader PRS t2 this mount came out a few
months ago it is an incremental upgrade
over the t1 which came out in 2011 Sony
hasn't made any major changes to its
e-reader but it has made some design
tweaks and most of them are for the
better
this model does come in black red or
white the black model is the one we have
here that we reviewed one of the things
I will say about it is that because it
has this kind of rubberized textured
finish it does attract finger prints I
assume that's not as bad with the white
model but like a lot of other darker
readers this one will show fingerprints
aside from that I really did like its
design it's a very lightweight ereader
it's also thin and fits in your hand
well unlike the Kindle paperwhite this
does have physical buttons on it
some people like those buttons one
little complaint is that the page four
and back buttons are on the left side so
if you're a right-handed person you may
not like that those buttons are on the
left side this model comes with two
gigabytes of built-in memory that's kind
of the standard these days for readers
it does however have a slot for adding
more memory it's a micro SD card slot
aside from that this is a good
performing eReader
sony has made the contrast a little
better on the small the performance is a
little better both in terms of faster
page turns as well as improved battery
life this one now gets about two months
of battery life with Wi-Fi off and this
is really in terms of Sony's eReader
line the t2 is the 2012 model for Sony
in terms of other new features those are
really more software based sony has
improved the interface it's also
improved its store and it's added some
social media features as well as an
Evernote connection all in all this is a
perfectly good eReader the text looks
good on it the performance is good and
as I said the design it's very
lightweight but the one thing it has
going against it is that the competition
has that integrated light in it and both
the Kindle and Nook cost $10
less than this so this is a little bit
hard to recommend unless you of course
are already in the Sony eReader
ecosystem and you want a new device if
you are this is a nice incremental
upgrade I'm David Carr Noi and that's
the Sony Reader PRS t2 thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
