new little big disc Thunderbolt 2
formula C now let me get straight to the
point
yes two points number one this is the
most expensive one terabyte external
storage drive on the market and number
two is worth every penny of is one
thousand three hundred dollars price tag
and by saying that I'm totally aware of
the fact that there are many pen in this
case a lot more that you can carry with
your fingers or even toe don't try so
the question is why
well another two points number one it is
also by far the fastest external drive
on the market period now it's so fast I
have to get a brand new MacBook Pro the
latest version to test it and in my
testing is registered the sustain will
world right speed up more than 570
megabyte per second and the real-world
sustained read speed of more than 670
megabyte per second now that is only by
far the fastest I've seen butter now
that's not the speed of the stride it's
a speed of the MacBook Pros internal
drive because when I use this one here
to work on is Oh writing and reading
within itself is still average more than
500 megabyte per second and that mean if
you have a fast enough host computer you
can actually expect more than a thousand
megabyte per second out of this drive
right here that is crazy because you can
actually finish a CD full worth of data
on this one here in less one second look
at my eyes that is one second and the
second reason why it's worth the price
because of the desire right here take a
look it's very compact and actually a
very light you can easily Kate with you
unfortunately it's not bus power and
require a separate power adapter but it
does come with these cute little box
right here for you to carry accessories
and by accessory I mean the power
adapter in app adapter for all the parts
of the world a Thunderbolt cable a test
post and you can put on and off just
like that
and all locked and I mean a lot of
plastic bags
thank you see this is great from my
plastic bag collection now the reason
why this one here is so fast because on
the outside is support the Thunderbolt
to standard which has a ceiling of 20
gigabit per second it comes with two
port right here on the back and it's
great in case you want to use it in a
daisy chain you can plug another thing
about drive to this one now it works
with both thunderbolt 2 and thunder boom
standard and on the inside it houses a
high-performance Pizza Express solar
stay dry and for that reason is also
worked very quietly it comes with full
metal casing and it works also as the
heat sink to keep it cool note how is
painted black because let's see what you
to know that this drive right here
matches the new Mac Pro in terms of
performance and if you can afford a Mac
Pro the prior on this one right here is
quite manageable if I mother drive here
check out my full review etsy.com
basically is a ridiculously faster
device and normally I only use
ridiculously to describe how good I look
in the bathroom mirror that's how fast
it is and that's also because I'm dumb
low and this has been the first look at
the little big disk Thunderbolt 2 proble
see I look good all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
