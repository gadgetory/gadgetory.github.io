the apple pie for all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple this week it's
all gravy with new product announcements
and even more to come next week can you
guys say iPad 2 so let's get to the good
stuff the all new macbook pros Apple's
laptop line will now feature the latest
Sandy Bridge processors from Intel with
the 15 inch and 17 inch model pros
rocking a quad-core configuration for
the first time ever they will also
feature AMD graphics cards while the 13
inch line will feature dual core i5 or
i7 processors and Intel's integrated
graphics now all macbook pros will also
feature the all-new Thunderbolt port
that supports high performance data and
high-resolution displays all through a
single connection with 10 gigabits of
throughput whoa unbelievable and with an
adapter it will connect to its apples
current Cinema Display DVI HDMI or VGA
displays you'll get a solid state drive
built order option for every model and
you'll also get a high res display
option only on the 15 inch models to
increase the resolution 216 82 1050
that's thirty-six percent more pixels
than the standard 1440 x 900
Wow Apple stuck with the same cosmetic
design so we might be waiting for 2012
to see a drastic physical change the
line but it's all about the power under
the hood we told you the Apple buyers to
wait it out and now you're being
rewarded now app will also release the
developer preview of Mac OS 10 line you
have to be part of the developer program
to get access to it and we've talked
about some of its features like
launchpad full screen apps and Mission
Control but they also showcase some new
features like a revamp male versions
which automatically saves successive
versions of your documents and a
wireless file sharing system for
computers nearby called airdrop they'll
also be integrating the server version
into Mac OS 10 line for free so we sure
to have more details on the OS for you
guys before it's summer release apple
also launched the facetime for the mac
app it was previously a public beta and
will now come pre-installed for new
macbook owners some of you current users
might be a little ticked off that they
have to pay 99 cents for it due to
accounting requirements for the new
functionality all right let's take a
break for our app of the week this
week's appt is tunein radio now i've
been using others but this is the
cleanest radio experience i've had plus
you can record live radio listen to it
later it's 99 cents right now which is
fifty percent off but it's by far my
favorite radio app right now so you guys
want to check it out now there's this
other product the ipad 2 thing that you
know i guess people have been talking
about well apple is sent out their
official invitation for the event on
mark second that's this coming Wednesday
in San Francisco at the yerba buena
gardens Center and we'll do our best to
get into the event for you
now I can tell you what we did learn
from some of the intelligence we
collected Apple will be releasing a new
line of colored dots they aren't scratch
and sniff they do taste sweet an apple
will be calling it I candy yeah you got
that all right everyone wants to know
what the next iPad will really look like
but could this be it will probably know
by the time some of you watch this but a
Japanese blog site has posted images of
the mock-up that shows a significantly
thinner iPad with tapered edges that
also coincides with some cases and
covers now Apple is called an all hands
on meeting for the retail stores this
recent Sunday employees are signing
non-disclosure agreements and they
typically only do these things before a
major product release now could point to
the iPad coming even sooner rather than
later but we'll get all of our answers
very soon now to the quick bites final
cut users who have been waiting for a
couple of years for the next version
might be getting one soon techCrunch
reports will be coming with a complete
redesign of the user interface which may
be a good or bad thing for long time
users but we've been waiting patiently
for the next FCP Apple has discontinued
the box version of mobileme and removed
it from their online store which could
point to the rumored free version of the
revamped service and we might be a day
or a few days late when you watch this
but we'd like to wish mr. stephen p jobs
a happy 56th birthday because let's be
honest without him I probably be making
balloon animals for a living all right
that's going to do it for this week's
show send your emails your questions and
your comments to the Apple by to cnet
com i'm brian Tong thanks for watching
we'll see you next week for another bite
of the Apple
