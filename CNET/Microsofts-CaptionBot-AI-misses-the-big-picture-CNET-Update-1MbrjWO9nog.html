experiment I'm Bridget Carey this is
your cnet update Microsoft's
artificially intelligent shat bought a
is still in timeout after misbehaving on
Twitter but that isn't stopping
Microsoft in its quest to create systems
that can interpret language and images
and so the company released another AI
program into the wild it's called
caption bot you upload a photo into
caption bot and within seconds Microsoft
analyzes it and creates a description
sometimes it gets the description
perfect but as we found out through
testing there's still a lot of work to
do it didn't understand basic things
like a baseball field a tree or the
shape of a Starfleet captain to the
Machine this man in a catwoman suit is a
man with a surfboard and this scene with
an alien well it's nothing to be scared
of it's just a man brushing his teeth
and when we put in a picture of its
sibling Tay why that's just a cell phone
he slashed she you can try it yourself
at caption bought AI and speaking of
weird things on the internet the vine
mobile app has a new feature to keep you
entranced and watching videos longer a
new watch button on a profile will play
through all of someone's six-second
videos back to back now normally video
is just keep looping until you scroll
past them but you know what if you feel
like your mobile life is just getting
boring that you're stuck in the same app
checking rut day after day well sharp
created a phone that can change your
life say hello to robo Han a little
humanoid robot smartphone pet it starts
shipping next month on May 26th and you
take this little buddy with you wherever
you go when you have a call you have to
talk into him or turn him around and
talk to his but it runs on Android but I
don't think of how much use for normal
apps with this fella he'll read your
messages aloud so everyone can hear your
conversations it projects videos from
its head takes photos with its face and
it babysits your infants and I guess it
also could even serve as a therapist to
treat depression I don't understand this
ad but the point is it'll cost you about
eighteen hundred dollars to own the 8
inch tall robo hon at that price hope
you get a good case
for it that's all for this tech news
roundup and you can add the cnet com for
the latest for more studios in New York
