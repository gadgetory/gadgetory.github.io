the Nexus 10 tablet in beautiful sixteen
by nine where this tablet really shines
is watching stuff because man that
aspect ratio is rad dig the tablet but
you know what I was thinking could this
handle an actual Ice Age Ice Age in the
icebox burr a cold to the touch
let's see this bad boy no problem
it turned right on no delay whatsoever
five new messages I got a lot of
messages while it was in the freezer
like hey it's cold in here and BRR
it's time for the heat test with the
Nexus 10 you know what I think I'm gonna
have the pizza dad some weirdness
weirdness I guess we just have a slice
of pizza and wait for this thing to cool
down and see if whatever is happening on
the screen is contagious this one
doesn't seem to want to turn that
comment that my friends is a fail so I
recant my fail it's back it just needed
a little bit of TLC a little reset
action and some some downtime and it's
working fine
reading here in the back oh my my phone
went off bad things Oh God oh Jesus
oh geez oh that's not good turn it off
turn it off time to get out of the tub
deal with this situation
alright well we're gonna pack this thing
in rice overnight and see if that'll do
it it probably wasn't in the water long
I guess I don't get to read tonight if
only there was some non electrical
version of reading that ain't right I'm
sure it's fine I'm sure it's no problem
to my law but it is usable it is still
working so that's you know quite good
I'm at the park for some frisbee action
the Nexus 10 is still operational though
admittedly very dim so you might have to
just take my word for it that the screen
is on and active you can't get it past
that rock right there I'm gonna go for
it
oh yes I got past the rock still on
orientation changed which as it should
in flight but still working fine we got
some serious hazards on the course but I
think I can get it past that other rock
ready oh it slipped out of my hand oh I
think we may have lost touch sensitivity
which I turn in and off but doesn't want
to turn off I think it's time to move to
swings
hmm nothing like enjoying a nice
leisurely day at the park finishing up
my reading of Tale of Two Cities on my
Nexus 10 tablet but then you realize
what it was the best of times and the
worst of times I was a pretty good fling
I got a say if I do say so myself and no
crack no cracks some scuffing on the
back but no cracks that's a pretty great
drop test if you can get over some minor
headache-inducing rolling I think you
can still enjoy some reading some movies
and a lot of multimedia on your Nexus 10
tablet even if you choose to use it as
an ultimate frisbee device as people on
Twitter evidently want to Nexus 10 this
is a really good
too bad I'm getting a aneurysm eating</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
