flagship cars like a BMW 7-series to
find out what's going to be in cars we
can afford like five to ten years from
now this example of the new seven is a
pretty good technology showcase that we
can look down the road at I'm Brian
Cooley with my top five milestone tech
features in the new Beamer flagship
number five the carbon core now I put
this at number five because it is not an
entirely new technology carbon fiber in
cars but pure carbon fiber passenger
cells remain a tedious expensive process
but BMWs done here is hybridized with
carbon fiber reinforced plastic here and
here and here blended with aluminum and
lightweight high-strength steel the
overall result is a loss of nearly 200
pounds now on a big boy like this that's
not exactly earth-shaking but weight
loss is the Holy Grail
and this is an important way of getting
there by the way this technology
trickled down from the iSeries the i3
and the i8 or it emerged a couple years
ago
number four Laser headlights and I put
these relatively low because this is not
entirely new technology
howdy got these out in a
limited-production r8 a little while ago
but this is full production in the seven
series contrary to what you might think
Laser headlights don't literally aim out
on the road like lasers at a concert
they go about an inch and they hit an
illumination structure inside the lamp
and then that light is projected out but
you end up with a much more efficient
and controllable light huge throw they
say about a third of a mile for these
guys that's way more than your current
high beams while using about a third
less power they're very tiny modules and
they should last forever unless your
rear end someone don't do that number
three is gesture control now a BMW gives
you a lot of ways to control the center
stack you've got the traditional I drive
knob controller which lately has had a
touchpad on top of that voice command
continues better than before you've got
a touchscreen now I'm still getting used
to that in a premium German car that was
very no-no for the last number of years
but now on the top of all that is just
your command as well this is the biggest
mainstream push to put gesture in real
cars yet number two is the head-up
display now you may say HUDs nothing new
and it's not but this is the largest one
in the business and that's important in
a HUD because the bigger and more
expansive it is the less you have to
scrutinize a small piece of real estate
which is not a great idea when you're
driving you want a big one that is more
or less in your gaze and this one's
absolutely doing that on top of that BMW
already in my opinion did the best
infographics on a hood of anybody in the
industry what I want to see them push
the bar on next is be the first to get
augmented reality in here number one in
the words of auric Goldfinger is what an
extraordinary car key you have Mr Bond
this is the first LCD touchscreen remote
key fob now you slide it up to get to
your screens and you can see if the cars
locked you can check your fuel range
check your battery charge if you happen
to have a plug-in hybrid or something
but here's where it gets really
interesting on the last screen it
marries into a new level of self parking
tech so you hit this button here and the
car goes and identifies a nearby parking
space it shows you yes I have found one
then you to stand on this arrow and the
car will start to nose in all by itself
you aren't in the car notice that that's
also a Deadman switch if I lift off the
car stops moving for safety reasons
otherwise I just stay on the arrow and
the car takes itself all the way in and
when it's done it tells me and all I
have to do is turn it off and it locks
and I walk away that's a crowd pleaser
or top five lists to wake the car lover
go to see net on cars comm but on top
five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
