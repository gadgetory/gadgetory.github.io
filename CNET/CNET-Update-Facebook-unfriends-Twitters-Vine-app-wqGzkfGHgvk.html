your lunch I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your CNET update there's a new fold in
the drama between Facebook and Twitter
the brand new iPhone app vine which is
owned by Twitter lets users create short
six-second videos and share it on social
media but within hours of the app
launching Facebook blocked vine from
being able to find your Facebook friends
you can still share a vine video on your
Facebook feed you just can't find fellow
vine users that are in your Facebook
network the move is similar to how
Twitter shut off Facebook's Instagram
from accessing its API and getting user
data since it didn't help Twitter's
bottom line you know the saying an API
for an API if you have an Apple device
it's worth seeing how vine works you
don't have to create a straight six
second video but you can't actually stop
and start the video several times
throughout so you create choppy montages
or a stop-motion clip but be aware that
your videos published on the vine
network are public there are no privacy
settings yet there is a way you can get
around it
once you create a video and get it to
the publish screen your clip is saved to
your camera roll so then you can exit
the app and just share the video with
whomever you want the live TV streaming
startup called Aereo has updated its app
on roku so subscribers can use the
service with the roku remote previously
users could only control it with an
iPhone or iPad Aereo can be a popular
device for people who want to save money
by dropping their cable subscriptions
REO subscribers pay $8 a month
to access several live local
over-the-air channels as well as a
cloud-based DVR ariel pulls in local
broadcasts from any tiny over-the-air
antennas and then streams those channels
to its subscribers right now it's only
available for New York City residents
but the company's about to expand to 22
additional cities in the u.s. several
broadcast networks including CNET's
parent company CBS are suing area
because it streams the over-the-air TV
signals without permission and it
doesn't pay the subscriber
retransmission fees that mainstream
cable and satellite providers do
and play it back like a DVR without the
box Microsoft will be launching more
variations of the surface tablet during
Microsoft's earnings call the chief
financial officer didn't give any
specific details but he did say the
company will expand the surface product
line as well as expand retail
distribution and get it out to more
countries you also said that there's
great demand in general for Windows 8
touch devices and that supply simply
can't keep up with demand
