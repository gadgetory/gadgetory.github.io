familiar with Roku's other streaming
boxes the first thing you'll notice is
that this one's much bigger the second
is the 4 on top which notes the main
extra feature the ability to stream 4k
TV shows and movies to take advantage in
the a fast internet connection and a 4k
TV the bigger the better with Netflix
Amazon YouTube Vudu MgO and toon goggles
roku 4 as more 4k capable apps than
competing 4k streamers like Nvidia
shield and Amazon fire TV it also makes
that content easier to find with a
dedicated 4k showcase app and a category
on its App Store devoted to 4k providers
on the other hand there isn't much to
see in 4k yet on those services beyond
original series like narcos and
transparent the few newer 4k movies are
also expensive starting around 10 bucks
to rent and while 4k streams look great
in my testing so did good old 1080p
streams in fact the difference was tough
to see even on a big TV it's also worth
noting the most 4k TVs a built in 4k
apps themselves although as usual we
like Roku system better than any Smart
TVs beyond 4k the Roku 4 is packed with
extras including a nifty remote finder
if you misplace your mode just tap the
button on the top of the Roku 4 and the
clicker emits a loud sound until you
find it and hit any button the box has
most of the same connectivity as other
Roku's including an Ethernet port and an
HDMI output but it also adds an optical
digital audio output for older AV
systems Roku also says it has a better
processor and faster Wi-Fi aside from
its little built-in alarm the remote is
the same as the Roku 3 including a
headphone jack for private listening and
the ability to search by talking into
the microphone Wendy Williams
unlike Siri on Apple TV and Alexa on
Amazon Roku's voice support doesn't
extend to commands or general questions
just search terms
Roku makes our favorite streaming device
software with its content agnostic
approach an excellent cross app search
and the company is also rolling out a
new software update for all late-model
Roku boxes and TVs with it you can
receive notifications for certain TV
shows movies and even actors and
directors become available to stream
complete with pricing information the
software update also has the ability to
connect a certain hotel and dorm Wi-Fi
networks the require web page Roku is
also improving the mobile app for iOS
and Android
adding improved casting of photos from
your phone to the TV that's a quick look
at the new Roku 4 I'm David Katz Marcos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
