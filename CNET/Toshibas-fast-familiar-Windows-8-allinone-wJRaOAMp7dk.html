gonna take a look at the Toshiba LX 8:35
all-in-one this is toshiba's new windows
8 all on PC it's a $13.99 configuration
and it's actually a pretty powerful
system for that price so the system has
kind of a nice design it is more or less
a commodity PC but I kind of like the
way the bezel swoops around here and you
have this nice little speaker setup at
the bottom it just has a nice sort of
clean look to it the screen is 23 inches
it's 19 by 10 resolution and there's
10-point touch and it works pretty much
like any other Windows 8 device out
there you might notice a little bit of
drag on the screen when you're using
it's not quite as smooth as you might
get from a smartphone or tablet
but overall a touch input works well
enough so one thing I've noticed with
Windows 8 all in ones is that they're a
little bit more expensive than their
windows 7 counterparts from a year ago
so he's using some competitors for the
system coming around 1200 1300 bucks but
at 1400 you get actually a pretty nice
speed boost over those other pcs and
that comes our way of a core i7 CPU most
of those other species have core i5s
you also get a dedicated nvidia geforce
630 m graphics chip eight gigs of memory
and a two terabyte hard drive now the
system doesn't have some higher-end
specs we might like to see at this price
range particularly a year ago where you
might get say a blu-ray drive or even a
solid-state hard drive for that price
but if you're willing to accept that we
live in a new higher priced Windows 8
world the system is pretty competitive
for what you get for the most part
though the system is pretty
straightforward it doesn't lie down flat
to work like a tabletop there's no NFC
input there's no real distinguishing
feature other than its basic PC
components that's fine though I expect
there are a lot of people out there who
don't want some of those newer extras if
you are someone who wants a touch-based
Windows 8 PC as well as a fast computer
behind it this is certainly one you
should consider how much value this is
the Toshiba LX 835 d-33 80
