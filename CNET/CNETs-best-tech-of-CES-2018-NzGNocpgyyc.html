for all the new technologies we're going
to see this year and in the future
here's what we think were the best
products at the show
Bryan Tong here at CES 2018 and right
next to me the adorable the all-new I
bow from Sony check this out 4,000 parts
there's actually 22 actuators or think
of it as motors and/or joints that are
moving to bring this i/o to life but
there you go a first look at the
adorable
eyeball I love it I gotta have it now I
am holding a product called the neo mano
this glove does something entirely
different is so cool it addresses the
lack of movement or even paralysis that
may be of someone who has suffered a
spinal column injury would have so if
you don't have full control or full
movement or even full paralysis of your
hand by wearing this glove it covers
your index finger your middle finger and
thumb and there's a titanium wires in
here and there's connected to controller
and the controller can either allow for
a grip or allow for release
I'm at CES 2018 in lg displays booth
behind me is one of the coolest things
I've ever seen this is a rollable OLED
television 65 inch TV the LG Display has
developed as a prototype to show to
other manufacturers this is not
something's coming out right now but it
is something that could be easily coming
out in the next few years
hey folks this is shot house 2 with C
net and I'm in the new 5 Pro an enhanced
version of the vive virtual reality
headset that has way better resolution
inside it's a little bit more glassy a
little bit more like I'm actually there
you turn a our choice is probably gonna
have a lot more things like the merge
six degree of freedom blaster it's fully
movable in space you can duck roll slide
around expect a lot of AR and mixed
reality with your phone in 2018 I'm here
at whirlpools booth at CES 2018 and they
have a new product that's an over the
range microwave that's
internet-connected onions it works with
Google assistant and Amazon Alexa now
this isn't any old microwave it has a
lot of capabilities beyond just heating
up your frozen pizza it has a convection
fan and a cooking element built in so
it's a little bit like having a small
oven right above your real oven
I'm here at CES getting to look inside
the biking concept cut this has their
shared experience display this is a huge
49 inch display across the front this
car is gonna go to the production 2019
I've got Cyrus from fighting here is
going to show me how it works
every year PC maker Razer provides one
of CES s big highlights by showcasing
one or more inventive concept pieces but
instead of a traditional Intel Inside PC
this is a dot for the company's own
Android power razor phone the laptop has
a large empty slot where the touchpad
would normally be and it's exactly the
right size to drop in the 5.7 inch razor
phone this might look like a Bluetooth
speaker what it actually does is it
sends power wirelessly to devices like
this this is the power spot transmitter
and it can charge up to 30 devices from
as far as 80 feet away we're about 24
meters wirelessly no mats no wires no
nothing the power spots transmit about
power cast cost $50 it'll be available
in the third quarter of this year
this is the thinnest computer ever or at
least for right now it's the Acer swift
7 the 14-inch notebook is only 8.9 8
millimeters thick technically making it
the thinnest computer in the world
there's so much more CES goodness where
that came from so make sure to check out
