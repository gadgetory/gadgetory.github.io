auto show i'm antuan goodwin and that my
friend is the 2016 mazda mx-5 miata one
of the cars i'm most interested in to
this show now we've already seen this
car debut a couple of weeks ago in
Monterey and here's what we already know
it's going to be more compact about 100
kilograms lighter it's about 220 pounds
and it's also a lot stiffer which is
gonna make it a lot more dynamic but we
didn't know up until now is what was
going to be under the hood we know in
the global market that you're going to
be looking at a 1.5 liter skyactiv-g
engine and in North America a two liter
skyactiv-g now part of the reason Mazdas
been pretty cagey about specs and
numbers is because we're expecting a
power drop for this 2016 model versus
the 2015 model that's out now the two
leaders back to G for example does about
155 horsepower in the mazda3 and that's
12 horsepower fewer than the current
mx-5 miata now we're hoping that the
reduction in weight is going to make up
for the reduction in power we're still
going to have a fun little car here now
one of the most interesting things about
this generation the Miata is in the
dashboard we've got a LCD screen and a
physical controller which means that
this generation is going to be a much
less Spartan vehicle than the previous
generations of the miata there's
actually going to be some tech hair look
to the current generation mazda3 for the
amount of app integration and
infotainment that we expect to see it's
going to be a much more broad focused
car but still keeping that sort of
enthusiasts tak will be expecting more
details about the specifics of the specs
and the power to trickle out as we
approach the 2015 launch of this the
2016 Mazda mx-5 miata I've been antuan
goodwin on the floor at the 2014 paris
auto show
