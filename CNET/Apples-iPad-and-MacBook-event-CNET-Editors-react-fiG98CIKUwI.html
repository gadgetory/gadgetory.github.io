excited by home borough for an actual
Apple event I never thought this would
happen we didn't have to go to Cupertino
we'd have to get on planes hold up
yeah well we saw some interesting stuff
I think that there if you were looking
for the answer as to whether the iPad
and Mac would ever do more things like
each other that was not answered there
there's an iPad there are two Macs they
continue to do parallel things and
they're three interesting products yeah
I mean but they've said they've said
that for a while that they really see
them as separate products you know I
think for some people the iPad could be
your computer for some people definitely
not the TV ad where the little girls
playing with her oh yeah what's a
computer so clearly they're they're
targeting it with a keyboard and
everything as a laptop replacement
yeah there's what's a computer and then
there's a computer there's also a
computer and they're all kind of in a
similar price range the iPad pro I think
doubles down on what it already did well
so it's like if you liked what it was
proposing before you're really gonna
like where it's going next which is the
the smaller bezels the the bigger screen
lighter faster processor face ID so it's
kind of like an iPad 10 or iPad X the
keyboard doesn't have a trackpad so I
merely a laptop but it's more it's all
screen it's going all in on the screen
concept yeah so no buttons nothing else
just pure screen and your fingers or
your pencil I do say
adding the thing where you take the pen
so attach it to the top and it recharges
through that well I mean if you saw over
feeling good yeah the way the Apple
pencil charged before you know it didn't
make a lot it was weird it was a hazard
but the but they weight attaches now is
much more like the surface it's much
more like and even people pointing out
that with a DoubleTap to add that extra
feature it's kind of like air pods in a
way you have this DoubleTap to assign
one function you could put another in
different apps but it's almost like a
bit like the S Pen so that evolves but
you don't get anything that pushes
beyond that is my only thing so I think
it's a really nice screen but starting
at $7.99 and up this is not a low cost
of that's 100 March I chose for the
pencil and
we won 160 170 for the keyboard in that
range for the keyboard so you're
spending up to 50 to send almost 300
more 78 9 hundredths or 1099 well over a
thousand which is 1199 which gave me a
little bit of a heart attack because the
MacBook Air was famously $9.99 that was
the Mac laptop you could actually afford
those days are over $9.99 they're still
keeping the old air valve oh and don't
get bad we're not quite sure for how
long it's the kind of thing that seems
like they're not making any like new
ones they may they'll use the stock they
have but it's certainly much more out of
date computer today than it was
yesterday and it's pretty out of date
yesterday yeah this is how you were
looking forward to for a while that
Retina display but the funny thing is it
already existed so there are display
MacBooks oh this is another iteration on
that philosophy so but it seems like the
best one it's what I want to dip down 13
inch MacBook Pro yeah well didn't when
they redesigned the Mac books you know a
couple years ago they positioned as that
that lower 13-inch is kind of the
macbook air release right but it was
yeah and it never really became that and
I think a lot of people for this we're
wondering if the air name just goes away
and I thought it would keep it yeah but
no the air name is still there even
though it basically is a MacBook Pro in
all but that name it gets rid of the
touch bar but it keeps the best part
about the touch bar which everyone loves
to hate on best part is the fingerprint
reader works great and frankly logging
in with your fingers a lot easier than
typing your password in all the time so
I think you know they get rid of the
fingerprint reader in the iPads and on
the phone they have a fingerprint reader
than the ones they are oh and don't
forget about all the different your
headphones won't work on all of your
Apple products on the Mac right
lightning on the iPhone USB c-lister see
the iPad and I don't think that there
are USB see
are there usb-c so was it though our UCC
headphones but Apple doesn't make them
as far as I know at this point but yeah
so there's a move to us PC which is
great in the sense that you can now
charge device so yeah charge an iPhone
charger guitar yeah ever that hand up
you've got that it can work with
accessories it can work with 5k displays
does not work it's storage but you could
work apparently you can use it for
certain apps as it targeted accessory
but yeah what do you do with your
headphones because I'm already carrying
three my theory for Android suffers from
OS fragmentation Apple suffers from
headphone fragmentation well and also I
still think face idea would be a really
nice thing to add to a Mac because it's
facing you it seems perfect you've to
wait for it got the camera in there yeah
got the t2 Jeff that's the next thing so
next year's max I don't know yeah maybe
what about the Mac Mini it's expensive I
use facial recognition on on Windows
laptops all the time works pretty good
actually
yeah so you could do that and then the
Mac Mini was there any awesome it's
great it's search the 790 no that's what
you want then that's what you're gonna
get you know what I mean there's like
they did except they didn't mess
anything up they didn't redo it in some
crazy way the same box yeah because
people have like rat gear that's built
around that Mac Mini shape and you have
rank attachments we can put it in with
all your other AV equipment and it's
basically it's the podcast computer you
get your whole podcasting system set up
and you run it all off on that mini I
mean that's what we do even and that's
an old Mac Mini so I think that you know
they should have called it a Mac Mini
Pro cuz that's basically what it is it's
totally pro or semi-pro that seems like
the whole proposition and I I think if
you've already got all the other
equipment like the monitor that's the
easy setup forces having to buy the iMac
which it's got on the back yes it's got
USB seaports but you know it's got its
got two regular old-fashioned USB ports
becoming very rare it's got an HDMI out
and it's got an Ethernet jack that's
something you know really
on any other max except for like an I'm
act and in some some bits on the old
MacBook here I guess we'll call it the
MacBook Air
classic or something we'll have to come
up with a new name for that and speaking
of legacy products going back to the
iPad they are keeping a lot of older
models around the ten point five inch
iPad pro much like the $9.99 Mac oh and
they're ready yeah and the mini is
sticking around the mini 4 so there are
a lot of different price tiers if you
made me want to only spend 650 to start
there's that iPad pro and you know which
one do you pick I think obviously the
new iPad pros are the best that are out
there oh yeah they're gonna get really
expensive they are but they are so
functionally and physically different
than the previous ones at least you can
say I'm getting something that looks new
and has new features and does different
things whereas in the case of the Mac
Mini it looks the same so it's a little
bit of a tougher sell unless you really
know what you're looking for spec wise
and and even in the new MacBook Air it's
not really a different design than the
MacBook Pros or the 12-inch MacBook it's
just becomes part of that family so
there's nothing really groundbreaking
about it even adding the fingerprint
reader is something they took off
another device and put on there that
said it answers most of what people said
they wanted from a new MacBook Air so so
good on that front but that $11.99 hurts
it hurts
$10.99 I could see obviously 999 be
perfect cuz that's the student computer
that everyone can save for for a couple
months and then afford and use for years
it's still the iPad pro is the one that
they could say is the most affordable of
the computer things and I feel like but
that becomes a bit of a you know get
your foot in the door and suddenly
you're spending up and what does this
show that again $7.99 okay like the same
is the Mac Mini yeah yeah so it's 75
yeah
saved as the Mac Mini but it's 64 gigs
so you really want to get more storage
on the storage I mean also climbs up to
a terabyte which costs that the pricing
on same I think look at those
configurations my name is getting close
to like 3000 when you put in the case
and the punch
well past $2,000 I would get the Apple
care for that something yeah it's a
$3,000 iPad pro I would give you yeah
that's a little high sport for the Apple
app and it's a shame the USBC cannot be
used for external storage not that we
even thought that it would are you
cannot use it for external storage you
know that's why I always you know what
computer operating systems have their
advantage over mobile operating systems
and that you get some more flexibility
for stuff like that you totally do
I mean I think that to me like the most
clear go-to product of all of these
three would be the air for the for the
everyday person the one that you say oh
that's the thing I've been waiting
people are waiting for the mainstream
laptop it's the mainstream tablet laptop
it's a little it's a little too
expensive it does have one cool it just
have one cool feature that hopefully we
got to have to play around with which is
you can take now you could do this with
the pro since like the summer but now
for this new air you can take an
external GPU box that has usually a
Nambe graphics card intim third party
companies may come at Apple approves
them and you plugged it in via USB C and
you get an external you know a graphics
card a real super high-powered graphics
card so you can do crazy video editing
you can do all kinds of rendering and
you can frankly play games if you're
that one hardcore mat gamer
on your new MacBook Air and then just
unplug it from the GPU take it go away
all right they've given off the they
give off the high side and the wind is
picking up on this chilly fall day here
in the borough of Brooklyn football
tailgating weather out here my toes are
freezing I'm spontaneously crying from
the wind but maybe we'll be back in
another one of these in New York at some
point I think every year this should be
the new this should be the new default
location Travel events right here in New
York City in Brooklyn
thank you Scott side Thank You Shara
Tipton and one in New Jersey okay and
one in New Jersey okay bye okay bye you
