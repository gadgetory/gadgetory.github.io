everyone is talking about this week it's
the sorest of sore losers a biblical
epic about a CEO and interspecies
adorableness but first it's the gadget
of the week the gadget of the week is
the kyocera echo it aims to answer the
question how do I choose between a
touchscreen smartphone and a tablet oh I
know put two three and a half inch touch
screens on a smartphone let people fold
them and attach them and then put the
phone in tablet mode voila problem
solved kinda like so many gimmicky
gadgets though once you get past the
tablet mode part there's not a ton of
there there the phone is running android
2.2 with kind of middling specs a 5
megapixel camera a single core 1
gigahertz Snapdragon processor and this
is the bad part no 4G even though the
big double screens pretty much scream
streaming video but hey good little
multitasker right and don't worry it
comes with a spare battery and now for
the news the Winklevoss brothers tyler
and cameron continued to lose to
facebook this week the 9th US Circuit
Court of Appeals ruled that the winkle
vie or as I call them the Y nervous
twins cannot overturn a settlement
agreement they signed with Facebook that
gives them 20 million dollars in cash
and partial ownership of Facebook the
whiner bosses wanted out of the deal
because they said they didn't understand
what they were signing when they signed
it as sober adults and they didn't know
that Facebook was going to be worth as
much as it is now in the ruling even the
judge said hey guys like at some point
you just gotta stop suing the whiner
bosses however said they do plan to
appeal the appeal guys can I see you
over here for a second come here listen
guys I understand believe me it sucks to
get dumped and it sucks even more to
watch the guy who dumped you become the
prom king and when the football
championship and be named times man of
the year and meanwhile you didn't even
win the Olympics ouch you know but see

anger is just not good for you and also

might not launch until September or even
early 2012 and there won't be an ipad 3
in 2011 at all dude what are people
going to get in line for cheap gas

twenty-five dollars cheaper and it will
include what amazon refers to as special
offers uh-huh like it was the best of
times it was coca-cola times for a
measly 25 dollar discount yeah you know

almost six hundred million dollars that
