hey good morning everybody and welcome
to the 359 podcast
it is episode 439 and I'm BVG the rude
crude bag of P food - doot and here you
host Joan Roger and Scott Stein here to
talk about something that's making a big
splash that's right
morning everyone we've got special guest
Scott Stein special agent Scott special
agent backups his mission in Florida
drive hard it was to not tweet from from
the airport and in Florida and he's got
on there who's got some special
intelligence for us all talking about
his impressions from the new magic leap
one aar headset which how much does it
cost is pretty pricey 2295 not for
normal human beings like us no no no for
22 bucks it's about the price of a
discount PlayStation 4 game yeah so as
always we'll just be focusing on magic
leap and so if you have any questions
for Scott I know you don't have
questions for us because we don't know
anything leave them in the comments
section Brian will get them is a lot to
say about alright so as always leave
your questions in the comment section
Brian will pick out the best and we'll
get them in 3 minutes and 59 seconds
from 3 - welcome to the 259 I'm Roger
Cheng I'm Joanie Sussman and with us is
special guest Scott Stein who recently
had the opportunity to try out the
magically one yeah got thanks for
joining us oh thanks
can you share your impressions is this
the big you know game-changer an AR that
we've been waiting for no it's not the
big game-changer rabbit we're done we're
done um well you know magic we've had a
lot of promises and I was and I've seen
a lot of vrn AR and you want it to make
a magic leap to another world and if you
tried microsoft hololens odds are you
haven't it's been out for a couple of
years that unlike VR is trying to
project things into the real world and I
think magic leap has made steps they're
using light-filled technology which is
supposed to provide it does provide a
crisper I think higher graphics feel but
it still feels
like a glowing almost ghostly type of
thing like apparitions which do feel
sometimes quite compelling but the
limited field of view is still there
it's very it's really like a squared off
area so it means like you're looking
through a window mmm that breaks the
illusion and the controller and you know
it's not perfect and the head doesn't
work with my glasses hasn't very
specified fit that plus it's 2295 $2295
that is aimed at developers and they
very clearly say that so I think this is
like early days kind of like the years
before oculus even had a VR headset that
was for the show you shouldn't be
waiting in line for the magic leave one
no and it's only available in six cities
so you probably can't even win a line
for it so it's gonna be white glove
delivery in those six cities because you
have to get a special fit and and if
you're if you have glasses or
prescription lenses with mine you
couldn't even get that Wow okay so I
mean look you tried out a number of
demos while you were there well you know
what impressed you the most um what a
Presley the most were the small things
and I think magically we talked about
this too that they want to have little
little details I remember a floating
robot where the smoke trails coming out
of the robot really looked nice and
wispy there was a one cigarette as a
musical a our experience called ten Andy
was that the most highly produced it
feels kinda selling you see the Museum
of Natural History almost like where
you're touching things and making
musical tones happen but I thought that
the the undersea creature II things look
good there were particles in the air
that I could move around in my video I
sound like I'm tripping out talking it's
but it was those elements that actually
felt very nice but anytime you're trying
to really layer something on top of the
real world like at one point the gun the
controllers holding became partially a
virtual Raygun you can still see a bit
of the seam there and so we're not at
the point where it feels
indistinguishable but I think that
there's more potential but it feels more
like a building block to try to begin
just begin to explore what this can do
and you didn't even get to see all of
the panoply of things that they said
that you'd be able to have like they
have so many other partners that you
didn't even get to see anything produced
by those Pino I mean I saw about like
over half an hour demos but it was a
very
run down I mean I got to see their the
painting app which was like a you know
cut if you've done the VR tools like
tilt brush it's it's not as good as that
but you can paint in the air
I tried MBAs just brief preview of
showing a floating screen of highlights
and then a slam dunk and it was like a
video game character very basic stuff
New York Times and Wayfair had apps but
you can get those things on phones and
then yeah this this is the shooting gun
game that was made by wetter workshop
which was cool but more like a more
advanced version of what microsoft
hololens has been showing for years and
you bring that up I mean what how does
hololens compare hololens obviously been
out for years now how does this
experience compared to magically but i
think it's i think magic leap is
definitely better but hololens has
distinct advantages you can wear it with
glasses it's all self-contained in the
headset and that's a two year old device
so you know I'm sure Microsoft is
working they said they're working on a
next version of that too and there are
many more players in the landscape all
right so I mean bottom line what will be
your final thoughts on what magic leap
one magic leap one probably a really
good step for a developer who has the
money to explore this but you have to
realize that there gonna be other
players in this space that are probably
gonna come out of the woodwork sooner or
later that are also gonna offer things
so I think magic leap is very intriguing
but they have their work cut out for
them all right there you go for more on
these stories chicken sounds CNET I'm
Roger Cheng I'm Jody salzman I'm Scott
Steiner sitting
all right thanks everybody for joining
us for the recording of the audio
podcast and as we watch the chat flood
with fantastic questions for Scott I'm
gonna try to start organizing these but
anything that pops in your head about
any of the topics ie magic leave one
feel free to filter them through yeah
we'll relay them to Scott and he'll
he'll answer in briones divisibility
bring them all what was like you
mentioned at the some point in your view
mentioned how they give you this like
moment where there was like a giant
dinosaur made out of flowers yes what
that was really like okay you're seeing
it yeah thank you that was so that
actually was probably the best demo and
it was outside of the demo room it was a
closed office right it was it's like
after the demo Connie and I got demos of
some things
Connie's energy pad seen it Connie's our
boss so yeah really nice she made a
really smart comment about something
what happened so then they said to me Oh
Scott um
come with us we actually want to show
you something Roni wants to show you
something and so I was like what's this
it's like I walk down the hallways like
immersive theater I walk down the hall
and then like I'm back at his office
which was a shame we couldn't shoot some
of that stuff because their building is
beautiful um it's it's so cool and it
said a lot of the expectations his
office is a collapse office glass-walled
in the middle of things lots of toys on
the shelves and so we've been talking
there for about an hour before and he
brought us back there and he said here
put on the magic leave I just want you
to look out the window and apparently
they had this idea day before and it was
smart so I looked out the window of his
office and they're floating in the
hallway was this dinosaurs like this
neon you know look like a toy building
block kind of sculpture a dinosaur yeah
but it was smart because what they were
really trying to demonstrate was that
because of that limited field of view
and the same thing with hololens is they
because what they're saying is that you
can't see stuff in the peripheral but
technically if you're looking through
that window at
your Disney ghosts you know they could
go all the way further back so like you
know 30 feet away much like the Mel
Channing thing in Times Square so
recently floating things in the sky
could look bigger than something up
close yeah I imagine things that are
further away are actually more effective
right the illusions are the better they
can be if they can be placed well and
right overlap with things so that's what
he was showing was that if you put
something further away in a fixed fixed
spot mm-hmm sure it looked like a big
thing and then he actually not just that
he then went out in the hallway there
was that in a space station and then
they wanted to show how bright the
display was he walked behind it and was
waving and then they said did you Sam
Miller I believe was saying did you see
Roni now I could if I really tried I
could see him there but if I wasn't
looking for him so it it obscured him
pretty well the light in the hallway was
like a little more dim so it's hard to
say what that would be like in bright
light but I think what it showed was
that I think if you're looking through
like looking at us at a space at a glass
box in an area where you want to project
AR could create a cool illusion like a
hologram right um but in the real world
of lots of chaotic things right it's
better for like not very many people
live in glass rooms no yeah I think
through a tank into a hallway it's you
know maybe for a performance or a theme
park er right I made me think of that
actually just totally random reference I
just saw a theater piece in New York
which is great symphonie fantastique
basil twist you should that's available
call I should go see that about ticket
to that last you did you just get paid
like no turn doors before me a ticket to
that that was just I saw 20 years ago
though exactly I love when it's like
just something I did on my own that I
can then support in Ardis and say but no
I
the reason it's cool is that that puppet
show is in a thousand gallon aquarium
mm-hmm and it's performed to live music
but it looks like you're looking into
another world right and that's kind of
what I think magically would be best
used for so let me I can look into a
window let me ask about the because I'm
looking at the the footage of you
wearing this thing and one of the pet
peeves for VR stuff for me is it gets
annoying to have all that gear in your
head and wearing these dope backpacks
what was it like wearing all that gear
on you because there's it's not just the
headset there's there's an attachment
your pop yeah yeah it's weird it's weird
the headset is surprisingly comfortable
I think Connie and I both thought that
we were like the way it rides high up on
the back here it is surprising because
it doesn't look comfortable though it
looks weird and it angles down so it's
like you're it's like this with my
glasses it's like I'm doing right and I
think that maybe you could help with
light I don't know but outside light
coming in but it felt fine it was well
well weighted and and comfortable but
you had to specifically set it up just
right with the right nose pieces and I
they were setting up the right fit oh
wow and again doesn't work with glasses
and the clip-on pack the the big cord
once in a while dangled in front of me
and they were sure to dangle it behind
me so I was a bit of tether thing okay
back that weird clip-on pack if you see
it it's it's like a like a snack pack
clip it's like a almost like a it's not
just a discman but it's like a u-shaped
clip so you put it in your pocket and
the rest is meant to sit outside and
invents heat so you're as opposed to
like cover it because who knows well
yeah yeah and that was that was odd it
was like a fanny pack and there was a
shoulder strap alternative that you
could do uh it's not there it is
yeah you can see it I mean it's not that
much my god it does look like a Walkman
yeah yeah it's a Walkman chip clip look
a really small disc man um
compared to the world of VR for PCs it's
not bad there are there are things in VR
called was a nukes and Intel makes
achill little little self-contained pcs
oh yeah yeah yeah better that you could
power VR off of and I kind of feel like
there are some mobile VR headsets that
LG have one where you plug it into your
phone yes yes yeah that happened for one
generation phones that just failed
completely yes and there's a new
standard in VR for like one USB C
connection to everything mm-hmm I think
plug-in displays and into devices make
sense I mean I feel like more companies
are gonna start doing that I feel like
that's why it like Apple hasn't really
gone in this because I think everyone's
kind of waiting for that point where
seems Teddy would do then you know tech
miniaturize is where you can get it all
into the headset I think that's all
that's what everyone's waiting for right
like I guess so but everything else
seems just too clunky to me
I think although if it was like one
simple cable it wouldn't be terrible
because it would be kind of like the
equivalent of headphones like its yeah
yeah basically it's not the cable it's
the the clunky pack that you gotta wear
around to that kind of it's not it's not
bad I so I saw some comments too about
like whether this is really just like
the prototype of like the smartphone
before the iPhone or whatever you know
that I think that's definitely true I
think we're probably gonna look at the
prototype of what this all is and it
probably is mapping out the hardware
relationship of like what people will
finesse later you know some device you
have that's always on you that's gonna
power stuff some thing that's hopefully
not annoying alright and but it's again
I think it's better the hard thing to
say is well it didn't Wow me I think
it's better than any other air headset
but of course name another good AR
headset no not really any it's it's a
very small list and a very problematic
list so yeah alright Brian do we have
any questions uh yeah let's go ahead and
start fueling things from the chat here
first and foremost I want to say welcome
to Peter Pan's playground a new listener
from the Philippines shout out
especially considering my random open
one liner today was from the movie hook
Joel GJ wants Super Smash Brothers news
sorry man you gotta wake up wait till I
am and Joel GJ also wants to know more
how the field of view was you got to
touch on that already and while you're
at it
I think syringe I wanted to know how the
fit was so how was it expand more you're
talking about how it fits kind of high
on the head which I agree it looks weird
oh by the way I'm uncomfortable with you
not wearing glasses so don't do any more
videos to put it back on I'm gonna
battle you without beer and I'm like
David Lynch in transformations exactly
that's all so yeah
kids I am wearing the same shirt that
was in the magically video on purpose so
I just want to say that yeah gosh my
question for you I think the first thing
I asked you is how's the field of view
because that's like so crucial - yeah
Scott will you go ahead and compare
contrast field of view and comfort and
fit how it fits specifically like on the
bridge of the nose yeah those are some
of the specific questions coming through
compared to you know hololens - HTC vive
- playstation to any of the others here
we go to the best of my ability this is
so tough um I wish when I tried eight
vive pro back at CES I got to swap back
in fortune of vibe pro and of regular
vibe yeah and I kept doing that to be
like do I really see the difference and
I didn't really see much I wish I had a
hololens in my pocket that I could have
like gone back and forth with a magical
I live in a really big pocket yeah just
saying I already had that yeah this
thing in there bulky so um know what it
is versus hololens if you care about
that
I'd say it's close enough that you
wouldn't notice it just reminded me I
just saw holland's a few weeks ago it
it's very similar to that versus VR it's
a very different experience for two
reasons one it is definitely a smaller
field of view so again the best
equivalent I could give is like if I was
holding something this size right here
that's kind of what I was looking at and
yeah so kind of like that so it was like
enough to kind of see yeah here's my
little magic world but also to realize
like oh wait where to go it's not here
because I can see the rest of my room
mom so it's smaller because the field of
view I think that it's like a 40 by 30
by they may be the degrees and and in VR
it's like a hundred degree or you know
in that zone field of view so VR is
definitely bigger but the second thing
is that it's also that you can see the
whole world we now AR yeah so now you
know your peripheral vision is amazing
and does all sorts of interesting things
and like I'm aware of all that and how
does that relate
to virtual things that's strange VR your
scuba masking yourself and that's
actually like a good way to deal with
the illusion because since you already
kind of thinking with the feel that your
parents scuba mask you kind of forgive
it and it's like magic binoculars and be
like so there's that too so that's the
answer there for fit again it felt it
felt I don't remember having it on my
face which is a nice thing it rode high
above the band came like all the way up
here it was a stretchable band so like
the back segments kind of extended to
kind of know like segments so it kind of
like I think and maybe had elastic in
there but it was like a just other way
the car segments your hard segments that
kind of like pulled apart gently so you
could like pull and then have it snap
back to kind of well is that comfortable
I feel like that that's gonna pressure
head after a while I was okay it felt
fine and it's padded as you can see
there so it was like actually hard to
see what the bat sorry the back was
padded okay um the front part they were
doing a lot of nosepiece adjustments
that I didn't see they asked my
prescription beforehand before the trip
and Hani's Connie they gave prescription
lenses to she couldn't wear glasses mine
they said sorry we don't have
prescription lenses for your - 8.5 8.7
yeah so I'm it's good I'm like the
breaker I'm like fear me when I come to
these demos this curve Scott I broke the
curve so I got I luckily had just gotten
a before this trip had gone temporary
contact lenses so tried to do for Google
glass back in 2013 I was like good
that's not spacious yes exactly
memories if that's the last I made to do
this was Google glass but yeah it was
it's uncomfortable I don't like not
wearing glasses and and also like
changed my vision a little bit and I was
trying to say that in the piece so that
it's like the world seems bigger when I
don't wear glasses everything is a
little shrunken a little cooked bodily
with these so and also to have the same
type of focus like yeah yeah a weird
amazing microscope the reason I'm saying
that is because
I like to come in with like all my
normal vision and it sucks to analyze
something we're all ready my vision is
like a little different but I got I wore
the contacts for for a whole day before
going in so it wasn't like I just
swapped them in there okay but yeah how
did it feel yeah it felt um but but the
field the headset was good and the
visuals seemed seemed better again
better than hololens was it was the feel
better than hall ones as well cuz
Hollins is it feels a little bulky in
your head yeah I think it feels better
than hololens um hololens feels like it
makes it on your head like on a
technicality yeah it's kind of like just
yeah precarious moment just well I feel
like I could wear but that work with my
glasses which was nice but I feel like I
would try hololens for like 10 minutes
and be done you could see magically
being worn for like I honestly could
wear it maybe for like half an hour or
so like I feel like it wouldn't be
annoying to do that they claim it has
about three hour battery life and
roughly like an attendance which level
battery life we'll see how that actually
can imagine when one who seems for more
than an hour I mean I can't either
yeah is I think it would tie I did fine
after a while that my eyes were sounds
weird my eyes were burning a bit now
breaking your door certified I know no I
don't know that just from looking it a
lot and wearing contacts I don't think
there's so many variables um I dunno
looking at VR a lot sometimes I'll have
that if I'm wearing yeah like an hour
demo I don't know if it's the attention
I don't know if it's having displays
near you all just your eyes having to
use them so yeah it's like yeah I think
it's just fatigue yeah yeah so it wasn't
like a literal my eyes are on fire
Bernie but it was like this feeling of
like probably like staring at a monitor
for a while right yeah you know like
this feeling well staring at monitor
like that's an inch away from me right
yeah yeah it's a weird relationship you
have to the glowing stuff now so hope
that says something as far as headset
I'm gonna say one other small thing I
know one asked me this but I'll bring it
up it's not the first time I've seen
light field tech either so there are
things that reminded me most of and and
the two things most were like from a
company hold avec on mm-hmm
ah on I looked at this
thing called the glyph which went on
sale a while ago which was his retinal
projection headset it was really just
for watching movies but it apparently
shot you know the the beams into your
eyes that sounds not comfortable yes
yeah a little dlp projector almost like
it was like that projected into your
eyeball yeah yeah so I will say sure I
remember when I first saw that
everything had like a gleaming really
vivid look like I remember looking like
an aquatic scene and going like oh it
just looks really very nice and vivid
and bright I wasn't as aware of the
pixels no when you walked away from that
demo like was the like the fish still
like burned in your eyes yeah yeah but
um magically if I would say they're
right that the gleaming less pixel aware
feeling using it was definitely the case
oh nice Brian got the footage and there
we go the the gleaming feel of magic
leaps display was oh my god I forgot it
geez Wow oh nice hair Scott this is
awesome um felt like that I also got to
see something else magically pacy you
creepy yeah I also got see something
else
avocados me last year at their
headquarters which I only wrote about
very briefly but I should probably
rewrite as a story on they had a
prototype light field headset a few
couplets got to write about it verge
wire to think some people and when I
looked at that it actually gave me a
heads up preparation for magically
because in a similar way it had
something that was kind of glowing and
projected except they showed multiple
depths like I could focus on something
farther away and closer magic leap says
that you can do that but I didn't
actually see any examples of that in the
demos right we got to get some more
question yeah sorry about that long
digression it happens it happens so
people are talking about you know if and
when the day comes we can fit its
technology into standard eyeglasses or
furthermore contact lenses APEC says
it's odd that they had to give you
prescriptions for the lenses to allow
you to see through it they do they do
this for all the developers and then are
they going to do it
consumers when the day comes super good
question and I have no freaking idea and
I would doubt it come on that's well I
said they need their own like health
care division for I care
well no oculis doc you let's go that 200
ollar headset has prescription lenses
that they do with a provider you got to
pay extra for it yeah you pay extra but
it's not like you don't need a
healthcare division you just give the
prescription and then they just provide
them and so it doesn't need any like
accredited you know accreditation or
anything so in that sense it was much
like that except akio's go you can wear
with glasses it's just an alternative to
to doing that it's a I think it's a big
problem I was not clear since I didn't
buy one yet
well how you get the lenses and maybe
that's why right now ocula magically is
only being delivered via this White
Glove service so it's like this special
concierge delivery I think because they
from what I understand is to make sure
the fits right maybe it's to make sure
there are lenses make sure I can fit on
your face properly does that mean if you
buy one of these things and they throw
customized eyes well we customize a
fiddle before you how does it only means
it's good for like that one person well
that's yeah so that's the other thing is
that what happens if someone else wants
to try the hell happens then so that all
remains undetermined and is a huge
problem not just for using this in the
home but also using this in any
installation so I was thinking oh this
would be cool in a theme park but how if
it doesn't work with glasses right now
this is something that Roni a bovitz and
that team definitely said that they are
working actively towards working without
glasses and with a wider field of view I
don't think they're thrilled at all with
that part of the proposition that
they've been making with the factory
that they have on site which is which is
making the let that photonic chip which
is that lens element they said is the
custom part of the they're also working
to they were saying they're working to
and I've saw some of the facilities but
you didn't get to hang around there to
prototype and work on building new
versions so that supposedly there's many
faster turnaround between iterations to
try to get out a next version faster
than would normally be possible they do
seem intent on every positioning of this
pitch and I caught a push because like
how long am I really there at the
factory right what am I you know I'm not
a factory expert but will they get to
that next version it definitely they
hinted about magically two and three
literally rhodium if it's literally
showed me a cloth covered thing on a
table which I think was also done for
Branca shiny half a year ago saying we
have magically to a magic leap three
under here we're only showing them to
investors let's see so powerfully but I
mean like what it what a tease and like
that was the part it was great to talk
to them and I thought really a lot of
like very interesting thoughts that part
was like I was kind of like come on like
what's going on here right but um I
think they're very intent on trying to
get to the next level I think this is
very much a prototype so that's that's a
very good question and I don't know
and yet it's a huge problem it's
probably why it's just one more thing
that is not great about wearing headsets
in a world where it's already hard to
get people to where we are yeah yeah
totally
hey Roger you got a cut out don't you uh
no we can keep going it's fine okay I
wanted to ask is that was gonna at least
ask Scott to stick around because yeah
there are so many good questions let's
try to slam through I'm here for as long
as we need to
oh yeah tomorrow all right Sam Scott
Stein okay life improvement would this
be a better experience if there was a
full face helmet with a wider field of
view uh and yeah ooh good to hear from
you haven't heard from you in a while
how good is the brightness did you see
anything that has text on it was the
clarity they know good question very
good question yes so I did see text I
saw some web browser shopping stuff
Wayfarer who makes a furniture shopping
they had an AR app actually talked to
one of the executives on the phone but
not much to say
the yeah so it looked like a wet and
also the NBA app sort of had like some
interface that showed that scores and
stats and sworn stat yeah
it looked good it looked good look I
didn't think about it which was the
greatest thing like basically like
that's my sign yeah um that however I
keep comparing against phone AR and I
think well so much that you can already
do now especially with like furniture
apps so I think it's really tough to say
but it accomplished that it accomplished
it brightness wise it did look nice and
bright and vivid and I think the roni
demo with the dinosaur in the hallway
was the best demo of that everything
every room I was in I wouldn't say the
rooms were dim but I would say they were
like not but bright I know that their
sensitivity I think there was even
something that they had said earlier in
the year about not being able to use
this outdoors right which is a common
thing my experience with hololens
outdoors a couple of weeks ago was a
great example of the limitations of this
stuff and I think magically people be in
a similar boat yeah I think this is
definitely meant for indoor use and it's
meant for those instances so I feel like
if you work outside you'd be mugged
almost instantly just because like you
look that ridiculous like they are ass
but maybe the heads-up display where it
looks like the illuminator or something
would like to turn so you could fight
off the assailant oh that's true you
could stand any two naked cowboy perfect
naked cowboy sweating element be an
eyewear guy yeah super tall statue of
liberty and it was strange I'm an a
terrible Optimus Prime yeah we have a
full face I do the initial question oh
yeah yeah wider field of view would
super help I would love but would more
comfortable or less comfortable I feel
like how much of a how many thing would
you get um I think they know it needs to
be wider field of view it's clearly
they're up against limitations that
they're trying to get to and maybe it is
about size of the hardware you know and
power who knows what or maybe it's about
projecting more stuff on your eyeball
right you know I don't know I don't know
I mean our eyes work in weird ways VR
companies it's it's always impressive to
me when I started hearing like the
further details and I tracking even
things like fovea rendering
this crazy thing like you know
emphasizing that the center of your eye
can see in higher detail right the fovea
and the rest of it can't see in that
much detail so like if you have the
reason I bring that up is if you have a
whole field of augmented stuff right
technically the stuff that's over in the
corner you're not gonna see in the same
level of detail so yeah so why does it
have to yeah if you don't even like a
live rendered perfectly yeah I don't
know well that's where the eye tracking
comes in oh yeah gaze tracking on this
headset so but that's not again they
didn't show examples of like what back
so surprisingly that stuff was not gone
into detail maybe it's not fully ready
to show what it can do I don't know but
I thought that would be showing off a
bit more um I think wider field of view
controller my Mansion controller like
because I think controls are a huge part
of this with their hands like hololens
right they did make a controller which
is like what the ones you would get on
mobile VR headsets but more advanced
it's actually more like the the desktop
VR like the way that it can its called
six degree of freedom tracking so a
camera positioning allows it to put it
perfectly in space which is important so
like if you have a virtual Lego table it
means it will track and map right if you
have a mobile VR headset like oculus
gear VR oculus go gear VR daydream those
are like a Wii Remote yeah yeah motion
controls but the difference is if you
notice it doesn't have perfect tracking
so what that means is that the
difference there is like if you had a
virtual world and you did this it
wouldn't like perfectly map hmm so just
kind of gets how does it track the
controllers their camera like built-in
the eyewear yeah cameras built into that
were outward facing outward face okay so
yeah a whole array of them and the
controller also it's kind of like I
think a bit like Microsoft's VR
controllers for their headset has inside
out tracking it's called so it's a
combination of like it knows where the
controller is in space but also can
continue to map it a little bit when I
find your back with its sensors so but I
want two controllers not one right and
the trigger basic stuff is fine but
didn't really have great vibration
feedback it didn't make me really feel
like I was grabbing things so
it was it was better than nothing and
felt fine but I feel like it was kind of
a little more basic than I would want
okay I'll be in the chat asks my doctor
suggested to me to keep any visual
devices about 20 centimeters away from
my eyes would this be safe for me ooh
really good question that's got to be
less than 20 centimeters just eyeballing
that yeah no pun intended
particular way way particularly for for
every person or was this only for him
for them this is a specific then they
they have either an eye sensitivity or
something their doctor is recommending
yeah I don't I wouldn't do it yeah
when try it because also I don't even
really know what this display tech is
all about it's it's still a bit of a
mystery zone I'd say the way better than
the laser shooting in your eyes is yeah
it's not lasers but it might be like
fiber-optic projection or who knows what
like it's basically you know they
present it like as a bunch of MS a
little more mystical secret sauce like
they they tried to explain
scientifically how it mixes analog and
digital and replicates the light field
that are I being dry Malkovich like so
like like Ghostbusters jargon yeah it
felt like a Charlie Kaufman film like
you're like what and then you bring out
the neutrino wand and then the proton
accelerator there were a lot of
mysterious and leaves a nuclear
accelerator strapped to your back there
are mysterious images of eyeballs then I
shrunk down and entered the magic
facility no it doesn't want um realm
with Ant Man yeah exactly so I didn't
the bottom line is unlike saying OLED I
don't even really know what we can say
yet about this display tech and what it
does so it is the very definition of
prototype II so I would die I would yeah
APEC asks what about sound did you have
speakers are there speakers are there
headphones a sound part of it as a
package yeah no and would it be better
if it was no that's a great question one
of the things I did a really good job on
I think was sound although I think you'd
be able to hear it around you like it
had a lot of it wasn't contained in just
you what it used were built-in speakers
that projected like spatial sound very
similar to what oculus go does in its
headset
so it's nice to not wear headphones I
think that the audio did Sam sound very
loud and clear to anyone else in the
room yeah so it's not like a personal
thing like new everyone can actually
know your experience they can't see it
but they can they can hear it and you
you can plug in headphones as well okay
now I was lucky because recently I also
got to try I'm trying to catch up on a
lot of this tech to compare I got to try
the Bose AR oh yeah yeah yeah the
glasses yeah yeah I just tried them out
recently downtown and I'm really glad I
did because they sound great and I know
they should sound great yeah they're
both exactly the shara I think saw them
at South by Southwest yep it sound great
and they were demonstrating that they
had very little sound leak like they
just sounded like the leak from a you
know a slightly noisier pair of
headphones so they're all onto something
about speaker about headphone 'less
stuff but I don't think magic leap is
acing it with the with the with the
finesse of that technology like I would
like to see boat basically but you know
bosz which is what they're working on it
so everybody called AR you know but i
think that i want to see the next
generations of what that audio can did
you want to see magic leap work with
those sure um but I feel like the Bose
is gonna have other yeah yeah yeah it's
the great Wacky Races of they are I'm
calling I mean weird idea of having both
paying bows against magically if those
are like two companies are like couldn't
further be a part right like it's
baffling and crazy but to get into one
note on that and I was kind of tweeting
about this before and I'm reading about
AR there was a is an air researcher
Helen Papa John us who had written a
book about about AR and all of the
different facets of AR and I started
thinking about it and thinking this is a
very large landscape and I think it's a
lot larger than VR and I think it's a
lot weirder and it's a lot more tangled
in the sense that I'm not sure it's all
about headsets and I'm right I mean heck
Tim Cook and and and I mean Google
already feeling that way you know
there's there's phones in AR so yeah but
not just that but there's um haptics
there's audio like Bose a lot of audio
based hero stuff and I would even count
like smartwatches assistive tech maybe
Alexa like what does it mean to enhance
your world and give feedback the point
is like there's a whole interconnected
universe of ambient tech I guess they
call it like ambient technology the
reason I'm saying that is like AR is
trying to tap in a part of that but I
don't think there's a lot of pieces to
this puzzle and I'm not sure it's all
just gonna be about nailing a headset so
I feel like I'm less convinced that
we've hit the right forum for AR versus
I think VR will be about a headset
because it's kind of the whole idea is
to shutter you even give ya another
world that's your deeper thought for
this Q&amp;amp;A but that's Scott Stein it's
important but I think it's important is
I think I got the ceiling of saying like
oh really
are we really gonna nail the super AR
glasses or will it be something else
we'll be smiling okay we are really
needing to wind down to let's slam
through to see more of the more in
question is this heads-up display going
to be kind of like for everyday use web
browsing advertisements Google searches
or is it really still more catered
towards the developer side of things and
that's from storm King oh I love storm
King Art Center so if that's related to
that awesome the the heads-up stuff yes
it's really for developers they kept
saying over and over again we want to
see what developers can do why see what
developers can do I think and this goes
back to the so what I just said was
super important because you need the
rest of the world to be aware and
connected in some way for things to pop
up and work
I mean sure AR can recognize objects and
do that but it's really helpful when
objects know that they need to be
recognized or displays are ready for
that or we're talking about a whole
interconnected world that needs to be
ready to dovetail you know what
storefront is gonna work with AR where
you get your magical AR person how is it
going to overlap with people exiting the
gap and like you know the world needs to
be ready for it and so that that is a
big other part of this since you can see
the real world where the heck is that
gonna land although I do think that no
one's really that I'm most likely gonna
sort of draft off of what Apple and
Google are doing right that's like Apple
may are available on their iPhones is
what's gonna have people thinking about
how to implement this stuff because I
think I'm right it's kind of weird like
how they're gonna execute whatever AR
ads or whatever special effects coming
out of a Gap store front that's I think
that the developer is working on an
apple solution will likely be the ones
that like crack that codes magically but
still fairly niche right yeah and magic
leap has a lot of partners that they're
working with and a lot of interested
entities and entertainment so they are
very interesting I feel like they have
many more shoes possibly that are
dropping or that they want to have drop
so but but yeah I think that they're all
kind of looking to each other
I think these solutions have not been
solved for yet and there's definitely no
killer app or anything there's no killer
app and right now unlike VR it's all got
to be somewhere so like every our demo
is kind of in this like you know empty
living room the special the magic a our
living room which like you probably
don't have and is full your own mind is
full of crap so like the real world it
has to live in a real world and what
real world is that it goes back to that
like are we gonna have a are safe spaces
and like how are people going to deal
with each other's AR I remember like
Jaron Lanier was talking about this too
and we we had him on the talk about like
the VR and AR in the future it's like
they're gonna be like a are parks like
there's dog parks right this is in a RC
me and they're all added and my airtight
[Laughter]
is that a dream kind of like that
Jetsons type utopia where everyone's
just got this little unit almost like a
G or T like Star Trek the visor visor
every piece of information they need
like we see a little bit from the last
Google i/o how the maps are starting to
incorporate directions and
advertisements and pop up they are well
I mean that's what Google ones is right
like basically the idea of putting
google lens into glasses that are nice
and thin yeah that's sort of the dream
for AR and I love that Google Maps idea
like levers talking
you know the arrow point yeah I mean
them and the magic Fox okay they're
trying to they're actively solving for
some of them which is incredibly useful
in New York when you get out of the
subway and you're just like turning
around which ways
uptown downtown is the Fox yeah the Fox
will tell you exactly who strangely
serene AIPAC had a really fascinating
idea about maybe partnering up with lyft
or uber and starting to make HUD display
windshields yeah maybe starting it out
at the the dry car service type level
and then working in a its way into
consumer because that would be awesome I
would love it if I didn't have to look
at a map Oh find where the heck you're
cool or dangerous I feel like more
heads-up displays for drivers as I am
not necessarily the best solution I mean
I finally ideally they'd replace
traditional street signs but I mean
that's nowhere near that but wouldn't
that be kind of cool like I mean how
well I think regular street signs like
the one percent gets to get where
they're going and everybody else's oh
yeah there's no there's no levels
Monica move cost-effectiveness to this
but I would love a world where I didn't
have to look over here to get my
directions I keep my line my line of
sight on the road so wasn't handling me
wanna signs but it would just be like in
your field of vision like directions
would pop up exactly yeah 101 of the
coolest things I don't even know if I
got to mention it that much in my hands
on but I thought this is an interesting
thing that magically did that I had not
seen before is they have a their OS
lumen OS allows multiple things to be
open at once hmm and I mentioned that a
little bit that so technically you could
like have one screen or browser open
over here and then another like MBA
thing over here that oh my gosh yeah I
know because if our attention span
wasn't sure enough like well it was kind
of cool you che in a few yeah that's
true but in the future we're like you
have some ability to tap into this you
could place things around a space to be
available for you when you need them or
create multiple monitors I'm laughing is
like you know what's a need but I think
the need is that as opposed to VR right
now is very silo it off so you like one
thing and then you stop the one yeah
yeah and I do like the fact that at
least na are you could potentially
just be working with several things in
the same way you'd work with multiple
monitors but maybe in a more tactile way
multiple tabs and I'm proud tabs so
there's something interesting there that
you know if I want to like try this cool
immersive game but also keep an eye on
messages or I'm also doing I mean a
plane go back to fortnight and then you
go to messages it's like the movie her
was just saying I'm letting Heron span
Roger remember that scene it I saw my
favorite scenes in in her where he's
like just singing the living room doing
this with his fingers making the little
thing run through the forest and he's
like sitting on the sofa like in that
little weird world a little sad creature
that's what I'll be like with that and
like a Twitter feed yeah Forest Twitter
well yeah you've had that slack up the
message you that's your new status away
message before we wrap things up I just
had to bring up this comment from life
improvements they mentioned maybe having
a drone that would like follow you
around and give your HUD a mini-map with
blips from moving things in it like
people and all I can picture is the knob
Boyd is at the Navi from Legend of Zelda
man listen oh yeah
so like the wait who's saying about the
drone following your life improvements
is imagining like a drone as part of
your HUD that would follow you around
and then update the mini-map in
real-time
oh yeah I could see like I do it is
totally like Navi Oh like giving you a
top-down view in real-time
what's that little turtle in the Super
Mario game that gave you the camera view
was it like Oh what lack it - like it -
it's a lucky - I see like he's got flies
in class yeah oh yeah yeah yeah that's
what it is
camera cloud I'm a camera cloud yeah
sure I want one of those
look at that the magic on lack of - yeah
sure
I mean yet that did Fifth Element have a
little floating drone there is like a
fantasy about you buddy have like a
little throne
didn't the character have is like some
sort of floating recording thing yes
live streaming all the time with your
little floating drone I mean I'm close
to that with selfie sticks yeah well
basically Chrissy yes like I think a
year ago where a guy having basically a
drone that came off his wrist like you
threw it off and it would it would
basically know to orient itself back
towards you for like a flying selfie
he's like the original youtuber in that
scene for info worse to use Tasker I
ever heard of you saw it no yeah I
thought it was dumb that was like what
it did one thing
yeah and how it was like 500 bucks yeah
I want your phone fly you up and taking
selfies technology coming out next year
just put some technology in the phone so
that it knows when it's falling and you
look at Fry's elfin lover and like not
break I'll pay for that then it grows
legs and just flies away yes doesn't
want you better if you drop it three
times and it pisses it off it just gets
up it just crawls away yeah Oh God all
Rick and Morty you don't deserve me
right what are you screw you I'm out of
here
what is my business conversation you
serve butter yeah this is getting really
weird
yeah okay okay so closing thoughts from
apex oh it's magically born actually
worth it for the developer or just an
end user
Matthew dacher will there ever be a day
however far in the future that a our
will be ready for the primetime and what
will we do with it and Timothy do how
far are we from Minority Report question
one for the developer if you've got the
money this is priced at developer
dollars this is like yeah if you have a
research lab that is working on
immersive tech yes it is worth it
because how many other headsets are
there that are we getting get your you
know get the magic leap one play around
with it and you need to have your
thoughts so for the average person no
heck no and it's not even made for that
and I don't even think you'll be able to
get it so don't worry you know it's like
not even it's not like a VR kind of but
you should straddle to write this story
that's Scott you can read the story and
know about the future is this excited
description when he when will we get to
that future um I think we're getting
there in small steps again through all
sorts of things I mean I get a little
buzzes notifying me about the world or
trying to you know air pods are slowly
drifting there and Bo's is trying to get
there and phones are doing it and maybe
VR is even even the world's obsession
with immersive I mean Joan writes a lot
about it everyone some about like
immersive entertainment I think we're
all kind of getting there in different
ways so we'll get there but I don't know
what the finishing line will will be I'm
the feeling of saying it may not be
exactly there'll be a lot of pitfalls on
the way but in years to come it took a
long time for smartphones it's taken
decades for VR yeah so I'm actually
declaring April 20 1990 hits primetime
well my kid turns 40 yeah sure I think I
do think twain based on like the the
reports and stories and Shara had
written the story about like Apple and
and a head headset rumors and reports
yeah I think 20 to 29 teen 2020 I was
mostly kidding oh wow
I think 2020 there's gonna be
interesting stuff it's good round number
2020 also 5g I think 5 G's gonna be
actually a critical element also that
has to be your own sight 2020 in order
to use any of the products because and
Minority Report we're already there
we're getting so novel and now yeah
spiritually but do we bring up Minority
Report way too often now like you we had
a whole special podcast yeah Joe Falcone
Jeff and I talked about that movie I
actually listened to that one you did
was good fun we were a little somber we
think it's good Thanksgiving listener um
so my turn Minority Report well here's
the other funny thing this is like
chicken and egg man Rd report famously
had a bunch of futurists working on that
film yep one of which was Jaron Lanier
who was on the the show I keep referring
him but he's he's awesome
a lot of people who were already working
and researching this tech envision that
future you saw inspired by a science
fiction writer but then other people
took that science fiction film and used
it as inspiration now it's alright
eating each other so in that sense it
feels kind of inevitable it a lot of
that stuff is coming to pass yeah like I
think we're a facial recognition tech if
nothing else
computer vision as it's getting more
advanced is fascinating and terrifying
and it's like that's like the main
driver between not just there's
recognition but also things that make a
artwork and cars and just a lot of
things that make the all-seeing world
feel like it's all-seeing so it's minor
report is a computer vision movie tape
sauce which Scott's died that should be
the new podcast there we go enough of
that all right okay we got around I so
deserve based an hour today remember
when we were struggling to get the four
hours at the 359 episode probably go for
hours with Scott for sure I'm so happy
to be talking like I am clear this is
such a buildup we were in here recording
this is so much behind his we're
recording
vo on top of vo in post-production for
this and we were going insane and I'm
sort of like Brian restrained Scott a
little bit during the four-minute
pockets cuz I told him for minutes we
got a yeah I get all the facts out and I
know once we get to the Q a Soderbergh
loose yeah everyone was like what's
going on we do it I'm like I can't talk
about it and they're so in the final
thing is that we were originally gonna
be running this story before and I think
we could say it's like the date for this
drifted up a few time so right we have
been we visited July 18th to see magic
leap and finally now the news is up a
day before Sam
so it's been a long it's been a long
process working on this well I I did
like I did appreciate the embargo time
which is 808 a.m. on yes
August August 8th 2018 it's pretty cool
yeah like the great conjunction my
theory is because Alibaba is a investor
it's the Chinese it's a Chinese good
luck thing I was thinking a very lucky
number in Chinese culture I like um yeah
I thought it kind of thought about that
all right we gotta jump guys we've got a
lot of still to do today
just a heads up the show will be on
tomorrow but it will be running late
obviously we've got Samsung in the
morning we have some experts in to talk
about all the announcements then I may
be here I may not be but after probably
in the afternoon three o'clock Eastern
3:30 Eastern somewhere around then after
all the Samsung craziness this podcast
is available on iTunes tune in stitcher
to feedburner google play music google
podcast the amazon echo of course
cnet.com we'll see you all tomorrow bye
bye
