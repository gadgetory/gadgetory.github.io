gives you Android the operating system
at the top of the finger and then turns
into a presentation tool at the top of
the button
I'm Jessica dual-core 4c net showing you
around this quirky likable Samsung
Galaxy Beam now I first saw the beam in
a very crowded conference room at Mobile
World Congress and I was just curious
about how well the integrated projector
worked as you are I have to say it works
impressively well for what it is you
turn on the built-in pico projector by
pressing a button on the side of the
phone true to its name the phone will
then beam out whatever it is that's on
your phone screen this is ideal for
holding an impromptu slideshow or movie
night on a wall on an outdoor screen or
maybe even on the side of a tent and the
plus side is that there's no extra bulky
or expensive equipment required it's all
built in the other major use case is for
giving presentations in the office you
can launch a presentation from any app
but some apps might fare better than
others the beam comes with Polaris
Office so you can use that or you can
download any other number of apps I
launched a presentation using Google
Drive it worked but it wasn't as smooth
as running it off of a computer and I
couldn't get the presentation to go
fullscreen it did help though when I
turned everything to landscape mode what
I do like is the suite of tools that
helps you fine-tune the projection
experience you're able to adjust focus
and rotation point or annotate while you
talk and use what's called a visual
presenter to show whatever is beneath
the camera lens
there's also ambiance mode which lets
you time music and images to work as an
intro while you warm up the crowd you
can also turn on the flashlight /
blinking disco light mode and set an
alarm to remind you of your next
briefing unsurprisingly projection works
best in a dark environment on a light
surface and you will have to be aware of
battery drain when you use the projector
you'll use more battery for longer
sessions like beaming a video but
luckily the phone comes with a large
battery for its screen size so that
should help it's 2000 mAh the phone's
audio worked pretty well in close quiet
settings but you may find that you want
to pair the beam to Bluetooth speaker
for some scenarios it's pretty apparent
that the project
the phones biggest draw but Samsung
luckily didn't forget about the rest of
the phone the beam has an attractive
almost rugged design with this bright
yellow racing stripe all around the rim
and the same vibrant color beneath the
back cover the phone is on the thicker
side because of the projector especially
at the top and it's also a little
heavier than usual but it feels
comfortable because of the soft touch
finish on the backing there's a four
inch Super AMOLED screen in Android 2.3
Gingerbread the phone also comes with a
physical home button on the bottom and
both the SIM card slot and a micro SD
card slot on the sides for easy access
the 5 megapixel camera takes some good
shots and capture 720p HD video there's
also a 1.3 megapixel camera on the front
for video check now this Galaxy Beam
that I have here is an unlocked version
running on 3G on an AT&amp;amp;T SIM card the
phone will be available in Europe very
soon but there's no official US release
date yet
I'm Jessica doll 4 for CNN and this has
been Samsung Galaxy Beam protector phone
