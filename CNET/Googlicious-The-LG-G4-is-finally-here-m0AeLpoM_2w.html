Google licious for everything google
that we can pack inside of a show let's
get to it and the big G release their
earnings for q1 2015 with a revenue of
17.3 billion dollars that's up twelve
percent from the previous year thanks to
its mobile advertising business but
google also acknowledged that the
year-over-year decline in sales of the
Nexus 6 has hurt them and it hasn't
performed as well as the previous Nexus
5 and Nexus 7 now the Nexus 5 was 349
and the nexus 6 started at 649 that
might have been part of the problem and
even stock Android can't overcome a
price difference like that alright
Google is launching an experimental
service and will now act as a
marketplace for interested parties
looking to sell their patents they're
looking to make the process easier with
the program they're calling the patent
purchase promotion now pads can be
submitted and Google will let them know
if they're interested in buying them the
idea is to allow smaller patent holders
an easier way to do this without selling
the trolls who might try to flip them
and then can result in lawsuits or
wasted time dealing with the fallout on
the software side cyanogen has created a
series of new videos called cyanogen
bites I wonder where they got that name
from and it will feature the versatility
of the custom fork of Android now the
first one shows off their app femur the
cyanogen OS has gained momentum recently
but this is a move that shows it's
trying harder to reach out to the
mainstream audience and educate them
alongside of the oneplus one being
available for anyone to order right now
and SwiftKey fans truly one of the great
gems from android that's also on iOS
release the beta version of their
android app and brings a redesigned
options menu that slides out and lets
you do things like customize the size
layout and look of the swift keyboard
and one of androids stellar features was
being able to say okay google to perform
a search from anywhere on the phone but
as of right now that's not the case
anymore with the Samsung s6 or s6 edge
and no one seems to know why it suddenly
stopped working Samsung could have
switched the flip to give s voice the
priority now but that seems silly since
it's just not as good
well actually that might make perfect
sense but there's been no word if it
will come back to the way we expect it
to and LG announced they're all metal
watch urbane that will be available
later this month on the Google store but
if you're in Korea you can pick it up
this month pricing is still yet to be
announced but it's going to be targeted
as a more premium device compared to the
g watch are and if you're curious what
it looks like running Android wear five
point one point one that we talked about
here last week here are some pictures
that show off things like the new emoji
drawing feature Wi-Fi support and
always-on screen support for certain
apps and don't forget about the Samsung
gear to watch we know it only runs ties
in but XDA developers are hard at work
to get Android we're running on
Samsung's watch and they've already got
the OS partially functioning up to this
point and finally the LG g4 is coming
this week and the specs have been leaked
already so what we fully expect to see
is a 3000 milliamp ear our removable
battery you'll still see this leather
backing styling with built-in wireless
charging and quick charging when plugged
in with a 5.5 inch quad HD display a
Snapdragon 808 processor three gigs of
RAM and 32 gigs of storage with microSD
card support several of the key features
that Samsung got rid of in its latest
design alright that's going to do it for
this week's show you can always email us
at google issues at cnet com or tweet me
at brian Tong thanks for watching and
we'll see you all next time for some
more of that Google ishes
google Isha's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
