there are many more on the way there's a
new tech arms race with Google now vying
for space on your wrist it's finally
possible to make a powerful computer
small enough to wear comfortably on your
body all day long google unveiled the
new smart watches at their annual
developers conference in San Francisco
just one more tap to pay and the pizzas
on its way the watch is made by mobile
companies LG motorola and samsung run
Google's Android wear operating system
find myself missing phone calls a lot
because my my phone is in my pocket so
with Android wear watch your watch will
vibrate you can glance down and you can
either see the message just like that or
if it's a phone call you can see who's
calling then you know if you need to get
your phone out to answer or you can
swipe to dismiss the call or send a
quick SMS reply right on your wrist
while Android wear was designed for both
square and round watch faces it's this
round of moto 360 that's getting the
most buzzed here at Google i/o the move
puts pressure on apple to launch the
much rumored iWatch one research firm
predicted that while this year wearables
will be around 1.4 billion dollars by
2018 only four years away they're
looking at a 19 billion dollar market
that ties together with Google's desire
to see Google products and services on
as many screens as possible Google is
challenging Apple and other arenas
introducing Android auto a competitor to
apples car play these two giants are
still going at it and it's moving on
from simply Android versus iOS to your
TV's and your watches and car play
android auto puts android into a car's
entertainment screen and ii can now put
his phone down and use the familiar car
controls it looks and feels like it's
part of the car but all of the apps we
see here are running on andy's phone
google is also making a push into your
home updating its TV offering now called
android TV that integrates with your
smartphone for example i can just say
oscar-nominated movies from 2002 google
will interpret that query hood of course
get me all my oscar-nominated movie
there was no mention of nest the smart
thermostat maker that google recently
acquired or Google glass which made its
debut at this conference two years ago
in San Francisco I'm Kara Tsuboi
