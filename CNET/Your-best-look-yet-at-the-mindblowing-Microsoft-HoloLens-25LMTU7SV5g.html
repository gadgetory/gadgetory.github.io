for the microsoft hololens development
edition here it is the world's first
untethered holographic computer puts on
really easily you can see it's on your
head no other cables no markers in the
room everything you need to see
holograms right here in this device
since obviously a lot of what you're
doing is looking forward most of the
cameras and sensors are gonna be in this
front part right here so we've designed
this nice protective shield that keeps
all the sensors and cameras super safe
but right in here you can see the
cameras and the sensors that help us
with our environmental understanding and
things that keep holograms pin to your
real world under that you can see all of
our optics obviously a big part as well
as seeing the Holograms a lot of the
processing that goes on also in this top
band up front here and then because you
want to have a nice center of gravity so
something that feels balancing
comfortable on your head a lot of the
batteries and the stuff that powers
hololens coming here in the back one of
the interesting pieces as we worked with
hololens we started to discover is that
i'm sure you know from using any device
when you're using a device it can start
to get warm and we don't things getting
you know warm on people's heads so we've
developed this really cool passive
cooling system where these slots right
here will take all the heat away from
your head it comes up out the side so
it's really dissipating the heat on the
device in a way that is super
comfortable
so people can use it we've got our
really unique spatial sound system that
comes right in here in your ear so not
only can you see Holograms all around
you but you can hear the Holograms
positionally and that that makes sense
both from a visual and audio perspective
and then you know some very simple
things like how you can control volume
how you can control the brightness of
your Holograms all on these buttons up
here but it's really as a marvel of
technology an untethered holographic
computer it lets you see Holograms in
your real world microsoft hololens the
development edition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
