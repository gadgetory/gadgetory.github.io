359 podcast episode 248 i'm BVG in the
house today we've got Alfred Eng and
Roger Chang what's up everybody hey my
periscope where the sharpest tool in the
shed no let's not let's not start that
again
hey now all right we're not all sorry's
clearly if you watch the show you know
we're not all started so it's another
busy day now we're gonna be talking
about yet another massive ransomware
attack Petya or goldeneye or whatever
you want to call it so many names so
many names
Alfred our security guru is here to
break down why should care I will also
be talking a bit about CNET's camera
shootout with the big Android phones 1+5
Galaxy s8 and Google pixel and who won
out
lastly we'll be talking about Qualcomm
announcement some technology that
they've developed to get to fingerprint
sensors buried underneath the display
which is something we may see with the
iPhone well not Qualcomm snack on hot
Qualcomm's better some form of it yeah
yeah so alright as usual if you have any
questions leave them in the comment
section BBG we'll grab the best we will
try to get to them at 3 minutes and 59
seconds all right buckle up everybody
here we go in the 3 - welcome to the 359
I'm Roger Tsien I'm Alfred hang well it
happened again another ransomware attack
is hit in companies and government
agencies around the world are scrambling
it's a very restraint called Pena and
it's even worse than want to cry however
do you replace it - Liam this yesterday
and today how is this different than one
a crime what is this well it's the same
thing as want to cry in the way that it
spread and the fact that it's ransomware
but you can't call it the same as want
to cry just because of how much more
severe the ransomware itself is so when
you take a look at wanna cry it
essentially encrypted you know certain
file is on your computer that you might
need right and then basically said you
know you can't use this the difference
with this new one it's called Goldeneye
instead
a strain of pet yet another ransomware
they came out which by the way is a
cooler name yes for sure golden eyes
definitely way cooler than pet yeah or
some other name called not pet yeah but
this one it doesn't only encrypt files
on your computer it also encrypts your
entire hard drive so essentially your
computer just becomes like a very
expensive brick unless you pay for
decryption and then on in this scenario
they used an email address from a
website called post EO which is based in
Germany yep and even if you pay it you
can't get it back because the host post
EO they took down that email address so
you can't email them your your
information saying hey please like send
me the decryption code no no longer so
what does that mean that doesn't mean
everyone is just screwed for now yes
like pretty much if you've been infected
but it spread to the same way that wanna
cry did which is through the eternal
blue NSA exploit yep and it also used
another act and it combined another
exploit with Microsoft Office documents
yeah and that's basically how the
initial network in Kiev got infected and
then just spread over to everybody else
someone clicked on a bad word file
pretty much yeah all right next up sina
tested out the big android phones in a
camera shootout
there's a galaxy s 8 the pixel and the
1+5 and surprisingly the pixel actually
held on fairly strong that's that's
interesting considering its the oldest
phone and I couldn't believe it because
it's the only one that doesn't have like
a dual lens camera in the back oh the
gsa does not have a dual lens camera
okay well i'm wrong twice now now i
thought the one plus five though because
it had the dual lens would have done
better than both of them yes it's clear
a case that like even adding an extra
lens adding extra hardware sometimes
isn't always the solution i mean from
the photos that i've seen though it
seems that you know the pixel is able to
get like the most detail by like getting
the most light and yeah photos and it
seemed andy eddie coyle who actually did
a shoot out he noted that the the 1+5 in
particular had some issues with its
white balance so that the color the
photos seemed a little off like what
should have been you know blue kind of
had this yellowish hue to it but yeah
that said what the 1+5 is the only one
out of these three camera or these three
phones that can do that portrait or
bouquet yeah it looks a lot better as
far as photo comparison goes when once
you get
to the close-ups and I feel like that's
kind of what the dual ends you know
specializes in yes definitely so I mean
it's definitely a phone you should have
in consideration it is far less
expensive than the other phones it's
definitely got its own following but
it's not you know it's not exactly a
widely available phone you can't go to a
carrier store than violin plus five so
that's always the issue yeah I'm a
little disappointed all right lastly a
Qualcomm has found a way to put
fingerprint sensors underneath the
screen which is something that we're
hoping to see if the iPhone but how do
you explain how Qualcomm is doing this
so they've revealed this yesterday or I
guess this morning at Mobile World
Congress Shanghai yep where essentially
instead of using normal fingerprint
scanners where you put your finger on it
and it kind of has like a small camera
kind of thing on it camera but it's like
one metal ring this one uses in
ultrasonic sensors so in the same way
that you can get an image through like
when you get an ultrasound for like a
baby so I'm just uses that kind of
technology and doing that it allows them
to go through like thicker like material
like going underneath your screen
instead of having to be like up on the
surface for it gotcha and it's the first
phone to actually incorporate this is a
vivo phone it's really a it seems like
it's a concept video at this point I
think they're really just announcing it
to say that their first since yeah
because yeah welcome said that this
technology isn't really going to be
commercially available until the summer
of 2018
right and right now we're expecting the
iPhone to have similar technology not
this kind of ultrasonic technology
definitely not using Qualcomm technology
but be able to accomplish the same task
and it's supposed to come with the fall
yes so it's really vivo plans stake in
the ground all right for more of these
stories sure cuz I don't see that Roger
Cheng I'm Alfred Hank thanks for
listening alright jumping right into the
comments and questions and the chat we
do recognize like we did kind of have to
breeze through that really quick our
goal is to try to get the the right byte
size into a four minute podcast that
people can download yeah as per
instruction from our superiors but we're
going to go into a little more detail
right now and there plenty of great
questions and comments filtering and
we're gonna start right
with the Panamanian Mike who was a
little disappointed that we skipped over
how to migrate or mitigate sorry I can't
read this far away
I thought he wants us to just go into
more details about how to mitigate the
problem well do the realism where well I
think if you have it or in general you
could hit your mostly like branching
upon with dr. Rama Han is uh give us
instructions on how to protect yourself
I know
Matthew dacher goes on to say that we
use a service called know before to
teach how to not to indiscriminate click
on emails well the issue with this
strain of ransomware and the same thing
with wanna cry is that even if you
yourself personally are very careful
with you know your computer what you
download you know you have getting all
the update things like that
this exploit you know exposes basically
your computer's networks this one in
particular eternal blue used the SMB
networks on Windows devices so even if
you personally are very careful if
somebody else that's on your computer
network like messes up like you you're
infected that and that that's how it
spreads so quickly so you know you gotta
watch out for yourself but then now you
have to tell everybody that's on the
same computer network that you are to
also be careful mm-hmm so the other
thing is everybody should be patching
their you know computers as quickly and
I think that's the the reminder there is
that
yeah like wanna cry should have been a
reminder yeah everyone to update the
computer but I think you said in your
story today wasn't like 39% of computer
t6 like million computers right
yeah we're not like patched we're not
patched even after one a crime yes and
that's only from the you know computers
that were using Avast like antivirus
really just as a small fraction yeah so
that's the thing there there should have
been more people that patched it but and
it looks like you know after wanna cry
happen I guess some people thought oh it
was probably not gonna happen again then
we go that's what um so yeah Pat your
computers to the latest you know and
it's not just patching your computer
it's making sure every computer on your
network is also that yeah
right right do we have any suggested
resources to go along to where where can
they find this where can I get the patch
from microwave from Microsoft we have a
link in the article really don't we
should check the show notes afterwards
we'll let you yep in the chat oh my god
I'm gonna butcher this name and I'm so
sorry
Raja mana calm I apologize again
we'll pay effect Linux computers it will
not because this is taking care this is
taking advantage of a Windows exploit
but that's not to say that Linux
computers are not safe from ransomware
in general
last week a South Korean host company
paid the largest known payout for
ransomware they paid a million dollars
for this ransomware which is the the I'm
not sure if there's ever been more like
discreetly but for sure this is the most
the largest amount publicly publicly
disclosed that they paid a million
dollars to free up their servers because
they were hosting a ton of websites and
then hackers you know basically put
ransomware on their servers and these
were all Linux servers that were taken
hostage so and just for comparison say
like these individual attacks are asking
for $300 for Bitcoin right yes yeah well
I'm like each person yep let's move on
to the fingerprint scanner Kyle says
Apple better get the fingerprint scanner
under the screen and not in the back
yeah I know there's a lot of debate back
and forth about that you know we've seen
kind of those those mock units with the
circular cutout in the back indicating a
potential fingerprint sensor there but
we don't know how legit those are first
of all how do people know that just
because that is a circular cutout that
it's a fingerprint sensor like what else
spinner whoo they just spinner
attachment probably not gonna happen
sorry okay if they don't want to make
money all right whatever that's their
fault these birds will be dead you know
by the time I phone they're like a
gajillion fidget spinner apps yes
doesn't repair circle yeah this is
better why would you even uh I hate no I
mark my words fidget spinners will not
be a thing by the time the iPhone 8
comes out
we won't be talking about them I mean
look I grew that several months I grew
up with pogs and that was stupid enough
but at least pogs had like art on them
and they looked kind of neat you can get
like different fidgets Pharaohs dudes
colors you know it's incredible to me
like the the the stupid little gadget II
collectibles we come up with pogs is way
more fun really sorry let's just
remember we're meant to play with other
people King is there like a midget
spinners yeah remember Alf he's back in
fidget spinner fella you could at least
respect that come on Sal all right you
win you gotta you've slipped in a
Milhouse reference thank you for that
alright let's go ahead and jump over to
imagine soggy our old friend he's asking
well he's stating that is why I was
surprised the 1 plus 5 had dual cameras
it's not necessary right now the bouquet
effect it's cool but people just want
great-looking photos as of right now I
think that's it's kind of like giving a
handicap to anybody who's an amateur
photographer and making people who spend
their lives becoming great photographers
feel like fools ok ok is the easiest way
to trick people into thinking that
you're like a real photographer because
all it really is is like changing the
focus on your like lens yeah and like
people will see a photo that I spoke ago
Wow my wedding god I mean look they as
someone who takes way too many photos of
his kid like when that day works and
it's not foolproof right a lot of those
do come out kind of crappy but when it
works and it's it's nice it's not
something I would share brag is like
some great piece of photography but it's
a great way to highlight you know a
person you care about right like it for
me it's not about like showing off any
skills like I realized I'm a terrible
photographer and that if I pay the
professional I would appreciate the work
that they did like the photos that
professional photographers take still by
far is way superior to anything that you
can do with your phone yeah but you're a
lot more humble than like people I know
that of iPhone 7 plus is where the
Instagram model is that and no job now
they'll show me their phones and their
wallpaper or some like waterfall thing
or something and that's it's just such
the wallpaper and the way I took that
I'm like
I don't cool okay I don't care it's your
wallpaper like how even look at that
it's just it's one more thing to lend to
selfie culture though yeah no totally I
mean I don't really work for selfies
because these are all yeah but it's like
four beautiful photos of yourself like
somebody else your phone it's so much
the idea of dual cameras it's it's it's
gonna be like the standard thing
oh yeah like iPhones got it we're pretty
sure I mean the rumors all point to the
Galaxy Note 8 getting it as well and all
these other phones are picking up dual
dual cameras as a thing but when when
we'll try cameras become a thing well
actually well you say that what because
the three lenses the tango phone no I
understand
yeah that's for AR though yeah but
that's the thing like I think three
can't like try camera phones will be a
thing and it's because of they are it's
because these other sort of
sophisticated I think will see three or
four cameras
I don't want cameras if you don't
remember I think it was the fire phone
which had like six cameras in the front
because it like read your face it for
death it was partly for AR as well but
that that's not the one that no one
bought you're right I don't remember the
fire phone yeah
no one does Matthew dad who says I once
shot a short film on an iPhone 7 I don't
want to sound like I'm too much of a
cranky pants here cuz I kind of poopoo
on the whole yeah really
five really he's as old as he looks but
okay so I'm not gonna not acknowledge
that the the mobile phone and the camera
that comes in your pocket now that's
kind of neat adventurous tool that
brings a lot more fantastic
opportunities to people who would not
have had them makes it more affordable
more attainable but at the same time I'm
tired of everybody run around just
taking pictures of themselves this I my
train ride this morning some girl on the
train just like cake in her face and
makeup and then click click click click
click click click I mean what happened
actually that happened to me yesterday
like walking down the steps to a no idle
or train this lady just stopped in the
middle walking down the stairs to take a
selfie and what are you doing that to me
that there is a crowd of people behind
her she literally just stopped to take a
photo then she looked back to I'm sorry
like no kidding yeah really
that warrants
Lapham to me on Matthew doctor's note
though about his short film that he shot
on iphone 7 I had a class project once
where I had to make like a like some
kind of like short film like video
documentary thing and this was supposed
to be for a class where you learned how
to use like a DSLR camera and all this
stuff sure I I didn't do that I did I
don't want to go get the camera or
anything like that so I just shot it all
on my phone and I didn't like super last
minute and then it passed so yeah you
know higher phone quality everybody well
there was a film that that did well
Sundance was a tangerine I believe that
was Sean tirely on an iPhone 5 again
there's an opportunity there and in the
right hands it can be a Fame the right
yes but now it's in everybody's hands
and not everybody deserves that yeah I
mean I think everyone does I will say
that I don't think everybody deserves
this the front-facing camera cuz you you
don't get one sorry you got put a pretty
may take it away from you if you've
taken too many selfies in a day or
something oh good
alright there's a go limit which you hit
like 10 selfies and that's down yeah I
don't know what is what is the threshold
for I feel like one per day I feel like
if you take more than like 200 a day
that's like too many I think little wait
what I don't yet people are gonna take
more than 10 selfies a day that's I I
think I take one I think I'll feel a
bump I think 200 is no one wants no I
don't care I know what you look like my
favorite use of the selfie camera though
it's like to take self shots of like
weird people on the train oh yeah that's
cool again Kyle Kyle says it's not about
the camera it's about the person behind
the camera absolutely very true and
Michael Brown expands on that Casey
neistat's last vlog was shot completely
on the SA and it was a pretty legit but
that guy is an incredible
cinematographer right I mean I'm not a
big fan of his of the vlog style in
general and that's subjective but you're
not going to deny that that guy could
shoot an awesome video on an old flip
phone camera just because he's got the
know-how and the skill no I love it
whenever some of these companies these
phone companies hire you know
professional photographers or video
producers to shoot photos to demonstrate
how awesome their cameras well of course
professionals can take anything and make
it look great yeah one more good joke
from Michael Brown if she has 100
selfies in her phone she's too young for
you bro that's like that's like the same
age as me I don't know it's probably
yeah I'm probably too young for
everybody so it's true yeah
I would not argue that how many selfies
I have on my phone now that I think
about it I want to tell about tomorrow's
episode I delete a lot of my photos
though just look it up in your iPhone
there's like a selfie folder yes there
is of course there is I do it to make
space though show more selfies so you
know what I'll well I'll take a look
right now see how myself is I bet all
right goodbye everybody nobody cares I
have six selfies and one of them is not
even really a selfie it's just like I
have 347 there what yeah but there will
see with my kid yeah I have six in your
face I told you haha and then four of
them are me with a cat okay add a kitten
that I rescued that's that's pretty good
ha I mean I would say like 99% of those
my kids are theirs alright if you want
to come up with excuses for you're not
sure you're the one with triple-digit
selfies and I have six that's true
maybe ugh - oh you're too young for me
that's that's wrong it's so mean okay
careful let's uh let's wrap it up I know
down a tad more boring path guys
well thanks if you join anything you saw
or heard here I don't know why they can
see that our podcast is also available
