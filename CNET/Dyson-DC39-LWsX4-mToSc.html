wheeled cylinders is they're very hard
to maneuver very clumsy very awkward get
always getting caught so that was our
brief we were looking to improve the
maneuverability of a cylinder product so
ball is very very maneuverable it will
go wherever it wants to go so the
challenge from our perspective is how we
can control it so we had to spend a lot
of time engineering in some stability
and there's some key features looking at
the front cuff making sure that the ball
is always pushed to the floor and we
have wheels at the size which help it
steer hoping to go in the direction you
want it to go rather than just moving
around randomly and we had lots of
prototypes we created in order to make
sure the center of gravity was low so as
it goes around corners it doesn't topple
we had to fit all of the components
inside the ball so that's analogous to
try to fit all of the organs inside the
head in the human body as you can see
there's over 100 components inside this
ball and it required us to be really
really space conscious in order to fit
them all in testing is vital to
developing new machines we would
probably have carried out over a
thousand tests on the maneuverability
elements and once we had a design which
was working really really well we tested
it seven days a week 24 hours a day a
thousands of hours in order to prove it
was robust we've really addressed the
maneuverability problems with cylinders
making a cylinder that steers very well
it follows you around so it doesn't get
caught we've really looked to improve
the acoustics but most importantly it
doesn't lose suction that uses our
latest cyclone technology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
