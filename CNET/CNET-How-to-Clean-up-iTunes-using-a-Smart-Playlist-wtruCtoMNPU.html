your hard drive one of the easiest
places to trim the fat is your iTunes
library so with music that you never
listen to not to mention old podcast TV
shows movies and audiobooks in today's
how-to I'm going to show you how to take
out the garbage with just a few quick
steps so how do you carve out all the
rotten stuff while saving the media that
you can't live without here's where a
smart playlist comes in handy go up to
the file menu and select new smart
playlist if you're new to these a smart
playlist automatically creates a
playlist based on a set of rules you can
use them to collect all the songs from a
particular artist or all of your albums
from the 80s or in this case all of the
music that you never listen to we're
gonna make a smart playlist with three
rules rule number one the media in this
playlist will have been played less than
two times rule number two any media that
has been skipped over more than five
times and rule number three songs that
you've rated one or two stars because
there probably won't be a lot of things
here that satisfy all of those
requirements go to the top of the window
and change match all to match any then
hit OK now you have a playlist filled
with all the bad ignored or frequently
skipped media in your iTunes library if
you don't see much you can right-click
on the playlist and select edit and
adjust the numbers to pull in more media
another trick is to right-click the
column headers and add a column for size
so that you can sort by file size and
delete the big stuff first the problem
is if you've ever tried to delete a song
from iTunes playlist you've probably
noticed that it just deletes the song
from the playlist and not from your
computer in a smart playlist the delete
key is basically useless since we have
no manual control over the list unless
of course you know this trick this
keyboard shortcut comes to us from our
friends over life hacker it turns out
that you can delete iTunes media from
your computer directly from a playlist
by holding down the option key on a Mac
while pressing delete or shift delete on
Windows now I wouldn't nuke all the
media on this playlist without looking
through it first
there could be some important or
sentimental media in there worth holding
on to
really the playlist is just there to
help you get a handle on the dusty
corners of your iTunes library if you've
enjoyed this video you can find more
over at how to cnet.com or you can send

facebook's more your thing you can
