how to a contributor today I'm going to
talk about one of my biggest
frustrations as a parent who is using
modern day technology to give their
toddler a jumpstart on education more
specifically we have an ipod touch that
we let our two children use and we
loaded up with games and apps step teach
them colors numbers how to draw letters
all that fun stuff what happens is you
load the game you pull it up you get it
started you hand it to your toddler and
the first thing they do is press the
home button this exits the app right
away and they have no idea what they did
they get frustrated they get mad they
give you back the ipod and the cycle
keeps repeating so i went on a search
for a way to prevent this and I felt
something that is actually pretty neat
it works very well take a look at bub
cap alright guys so what I have here is
our ipod touch that we use with our
toddler to 11 play games and learn and
draw and interact with the problem was
the home button as soon as we load up
the app he pressed the home button hand
the ipod back to us and get frustrated
and on and on so what i found was a
product called bub cap there are five
dollars you get a set of four different
caps two different strengths i think i
paid six dollars total to get them here
to me and what they are they're little
stickers they're made of a pretty thick
material and the out prevent the toddler
from pressing on the home button so what
i'm going to do is go ahead and apply
this one it's real simple take it off
center it over the home button press on
it pretty hard make sure it sticks all
right in the instructions advise you to
wait several hours before giving the
ipod ipad or even iphone to a toddler to
use letting the adhesive set but as you
can see it completely covers the home
button and it makes it even difficult
for not difficult but it if you
definitely tell the difference
it's not as easy to press the home
button once you hand it to a toddler
they can't press it at all depending on
their age and there are different
strengths and different sizes of bub
caps that will prevent older children
from pressing it as well so as you just
saw the bug cap is extremely easy to use
you put it on you let it set for a
little bit of time and then you hand the
iphone ipod touch or the ipad to the
toddler and you ought to worry about
them hitting the home button exiting the
app they can play and I have to worry
about the fit that's going to come as
soon as that app closes this is just one
of the many great tech tips we have over
at how to cnet com come join us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
