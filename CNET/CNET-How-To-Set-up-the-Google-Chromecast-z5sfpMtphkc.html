affordable way to stream media from any
of our mobile devices to any HDTV
I'm Donnell Bell and then this how-to
I'm going to show you how to set this up
and make it work with a number of
different devices including an Android
tablet iPhone or laptop now as simple as
this thing looks setup does take a few
minutes to complete you plug it into an
open HDMI port connect the power cord to
either a USB port on your TV or the
included power adapter then select the
HDMI input you're using and you should
see a setup screen now unlike an Apple
TV or a Roku there's no remote control
for the chromecast and no Ethernet port
so you have to connect this thing to a
Wi-Fi network and to do that it's gonna
need some help from another device now
whether you have a laptop or a phone or
a tablet make sure it's connected to the
same Wi-Fi network you plan to use for
the chromecast and direct the browser to
google.com slash chromecast slash setup
preferably using Google's own Chrome
browser on this Mac I was directed to
download the chromecast app I'll open it
up and it searches for any nearby
chromecast I'll make sure that the names
matched before I hit continue since
hijacking my neighbor's chromecast
probably won't make them too happy once
the computer and the chromecast are
connected to each other you'll see a
unique four-digit code on the screen
since it matches the one on my computer
I'll click that's my code next I'll
choose the Wi-Fi network I wanted to use
from the drop-down list and enter the
password you also have the option to
give your chromecast a name if you're
prone to naming your tech now on the TV
here we can see that the chromecast is
trying to connect to the network and
there it goes we're all ready to cast
now once that set the application on my
laptop here points me back over to the
Chrome browser and installs a chromecast
plug-in which gives me this little
button over here in the corner when I
press it you can send your page over to
the chromecast while still controlling
it locally on your computer on youtube
you'll see a specific chromecast button
down on the corner of the video player
which displays the video fullscreen on
the TV
on Android you'll see these same
chromecast buttons and media apps like
Netflix YouTube and Google Play just
make sure you're on that same Wi-Fi
network as your chromecast or you're not
going to get very far
you also notice that when you're
throwing content over to chromecast that
your device turns into a kind of remote
control
which you can use to play pause or
adjust the volume the same goes for
iPads and iPhones so long as you're on
the same network you should see the
chromecast option here for Netflix and
YouTube and support for Pandora is also
expected soon one last thing I want to
touch on our settings back here on my
laptop with the Chrome browser open
you'll see a settings option here when
you click the chromecast button here you
can throttle or raise the video quality
resize your browser page to fit the TV
screen and even change the zoom setting
for video playback
there's nothing here I recommend in
particular but it's good to know where
these settings are so that's how to set
up and use a chromecast you're on the
fence about getting one check out our
full review over on CNET and for more
how-to videos how-to cnet.com i'm donald
bell thanks for watching
