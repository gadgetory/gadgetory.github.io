and you seem to like the fingerprint NSA
scanner thing on the phone and so why
why would you be in favor of anything
like that that they can gather more
information and so it's fine well no
it's funny because that I didn't realize
it was a reporter it was a somebody at
the end of the menu just said like what
did you like and I slip in your bow so I
didn't really know that had gotten
picked up but the uh um but I mean I
think of it I liked about it and sort of
funny because you mocked me once
backstage at TechCrunch so maybe it was
on the web because Mike was making fun
of me because I don't have a passcode on
my phone oh yeah I'm like my girls like
are you crazy and I was like look I just
can't do this bass cover thing like yeah
15 times a day and then leg but I saw
the fingerprint thing I was like and now
I don't have to yeah so yeah I was
excited about that and I just think that
like building in some of these smart
sensors into the small into the phone is
really exciting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
