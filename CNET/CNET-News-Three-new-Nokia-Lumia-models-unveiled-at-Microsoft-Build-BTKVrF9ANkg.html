proud to be able to announce that first
here today
now the Lumia 930 is absolutely a
flagship device built on and for Windows
Phone 8.1 it integrates the best of
Microsoft and the best of Lumia now as
you can see in the video up there as
well as in my hand the 930 is just a
beautifully crafted device it packs
great Lumia innovation into an elegant
smart phone with metallic details around
the side and vibrant new colors
sometimes matching wardrobe which is a
necessity it has a bunch of great colors
orange is one you saw the bright green
and it has a crystal clear 5 inch full
HD display with amazing readability in
all conditions an amazing viewing ratio
and even in spotlight conditions you can
clearly read what's on the screen it's
just great outdoors we've also taken the
time to integrate wireless charging into
the device so you can power it up quite
easily love that we all love the
wireless charging we have built the
Lumia 930 for absolute speed and
performance it has a 2.2 gigahertz
Snapdragon 800 quad-core processor and
it in short the Lumia 930 just rocks so
your applications are just gonna sing on
this device thank you
now we'll start selling the lumia 930
globally in June we will start in Europe
and then move through Asia India and the
Middle East here in the u.s. we'll be
focusing on continuing with the Nokia
icon which is a very similar device in
terms of specifications to this and of
course the big boy that I showed you a
few minutes ago the Lumia 1520 the Lumia
930 will be available with more than 100
operators around the world for around
599 dollars before taxes and the
subsidies that operators apply to the
prices Nokia Lumia 630 and very similar
to that the Lumia 635 just an amazing
device as you're about to hear it brings
an uncompromised Microsoft experience
and an uncompromised Lumia experience to
more people at much lower price points
the 6:30 and 6:35 have a sleek design
with a bright four and a half inch clear
block display that is also great in the
outdoor environments they come in five
stunning colors with changeable shells
but here's what's really exciting me the
Lumia 630 comes in two variants a 3G
single sim variant as you'd expect and
the very first Lumia with 3G dual-sim
capabilities enabled by Windows Phone
8.1 which is just a huge opportunity for
all of us to broaden the reach of our
applications to many more people and in
the Lumia 635 comes packed with
lightning-fast 4G LTE capabilities so we
have the full range of radio
requirements now the Lumia 630 is
designed for hyper social people who
love to play games and we have their
favorite games you can quickly go to
their favorite Xbox game by tapping on
the screen or as we saw with Joe earlier
today you could use Cortana now it's
really great news that Cortana as its
rolled out around the world will be
available on the entire range of Windows
Phone 8 devices including the 630 our
most affordable Windows Phone 8.1 device
today our competitors have various voice
assistance capabilities heavily biased
towards the high-end devices we are
bringing that innovation
to all of the different price points of
that innovation is available to everyone
but I think it's really good it's gonna
be good for your applications now for
the really really price conscious
consumer someone who might have just
bought into a lumia 630 perhaps is their
first smartphone these devices are also
great ways to get the benefits of the
equivalent of an expensive fitness band
or wearable device what we are doing is
introducing into these devices something
new called sensor core this is a very
low-power sensing capability that tracks
motion and location so now people can
use their Lumia to keep track of their
steps and calories burned using as cron
is showing the Bing health and fitness
application you can even have this
working when the Lumia devices in your
pocket or in your bag it doesn't matter
this thing keeps track of your movements
so that you can follow your improvements
and your progress built right into the
device now let's go back to the home
screen final point I want to make about
these devices is they are Lumia devices
so there's many things we've come to
expect as part of that experience
including nokia mix radio where you get
at no additional cost the equivalent of
your own personal radio station with
more than 30 million songs the cost of
which is built into the device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
