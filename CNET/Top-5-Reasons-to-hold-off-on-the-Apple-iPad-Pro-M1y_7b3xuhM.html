things
I'm your host Aya's Akhtar Apple's big
iPhone 6s announcement came and went and
the big news was the iPad pro no pun
intended the audience booed and awed the
monster tablet and what it could do
there are plenty of reasons to buy an
iPad pro and we'll cover that in another
top 5 however today we're counting down
the top 5 reasons to hold off on the
iPad pro at number 5 you already have an
iPad air sure there are performance
boosts with the air 2 and the pro but
how slow is your current iPad anyway
Apple's iPads have aged relatively well
and they'll gain some functionality with
iOS 9 iPad air 2 will get more cool
stuff in the original air but can you
miss what you never had at number four
you're not a giant the new iPad pro is
twelve point nine inches the nine point
seven inch model wasn't that portable
but this is even less portable the iPad
pro will feel like holding a decapitated
13 inch laptop now if you're a giant of
a human perhaps this will feel natural
for some of us it might be a little
weird number three no 3d touch display
Apple spent a lot of time discussing
with set the iPhone 6s apart from the
iPhone 6 and that was the 3d touch
display they could sense how hard you
press on the glass so you can use your
phone in a new way the iPad pro doesn't
have this technology for some reason
granted you could probably get similar
functionality by picking up the Apple
pencil but if 3d touch caught your eye
you might actually want to wait for the
next generation iPad pro at number two
the price let's get down to the money
here you want the iPad pro it'll cost
you at least 800 dollars if you want a
version that runs on wireless carriers
there's only one and it costs one
thousand $79 oh and those cool demos
showing off at the Apple event with that
new stylus the Apple pencil will cost
another hundred dollars and if you want
that smart keyboard cover pony up
another 170 dollars please one thousand
three hundred and forty seven dollars is
what you'll pay for an LTE iPad pro with
those two accessories you know what time
it is it's time for Twitter I asked you
guys on Twitter what would stop you from
buying an iPad Pro Kamerion said I would
be more interested if it ran OS 10 that
would make it a real surface ripoff well
exactly what I want at scene D said the
lack of available software for my job UX
design and MJ Dumas said nothing I'm
buying thanks for your feedback and on
to number one and at number one
you think it'll replace your laptop when
I saw iOS 9 and it's multitasking
capabilities it looked like the iPad
could one day replace a laptop however
that day hasn't happened yet the iPad
pro still uses Apple's lightning
connector so accessories have to be
specially made for the iPad pro or
you're going to need something like
nning to whatever adapter had the iPad
pro made the move to USB C like Apple's
MacBook now that could have been
interesting there's also a question of
how well multitasking will work compared
to a traditional computer and so we draw
to a close another top five we're lucky
to have the best audience out there so
it's always great to hear from you on
Twitter if you disagreed or agreed with
this list let me know I'm at Aya's
thanks for watching and I'll see you
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
