Tank and we're not totally convinced we
really need all of them so we're gonna
try some out ready
nerd wax nerd wax stop your glasses from
slipping and do it in style do you put
this on like four hands okay okay
chapstick for your I think it's just
these like to go for it whatever okay
for the record I don't know if I would
put this on your Gucci $500 sunglass
okay are you ready for that
no this is beautiful okay it looks like
a book like a note Thank You Austin
it's a beautiful lamp that not only
lasts for like 10 hours of just light
but it also charges your phone for like
24 hours how much is it yeah that's the
problem it's a hundred and twenty-five
dollars but you're paying for a charger
basically for a charger and a flashlight
these are flavored face wipes because
normal face wipes taste like the bottom
of the Lysol package and most kids
probably don't want this on their face I
mean it tastes sweet
I can't we just licked up face white but
it tastes sweet babe with stevia so I
guess it's like low sugar but really
sweet yeah all right
the king of charging squatty potty oh my
god what the heck is this this is
basically the solution to the problem
with toilets toilets make you sit in an
unnatural position it stresses out your
colon your bowel so in a natural
squatting position you will eliminate
faster you'll be more comfortable with a
squatty potty Oh be right back
new pooped
I'm salt because it come with something
that's not plastic I'm so glad you asked
oh my god the mercedes-benz of squatty
potty yeah I'm gonna take that home with
me opening coconuts is extremely hard
you need a machete or you need a cleaver
so I present to you the Coco Jack I'm
terrified what the hell is this so it's
really only meant for young coconuts and
what you're supposed to do is not
supposed to do this I think you should
put this over here and yeah okay I mean
it's easier than a machete okay well
done
hello there you can also use it to open
up old coconuts that's a young coconut
this is an old here's that here it is
I don't know to do it this year don't if
you're impressed or upset I'm a little
terrified but I think I'm on board the
readings like it would probably be a
good thing to use maybe in my kitchen
and it's not easy all right then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
