augmented reality software built right
in and it is truly something to behold
the software is called tango the phone
is the Lenovo fab to pro and the two
together are an early look at how AR on
a phone could make the app to use so
much cooler by interacting with the
world around you in weird and wonderful
ways the problem is that tango isn't
very developed on its own and the phone
itself makes a lot of compromises to
make tango work for example it's really
big and heavy it should be because
there's a huge battery in it and lots of
processing power and you need both these
things to run the kind of intensive
programs that scan and track the real
world around you and then place things
in it but battery life drains really
quickly on the phone with its huge 6.4
inch screen is very bulky and awkward to
use apps you can download will make you
feel like Zeus on high as you kill
innocent villagers or preview how good a
lamp or appliance might look in your
room the possibilities are endless here
and the platform is just waiting for
developers to dive in but unfortunately
most of the apps so far are either
unintuitive inaccurate or simply poorly
made when air gets good enough that
virtual dominoes fall off the table and
onto the floor then we've truly made
strides for now though they just hang in
the air and that's a problem even if
you're curious about AR and like the fab
to pro size and price it just isn't a
stellar phone camera quality is so so
and it takes way too long to process a
photo I ran into issues here and there
with buggy software and drop calls to as
excited as I am to see a our cameras and
ir sensors together on the same phone
this just isn't the right combination
right girl
bottom line if you aren't a developer
trying to experiment with AR apps the
fab to pro isn't a good buy despite its
cutting-edge promise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
