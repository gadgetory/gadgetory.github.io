this is a review of the forest ps1
speaker in 2013 there's been a rash of
new wireless audio products hitting the
market from Samsung to Bose - sound
engineering company DTS play fired by
DTS is the latest attempt at a wireless
audio standard designed to compete with
current Kings Sonos and Apple AirPlay
forces PS Fon speaker is one of the
first products to be released with the
standard though more are promised for
CES 2014 the PS 1 is a stereo speaker
which resembles an iPod dock with its
large rubber holster but it won't
actually dock with anything not without
running a separate USB cable around the
back unfortunately when playing with it
though it does feel a little cheap in
its construction this speaker supports
both the play face standard and
Bluetooth and there are dedicated
buttons for each on the front of the
unit while bluetooth connection is the
most straightforward connecting via play
fire requires the forest app which isn't
as easy to use or configure as so
Knossos the app is available for iOS and
Android but they don't yet have the same
functionality for example you can't
currently stream from an ass or other
computer with the iOS app just the phone
itself and Pandora while DTS has
promised a lot of updates including high
resolution support a PC app and more
streaming services it's pretty much
limited to standard mp3 and flack and
Pandora playback performance though is
its biggest problem getting a solid
connection proved a hurdle with
occasional dropouts even over Wi-Fi and
the app would lose the dock completely
and need to reconnect in comparison our
Sonos play:1 didn't have these problems
and remained solid throughout sound
quality was pretty average - with a very
woolly mid-range e-type sound and the
play one blew it out of the water in
both bass response and fine detail given
that these two speakers are the same
price of $200 and the sonar system is so
good in comparison I can't yet recommend
to the forest PS one however I do look
forward to seeing what improvements DTS
can make with this system as it still
has a lot of promise it just needs to be
more reliable
this has been typing a brief for
cnet.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
