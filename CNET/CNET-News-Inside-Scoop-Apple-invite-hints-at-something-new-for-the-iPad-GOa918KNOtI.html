Jimmy does draining me a senior writer
for Cena Josh Lowensohn Josh thanks for
being with us my pleasure okay it seems
like we were just talking about the
invite for the iphone event now all of a
sudden it's October and we're talking
about the next set of invitations that
have just gone out this morning from
Apple describe what you got in your
inbox this morning yeah I mean it's
pretty much the same exact thing that
happened last time we have the iphone in
September and now we have what's
probably gonna be the iPads in October
it can be a bit predictable isn't it
yeah but it makes a lot of sense to me
this is right before the holidays they
get to push out new products and all the
little kiddies get their tablet under
the tree or Hanukkah bush or what have
you hopefully in time you know okay so
describe the invitation for us we always
like to read between the lines yeah so
last last time for the iphone is circles
which was kind of a hint about the home
button this time it just basically says
we have a little bit more to cover which
is kind of allusion to the smart cover
which covers the ipad what we think but
it's basically just a series of the
apple leaf in the apple logo just kind
of floating around it's not exactly
foretelling of the future okay and give
us the details when and where next
tuesday october twenty second at the
yerba buena center for the arts in san
francisco which is just right down the
street from where seen it is right
that's where they introduced the first
iPad that's where the ipad 2 it's kind
of a go-to place to do tablets so it's
it's actually really nice venue it holds
a lot of people right it's down asking a
lot of people right exactly the we have
a lot to cover line in the invitation so
covers this is maybe not the grand
innovation that some people were hoping
for is it no and so that the key thing
to think about here there's been a
series of leaks for this new iPad we're
basically just expecting a redesigned
version the full-size iPad that looks a
lot more like the ipad mini with kind of
narrower sides okay so obviously if they
do make an area where they have to make
a new magnetic cover for it ah it's
really not very exciting not terribly
exciting but people will still get crazy
excited about yeah sure I think the hard
thing now is that if you look at what
Microsoft's doing especially with the
surface they have these covers that have
batteries they have keyboards they have
track pads they basically turn your
tablet into to a mini oh yeah
yeah Apple's put out patents for things
like that but I don't think we're
expecting anything close to that okay so
we're not going to see a six inch
version that was a sort of off the wall
rumor that we had I'm circulating I
would not expect that this year you know
there's already been a bunch of leaks
and I think the big kind of mystery and
unknown is whether we get a Retina
display I've had mini so something with
four times the amount of pixels as last
year's model all right well let's
something to look forward to i suppose
and you will be at the event of course
it will be there in force and you'll be
live blogging live blogging we're not
sure if apple's streaming or not that's
usually not something we know till the
day out but yeah well at pictures live
updates all that stuff so definitely
tune in streaming or not you can always
come to seen it to find out what's
happening Josh thanks so much my
pleasure for inside scoop I'm Sumi das
