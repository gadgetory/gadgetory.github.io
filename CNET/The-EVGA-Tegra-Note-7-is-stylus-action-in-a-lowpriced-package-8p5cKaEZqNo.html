designed by Nvidia and released through
its partners it includes a Tegra 4
processor costs two hundred dollars for
16 gigabytes of storage and the first
partner to take the jump is EB da a
noted seller of nvidia geforce graphics
cards the note 7 comes with a stylus and
even its own pocket of the pin there are
typical connections like the headphone
jack micro HDMI and microUSB as well as
a 5 megapixel back camera and a VGA
front camera there's also a microSD slot
on the right edge for storage expansion
at the ends of the side bezels are two
full speakers and a subwoofer on the
bottom vertical edge the back has this
nice feeling texture on it which works
for me is some kind of a sucker for that
kind of thing there's also this tablet
length groove here it's here so you can
insert the included cover that's fine if
you're always using a cover however if
the covers lost or broken or you just
don't want to use it then the blue
becomes this really distracting and
uncomfortable part of the tablet you
can't really do anything about the back
has also been magnetized so that the
cover can actually stick to and prop the
tablet up the tablet is pretty well
integrated when you first remove it it
prompts you with a choice of launching
two different styles compatible apps
drawing with the stylus seems to be
pretty fast responsive and accurate all
that you want with a stylus however I
still need to spend some time with it to
truly get a feel for how it works the
back camera takes decent shots but
include some useful bells and whistles
like multi shot mode and an HDR or high
dynamic range mode the note 7 has a
screen resolution of 1280 by 800 that's
slow by today's standards and not
surprisingly it's not as sharp as the
nexus 7 or kindle fire HDX 7 screens
games performance is up there with the
Nvidia shield which is impressive given
that this is a two-hundred-dollar tablet
the Tegra note 7 offers a lot for two
hundred dollars it's
evidently the cheapest stylists habit
that I know of for sure also has great
gains performance and the stylist aspect
seemed to be pretty well integrated but
check out my full review at cnet com
more information and my final
recommendation i'm eric franklin and
this has been a first look at the EVGA
