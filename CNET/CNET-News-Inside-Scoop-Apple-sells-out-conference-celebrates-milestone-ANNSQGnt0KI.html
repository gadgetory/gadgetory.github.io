I'm cnet's Cara Savoy joined by cnet's
Josh Lowensohn and we were just checking
in with Josh ticket to the latest update
on Apple news and Josh it sounds like
the big thing going on right now is this
crazy interest in WWDC Apple's Worldwide
Developers Conference coming up in June
it's been going on for years but why so
much interest this year well it's really
the only time of year that Apple holds a
conference for developers the rest of
the time it's just kind of press events
so they really kind of get hands-on
experience they get time to ask
questions with with engineers who are
there in Apple staffers but it's also
really all about the keynote that's when
they unveil new stuff they've shown off
new iPhones there they've shown off new
versions of iOS and Mac os10 new
hardware it's really kind of their
chance to be a part of that with what
the press usually get and what kind of
demand are we looking at this year so
typically they have about 5,000
attendees and all those people sign up
immediately and so this morning that
sold out in two minutes which is just
crazy it took two hours last year
incredible and these tickets aren't
cheap either you know there's sixteen
hundred dollars and you already need to
be registered with apple as a developer
which means you need to usually pay
about a hundred bucks on top of that so
it's a huge benefit for them but it also
you know it's expensive they have to
rent moscone west for an entire week you
listed some of the announcements that
have come in previous years are we
expecting something huge from Apple this
year that would drive up demand like
this it's really safe to expect just
software which doesn't sound very
exciting but apples already said they're
going to show off new versions of OS 10
and iOS so that's for the mac and for
their iphone and ipad things like that
they showed off iOS 6 there last year we
got it about three months later they're
kind of behind on OS 10 it seems so we
can see both of those things kind of
coming together for the public just a
couple months after that but still this
isn't where we're going to see like an
Apple watch or an apple TV set finally
this is just no incremental software the
key thing to remember is that they're
doing this for developers it's really to
kind of give them an early chance to
build stuff and get used to new
platforms so they can really kind of get
their apps and software ready to go for
the more consumer a stuff they tend out
the whole their own events
so I would expect something like a watch
or a TV to be separate that doesn't mean
that there won't be a surprise they've
done the hardware there before last year
they did a retina MacBook Pros and like
I said before they the iphone sure
there's always like a little bit of
surprise okay well speaking of popular
software this weekend does mark the
10-year anniversary of iTunes that's
pretty amazing yes the itunes store
store so I Tunes itself is you know 12
years old going on 13 but the itunes
store is turning 10 on sunday which is
just crazy yeah that 10 years has gone
by so fast do you have any idea how many
downloads in the last 10 years yes so
they've announced a 25 billion songs
sold which is just nuts so I think that
works out to 15,000 songs per second on
average it's just it's nuts and it's
it's becoming their fourth largest
business just behind max Wow and so it's
continuing to grow it hasn't stalled out
no infection competition it's growing a
lot and a lot of that's just because of
apps it's kind of funny we did the math
and if you actually take the expected
revenue just from itunes alone it's more
than three times as large as yahoo did
all year so it's it's not it's not a
small thing Apple seems to be making
money hand over fist these days they're
doing okay they are thank you so much
see that's Josh loads and I'm card a su
boy you've been watching the inside
