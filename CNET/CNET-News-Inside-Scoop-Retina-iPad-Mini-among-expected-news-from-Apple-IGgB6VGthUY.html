stupid aah straining me a senior writer
for Cena Josh Lowensohn Josh thanks for
being with us yeah my pleasure doing
something a little different today we
are in a specific location at the yerba
buena center for the arts because
tomorrow at this time what's gonna be
happening here Kaos organized chaos
you'll be a part of it yes we're gonna
be there in for us we got a few people
going inside right here it's gonna be
ground zero for probably new iPads a new
Macs and some new software too okay
let's talk specifics then let's hit the
iPads first we're probably going to see
not a different size of the ipad but
some finer finely tuned features yeah
yeah the big expectation is that will
see a bigger iPad that looks a lot more
like the ipad mini with rounded corners
and thinner kind of that at portrait
style where the edges aren't as thin
right also what we're expecting is a
retina iPad Mini yeah this is the thing
we didn't get with the first generation
I've had you know we had that first kind
of 1024 x 7 80 kind of displayed it
looked okay but it wasn't quite up to
par with some of the other devices so
we're expecting something very sharp and
if you're excited about that ipad mini
with the retina display you should
probably act quickly if they announced
it because there's another report that's
surfaced from their having a couple of
reports floating around that suggest it
it's gonna be a limited supply the same
kind of thing happened with some older
products that have come out with retina
displays where they were kind of hard to
get at first right I don't think we have
a good indication that but the fact that
they're launching that probably a long
side an updated version or older version
of the ipad mini means it could be sure
yeah there's still a question mark about
whether or not we'll see a fingerprint
sensor carrying over from the iphone
yeah and and reports are going to
diverging on that some suggested that
will only see it on the full-size iPad
not the mini um I kind of think that if
they are gonna put it on the ipad it'll
come the mini too cuz that's really
device that people carry around with
them right and that's the kind of thing
where you do want to pass word on that
it just makes a lot of sense yep okay
and it's not just iPads tomorrow though
they're probably gonna cover some other
ground because this is the last Apple
event before the holiday season kicks
into gear yes and I max her almost a
sure
that we got the mac pro which is their
big weird tube like desktop the Darth
Vader's right we still have a price or
release date on that we're probably
gonna get both those things tomorrow and
some of the people I talk to you is on
the analyst suggestion it could be like
twenty eight hundred dollars to start
even higher so this is definitely gonna
be a high high-end machine the question
is if Apple price it down cheaper and
it's not just going to be hardware there
will be some software news to possibly
yeah we're expecting a full price and
release day for mavericks which is the
next version of OS 10 I think we're also
expecting some new ilife software and I
work software for the iOS some of the
details about that leaked out over the
weekend so I expect Apple up they pulled
those things this week all right you
will be inside you'll be live blogging
the whole thing so we won't miss a
single detail live photos and videos it
all starts at 9am with a live video show
okay so just go to cnet for more
information josh thanks for chatting
with us absolutely for inside scoop im
sue need us thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
