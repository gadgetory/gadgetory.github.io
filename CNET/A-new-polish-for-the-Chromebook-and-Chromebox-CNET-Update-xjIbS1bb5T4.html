trip goodbye to Nextel and pay with
green pigs I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your scene at update the reviews are out
for samsung's new google chromebook and
chromebox running on the newly updated
chrome operating system and the bottom
line is that it's better than the last
version but still pretty unimpressive if
you're unfamiliar with chrome it's a
light system designed for people who do
all their work in the cloud through a
web browser so you better have an
internet connection to get work done and
as for programs you're limited to
whatever is in the chrome ecosystem but
this laptop starts at 450 bucks way too
pricey when you think that you can get a
tablet for less and it can do more the
chromebox is the desktop version at the
more affordable 330 dollars which you
might make a little more sense if you're
looking for something basic it's now
available online and hitting select best
buy stores next month folks some tragic
news today the nextel network will
officially be killed off this 2g
push-to-talk network owned by sprint
will see its final days in june next
year and Sprint is pushing customers to
migrate to direct connect technology but
there is some good news the chirp walkie
talkie sound will still live on there's
a new weapon in cyber warfare and it's
called flame the massive attack has
infected computers in the Middle East
mostly in Iran it's not clear who
exactly is behind the attack but
security experts believe it is
sophisticated enough to be created by a
government it doesn't try to steal
banking info like your typical cyber
criminal it's also more complex than
something from an activist flame just
digs for any intelligence it can read
emails take screenshots record audio
keystrokes it's very complex making it
hard to detect and remove there's angry
birds games toys clothing a movie even a
cookbook and now we have the biggest
bird brain marking scheme yet The
Associated Press is reporting that a
bank in Russia is offering special Angry
Birds MasterCard debit cards called
angry cards and it would give users a
ten percent discount on game related
products we've heard reports for some
time now about Apple creating its own 3d
mapping software for mobile devices the
latest buzz comes from the blog boy
genius report
which obtains some photos of the new map
app but it's all out of focus mo shots
are covered by a finger I've seen better
pictures taken a Bigfoot be sure to
check out Apple CEO Tim Cook's chat this
evening at the d10 conference at 6pm
Pacific sea night we'll be live-blogging
his public interview but don't expect
any new apple product announcements you
can be sure he'll save that for apples
