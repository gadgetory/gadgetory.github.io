the stage president and CEO head of IT
and mobile communications division DJ
kool
hello everyone and I'm excited to show
you the next version of the world's most
powerful mobile device not just any
smartphone or smartphone
powerful enough to keep up with you
wherever you are whatever you are doing
whatever you need ladies and gentlemen
it is my great pleasure to present the
all-new galaxy note 9
you shouldn't have to plan your day
around your phone's battery life that's
why we created an all-day battery the
largest ever on a note no more worrying
that your GPS will die right when you
need it most
no more begging co-workers to borrow a
charger instead you can power through
your entire day with just the phone in
your pocket right fact is we meet our
phones to last all day and we're storing
more on them than ever before so note 9
starts at a minimum of 128 gigabytes
that's twice as much space before so you
don't have to pick and choose which
photos videos and apps you can live
without with that amount of storage you
could download close to 670 hours of
movies and TV shows that's enough to get
you through 30 round-trip flights from
New York to Madrid and that's just to
start with you can also get a 512 gig
person that's the one that I want just
like its predecessors note 9 also comes
with expandable storage and get this
soon with Samsung's upcoming 512 gig
microSD card you'll be able to get as
much as one terabyte of memory one new
terabyte has more than most laptops but
the ultimate test of all this power and
speed is gaming to get a truly great
gaming experience on a smartphone you
need a device that packs a serious punch
but don't take it from me let's hear
from someone who created one of the most
popular games on the market today ladies
and gentlemen please welcome the founder
and CEO of Epic Games Tim Sweeney
epic games launched our most successful
game yet fortnight so today there are
over a hundred 25 million people around
the world building bases gathering
weapons and getting ready for the next
storm and the judging by the tweets just
about every gamer wants to know the same
thing when is fortnight coming to
Android so uh about that we're going to
be launching the fortnight beta on
Android this week and players with
Samsung Galaxy devices are the first to
be invited starting right now
also gamers who play gal fortnight on a
note 9 or tab s4 will also get access to
a special skin galaxy yeah what really
excites us about this partnership is
that Samsung makes the best performing
Android devices in the world and the
note 9 represents a real revolution for
mobile gaming that brings a console
quality 100 player fortnight experience
to Android now Epic Games has always
been on the cutting edge of mobile
gaming and together with Samsung we're
ushering mobile gaming into a new era of
high-end games for gamers and we can't
wait to see how players around the world
to enjoy it thank you very much no.9
whatever you're doing your phone works
for you giving you the performance that
you need and nowhere is that more true
than weather though it's powerful
intelligent camera back in February we
reimagined what a camera could do with
an incredible dual app at your
smartphone camera because when it comes
to capturing a great photo there's
almost nothing more important than light
just like your eye Note 9s camera adapts
to your environment if you're out at
night the aperture widens to let in more
light and if it's a bright sunny day the
aperture contracts to let in less light
so we started with one of the most
powerful smartphone cameras in the world
and now we're
building on that foundation with note
nines brand new intelligent camera some
things are always going to be out of our
control maybe your friend blinked maybe
you didn't see the smudge on the lens
until it was too late
seriously there's nothing worse than
asking someone to take a photo of you
and your friends I'll need to get your
phone back and realize that the photo
looks terrible well now when Evernote 9s
camera detects a flaw like closed eyes
or image blur it'll automatically notify
you so you can take another shot before
the moments gone no tonight's camera
also uses scene recognition to identify
different subjects like flowers
food a variety of landscapes and then
based on the scene it optimizes the
color tones so that every shot you take
is Instagram ready but what if you could
take a better photo without all that
hassle here let me show you what I'm
talking about make my way over to the
camera and you know this is just too
cool of a moment I don't think I want to
take this one alone I need to Matt you
want to join me
alright here we go let's get in here
alright one two three I need my good
side one two three eager album cover
all right looking good let's see perfect
yeah there we go well you might have
noticed that I took those photos without
even touching the phone I used this tell
you all about note nines powerful new s
Finn please welcome my good friend and
Tavis for video sensation John Wong the
new S Pen has some pretty cool new
functions that's because now it supports
Bluetooth Low Energy
to turn it into the ultimate remote
control you can use it to play and pause
YouTube videos so don't smudge the
screen with my greasy pizza hands to
capture snaps and snapchat and take your
selfie game to the next level or flip
through some slides in Microsoft
PowerPoint well work in the room
speaking of work in the room you can
even use it to control something much
much bigger in fact I've been
controlling this presentation with my
s-pen I know pretty cool I check it out
I can go backwards I can go forward all
with a simple click of the s-pen
that's not all right now we're working
with a handful of partners soon we'll
open up the SDK to everyone so that you
all can come up with your own creative
ways of using the S Pen these days your
phone is basically like a supercomputer
that fits in your pocket so why not
extend that computing power to a bigger
screen Samsung Dex is a PC like
experience powered entirely by your
Galaxy smartphone with Dex built into
the note 9 all the computing power I
need is in my pocket Dex is designed for
the work anywhere generation and now
it's simpler and more convenient than
ever because the only thing needs to
start Dex is this that's right all you
need is a single HDMI adapter just like
the one you'd use to connect your phone
to a TV let me show you all I need to do
the connect is this
it's as simple as that
I just plug in my note 9 and I'm index
all powered by my note 9 index doesn't
just work with your phone you can also
use it with the device we just saw the
tab s4 to turn it into a true
Productivity machine combined with the
s-pen gives you an even larger canvas
for your notes or your doodles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
