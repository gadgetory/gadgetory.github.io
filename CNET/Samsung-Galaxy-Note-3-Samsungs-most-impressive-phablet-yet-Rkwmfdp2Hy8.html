and right now we're taking a first look
at Samsung's latest beast of a phone
tablet hybrid that's right my friends
I'm holding in my hands the galaxy note
3 shipping now and hitting US carriers
in force in October 2013 the note 3
costs to 9999 on verizon and AT&amp;amp;T
t-mobile sells a device for a lower one
9999 up front but you're on the hook for
24 monthly payments of $21 sprint and US
Cellular have also said they expect to
scoop up the note 3 soon now I know that
three hundred dollars is a heck of a lot
of dough to cough up for a smartphone on
contract the galaxy note 3 though has a
ton of awesome features a fresh design
plus cutting-edge software and
components and oh yes the mighty s-pen
which samsung is so proud of measuring 6
inches long by 3.1 inches wide and just
a third of an inch thick the note 3 is
only a hair taller and wider than its
predecessor it's a smidge lighter to 5.9
ounces compared to the note 2's 6.4
ounces it's an impressive engineering
feat considering the note 3 packs a
bigger screen than its predecessor and
my what a screen it is spanning a
massive 5.7 inches across the note 3's
AMOLED display is not only big it has an
extremely sharp full HD 1080p resolution
which samsung says provides an ultrafine
385 PPI the high contrast display
produces well saturated colors as well
with deep blacks and boasts wide viewing
angles samsung has gussied up the note
3's design to the edges are molded info
metallic silver complete with
distinctive ridgelines another
controversial design choice is the back
plate which flaunts a fake leather motif
it's pseudo organic patterned surface
has an almost leatherette quality to it
there's even mock stitching running
around it the upside is it resists
fingerprints and is easy for your
fingers to grip the downside is since
it's made from thin plastic it lacks the
premium feel of real metal or expensive
polycarbonate personally I like the
notes new look and it ryans me of
classic Samsonite briefcases from the
night
1860s very cool indeed the note 3 runs
Android 4.3 jelly bean powered by a
blazing two point three gigahertz
quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor
backing this up is not two but three
gigabytes of RAM along with 32 gigabytes
of internal storage better still is the
phones huge 3200 milliamp battery which
samsung claims will power the device for
15 hours straight it's removable too so
you can swap in a fresh battery if you
have one handy to add more memory the
note 3 has an SD card slot but you'll
have to remove the battery to get at it
above the screen is a 2-megapixel
front-facing camera below is a physical
home button and two capacitive android
keys buttons for power and volume sit on
the right and the left side while
there's a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
up top around back is a notes 13
megapixel camera with LED flash the note
3's camera app comes with the huge
bucket of shooting modes you'll find on
the galaxy s4 they range from the very
useful such as HDR burst panorama to the
strange like beauty face golf and eraser
which removes people and moving objects
in the background on the bottom lip is
what really sets the note 3 apart from
other smartphones its S Pen Stylus
Samsung made the tool more compact and
has given the note 3 slick new abilities
when you pull the S Pen out of its
sheath a little fan shaped graphic
called the Air Command appears you can
also activate it by holding the pen
close to the screen and pressing its
button Air Command has five main options
action memo scrapbooker screen write s
finder and pen window just tap a
selection to launch the feature action
memo lets you create a handwritten note
then email it save it to your contacts
use it in a text or look it up on a map
you can also convert notes into to-do
lists and even port them over to
Evernote for safekeeping scrapbooker
lassos images and content you see
whether that be from a website photos or
youtube videos to save in a virtual
scrapbook the s finder function will
search the phone for keywords including
your handwritten notes and present a
list of documents with relevant
information hitting pen window allows
you to draw
box on the screen then select an
application that will fill that space so
for instance you can have your email or
web browser open then pull up a little
window for the calculator phone or
contacts which will float above
everything even Wilder is the advanced
multi window that allows you to open
multiple application windows at once
then even drag and drop content between
them Samsung has also taken a cue from
HTC and it's blinkfeed news aggregator
which first appeared in the HTC One
swiping upwards from the home screen on
the note 3 launches the my magazine news
viewer using technology from the popular
flipboard app my magazine serves up
articles and news stories from a variety
of websites I'm Brian Bennett for cnet
