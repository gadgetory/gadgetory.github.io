smaller than the Xbox one losses that
awful power brick and can stream 4k
video and playback 4k Ultra HD blu-ray
as well as support for HDR it looks
pretty badass in its fancy white case
and that slotted design it has side by
side next to the original Xbox one and
even the current ps4 the new s model
looks more practical in fact just a few
days with the new Xbox one s and the old
one seems like it's a relic from a
decade ago so what's new with the Xbox
one s well it can do everything the
original Xbox one can but adds in 4k and
HDR capability HDR lets tvs display a
lot more color and more finer detail it
comes in three harddrive sizes a 500 gig
a 1 terabyte and a 2 terabyte version
now the 1s introduces a new controller
but it feels cheaper to me I don't
really like the plastic grips on the
back and the d-pad just doesn't feel
quite as precise as the original but the
controller does have bluetooth support
so now you can use it with other devices
so we really had a tough time getting 4k
and more specifically HDR to work
correctly with the Xbox one s and a
number of TVs we tested it with it
forced us to play trial and error with a
bunch of different settings was
frustrating and honestly the end result
is a bit underwhelming 4k streaming
worked well with Netflix but you do need
to have series bandwidth to support that
so do you need to buy an xbox one s
probably not you definitely don't need
to upgrade to one unless 4k and HDR is
the most important thing to you and only
a small handful of games will even
support HDR games will not play in 4k
the only upscale to it xbox won't get
true 4k gaming until Project Scorpio
arrives which Microsoft is targeting to
the 2017 holiday season if this is the
first Xbox one you're going to buy and
you do own a 4k TV well then yeah this
is the one to get but a 4k isn't in the
cards for you and you also don't want to
wait a year for Project Scorpio you
may even want to consider getting an
older Xbox one if you can find it for
cheaper which odds are you can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
