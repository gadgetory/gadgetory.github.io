and beware of bogus ads on Facebook I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update the next version of the android
operating system known as lollipop is
now rolling out android tends to spread
out its updates over time right now the
lollipop upgrade is being pushed out to
Moto X and G along with Nexus phones and
tablets but some developers with a Nexus
device seem to be having problems
connecting to Wi-Fi after installing the
update a few reports of this problem
were posted to Google's bug report forum
it seems like buggy software updates are
part of the norm these days but if you
have a device that lets you upgrade now
head to seen it for your guide on all
things lollipop the brand new Nexus 6 is
loaded with lollipop and Sprint is the
first to sell it for three hundred
dollars with the usual two-year contract
a teensy will have the phone on Tuesday
for two hundred and fifty dollars with a
contract t-mobile gets it Wednesday and
verizon will also sell it but it hasn't
set a date or price yet the newest
amazon kindle e-readers are also getting
a software update it lets you share
books with family members accounts such
as a spouse or partner the update also
brings a feature called word wise short
definitions appear automatically above
difficult words for children expanding
their vocabulary and people learning
English the update will appear
automatically on devices in the coming
weeks or if you can't wait you can
manually download it yourself changes
are also coming to skype microsoft is
testing a beta version of skype video
chat service it'll work with a variety
of browsers so you don't need to
download a special skype app or plugin
and in other news if you see an ad on
facebook for cheap ray-ban sunglasses or
discounted louis vuitton bags don't
believe it cyber security researchers
examined more than 1,000 facebook ads
and found about twenty-five percent of
ads for luxury fashion goods we're
sending people to sites that sold
counterfeits
to get these scam ads all you have to do
is like a few fashion brands and the ads
start to target you these bargain ads
were tied to websites from China that
were trying to fool people into looking
like the actual brand website the pages
even have fake security logos to lure
you into thinking it's safe facebook
says it has a team to remove misleading
ads but it didn't comment further now
when you're looking for deals online
this holiday season just remember if it
sounds too good to be true it probably
is that's your tech news update and
there's always more as cnet com you
could stay updated by following me on
twitter and subscribing to our podcast
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
