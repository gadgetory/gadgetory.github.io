looking at the neato signature Pro 15
robot vacuum this is a Roomba
alternative and a lot of people are
going to like the price at $449 a couple
hundred dollars cheaper than the Roomba
or the LG home by the neato
distinguishes itself from other robot
vacuums with his ordered approach to
cleaning a room it'll map out the
perimeter and find the obstacles and the
furniture in the way and then go back
and forth through all of it which is a
really nice approach it does a good job
covering the space and it stands in
stark contrast to other robot vacuums
that employ a zig zagging kind of
chaotic drunken Zamboni driver approach
the neato is also really easy to use you
just press this button to wake it up and
then press it again to have it start
cleaning you can also set a daily
schedule at the same time every day or
different times at different days and we
like that a lot that's a really nice
customizable feature that works well
another nice feature about the neato is
the bin it lifts out right at the top of
the machine you don't have to flip it
over and it cleans really easily the
filter comes right out and you can dump
out the dust it's really nice you can
also swap out the brush on the underside
of the neato for easier cleaning on
different surfaces this one here is
really good on carpet some good for pet
hair but there's also a brush they offer
that's great for hardwoods if you listen
as it starts up you'll notice that it's
also a little bit loud the loudest robot
vacuum that we tested it even sounds a
bit like a jet engine on the runway
taking off
in all of our tests Veneto performed
very well especially on carpets and with
pet hair so the knee toes are really
good vacuum but is it a good robot
vacuum there are some features missing
we would have liked to have seen the
knee toe doesn't have a remote and it
doesn't have any customizable cleaning
modes it's going to clean it the way it
wants every time and you can't change
that if you take a look at the neato in
action you'll see that it's a really
slow robot vacuum and in fact it's the
slowest robot vacuum that we tested I
think this is a good thing it takes its
time and it picks things up and does a
great job it does a better job in most
other robot vacuums also it might be a
funny thing to mention in a review but
the personality factor on this machine
isn't quite there the Roomba has got a
little bit of a life of its own it's
sort of like r2d2 this is more like
something you'd see cleaning the Death
Star and maybe that's appealing for you
but for some it's not going to be quite
as fun or playful as you want the bottom
line for us is that the neato is a great
robot vacuum and one that we are happy
to recommend it cleans well it's easy to
use and at $449 the price really can't
be beat especially if you're a pet owner
or you have carpets for cnet.com I'm Rui
Chris thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
