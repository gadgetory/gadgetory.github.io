song here and welcome to the apple byte
it's all the good and bad inside the
world of Apple and I just enjoyed a
cranberry walnut cookie for lunch now we
start off with really the story of the
week from nine to five Mac who's been
all over it lately and images of what
they claim to be the back panels for the
next-gen iphone and there are a lot of
details that can be pulled from this if
they're in fact the real deal now these
potential images show the black and
white versions with a larger portion of
the backing made of metal you'll see the
slight difference in color and material
could be a stylistic choice or the
current prototype design but it also
looks like the metal antenna banned from
the 4 and 4s design has now been
embedded into the panel now let's take a
look at some more booty shots you'll
also see the rumored smaller dock
connector is part of the case design
with newly designed speaker grilles and
the headphone jack looks like it's been
moved to the bottom as well there's also
a microphone between the rear camera and
flash to possibly capture better audio
9to5 mac also has an image of the frame
that shows a space for a physical home
button so it should still be there and
according to their sources the frame is
the same width as the current iPhone but
just longer to accommodate the larger
4-inch screen with the reported 1136 x
640 resolution now a full-frontal image
of what's claimed to be the next gen
black iphone also shows the FaceTime
camera has moved and will be centered
above the earpiece and the city of blog
possibly confirms this after they
received an image from a tipster of what
they believe is a schematic blueprint of
the iphone 5 that jives with the parts
and panels we just talked about now we
told you last week we don't expect to
see the iphone announced at WWDC boo who
cares we already kind of know what it
looks like
in more Apple rumor news a report from
boy genius report says Apple is plenty
to demo a brand new version of the Apple
TV next week at WWDC they report it will
be much more feature complete and it's
the same one that will run on Apple's
upcoming HDTV now that sounds a little
like a stretch but it's reported that
Apple has also been trying to court
third-party manufacturers to make
accessories that are compatible with the
new Apple TV OS and their new TV now the
big a is also ready to unveil their new
maps app boy Jesus report says it has a
new user interface and a brand new
navigation bar in order to see the 3d
maps you'll just need to peel back the
bottom corner like you do with the
current maps to access the button we'd
also like to thank them for the blurry
top secret spy pictures because now I
know what it's like to have my mom's
eyeballs also at this year's d10
conference Apple CEO Tim Cook was the
headline speaker and there were a lot of
nuggets that came out of it Tim didn't
say Apple is working on a TV but with
the increased success of Apple TV sales
he did say this is an area of intense
interest for us we are going to keep
pulling the string and see where it
takes us so they're making a TV out of
string now cook also talked Siri and
said it has proven that people want to
relate to the phone in a different way
people will be pleased with where Apple
is taking Siri and they are doubling
down on it which I hope they do when
asked if Apple will be less secret with
him at the helm Cook said there will be
incredible things coming out and Apple
is going to double down on secrecy on
products see I think he meant starting
this week after the recent iphone parts
in the schematic leaks and finally Tim
reflected on Steve Jobs and said he
never really felt the weight of trying
to be Steve it's not his goal in life
and he's focused on being a great CEO
for Apple but he offered some insight as
to how s J's mind works but he was the
best person in the world about doing
this he would get he would flip on
something so fast that you would forget
that he was the person that was taking
the 180 polar position on it the day
before the meeting has milady been that
hair on this day I did that here on the
stage many times but he was me
was an art and he would never know that
he fought the opposite we actually have
videotape but the government so you've
got prude I saw it daily I saw it daily
in and this is a gift because this is a
gift because things do change and it
takes courage to change and courage to
say I'm now wrong maybe I was right
before but maybe not maybe I was never
right it takes courage to do that and I
think he had that see that sounds just
like my boss and if I'm no longer here
for future episodes of the apple byte
you'll know why alright that's going to
do it for this week's show send us your
emails for the Apple bite at cnet com
and we'll get to as many as we can
thanks for watching i'm brian Tong will
catch you guys next time for another
bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
