the floor at the 2014 LA Auto Show and
I'm about to get a look at Google's new
in-car app system that's right it's
Android auto and we're gonna see it
behind the wheel of this 2015 Hyundai
Sonata now here in the Sonata and we've
got our Android phone plugged up by a
USB to the Hyundai's infotainment system
and the first thing that you'll notice
is that the on-screen interface looks a
whole lot like Google now on your
Android lollipop device you've got some
sort of contextual information about
commute times and what the current
weather is like and also your recent
call information but then getting past
that you get integration with a bunch of
different apps popping into the phone
system right here you'll see your recent
calls everything's very simplified and
you don't actually really have to touch
the screen to gain access to any of
these things you can hit a button here
on the steering wheel and sort of give
Google those sort of voice controls that
you're used to using on your phone call
Joey Allen Joey mobile and it operates
just like it would on your phone and it
kind of looks a lot like it does on your
phone you hit the map button and you pop
it to an interface that looks a lot like
Google Maps and again you have those
sort of Google Voice commands that you
can give here navigate to the nearest
coffee shop catch the one you want
and then you're on your way now we've
seen some of this before at Google i/o
when this system was demonstrate it but
one of the things we're seeing right now
is our first implementation of
third-party apps Google's are sort of
released an API that allows third-party
app developers to develop for Android
auto and get their apps working in your
car now currently it only supports audio
apps that are gonna be things like
podcasting your news readers and
messaging apps they kind of want to
limit you to things that aren't going to
be distracting in the car and that are
going to be useful when you're behind
the wheel so the all of the audio apps
are gonna kind of look more or less the
same Google Play Music has larger album
artwork in the back and an orange color
scheme and when you pop into Spotify it
looks pretty much the same except for
its green the reason behind that if they
don't want you fiddling around with a
lot of complex controls they want the
play button in the same place every time
so you're not gonna spend a lot of time
filling around the screen you'll have
more time with your hands on the
steering wheel and on the road now one
of the most distracting things you can
do in the car is fiddle around with text
messages so we have something in place
here with Android auto that's gonna help
you deal with that text messages from
third-party messaging app and text
method just come in and notifications
and are read aloud by the system without
you having to take your hands off of the
wheel now I can respond to that text
message via voice using the steering
wheel controls reply see your message
I'll be there in about 10 minutes
there's your message I'll be there in
about 10 minutes do you want to send it
sure big message now I've received the
message and reply to the message with
minimal interaction with the screen very
cool now you'll be able to get your
hands on Android auto in the 2015
Hyundai Sonata sometime in mid 2015
Hyundai's gonna bring it to the market
alongside apples apple carplay and pro
payment system for iPhone devices I've
an inch long goodwin on the floor at the
2014 LA Auto Show be sure to stay tuned
to the rest of our coverage of the show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
