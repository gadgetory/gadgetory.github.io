took out a stick and beat the camera
within an inch of its life to make it a
hipper car with some cooler technology
including M tune let's drive the 2012
XLE v6 with the Entune head unit and
check all the tech but this being an xle
we've got the high tone trim you got
this stitching and all these nice soft
finishes let's just say the Camry looks
a lot nicer when it's a nice one
then it ever did before kind of a more
grown-up luxurious look not that kind of
doughy transportation appliance it long
was but let's get to the real action
here the head unit we've got the
ultimate head unit here which is what
they call their advanced navigation
system and one of the things you'll see
is that I can do a split screen and I've
always liked Toyota and Lexus rendering
the quality of the graphics to me this
is one of the best screens in a car
today beyond that it's a standard Toyota
navigation system that we've seen many
times and the interface is good very
clear one thing about it though it's a
touchscreen of course sometimes I found
it was very hard to get these touch
buttons to react sometimes they're light
sometimes I got to mash them with my
thumb I don't fits temperature-related
or a different mode of the system but
sometimes it can be a little bit of a
pain our media options are many on this
car because we've got it as a high trim
car with the top-end head unit we have a
USB plus iPod down in here there's also
an auxilary jack there for your basic
fallback AM FM HD radio with iTunes
tagging Sirius XM satellite radio is
standard as is a2dp bluetooth streaming
the biggest innovation on this camry is
it's the first car from Toyota to
feature their new in tune system it's
under the apps button that's been kind
of grafted onto the old info button here
and then you get this app selection on
the screen and that takes you into five
apps that come down through a single app
on your smart phone
I get Bing for search and the results
are very simplified and they're really
kind of oriented toward navigation i
heart radio streaming Clear Channel
Radio stations live stations around the
country movie tickets calm look up
movies and buy tickets live open table
for restaurant reservations
of course pandora is pretty common in
cars these days now see our separate
video on the end to insistence you
really get some detail on this but I'll
say in general this is the best basket
of apps in a car so far I like the fact
that you installed just one app on your
phone it pulls these down from the cloud
and the way they've optimized everything
for the car looks and works well
downsides are too much is locked out
when the car is driving and even then
too many of these apps don't respond to
voice command so they kind of go off in
a wasteland unless the car is still
Toyota's got to figure out their game on
that front a couple things to note on
this car it is trying to be very green
then of course that's not a hybrid or
anything like that and there's no auto
start/stop technology but you do have
something I've never seen before that
needle is an average mpg gauge not a
readout digitally but that needle
actually moves around and hovers and
monitors your historic mpg it's
interesting way of showing it and right
around it you've got those green segment
bars those show your instantaneous
economy as you're driving and finally
the eco light tells you when you're
driving as economically as the engine is
capable of one choice on the gearbox a
six-speed automatic that has a sport
gate now everybody has to do these days
no paddles on the wheel though unless
you get the SE model now pretty
garden-variety stuff in this Camry it's
a carryover three and a half liter v6
good motor get you 268 horsepower 248
foot-pounds of torque
while getting this roughly 3,300 pound
car up to 16 around six and a half
seconds your mileage is 2130 EPA rated
it's gonna give you around twenty four
then as an average this car is also
available as a four-cylinder with more
like 178 horsepower as I recall and also
the hybrid carries over we'll review
that one separately all Camrys are
transverse front-wheel drive does no
all-wheel drive going on here and no
more manual transmission on any of the
power trains
now you know me I care much less about
how much power a car has then how
available the power is that a car has
and this is in the high camp for
availability great responsiveness under
the throttle you step on it and the car
goes faster a lot of cars don't do that
this one's very responsive that way the
blind spot tech is well calibrated it
picks up cars up to about midship here
all the way back through what I would
consider a blind spot so it's well
arranged in that respect it doesn't get
in the way of anything though all it
does is tell you with a solid yellow
someone's there or with a blinking
yellow if someone's there and you've
turned signaled into that lane and
here's the great sort of unsung headline
on this car the handling is good not
sporty good but responsive good it goes
along with that engines right now power
availability makes for a very cohesive
package this is the kind of car you will
enjoy driving in almost all modes it
never feels laborious or like you're on
a boat you got to kind of lean the
opposite way to keep it from capsizing
okay bottom line on the Camry this car
is gonna come in in this trim somewhere
in the mid 30 thousands and for what
you're getting and the quality of
materials the improved handling the
little better mpg and the Entune
technology it's a good value on the
other hand it still remains a very
middle-of-the-road car not totally
polished on the tech and to needs
another rev and nor is it become a car
that has any real driver aspirations but
that isn't the idea and they'll sell
these things all day long</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
