the 2016 escape shows off for its latest
technical achievement a sync 3
infotainment system
checking off the high points the Ford
Escape benefits from an efficient and
powerful engine automated parking a Sony
stereo and quick responsive handling
however the ambitious MyFord Touch
infotainment system sluggish response
didn't help the overall appeal but now
the 2016 Escape is one of the first
models to get Fords entirely new sync
three system a very welcome replacement
for my Ford touch with sync three I've
got an entirely new interface on the
touch screen giving you navigation
digital audio and a hands-free phone
system the maps look clean and show 3d
rendered buildings best of all the
system responds as quick as any tablet
to my inputs although there isn't native
online destination search here port uses
a 1 box input idea when I type in
letters it begins immediately matching
them the streets and businesses in its
local database that's a quick way to
search just like using a Maps app and on
the subject of apps Ford finally has a
visual app link system right now I'm
running Spotify on my iPhone cable of
the cars USB port so I can control the
app here on the touchscreen other apps
are available with more being added by
developers every month if I want to talk
to Siri I can tap the touch screen here
or hold down the voice command button by
the way there isn't apple carplay or
Android auto here but Ford is looking
into adding it to top it all off I've
got a Sony branded audio system with 10
speakers I really like the sound quality
and think it's one of the best values
under the rest of the car this small SUV
has a really versatile interior I've got
a good amount of cargo space and a high
seating position for a good view of the
road
you can get a few different engines for
the escape I've got the top choice a
2-liter EcoBoost turbocharged engine
making 240 horsepower and 270 pound feet
of pork this engine runs quietly but
it's really responsive on the throttle
it's well matched to the 6-speed
automatic transmission and this car is
optional all-wheel-drive system
there's no differential lock here though
so don't expect to escape to be a baby
off-roader beyond that peppy engine I'm
really impressed with the steering feel
of this state it reacts really quickly
to my inputs and the suspension is
extremely well tuned it soaks up the
bumps and glides over the road board
gives the escape a corner braking system
to improve handling but didn't feel kind
of pop heavy in the turns
okay now one of my favorite features
automated parking all I have to do is
push this button and escape signals
Annie on its LCD when it finds a spot I
put it in reverse and it does all the
steering putting me perfectly next to
the curb
all right let's price out our 2016 ford
escape base price for this bottle is
twenty three thousand nine hundred and
ninety five delivery but i've got the
type tuning trim here which to bring the
base up to thirty thousand four hundred
to do to up CNET style add the 301 a
package to get automated parking and a
blind spot monitor for 1795 i'm also
going to add the two-liter engine over
the standard 1.6 liter because I like
the power that goes for eleven ninety
five but I might leave off the 1795
all-wheel drive option because I live in
California that makes a total of thirty
three thousand three hundred ninety
dollars the 2016 Ford Escape is a really
nice little SUV with great handling and
responsive power sync 3 is the icing on
the cake here though adding a high-tech
electronics platform with great app
capabilities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
