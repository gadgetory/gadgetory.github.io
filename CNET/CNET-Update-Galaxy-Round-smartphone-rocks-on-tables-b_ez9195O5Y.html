the ability to teeter-totter on a table
I'm Bridget Carey this is your cnet up
thing the time has come we finally have
a curved smartphone Samsung announced
the galaxy round and as you can see here
it has a slight dip in the middle along
the vertical axis and the left and right
sides curve upward the curve allows the
phone to show off new tricks if you put
it on a table and press down on the side
it can rock back and forth on the curve
and you can give it different commands
to open different apps depending on how
you roll it so a tap and roll let you
quickly check the time a missed call or
maybe even toggle back and forth between
songs let's break down the spec shall we
they're pretty solid it has a 5.7 inch
1080p high def screen it runs Android
4.3 it has three gigs of ram and a two
point three gigahertz quad-core
processor its first launching in South
Korea but we don't know when it's
landing to other countries if you're
rolling your eyes at the rolling phone
just be aware that this isn't the only
curved foam coming this year the G flex
by LG will likely be the next phone that
rocks on a table and LG said it's
working on making batteries that also
come with a curve we may get some new
iPads this month we've been expecting
Apple to have some sort of iPad
announcement in two weeks likely on
october twenty second and you can bet
Apple will also use the event to show
off the new Mac Pro loaded with OS 10
Mavericks so far a few leaks suggest the
next full-size iPads will have more
angled edges and a thinner design kind
of like the mini and the mini may get a
Retina display screen and come in new
colors to match the iphone 5s if you
have comcast xfinity cable service
you'll soon be able to use the Twitter
app to watch TV a new feature called see
it is launching in november through a
partnership between twitter NBC
Universal and Comcast some tweets will
have this see it button that will
command the set-top box to turn the
channel on set the DVR or play an
on-demand
show see it will first only work with
NBCUniversal channels but it could
expand to other networks the flickr app
on iOS is now a tool for automatically
saving all your photos online for those
that upgraded to iOS 7 the new flickr
app takes all the photos in the camera
roll and uploads them to a flickr
account but the photos are stored
privately until the owner decides to
share them it's cool but not unique
Google+ can also auto upload photos
that's your tech news update but you can
get more details at cnet com / update
and follow along on Twitter from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
