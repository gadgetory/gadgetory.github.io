your weekly dose of everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple the iPhone
7 hasn't even been released and we're
already hearing rumors for a digit times
report that says Apple is building an
iPhone beyond its current 5.5 inch
screen and is moving into a 5.8 inch
screen with an OLED display that could
launch in 2017 or 18 now Samsung and LG
would be supplying the displays for this
new device rumor reports have already
stated the 2017-18 time frame is when
Apple is finally expected to go to an
OLED display and it's about time even
Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg touted how
Samsung's OLED screens were the only
ones the gear VR supports because LCD
screens like the iPhones aren't up to
standard for VR content now again you
might be rolling your eyes about this
5.8 inch screen thinking that's too much
Apple but patents from 2011 show how
Apple's been thinking and it could make
sense if it was part of their wraparound
designs with flexible OLED displays they
also have another patent for virtual
buttons switches or informational
displays that can run on the edges of
the phone it includes a touch sensitive
layer and would allow you to do things
like adjust your volume or take pictures
without any physical buttons and apples
March 21st event has been officially
confirmed with Apple's invitation that
says let us loop you in where we expect
to see the nine point seven inch iPad
pro the iPhone se and all new Apple
watch wristbands that we've been talking
about on this show but let's talk about
the actual iPhone 7 that we are
expecting to come out this year probably
a good idea
now images of a purported iPhone 7 case
from Steve Hammer stopper which you can
choose to believe or not feature a
design that has no headphone jack a
single lightning port and stereo
speakers at the bottom of the case and
don't worry you can be sure Apple will
make that lightning headphone jack
adapter somewhere you know in the
affordable ballpark of 50 dollars now
these images showcase rumored features
of the next iPhone with a body that is
similar enough to the iPhone 6s and even
early case leaks have been pretty
accurate in the past so as usual we'll
just wait and see
we also told you how Zuckerberg threw
some shade apples way recently but he's
not the only one during an interview
with Shaq News oculus VR founder Palmer
Luckey was asked if the company plans to
support the Mac for the oculus rift
virtual reality headset his response
it's up to Apple and the company needs
to prioritize hire and GPUs if Apple
builds a machine that can handle the
hardware oculus VR would love to support
the Mac that's real talk but oh that's
what I call an out sheet and it's not a
coincidence that all of a sudden Apple
is looking at OLED screens with their
newfound interest in virtual reality
also this past week in the first
instance of ransomware for the Mac was
found in a malicious update to the
BitTorrent client transmission
ransomware is a type of malware that
encrypts a user's hard drive and files
and then demands money to decrypt it
it's nasty and this version of
transmission was downloaded over 6,500
times
the good thing transmission has since
released and updates removed the malware
from computers affected also Apple's iOS
9.3 betas are showing off their
nightshift feature that changes the
color temperature of the screen from the
normal cooler blues to warmer tones in
an effort to help people sleep better at
night a new app called Flex bright on
the App Store did just that it was
approved by Apple a few days ago until
Apple realized hey we're doing this
feature in our upcoming iOS 9.3 which we
also stole from another app called
efflux by the way so now we're pooling
flex bright from the App Store no
explanation has been given for its
removal and you all know what that is
that's a bad apple seeing just what you
thought we'd get through a show without
throwing one out alright let's announce
our winners for the full copy of Mortal
Kombat XL from last week's show my
favorite fighting game franchise of all
