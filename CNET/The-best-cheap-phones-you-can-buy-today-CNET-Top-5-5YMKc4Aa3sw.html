you can get right now every phone here
to be found for under $300 and that's
the unlock price let's see our options
and number five is a huawei honor 6x you
can find this phone for around $200
these days it's gimmick is its dual rear
cameras along with lots of photo tools
and modes the honor 6x to create that
nice depth of field effect it's also got
a pretty big screen with a 5.5 inch
display the fingerprint sensor is on the
back and it's easy to reach that number
four is the ZTE Blade v8 pro which you
can pick up for around 230 dollars it
might not be the most exciting phone
when it comes to design but it does have
great battery life the ZTE Blade v8 pro
survived
14 hours in our battery tests the screen
is nice and bright but we found the
phone to be a bit on the heavy side
weighing in at six point five ounces Oh
the v8 pearl also has dual rear cameras
that can handle low-light situations
admirably and number three is the
Alcatel idol 5s there's so much to like
about this phone the fingerprint sensor
on the rear handles shortcuts like
getting you back to the home screen or
pulling down the notification tray while
the idol 5s does not have optical image
stabilization its digital image
stabilization worked pretty well it
costs around $200 if you get the Amazon
Prime Edition so what's the downside the
battery life is short at 7 hours and 48
minutes at number two is the amazingly
cheap Moto e 4 it costs $130 unlocked or
$99 if you get the Amazon Prime version
with ads the e 4 survived more than 14
hours in our tests the camera is a bit
sluggish when it comes to processing
pictures that may be forgivable because
of its price tag the e 4 also has a
snappy fingerprint sensor that can
handle shortcuts kind of like the idol
5s and the number one cheap phone is the
Moto G 5 plus it starts at around $230
and it's well worth it you get an ear
stock version of Android on the g5 plus
the fingerprint sensor works as well as
apples touch ID and it also lets you use
gestures or shortcuts the 12 megapixel
camera is decent although not great in
darker environment
the g5 plus can also capture video in 4k
as Sina editor Patrick Holland said
there is no better budget phone than
Motorola's Moto G 5 plus more top fives
