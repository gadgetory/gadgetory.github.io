cnet.com and I'm here with the Belkin
iPad Mini keyboard case you can get this
case for around 70 dollars online and
it's a pretty good case it's got a nice
thin form factor for a keyboard case it
folds up it has a magnetic back and you
fold it back there's kind of a little
rubberized clasp that you detach the
iPad from and then you fold back the
cover and that's how you get it to fold
into a stand this does weigh around 11
ounces so it does double the weight of
your iPad Mini that is one of the
drawbacks to this case but that's what
you expect from a keyboard case the
other drawback is that it's a little bit
cramped I did like the keys that are
pretty tactile they're hard keys they're
not those kind of rubberized soft
buttons so you can use this as a
keyboard but it is a little bit cramped
it's not a full sized iPad keyboard in
order to do that you'd have to sort of
have a butterfly style keyboard the
other drawback is the keyboard layout
for instance there is no apostrophe key
the apostrophe key also has the quotes
key and there is no dedicated key for
that and you have to hit the function
button to get an apostrophe and that's a
little bit irritating so there have been
some compromises made to get this
keyboard as small as it is as a result
this is one of those funny products that
is a good product but it does have
enough drawbacks that it would give you
pause to get one especially because it
cost 70 dollars so what I would
recommend is that you only get this case
if you really think you're going to use
the keyboard a lot the keyboard isn't
removable from the case if you have to
keep the keyboard in there and that
makes it a little bit cumbersome to
carry around all the time with you to be
clear this is a Bluetooth keyboard so
you pair it with your iPad I mean you
get a wireless connection to that
keyboard it charges via USB and it does
get long battery life you do get around
a hundred and fifty-five hours of
battery life according to Belkin it is
also worth mentioning that there is a
cutout for the camera on the back side
of the case which is nice so it really
is for someone who wants to do a ton of
email even some word processing and then
again it is a little bit cramped I'm
David Carr know and that's the Belkin
iPad Mini
keyboard case thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
