options see tutorial tour guide exhibit
windy day earth YouTube photosphere and
Street View and depending on where I
look I get different options I'm going
to go to the windy day and I can do that

this little mouse guy I've seen before

I have to turn all the way around or to
see him not to say my eyes take a minute
to adjust to see both images as one
image okay I want to go to Street View
now let me see if I can go back and
doing this okay that's how you go back
to home Street View is just like a
time-lapse first-person video view of
you going through a city
all right and that's a virtual reality
right there really virtually no costs
all you need is the cardboard the phone
and the app so if you can get that pizza
box you know you may be able to build
your own virtual reality headset it's
pretty cool I like it

rift or wait for the sony Morpheus you
can just use your Android phone it's
