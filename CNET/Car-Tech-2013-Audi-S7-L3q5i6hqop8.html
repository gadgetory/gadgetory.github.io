it first came out Automobile Magazine
named it their favorite car of the year
so did Esquire magazine for Christ's
sakes what is it we all love so much
about the Audi 7 let's drive this 2013
Audi s7 find out check the tech
now without he really did with the seven
is combined high heeled pumps with
sensible shoes I mean this car is
gorgeous and spacious tough trick and
when and if they ever dramatically
restyle it I think it's going to be a
sad day spot and s.vs a standard a seven
by it's unique grille and face quite
different on the front as are the wheels
look for lower body moldings that are
body colored and also these satin finish
mirrors
now the cabin of the s7 is particularly
macho if you will you've got this sort
of vintage racer tufted diamond pleat on
the seat here's our pop-up screen that
gives us the g-wiz of this thing coming
out and also the g-wiz of what it
presents
Howdy's navigation system is one of the
best out there I like the way it
presents almost everything in terms of
operating still the same MMI interface
for zones here mapped to four buttons
down here around the controller notice
on this car we've got the Google Earth
services built-in so it's got Google
Earth satellite imagery once you get out
to let's say this level here 3/4 mile
view along with that Google Earth
imagery you've got local search to find
destinations and all that's done through
this little SIM card connection right
here you don't need to pair your
smartphone to this guy to get connected
now let's talk media system on this car
lots of choices they start back here
into the sneaky door alongside the sim
you've got two SD card slots I don't
find that tremendously interesting more
interesting your bluetooth streaming for
which on my Android phone I'm getting
good meta tag information that's quite a
win on Android now the one that's grayed
out here that would be your Audi media
interface it lives here in the console
the reason it's not connected is because
as you can see here we've got the
old-style 30-pin dock connector now
getting away from infotainment the cabin
tech really takes off with driver
assistance tech in this car first of all
we have adaptive cruise control which is
where you set the speed and the follow
distance but on top of that it's got
stop-and-go technology if you get into
stop and go traffic the car will come to
a stop and then when traffic starts
again it will automatically resume after
the radar in the front sees that happen
and the camera up here behind the mirror
scans for pedestrians first Lane Assist
technology on this car is active if this
same camera which can read not just
lines but colors of lines detects that
you're drifting and your signals not on
in that direction it uses the electro
hydraulic steering rack to steer you
back and also give you a stick shake on
the wheel if you set it that way that
same camera also looks out there for
speed limit science and can read them
and puts those on the interface of the
car to let you know what the speed limit
is here now I'm really sad our car does
not have the night vision with
pedestrian detection and head up
display that is something I want to
check out in the real world on these
Audi's and finally we have parking
assist technology we've seen this in a
lot of other cars that cost a lot less
than this one for example but it will
get you into a parallel parking spot as
long as it is at least 31 inches longer
than the car that's actually a pretty
tight spot now a big part of the story
on an S versus an a7 is here in the
engine bay completely different
powerplant your standard a7 is a 3 liter
supercharged v6 this guy has a 4 litre
twin-turbocharged v8 night-and-day 420
horsepower versus 310 406 foot-pounds of
torque versus 325 0 to 60 is almost a
second different 4 5 vs. 5 4 and that's
in spite of the s7 weighing about 300
pounds more mpg almost identical 1727
for the S 18:28 for a standard 7 and
completely different transmission on the
S this guy has a 7-speed dual-clutch
automated manual only the a7 has a
8-speed Tiptronic automatic though both
cars are Quattro all-wheel drive of
course lots of ingredients in this cake
let's see how it comes out
and the first thing I love about this s7
is even though it is only available with
a dual-clutch automated manual it drives
almost exactly like a well-tuned
automatic and that's a good thing for
everyday livability
I like the blind spot tech in this car
big bright lights in the mirror housings
that actually get my attention they get
even brighter and more frantic if I
signal into someone who's on that side
and of course you've got many ways to
shift this guy to change the personality
of the vehicle if you go over here to
the gate and then you get on the paddles
and you start to shift this thing or
change the mode to one of the aggressive
modes you can really lighten this car up
or put it in comfort mode and it really
come becomes a boat to be honest it got
almost wallowing which is nice when
you're just floating down the highway
when you put this car into its most
aggressive personality through that Audi
Drive select everything changes the
steering the suspension the way the
transmission deals with the engine the
way the engine holds rpms and even the
way the exhaust this is perhaps the most
widely configurable car we've ever
driven all that said I will give you who
are shopping Audi against BMW one last
thing to think about
the BMW comparable model always feels
much gutsy er this car feels more
elegant more finesse this cars Roger
more BMW is Sean Connery I don't mean
that as a diss I know some people
daren't big and more but he did his
thing his way with much more of an
elegance Connery was much more of kind
of a gutsy guy that's a pretty good
analogy
let's price this technical wonder that
has hot sauce splashed all over it
s7 is going to start at seventy nine
seven let's call it eighty grand then
you want the innovation package to go
CNET style with one check box 5,600
bucks brings in the lane-departure
technology the blind spot tech the night
vision with pedestrian detection
adaptive cruise with stop and go you
also get the cornering cameras self-park
is in there there's all kinds of goodies
for what I think is kind of a steal of
