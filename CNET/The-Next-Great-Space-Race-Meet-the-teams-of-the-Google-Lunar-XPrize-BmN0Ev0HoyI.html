here at the Kennedy Space Center
completed its moon shot and won the
space race for America it was a 25
billion dollar investment by the US
government that's one hundred and sixty
five billion dollars in today's money
but just three years and six lunar
landings later we lost interest
it wasn't until 2013 when China Lena the
Chang III rover on the moon that
humanity returned to the lunar surface
but that was a state-funded project that
cost hundreds of millions of dollars and
was ultimately unsuccessful with no
competition to spur us on humanity's
interest in the moon cooled but things
were starting to heat up there's a new
competition a new space race a 30
million dollar Google Lunar XPrize
independent teams are racing to
collective the winner of the Google
Lunar XPrize has to complete three
criteria first and most important being
actually landing on the moon once there
needs to cover 500 meters either on
above or even below the lunar surface
and all the while needs to be
broadcasting back high-definition video
to those of us stuck here on earth
the first team to do that gets 20
million dollars a nice chunk of change
but just a fraction of the money they're
gonna have to spend to get to the moon
in the first place second place team if
there is one we'll get five million
dollars well the last five million
dollars to the 30 million dollar purse
it split up into optional challenges
things like surveying historic locations
on the moon and covering extra distance
thirty three teams were entered into the
Google Lunar XPrize and of those just
five were selected for the so-called
milestone prizes that six million
dollars awarded to those teams that can
demonstrate that they have the
technology and the know-how to land on
the moon this is the story of those five
teams
first is Astrobotic a Pittsburgh
Pennsylvania based team with strong ties
to Carnegie Mellon University Astrobotic
was spun out from Carnegie Mellon in
2007 we are located in a strip district
in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania about five
minutes from Carnegie Mellon Astrobotic
has taken an approach of the being what
I would call a large cargo carrier
they're actually looking to take a
number of other teams with them to the
lunar surface they're trying to to take
a large Lander that could also be used
for future cargo missions so it's very
interesting commercial development which
should come out of this it's actually
far more complicated than just unloading
a few Rovers we hope to release some of
these payloads in orbit some of them
want to land we're going to release some
payloads in translunar after translunar
injection as we fly towards the moon and
then we want to release some of the
rover's on the ground so we have to come
up with a model that takes all of that
into account not just the ground race
that's going to happen when we drop all
the vehicles off I think Astrobotic is
gonna do great things we want to prove
that we can land precisely and
accurately while avoiding all the
hazards so for me personally I'd really
like to see my software be useful for
pinpoint landing that's really exciting
I'm the only woman here at Mastan and
Astrobotic so that's kind of exciting to
inspire women and girls to follow their
passions and explore career and
contribute to the state of art of space
exploration computer vision so our goal
is to secrete extend humanity's reach
into space create a sustainable economy
and ecosystem that can work there and as
that cost comes down it gets that much
closer and then we can turn the moon
into the 8th continent team hakuto is
based on homage to japan and has some
very interesting Rover designs
the technical team is located in Tohoku
University which is a city of Sendai a
nose up Tokyo and the business team is
mostly located in Tokyo area XPrize gave
us a very unique opportunity to bring
our Rovers and demonstrate the mobility
but our final goal is to contribute to
the science Cocteau's solution to the
XPrize requirements is Moonraker the
larger the two they have a secondary set
of objectives that don't have anything
to do with XPrize and that is to look
into what are termed lava tubes on the
on the moon it used to be used to be
volcanic activities on the surface of
the Moon the rubber floor build number
of the underground tiles and as some of
the tunnels has you know small boy or
horse so very unique nice access hole to
the underground tunnels so then first we
complete the 500 meter trouble and
approaching to the edge of the hole then
as an option if we use this Taser system
to make an underground exploration as
they're attached by tether so out the
back of this rover a tether attaches to
the second rover and it's designed to
tow the smaller one so the second rover
has the ability to go down a cliff side
and then pull itself back up and also
there is such an underground structures
it's so natural structure should be
useful for the future human habitation
well I don't know what they're going to
find but it will be really interesting
when they do where's a weawy in the
exploit or not we're gonna continue to
our journey team in this is based in New
Delhi India and they're sending not one
but two Rovers to the moon
so for us it's about completing the
mission
completing the engineering you know
qualifying the hardware getting onto a
rocket landing on the moon finishing
that track the team was formed by me and
a bunch of business associates back in
2010 that's when we found out about
Google Lunar XPrize we were looking to
work with any other team from India
because of restrictions around
technology so on so forth when we found
out that there is no team from India we
decided to put one up on our own our
Rover is small so it's it's four wheel
all four wheels are power different two
videos are staring it has a collapsible
mast it is powered using solar panels
relatively small overall dimensions
would be you know it's it's it's about
you know half a meter by half meter by
forty centimeters so it's it's almost a
cube that would fly on top of the London
and once it is deployed the mast comes
out and gives us a hand in a height of
almost one meter it's almost 10 years
since Ansari X PRIZE and and it's about
time so I think that would be the one
big visible you know step towards
consumers getting into space and that
would automatically have a ripple effect
and more and more people thinking that
there's a lot more that can be done in
space that can be done with space moon
express is another American team based
in Mountain View California they have
some pretty lofty goals for the future
of commercial space exploration
so we're here at the Kennedy Space
Center where humanity went to the moon
and it's a great honor for us to be not
only standing on the shoulders of giants
but working shoulder-to-shoulder with
our NASA colleagues and learning a lot
and there's a new era evolving now and
as behind US government spaceships reach
out to space here at the slf private
spaceships are being built and our
little team of 50 people given the
support of NASA and the camaraderie that
we're experiencing and the incentive of
the moon
we're built developing and testing our
vehicle today there's one sixth of
Earth's gravity on the moon and that
provides a lot of challenges for
traction and mobility and that means
that your mass of your Rover should be
six times as much to get the same
traction so we thought well there's no
atmosphere so there's no aerodynamic
forces there's less gravity and if we
landed once should be able to land again
and flying is the best option and so
we're going to hop our mission is going
to hop 500 meters and during that hop we
also have an opportunity to reorient our
solar panels to take advantage of
wherever the Sun might be during that
day wherever possible we use consumer
technology and upscaler to upgrade it to
space qualification this is real change
from what's usually done traditionally
in space where you only fly would you
flown before well there's no opportunity
for innovation when you do that so with
imaging we're going to be using some
commercial cameras that we've modified
and environmentally tested and this will
be very cool because they are extremely
capable and relatively inexpensive and
we'll be flying these things for the
first time to another world and when we
announce what those cameras are I think
people be pretty excited about it
writing software for an application is
gonna go so far away I mean it starts
off with a little unreal until you start
making more and more progress and
realizing like oh man we're gonna have
to actually let this thing go at some
point finally team
time's scientist is based in Berlin
Germany but they have team members
located all around the world the idea
for getting started was to part-time
scientists came basically when the last
announcement for participants was sent
out by Google I think by that time the
competition was already running like two
years or so and they were still looking
for new teams and I said okay if we want
to take part in this competition then he
got one more week to apply and up to
this point I have never heard about the
j-league speak so that was really what
got me interested and I was looking at
it and I was really thinking like why
the hell is Google Earth can I say this
okay so I was really thinking like why
the heck is Google giving away 40
million u.s. dollars for something to be
sent to the moon so after talking to
other people I noticed that 30 million
is actually not it doesn't even cut it
for the entire mission cars and yeah
that's what was fascinated me was to try
to get it done in a cheaper way because
when I saw the numbers said usual space
missions take place I really saw that it
makes sense to lower the mark so we're
here at the D fki and this is a German
nonprofit Institute for robotics and
artificial intelligence research one of
the labs that they have here is this
artificial moonscape which is useful for
testing robotic systems which one day
would operate on the moon this moon
scape has a few interesting properties
one of them is that it's optically
realistic so they have the right color
and the right formation of the surface
to give the shadowing effects and the
lighting effects that a camera on the
moon would actually be looking at our
goal is actually to conduct at least two
more missions and a five to seven year
time scale and the reason for this is
because I believe what is important is
to build up infrastructure that others
can utilize for example if we put a like
an LTE base station on the moon to speak
it a little bit simple and we provide a
high gigabit uplink back to earth for a
laser link for example then other
missions future missions could use a
simple small chip in their components to
link into this base station instead of
having
own communication solution which
requires a whole lot of power and mass
to dial back to earth the reason why I
believe this entire Google XPrize and
pop time scientist is pretty awesome at
least for me and for most of the people
on our team is that you you get to learn
so much more things that you would have
never come in contact with in your
normal life it's the next great space
race it's happening now in our next
video we'll show you highlights from
those tests as the team's prepare to go
on their 20 million dollar moonshot I'm
