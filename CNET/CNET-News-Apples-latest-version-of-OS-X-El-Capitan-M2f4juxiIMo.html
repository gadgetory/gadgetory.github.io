demonstration or whenever you wake your
Mac is finding the cursor and El Capitan
makes this easier than ever I just do
that little shake we all normally do
there it is it comes right out to greet
you it's really handy now in safari I
have some sites that i like to keep
around because i refer to them on and
off throughout the day and now in safari
i can pin those sites just like this so
there's i'm going to pin my twitter site
here and of course have been following
the Warriors go warriors we're going to
get it done but if you've had this
happen to you you're like where is this
audio coming from well now with just a
tap you can mute it or find out where it
came from and shut it down just like
that now spotlight can actually help me
out there so I'm just going to do a
search for the SF giants and we see
right now I get current game scores
upcoming games it looks like the game I
want to go to is on friday so i can just
search for weather on Friday well let's
try it out in mail so I've been really
busy of course the last couple of days
and so I've been getting a little behind
on my mail and I want to see the
messages that I've received from Phil
but that I haven't responded to yet so
I'm just going to say mail I ignored
from Phil there there are a few but i'll
be getting back to him right after the
show now we've done something totally
new to El Capitan and it's the ability
to work really easily on to windows side
by side so I'm just going to click and
hold here on the green button and you
see it then prompting me to pick a side
I'll just drop it in and you notice i
get an expose of all may of the windows
let me pick the new news app just like
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
