many many cheap tablets but there are
only a few truly great cheap tablets
vonabell and this top five I'm counting
down CNET's picks for the best tablets
price under 250 bucks starting off at
number five the assist transformer pad
TF 103 C retail prices $299 but we're
seeing this as low as two hundred and
forty nine it's an amazing deal
especially when you consider that it
comes with a keyboard dock making it
more of an Android laptop hybrid it's a
10.1 inch screen on top of a 1.8
gigahertz quad-core Atom processor a gig
of ram and a base of 16 gigs of storage
along with a micro SD card slot for
memory expansion it's not the prettiest
thing or the fastest thing out there but
if the hybrid concept appeals to you
it's a steal at number 4 the LG G pad
10.1 this actually comes in a 7 8 and 10
inch version with the 10 ringing right
up at $249 that 10 inch er is more or
less like the transformer pad except
you're trading that keyboard dock for a
significant upgrade in style internally
you're getting the same gig of ram 16
gigs of storage microSD expansion slot
and a good enough processor LG throws in
an IR blaster so that you can use the G
pad like a giant TV remote which you
never will coming in at number three the
soos memo pad 8 a slim lightweight
8-inch Android tablet that can be
snatched up for around 180 dollars it's
a nice design and a more manageable form
factor that's free this colorful and
packs a decent pixel density making it a
good choice for reading processor speed
isn't great though so if you're looking
for a gaming tablet keep moving and
number two the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 7
starting at $229 the seven-inch tablet
offers a beautiful screen with a sharp
1920 by 1200 resolution the processor
has enough juice to keep up with your
gaming addiction and the whole thing is
tied into Amazon's media empire on the
downside Google fans aren't getting the
real Android treatment here Kindle
owners live entirely
Zhaan's world which brings us to seen
its highest recommended tablet priced at
or under $250 at number one the Google
Nexus 7 Android fans can pick this up
direct from Google for $229 and expect
nothing less than the pure unadulterated
Android treatment great processor
performance beautiful HD screen 2 gigs
of RAM and an impressive 11 and 1/2 hour
battery life no storage expansion though
so if you need more than 16 gigs we'll
have to spend the extra $40 for the 32
gigabyte version so there you have it
five tablets under $250 that we can
actually stand behind for all the latest
