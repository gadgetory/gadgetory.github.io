one wheel plus XR I've been riding it
for over two months now put 250 miles on
this thing and boy it's addictive your
friends think I'm crazy because I ride
it all over New York City the one wheel
plus XR is more than just an A to B
travel product it might even be
intimidating at first but once you get
used to it you won't want to get all the
Nightrider
the first glance most associated with
the skateboard but it rides and handles
more like a snowboard or surfboard it
may look like something that requires a
lot of time to learn but it's easy to
pick up although hard to master once you
do that's when the addiction kicks in
you got it already the one wheel plus XR
can pretty much go anywhere it's fitted
with a Vega go-cart tire that has no
problem taking on grass gravel dirt and
of course pavement with more torque than
its predecessor than one wheel plus the
XR takes hills with no problems and does
it quietly with its precious motor the
board is self balancing riders shift
their weight foot to foot to go on a
desired direction and a dismount
you can either jump off or tiptoe then
step off this is done by lifting the
heel of the foot that's on the pad with
the blue line through it there are two
sensors under the pad and when the foot
is flat across the board is active but
if any part of the foot is on one side
of the blue line the board will come to
a stop depending on a rider's size the
board can go approximately 20 miles an
hour and travel a distance of 12 to 18
miles on a full charge with me being a
plus-sized reviewer I was able to get
about 16 to 17 miles per hour and get
about 16 miles distance so Joe
and I'll give you the shift off that can
also vary depending on what board
settings are used in addition to hills
and terrain when I speak of settings I'm
refering to the digital shaping these
are different ride settings for Hills
environment speed etc they could be
unlocked and changed in the iOS or
Android app in addition to that users
can view battery life and current board
speed there's even a social aspect where
you can locate other one wheelers I know
when one guy's name was Stevie Wonder
with two A's a nice addition worth
mentioning is once the battery is at
fifty percent the app will notify you so
you have enough juice to get home the
app can also tell you when the board is
fully charged when plugged in for those
in a rush to get back outside it has LED
lights on the front and back depending
on the direction of traveling the
forward light will be white and the rear
one will be red in the after is even a
switch to toggle those lights on and off
the only time having the one wheel plus
XR wasn't enjoyable was when it needed
to be carried there's a handle that
makes transporting it easy but it weighs
about 30 pounds the board is very well
constructed and durable like I mentioned
before I'm not a small guy and I rode
that thing all over New York City the
town built around potholes after riding
it for a couple of months the most
intimidating thing to me is its price
eighteen hundred dollars but I
understand you get what you pay for
the bagpipes
this is a really good monkey I'm gonna
keep running</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
