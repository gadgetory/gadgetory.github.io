Conte and it's time to get loaded Amazon
has a new deal on the kindle to be the
exclusive digital publisher for Andrew
Wiley a book agency that represents
famous authors such as Salman Rushdie
Philip Roth and the estate of John
Updike this means that other eBook
stores like nook or Borders won't be
able to sell digital copies of those
books meanwhile Barnes &amp;amp; Noble released
a nuke reader for Android phones this
means you can access your Barnes &amp;amp; Noble
ebooks from your Android phone the app

bring a Nuke application to iPhone and
iPad soon and you to prevent its music

organized crime Google has 120 days to
create some kind of technology that will
identify the offending profiles if they
do not they will be fined around fifty
five thousand dollars per day and your
toilet flushes could save you energy the
hydro system turns your toilet flushes
into a small hydroelectric dam every
time the water rushes from the pipes it
turns that energy into electricity using
four blades like a turbine it's
estimated that it could save you
fourteen hundred dollars per year in
electricity costs kind of gross but kind
of cool and finally how would you like
to own your own submarine well here you
go the personal submarine seats too and
lets you descend up to 1,000 feet under
the sea for up to six hours it has a
climate controlled pressure sphere for
