interface and even connectivity would
sync and MyFord Touch came along with
the most ambitious upgrade to that but
it tripped over itself in a couple of
ways a little too much going on on the
screen and things weren't responding
fast enough and they heard about it
here's their response they've
significantly overhauled my Ford touch
which is the interface you see and the
way that it responds first of all
they've done a better job of making the
homescreen very clear you've got these
four regions that are now much more
persistently visible when you press a
button things happen faster you don't
see that anywhere more than if you're
watching the navigation screen do its
thing where things are happening
smoothly now because they've done much
more with hardware acceleration letting
the graphics hardware take on all that
rendering and freeing up the CPU to be
responsive to you or your voice commands
good move another important change for
those of you that we're finding it was
very slow to get this system booted
after you started your car is they now
suspend everything the system state and
the navigation also gets frozen in
memory and basically ready for an
instant reboot they weren't doing that
in the past they were cold booting NAV
every time you started the car and that
was holding a lot of other things back
one of my favorite improvements is what
they've done on the main screen wherever
you go you're gonna find a much cleaner
set of buttons and labels remember these
are on the left they used to kind of
overwrite each other you'd have serious
on top of its logo you might have some
frequencies or megahertz alongside the
radio presets it was kind of a hot mess
now things have been cleaned up and
these button stacks on the left and the
right are much more consistent across
all the levels of information and
function on this system small thing but
they had to hear about this too the
clocks bigger the digits were too small
in the past a lot of folks said do I
have a clock in this car one last touch
they've added these sort of virtual LEDs
to many buttons that have let's say
multiple pages to each choice like on FM
you've got several sets of presets there
was no way to sort of see which one you
were on until they surfaced these little
virtual LEDs and they do these on many
buttons around the system that have
rotating pages underneath them all
these small things and from what I can
tell in this quick test of their
increased hardware acceleration on
graphics seems to have brought this
system into the kind of snappy
performance I always wanted it to have
this would be coming out first on the
escape the flex and the Taurus in early
2012 as new 2013 models and as all the
2013's roll out from Ford they will have
this spread across them the other good
news for those of you who have a my Ford
touch equipped car for the last year and
a half from when it first debuted
they're gonna mail you a thumb drive
that you stick in the USB port that will
do this field upgrade so all the my Ford
touch cars are gonna get to this level
bring everybody forward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
