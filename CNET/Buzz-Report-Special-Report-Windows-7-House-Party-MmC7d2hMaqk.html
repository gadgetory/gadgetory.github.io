along with house world line and you are
launching windows 7 ultimate software ah
the windows 7 party video I hate to say
it but yeah it's gone viral
but viral like swine flu it's everywhere
and it's not good for Humanity I mean
are they serious about this completely
out of touch effort to communicate what
a windows 7 launch party should be or is
this really the cleverest self-parody
ever let's deconstruct it first the
characters first we have the dork you're
vaguely emasculated suburban guy of
limited stature who doesn't like the
fact that shirts have buttons or really
should be tucked in classic primetime TV
kind of character he can't change a flat
tire but he's really good at playing
video games and getting your computer to
work then we have the busybody see just
won't shut up I mean I guess it's her
house but still she could relax a little
push back from the white powder for a
minute and stop being so damn excited
about stuff like helping how to then we
have the Cougar this silver haired piece
of work has been a swinger since her
divorce she's trying to be interested in
all this Windows stuff whatever that is
but she's really here because she heard
you need a key to install Windows she's
gonna be real letdown when she finds out
this isn't a key party and finally we've
got the brother and as we'll see later
he may be the only guy in this whole
crew who gets it and most of the time he
lets the others talk windows while he's
making serious moves on the groceries he
knows that's the best thing coming out
of this party so he's loading up now the
elements these characters bring the life
and make our jaws drop here are the top
5 lines that make us squirm and wonder
is Microsoft serious number 5 pictures
you can use house burning tools to build
your guest list upload your pictures
which is his face right okay what's with
the conspiratorial laughter around
uploading pictures does he have some
history with the DA's office around
uploading pictures many of the
activities suggest that you
photos from the parties so we made a
point of shooting it's when your still
photos on the digital camera at the
start of the party - oh my god really oh
my gosh are these people new to the idea
of taking in posting digital photos
yikes number for fun when everyone was
there and settled I had an overview of
some of my favorite Windows 7 features I
showed my guests things from two of the
windows 7 orientation videos and it took
like 10 minutes oh you know it was great
it was totally informal no it wasn't it
was stupid Wow honey you are so not hot
all of a sudden but I love the
incredulous look on the Cougars face
second look at the activities you and
your guests can try it your party and
choose the ones that seem to you to be
the most fun fun and learning a new OS
don't normally go together for most of
us but this is the Cougar talking so in
her mind fun probably means
skinny-dipping or swapping spouses later
number three activities make the thing
you're demonstrating personal to someone
at the party but the way I made shifts
files get transferred by Windows Easy
Transfer I can think of a lot of things
to do on a computer that are more
personal than doing a file transfer
number to play with my computer so for
the rest of the party you just leave
your computer on and running and then
you let folks mess around with it right
yeah that's my idea of fun leave my
personal laptop out on the counter so a
bunch of drunk people can mess around
with it all night what the hell you've
already installed Windows 7 once doing
it again the next morning to recover
your system should be easy and finally
number one the reality check can you
believe that Microsoft put the launch of
Windows 7 in our hands
that's what yeah I'm afraid there's just
one conclusion to all this this is no
clever self parody this is why Microsoft
isn't Apple have fun out there see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
