gentlemen it's Friday June nineteenth I
Maya's Akhtar Jeff isn't in because he's
on assignment at e3 if you want to hear
his thoughts about it go check out the
Beast cast at giantbomb.com he's been
doing a bunch of great work over there
today we've got Bridget Carey joining us
we've also got my son silently sitting
in a corner we'll see how silent hill be
throughout the episode bridge Hayden hey
good to be here so you just got back
from a jaunt in Disney World right a
jaunt this weekend John little gets away
yeah oh I I'm a big Disney fan for
anyone who was just turning into the
first time on who i am and i haven't
been in a while and a while being like a
year and a half and so I was really
jonesing for for another dose and I
definitely got my dose so I am i'm gonna
i'm in happy spirits so how does one
take on disney world in a weekend from
New York going all the way to Florida
and then like coming back you were back
on Monday so you were just gonna play
two days right yeah i was back sunday
night so i'm growing up in florida I'm
done Disney quite a few times and so I'm
not there looking to see everything at
disney world there's obviously for parks
you can't I mean you if you were to do
all four pork parks in one day you're
only seeing the top rides but the way I
did it um you can I start my day 8 a.m.
and ended at two in the morning did too
barks they had a Star Wars weekend event
which is pretty cool you have
stormtroopers walking around chewy and
and the gang and like I'm in walking
around cuz they have that you know Star
Wars ride star tours and so they kind of
really build up have fans come people
dress up I mean we're talking people it
is like you know the high 80s it is
really hot and people are in serious
makeup and gowns and so I applaud them
but also the most creative Star Wars
t-shirts I've ever seen like things you
just don't find online everyone comes
out of the woodwork you know all over
the world to come to this you know
couple weekend event and to buy random
merchandise in art and they just bring
out their craziest Star Wars t-shirts
like mashups like a cash but what was
one of them you know like a like Darth
Vader you know looks like he's pumping
iron you know like like no just weird I
can't even come Sam
during cuz it's like so much is filling
my head at once um I guess so much
amazing I can't get it had my lips um
but let's just say lots of fun puns I
saw people two girls do princesses
versions of Jedi's so you had the frozen
you know Anna and and and the Rapunzel
but they're Jedi versions people are
just so creative it's so much fun to be
there and then at night you just like
closed the park at two in the morning
and the next day you just kind of relax
at the resort you just chill by the pool
get in that Florida Sun and your
rejuvenated I don't know if I need the
Sun if on audio I don't know if you can
hear how Brown I am but I'm pretty brown
at this time nothing do with the tan
just them oh I don't tan but I'm just
saying like there's something about that
Orlando air and that and that no special
water that you smell on the rides it's
just something you can't get anywhere
else so I I'd seen a bunch of weird
mashups when it comes to Disney I saw a
I guess it's disney now Star Wars I saw
a Hulk Hogan Matt like faced with a
Darth Vader helmet mashup it was
terrifying but awesome at the same time
it just has like in a walrus mustache
yeah that that helmet it says like I'm
your father brother I don't know if
you're into the pro wrestling anymore
but it's the mash ups that were so much
fun yes is just before you've all a lot
of fun with it and especially with
Disney nerd isms and put that together
with Star Wars nerd isms oh it's just a
whole bunch of nerd what is a frozen
Jedi look like is it like the blue dress
with like a brown robe it's Elsa but you
know she's she just has more of a hoodie
like like they made their own little
interpretations of the dress so so it's
more like the ELSA colors but she's got
like a sash on them to hold her like you
know you know weapons and it's just more
more gloves involved and just looks a
little more medieval perhaps mixed with
a hoodie so let's switch topic to e3 I
don't even covering if we've seen that
update I'd imagine yeah yeah okay so
I've been kind of keeping tabs of it I
know there's no way on earth I'm going
to do this justice as compared to Jeff
so again go check out beast cast I've
been paying attention though because
this can't you mean you can't not pay
attention this guy know what's going on
did you see anything or at least read
about anything interesting because the
coolest thing I've seen so far this
sounds lame i think that I'm gonna say
this cuphead yes that's the only
that I care about right now that is
amazing okay so if you have eaten
cuphead it looks like a 30s 40s style
animation disney animation style when it
comes to this game it looks accelerated
yes that this is something in the style
of the old Betty Boop cartoons Popeye
and and obviously Disney Silly
Symphonies is that whole era in the 30s
where it was a little more wacky than it
is today and that the trailer that's
online for this thing is so wild it's
demented almost and that's kind of its
kind of us something you haven't seen
before yes sounds like it's what the the
two leads mug head and cuphead I think
those are the leads and they make a deal
with the devil or something make a deal
with the devil and they're supposed to
go ahead and do what the devil says for
like the rest of the game I assume so
once they get I guess dandy they're
doing the devil's bidding it sounds like
to win back their souls and in that
going up against big bosses that are
just you know these Wiggly armed crazy
headed skeletons and mermaids and things
that you would see in those old cartoons
from from that era and you know when you
that obviously the drawings themselves
have been done before but you just
haven't seen that in a video game before
I think honestly when I'm watching III
and all these trailers I'm finding
boredom in the fact that everything is
the end of the world I mean the POC
ellipse is getting mundane I'm just
tired of it and look I mean yeah okay it
looks great okay another way to send
that the world does so sad okay okay how
many more zombies you're gonna get this
is something refreshing it was a no
man's sky that looked like it was a
little depressing that Sony had that
game where you go to these worlds and
check it out like oh look at this one
and now there are some giant robots
trying to stop stop us because we're not
supposed to be here but then I wanna saw
cop head I was like this looks like fun
actual phone my son was watching the
trailer even though it's that's not
advised for children and he was like
maybe we can get that because he was his
eyes are super widened look like a
playable cartoon yes when I was a kid I
tried out I think it's called dragon's
lair you ever tried this game no it was
a laser disc based arcade machine and it
had great animated I footage it wasn't
like you could really play it so much
you pick like what should the carrier to
do a or b because it's a laserdisc you
just have to choose it looked
beautifully thought it'd be a game that
you could play as a cart
but that didn't really happen this thing
though looks just fantastic even the
silliness when when the character just
stops and they do that weird little knee
jiggle you know I'm talking about they
kind of floating up and down which is so
indicative of really old cartoons it's
kind of like oh look we're animated we
can move you can't tell that I'm moving
up and down in the chair but I am
because that's what it's like it I
really think that's really cool looking
oh that's that that's what I do whenever
it's actually the motion i do like
whenever you're just waiting for
something or feeling a little kooky I
just I fallen I love those cartoons
obviously I'm a Disney fan I'm a fan of
the older stuff it's why I liked you
know the the the mickey games that kind
of brought out Oswald for a little bit
because it kind of played off the weird
black and white world of yesteryear so
I'm looking forward to that although I
think about a three is I here's see a
lot of games that don't even come out
this year it's it it almost takes away
some of the fun of like hey look at this
coming out sometime in the next two
thousand sixteen when no date or all
this VR talk and a no release date yet
cop had at the end says coming in 1936
or 80 years after right so it'll be next
year before we see that but VR was
freaking huge it was everywhere
Microsoft was all over this stuff they
partnered with oculus and valve they're
like yeah sure we'll discover this and
we have hololens so they're like way way
big into VR what do you think about VR
from everything I'm reading I'm not
impressed and I'm kind of bored at this
point they need to stop talking about
unless they're going to show something
at this point for example reading about
the experience on hololens that's the
one we're like 3d images kind of float
in the room around you they're not
allowing any photo or video being taken
of the experience which shows you how
they're not ready yet or they're just
trying to build a pipe but when i read
with scott stein writes about it and his
experience is that it's it's still a
little weird wing with the peripheral
vision it you have to be straight on
looking although it's cool in concept
all the time you see all this lots of
potential here types of stories but the
price will probably be so high that
it'll be a great add-on for a moment in
a game but will it be something that you
always want to have on
for you get dizzy or you know will you
really want to play an entire game that
way or will be a very expensive
accessory for one level hollow lens is
supposed to be a self-contained
computer's not supposed to necessarily
need to be an accessory to something
else so it's got to be expensive I'm
really curious by the battery life like
how long can that things stay on your
head and stay cool first of all that's
gotta be tons of processing power when
you're moving your head around and
there's a virtual giant screen on one
side or you're playing effectively
minecraft the shirt off minecraft and I
could see that being awesome especially
because I have a tiny apartment and a
child who likes toys I'm like wow
virtual toys now that's a way to go yeah
no this does seem fun for what it can do
and imagine the plop changes playtime
exactly you can think about things
differently things are in the room with
you your imagination can have some fun
with that I can see that that being used
in different types of storytelling but
I'm tired of waiting in here and all
this hype I'm and and I just don't think
that people are going to probably dish
out five hundred dollars or more for
something like this because I'm glad
there were I guess I'm glad they're
working on the technology thanks for the
future the future that won't be here and
realistic for another four more years
try out cnet's this is not meant to be a
plug but like I tried this out we had
seen that had this be are virtually come
to e3 experience shot with this awesome
camera ashley Esqueda was on there and
it gave me kind of a tour and did you
try that actually what made it neat and
how they filmed this is that you had to
compute at to turn your head you had to
get involved because you had Ashley on
your right and and and and and you had
to turn around it to like see everyone
who's talking because they're not all in
right in front of you it thought that
was pretty creative i will say yeah
we're with the galaxy gear VR and I
think cardboard and so I tried it with
gear and was the first time I've ever
actually used it which is really weird
considering it's like usually about 10
feet from me I just never bothered like
hey I want to try that out and grab well
isn't that the problem with all this how
you gonna get people they interested in
it if we're sitting here with all the
tech around cats miners going around
he's like hey does anybody want to try
this and I'm like okay I'll do it so put
this it's very clunky to put on just in
general got put this like helmet like
kind of thing on they got putting on a
different pair of headphones so you have
this weird crisscrossing
going on so it's definitely not elegant
in putting on this this experience but
once you're in it and just looking
around it's really bizarre because
you're sitting in a chair and your first
instinct is kind of like just sit still
and that's not what they want you to do
so in the video it's really good because
you look around you look there's
Nintendo you high up they took advantage
of a lot of the different perspectives
you'd get and I thought it was really
cool and then I let my boy try it out so
he was in the office and they put it on
him and he's like dad where are you
because you completely shut out from the
outside world there's no like augmented
layer over what's going on it's
completely closed off I thought like I
have set the bar too high he's only it's
gonna be five in a week or two but like
he's not he's like we can do that again
I'm like I don't know really because
that phone was getting really hot is the
the it's killing the battery the note
that's what yeah that's had so and
there's also a the bit of screen door
effect because the resolution on the
screen isn't as high so it's kind of
cool it's really close to cool but like
I can't see spending you know what
whatever the oculus rifts gonna cost
like 1,500 bucks that I think is the
rumored number or whatever computer you
need to have that on the side it has to
be pretty beefy to handle that too seems
like it's a really neat kind of thing
we're not like hey I got this idea I'm
gonna spend either $2,000 an awesome TV
or i can get a virtual cinema on my face
right you know where this is going to
start to like take off it is with kids
and it's with things like mattel and how
they're working with Google cardboard in
that new type of view master toy where
you could put mom and dad's phone inside
and get that quick hit of a 3d moment
but it's not strapped to your head you
have to hold it up just like that old
red viewmont master a little I guess
it's called view masters right yeah so
you got to hold it up and you dip in and
you dip out and it's good for
educational moments and then that'll get
the next generation really thinking
about it maybe more so but for now yeah
making that huge investment and just
sitting and watching a whole movie that
way or having a long-term experience
that way it's a little expensive yeah
dan graziano was telling me about the
virtual cinemas experience we get to see
a giant movie but then he looks down and
he has no body
freaked him out and it's small things
like that you don't even think about oh
yeah I have a hand that should should
appear if I wave it to the right it's
gone you look down there's no body and
there's nobody else in the theater with
you so do you need to populate that well
the first time I used an oculus was of
course they threw at me a scary zombie
game and when it started to eat my face
the first thing I wanted to do was you
know punch it so I start kicking and
punching and yeah that next step is
getting our bodies involved and making
it feel like we're there because your
mind was already starting to think that
way what else came out with Microsoft BR
we had Sony showing off very little
there's a couple of remade games i think
final fantasy 7 is that the dude i don't
know i think it was seven i think it was
like the yeah a lot of nostalgia is
being played up more more starfox more
final fantasy Nintendo's in a holding
pattern they're like yeah we have a new
console coming out next year so your
puppets and I'm making that up to did
you see the puppets I I did see a little
bit of the puppet action I'm fan of
puppets I think it was creative better
than like you know staring at some some
person at a suit talking go ahead give
me give me puppets so Nintendo didn't
have a live actual press conference and
I'm being shown seen a shown right now
that my son failed at a level at Star
Wars angry birds or angry birds star
wars sorry buddy I can't fix that right
now but anyway there were these awesome
puppets of Mario's creator and the
president of Nintendo America and the
president of Nintendo Japan and there's
three puppets and they're walking around
and they slowly start taking on these
animal like characteristics one starts
looking more like a fox and then
eventually to pull out star fox and
you've got do a barrel roll and that's
pretty much the highlight I want to do
an entire cnet show as Bridget the
muppet I think I think that I think I
want to take that idea and which let's
let's do it let's do the 44 Muppet style
you know that's how the YouTube video
should be and we do this this actually
does come out on youtube we do audio
only maybe that's how we do it is that
we just have puppet version you can make
your own Muppet they have this thing at
where is it the toy store the really big
one um fio yeah that's going down I know
but they're moving it but you can make
your own Jim Henson Muppet I mean it's
kind of expensive but you can make your
own I think I might have to do that
we'll have to have 44 Muppets made and
do this Muppet style no it's odd to
actually know to puppet makers or sort
of know to puppet makers that's amazing
can can we have brunch I wanted okay
when you go to Atlanta I'll have an
introduction done we're gonna take a
quick break we have sponsors today so
let's take a quick break and when we
come back read cheeseburgers mmm all
right guys it's time to talk about that

back talking about a red cheeseburger so
if you're thinking about puppets get
that out of your head unless it's a
puppet cheese burger burger king there's
news again by Burger King they've done a
black hamburger before now they've done
it a bread cheese burger it's called the
aqha burger acha means right in Japan I
didn't know that maybe it's um
pronouncing that wrong the cheeseburgers
got a red cheese a red bun red tomatoes
red sauce that BK Japan calls angry
sauce all caps must be spicy it's
supposed to be like red chilies goes on
sale July third you can get a chicken
version for about 540 n or the samurai
beef at 690 n that's about four or five
bucks you need to test this in America
we would eat this up red yes I'll tell
you what in the past that black one what
does it do subconsciously you start
thinking that thing is rotten and you
don't want to eat it there are some
colors you don't want to eat you don't
want to eat blue things that's why blue
eminem's are kind of rare there are no
blue real foods except for blueberries
um so there's some things in your mind
that you don't think our appetizing but
red there's plenty of red foods we
should do it everyone loves red red
things oh I would love to I would love
to eat this now I'll tell you what is
gross you know those like green milk
shakes I can't get myself to do that I
know it's just food coloring McDonald's
you're looking at me strange I know I'm
like why would the green milkshake which
is in a big big not see-through
container bother you well I'm just
saying a green hamburger would look a
little weird but read this delicious
let's do it let's do it here let's get
creative let's have a little fun I'm
just saying I think I think Japan to
some crazy things with their food this
might be the one thing we would do to we
write about it we write about that means
people are interested that means bring
it over here let us try it I think this
is freakish I can't believe you're so
excited about you're right about the red
food concept that we do meet isn't
colored know that looks meat like
doesn't the red cheese throw you off a
little bit that's kind of gross looking
like it looks like somebody had taken a
piece of red plastic put it on top of a
burger and this is by the way we're
looking to the press images what you
know are the ones done by food stylists
right so I want you to imagine I
wouldn't imagine a cheeseburger that has
been squashed and it's
read though it's just kind of you know
what because I'm thinking I've seen
cheese have read elements and trying to
think of like red wax around yeah you're
like like it's kind of you eating the
wax instead he's just take the wax off
the bells I'm trying to think of like
why I'm not a reasons why I'm not
appalled by this and maybe maybe it just
meant to be everybody no you're right i
don't think it's not appalling the black
one looks burnt and it looks like
something's wrong like we're trying to
go no that's like dirt you don't to eat
that if it's Browns if it's brown drink
it down if it's black send it back if
it's red isn't go ahead I think is that
guy apparently that's the way to go with
bread it's you know what maybe you've
convinced me that it's not such a bad
idea it doesn't look so bad but what
kind of like we're gonna see are we ever
gonna see these gimmicks out here we
have like Taco Bell just goes all out
right now chicken fries it's kind of a
gimmick to me that I can't I can't do it
I can't do wrong with chicken fries
compared to chicken fingers I don't know
I think they're just too too too much I
don't know I don't know I just rather
have the chicken nuggets I'm a chicken
noise wait a second it's like not
chicken McNuggets you mean regular
chicken nuggets yeah bruh I don't know
what something about the size of them
seems more advertising than the sticks
but I don't know if what am I talking
about i'm clearly i clearly have issues
of em being picky over something that's
actually just just different shaped
breaded chicken over a color it's just
tubular chicken right yes I'm attracted
to weird things on menus sometimes like
you know different color I'm going to
add a visual of you like holding up a
weird menu and just face gonna smack
right into a trap wait wait when you're
at a restaurant and you see something
like snake on the menu or alligator are
you the kind of person who goes you
never or do you want to try because it's
different I don't mind trying it just
depends on the price I'm like isn't am I
gonna commit to this and how big is this
can I try an appetizer version because
that's fine but if I have to commit to
this is my entree and I'm like I gotta
eat this in this is my actual dinner I'm
gonna have to commit to it I don't know
if I can do it yeah there is one thing
that I can't just stand and that's ice
cream that looks rainbow colored because
I can imagine it's like bubblegum
flavored or something I just can't like
they always had that Superman you know I
scream sometimes where it's like a total
rainbow then it's too much color then
it's too much for me but and I haven't
tried that maybe that'll be my next
thing I have to try before I have my red
burger
the actual ice cream not not like they
like nothing i sees or something no i
mean like when you go to like a haagen
dazs or ben jerry's i know there's
always that one tub that's like why are
you a rainbow what flavor are you I
don't want to try you you everyone heinz
tried out there's weird like like this
quirky catch up that they had a blue one
that a purple lime green yeah and none
of those did well because they were like
disgusting looking because people you
know think yeah like maybe that's a
different flavor I guess the green one
look like relish look like not I didn't
do I've had green catch up though I
don't think if face me yeah what do you
mean hitting bays you I don't know it I
was okay with it may be big because I
yeah the relish I'm really analyzing now
my my food issues you're really bringing
up some things that's why I'm pausing a
little bit I like that you actually
thought this through entirely all I
thought was like knee-jerk it's red
that's weird you're like no wait a min
red is the natural color and that's what
people eat it's like um that's what I
used to think about of wraps when I like
when I was a little kid I'm like why are
there green wraps what does that mean I
don't understand its oh ok that's oh the
red ones are tomato okay that's neat you
know people have a thing with candies
that they like read more than other
colors or like red Eminem's more but
then they're all the same flavor that's
weird to me only the claim that I can
taste the difference between red 40 and
yellow whatever number it is that's
weird to me but when it comes to
starbursts and stuff like that I only
like the citrusy ones I'm the weird one
I never eat the red I always like the
yellow you like the yellow ones that's
the nobody like to go that's why I'm put
on this earth to eat all the yellow
candies you're no you aren't that you
and the rest of society are casting
aside unfairly for the karmic balance of
the universe Bridget Carey exists bless
you all turned in east and basically an
old lady who likes lemon candies what
can I say is that why you also like
butterscotch is somewhere all the time
and your bag of the showing up yet I did
buy some really they're kind of nice
when you're through your throat's a
little sore I don't know where you even
get those little candies but you know
where to get them to store you okay all
right cool let's talk about ketchup and
porn because why not Heinz you know the
ketchup maker they're in trouble because
of a QR code they had on a bottle of
ketchup so you know if you've ever
looked at a bottle of ketchup at least
Heinz one you might see a QR code and
the thing is they were running a contest
for two years 2012
2014 you'd scan the QR code and you
could design your own label so I think
either was a contest or you get to
actually make your own so in Germany
this guy scan the QR code on the bottle
and instead of being taken to a
hindsight he was taken to a hardcore
porn site owned by fun Dorado now this
is in Germany right this isn't here like
I can't go at the store and get this you
know I don't I didn't check they're
gonna find that part out I think it's in
Germany is this QR code you know
region-specific or not because I would
think that if it was just a website it
would just resolve whatever area you
were in and go ahead right so I don't
know the answer that this this is
important lesson that you never know
what you're gonna get with the mysteries
the mysteries of the QR code oh my gosh
yeah so this is terrible so Heinz they
kind of let the registration slip that
was part of the problem so it's it's a
nasty ol bottle of ketchup that God's
can the contest was over kontes been
over ketchups minute like it was made in
20 to 14 or so and basically it's been
sitting around for a while so the guy
just bought it in the store so he Daniel
Correll is his name just catch a blast
that it was over I would take a while
it's only what June it lasts a year so
that means that that within the year
they they must've let it expire really
quickly well maybe Daniel bought it at a
discount place okay we don't know we
know what Daniel did no offense Daniel
maybe you bought it from a store that
was they were just keeping this ketchup
it was on clearance you're like cool six
months I can be done catch up with like
two days then you deserve tonight this
horrible surprise or maybe wonderful
surprise it depends when he looks so
hanns-g signs Heinz is trying to figure
out what to do with it so they decided
that they will let Corral create his own
label and send him a free bottle printed
with his design do you think that's
enough forum do you think that's what he
should I would design a bottle that that
has some implications of what you saw on
the point site he's mildly offended if
you have the power to design a bottle
after something like that happens to you
I'd make it definitely titillating oh
it's just the label he's designing not
the actual bottle shape we've got like
you got some old ideas by mold Emmett
like you know plastic molds not like
of the horrible not not not a green
ketchup right not a green yeah he can't
do that and here's the fun thing bun
Dorado offer him a one-year subscription
to fun Dorado oh jeez well he wins on
all counts here he gets one free year of
porn he gets one customized bottle of
ketchup and what did he have to lose
here all kinds of condiments related
jokes you're coming into my head we
won't touch those at all so let's talk
about drinking as I likes to drink I saw
this Kickstarter we had it on cnet it
was something called partying and it
makes making cocktails as easy as those
cake up things for coffee yeah so the
machine would have you would have
provide the alcohol so be gin vodka
tequila and the fourth one rum and what
these guys actually give you these
little packets now the packets aren't
little flavored packets of powder or
anything they're actually the liquid
based ingredients that you'd have for
cocktails so like you could pop them
open and probably just shoot them back
like it it's not missing water or
anything or well you they would be well
the actual pods are not alcoholic you
provide the alcohol okay so it's
basically every other ingredient for
this so the machine looks like a weird
like scientific k-cup meets some kind of
a beaker kind of system there and what
left you do is you put in it looks like
a coffee maker yeah pretty much you put
it in and it actually can read the
barcode to tell you oh by the way when
you're making a cosmopolitan so the
machine itself will take the right
amount of alcohol mix it in with the pod
and just dispense it into whatever
container you want so you have to like
pour in your vodka or and then what is
the pod do okay so you have four
containers surrounding the actual
machine so you've got the machine and
just think of a k-cup machine so on the
left and right you've got two separate
containers holding gin vodka tequila and
rum so what it does is it just pulls the
actual alcohol out of the appropriate
bin okay gotcha and so all right so then
but I don't get the pod part still so
right it's gonna suck up whatever the
for alcohol is already like
loaded it up with but was the pods for
flavoring like that give you the
strawberry flavor or something that's
like a sex on the beach here vodka so
you it'll take the vodka from your own
stash there but in the pod you have
peach schnapps cranberry juice and
pineapple juice you have to go out and
buy those actual things you'll have just
the right amount so you just pop it in
make you one drink but the pods
themselves are they alcoholic I'm appear
to be okay see that's how they get
around who they sell it to in the right
and the rights to sell it you on your
own have to do the the main containers
okay all right following I kind of like
this thing because I mean it's not going
to taste as good well they claim that
it's supposed to because they had like a
they have a bunch of research involved
and a mixologist who helped make make
the pods she claims that the drinks will
be as if she made them now there's no
actual like credentials to her in the
Kickstarter video saying she's a
world-renowned mixologist or mildly
popular or if she even works anywhere as
a mixologist it just says that she is a
mixologist and these are the drink that
she'd make for you all right well that
is kind of interesting but I you know I
have heard that others are kind of
making this um I I mean I think the cake
up folks are even looking into this from
from things I've read I would you know
so I guess now you're picky guests can
pick their own concoctions based on
instead of just going with it ever you
have you can be like all right do you
want this do you want that and they can
do their own its kind of it seems
novelty fun for a party but there's
something about mixing your own drinks
it's kind of fun too I don't know it
might be pretty expensive I'm saying
considering just the novelty factor it's
250 bucks if you get as a Kickstarter
and after Kickstarter something costs
four hundred dollars at that point you
could probably hire a bartender for the
day for the night yeah we're just more
impressive and you'll get your little
umbrellas too on the moon it is gonna
taste like a mixologist made it because
you have a bartender with you release
that one night but I think it's an
interesting idea I could see this kind
of thing taking off I can see it like a
hotels or something like you to pay
couple bucks like oh come on here you go
or you have like the most inept
bartender somewhere like okay I don't
want to make the drink I'll just go to
the Machine and then I'll bring you your
martini cuz I don't know anything just
imagine just like
imagine some kid who knows nothing going
I'll be right back and then here's your
martini sir you like it thanks kid this
isn't bad it tastes like a machine made
it and we're losing the art form there's
an art to this it's all machines are
gonna be doing everything including
giddiness drunk for their eventual
takeover well there are those wine
machines they just dispense one class at
a time i'm looking forward to win the
kind of SodaStream type bubble you know
the carbonating machines can put can do
that with alcohol because they're
working with that right now it's only
water for sodastream but they'll be able
to reef is your wine I mean now that is
something I paper because I can do water
I could do juice and then I can reef is
my wine and keep the party going on that
note we're gonna take another break we
get another sponsor we'll be right back
and don't go away so if you already have
a car there's a good chance you can make
some extra money on it without even
selling the thing we all know that cars
values depreciate like crazy you take it
off the lot it loses ten percent over a
year it loses twenty percent of its
value now how could you make some extra
money but you don't have to even figure
that out RelayRides hasn't all figured
out for you because RelayRides is a
peer-to-peer car rental company it's
part of that sharing economy you've
heard about kind of like Airbnb and uber
what you get to do is rent out your car
on RelayRides and earn as much as one
thousand dollars per month so you got
this car that needs maintenance anyway
you got this car just sitting in the
driveway losing value but you could earn
extra money some owners earn as much as
six thousand dollars per month now what
about the people who are going to drive
your car don't worry about that
relayrides prescreened each renter and
provides car owners with 1 million
dollars of insurance coverage with no
out-of-pocket expenses to you so you
don't have to worry you control when
your car is available for rent by the
way so it's like people are going to be
calling you up randomly at night saying
hey I need a car like no don't worry
about that you control when your car is
available there's a lot of people out
there doing this they're becoming
entrepreneurs just by owning cars you
could turn your idle car into extra
money you can sign up free right now at

when you go to RelayRides calm / 40 for
now back to our show and we're back
we're going to take a look at the reddit
because I actually bothered to put up a
show thread saying Bridget Carey is
going to be on what do you want to ask
her what's going on it says send in your
questions about tech or Disney or
Florida or a fourth thing anyone have
questions for me or now they did
actually so let's ask you this kmac
wrote in and wrote which Disney princess
does bridget most associate with well
I've been told I look a lot like
Rapunzel from the recent movie hmm
because you know just kind of like fish
facially um this is it's a really
personally tough question because at
times you know i'm i'm the spirit of
aerial or maybe I look more like sleepy
beauty I actually walk around the park
with us the beauty crown it's kind of
amazing because everyone has to bow to
you when they work there o is new world
yeah unlike central or like madison
square park which park are you going to
wearing a crown and are they doing that
it's a thing now no actually you
probably go to know it even look twice
right I was like how do you bow that's
pretty impressive um but how that that
is tough because it depends on your mood
everyone has a different oh but I'm
gonna say at least in terms of dressing
up I have dressed up as Aurora and I
love I love the little mermaid I love
our aerial and I think my next one I
have to dress up as is tangled is
Rapunzel which one is Aurora on sleeping
beauty that's her name yes or she also
went by Briar Rose when she was you know
not knowing she was a princess hiding in
the forest when Prince Philip came by I
didn't know they had names I don't know
why probably cuz I haven't bothered to
watch him again it's the princes that
that sometimes don't have names you know
it's the princes who who kind of get you
know in the old ones you know like Snow
White was just prince and then there's
Prince Charming which is Cinderella and
then later on they started actually with
though names so they were just as
interchangeable as anybody else they're
like II yeah you you you seem you're the
Prince right
oh yeah you're still the Prince of
whatever actually if you ever read the
comics the fable comics they actually
play off that that that there's just one
player prince who got around and she did
it all and he was just the prince and it
was pretty funny stuff uh another
question from Mary pop in a cap is the
60th anniversary all hype oh my disney
land I have never been to Disneyland and
that was one thing on my list it's my
list to go to all the worlds I grown up
in Florida I love disney world the most
so I know Disneyland's doing this big
60th thing they got like a bunch of they
like make it all sparkly extra on the
castle and I got so much for things you
can buy I have his little extra
merchandise so I really can't answer
about the hype or not cuz I haven't been
there I went to went to Florida the
coolest thing about Flores anniversary
while back as they made the castle giant
cake do you remember Hank I remember
that was a giant like like almost bounce
house type balloon around the whole
thing it's amazing what they can do to
that park and just turn it around so
like you ever noticed oh by the way
that's off-limits near scaffolding up
for like two years if you walk around
New York City like how long's the
scaffolding Mia been up and then when it
disappears you're really confused yeah
but out in Disney World's like it's up
and done within a couple minutes well
actually right now they're they're
adding they're expanding the castle in
Florida and what they're doing is adding
extra tower pillars around it and to
hide it they're scaffolding so to speak
their little wall is a painted-on tree
that looks like other trees so with the
quick glance it's not you know harsh to
the eyes I think what's most amusing of
Florida is that they built extra castles
in the past year or two so now you walk
around you don't just see Cinderella's
castle but you see bells castle you see
the tower from Rapunzel depending on
where you're looking and you see aerials
cuz it's so magically making me all
worked up Newcastle be under the sea
Prince Eric's like castle okay I guess
now I've never seen little mermaid you
know that I've never seen it it's it's
it's it's one of the classics I heard it
doesn't make any sense though yeah like
she gives up her power of speech just
did tell you listen she's 16 and she got
this big bossy lady you know kind of
kind of working her magic and kind of
she's very convincing alright saying
that you you know you got your body
language
you can work a girl you can get your
true love you know do it and you know
your six-year making the best decisions
when you're only advice is coming from a
little flounder fish in some crab you
know so yeah she think she knows it all
sounds like because his teenager
involved okay yeah how old's the
Princeton Oh probably not 16 oh boy
that's a little bit more I don't know I
don't know if they ever say I mean she
actually says in her song you know she
at 16 in meta de i mean i'll have the
princesses are a little young you know
this year's like dog years do you age
faster as if i guess a more person
excuse me well no exposure to the Sun
she probably had great skin oh it was
really really like pruney yeah really
really gross I don't know if that's
gonna work uh I'm gonna have to watch
this movie so you have knowledge about
this I don't know when people have time
to do all this stuff though so I
understand well you you you have you
have you have a kid you this is the time
to like get into all the Disney movies
but not look dorky that you're doing it
on your own you're really just doing it
to it to white in his world to to uh you
know it's good for boys to watch
princess movies I'd say it's not it's
more like I'm not a big fan of musicals
which is a problem like oh oh but right
but but alan menken who has done all the
best musicals beauty the beast little
mermaid he's the one who was called back
in to do the enchanted movie have you
seen that it parodies all of them i have
not i mean it is the that is the best
music for disney air on this argument
the other day with like what one disney
movie which you showed us someone who's
never seen a disney movie and you have
to do what one of the one of the great
musicals like Beauty and the Beast to
really represent it for the first time
person I think compared to maybe some of
the older ones sorry getting so deep can
it hold podcast on that don't worry
there's no more that there's still more
Disney questions elvia even gotten to Al
viateur a rigid Disney just released an
oculus app that lets you walk around and
explore any world in any of their movies
but you have to listen to let it go over
and over again would you do it yeah it's
not a problem edit Oh which move your
roles will you visit first I actually
spent some time at the park looking at
the animation cells this time of all the
artwork that they do in these movies
it's so M
amazing the time that they spent on
getting the world's right I think I mean
you have your fantasy choices like the
little mermaid in the world that they
created it or there or you have like all
the streets and towns that they built
with every brick of like Beauty and the
Beast I think I'd have to go oh that's
hard I think I think they're so there's
so much beauty in all the worlds but um
i would i would want to walk around the
streets with Belle and do the whole bum
good and get some you know like like the
whole little town in the morning when
they wake up I think that'd be cute what
about it is wrong a rubber rabbit count
at all not your rabbit yeah I mean
technically yes it's gonna toontown the
head of the night were fine that's
brilliant I want to go to toontown oh
man let's do it did you get everybody
from egg every world and like I remember
that was a cross-licensing nightmare
they're like Bugs Bunny's gonna be the
same cartoonist Mickey Mouse I love that
movie let's do it and although you got
to be careful you know you don't want a
piano falling on your head but well it's
a virtual thing so even if you die I
guess you'd respond somewhere else
series right you have to respawn at some
point oh let's do it yeah toontown i
think was coming in to Disney World at
some point when I was like visiting as a
kid and I'm like wonder what that's
gonna be like I really want to see this
really want to see this really wanna see
this but yeah that would be where I
would go but let it let it go over and
over again I have nieces and I've heard
that song over and over and over and
over again think you you can condition
yourself to to be okay not go crazy I
think maybe I've listened to so many
musicals in my life that I'm okay and I
can handle it I can take it I've been in
when you're in line for something like a
Peter Pan ride over and over and over
again the worst one it's a small world
being in that line can you survive that
I mean nowadays a totally different you
have earbuds in you can like have giant
headphones on well you know what the
workers I think they make them shipped
in different places so they don't
personally go go cuckoo by just
listening to it over over again I think
they like shift how they know they're
having your party how many your party I
think those folks have to move around so
they don't go bonkers we had to send a
question just flying donkey 04 just gave
us a link and it's to a CNN article
right-handed or left-handed kangaroos
actually have a preference saying that a
lot of kangaroos had left handed so I
guess he wants this or she wants us to
discuss this one did you think the
Kangaroos had a
reference on on what pan to go with and
to does this surprise you I've seen the
boxing kangaroos I mean gosh they seem
like South paws to you well hey that
that is very funny I gotta get I can't
beat that I can't beat that that one you
win I'm sorry I was laughing at that
myself Oh Mike that was not intentional
but it was there but yeah apparently
kangaroos have a preference will have
links to this and I actually put links
at the blog post have you seen that like
really beefy kangaroo on on YouTube
that's kind of went viral well it looks
like the Hulk yeah yeah I've seen that
thing yeah that's frightening he's cool
you want to hang out with them yeah
that's good and lastly flying donkey 04
also sent this in since Jeff is away
tell us something about Jeff something
that Jeff doesn't want us to know I
don't know him that well that I don't
know his secrets I don't know what do
you know about him what I know about him
is that he's over eight feet tall I know
if the weird thing is there's a lot of
forced perspective done when it comes to
Jeff and everyone thinks he's like a
normal height person and like he's just
this kind of low-key guy he's eight feet
tall fires lightning out of his eyes his
hair is as red as a fire like like the
Sun with a perfect kind of filter it's
true it's very true if you hear it on
the internet unless picture it's got to
be true and that's what you're hearing
it here first if you never heard this
and if you just come in to see in that
office you can't help it like stare at
Jeff cuz he's just there just gigantic
Jeff that's what we call him on the
office gigantic Jeff that's what he's on
the Beast cast it's named after him one
of these days you know one thing about
Jeff is that I can't get him I can't
tempt him to eat all the terrible food I
bring into the office or any snacks he
has he has a willpower of a champion you
brought in like goofy taffy didn't you I
bring in goofy tat well he well he was
gone that this week but I mean like I'll
read full power how ordering pizza or
whatever it is there's cookies there's
doughnuts there's always something he
has he has the willpower I don't know
