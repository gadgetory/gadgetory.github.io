in the Nintendo 64 classic that's right
Nintendo just announced this Super NES
classic but we're jumping ahead to the
inevitable sequel and no Nintendo has
not officially announced such a device
yet at number five cartridge support
okay I know what you're thinking part of
this whole classic reissue thing is how
tiny the consoles are that's fine but
I'm pretty sure you could sneak in
cartridge support take a look at the
Sega Genesis flashback coming out later
this year 85 reloaded games bus you
guessed it cartridge support and number
four expandability alright maybe
Nintendo sticks in that small
form-factor
how about SD card support downloadable
games maybe just give us something that
lets us get even more games of a
Nintendo 64 classic than whatever is
pre-loaded and number three wireless
controllers the NES classic shipped with
one wired controller the SNES classic
will come with two wired controllers the
Nintendo 64 had four controller ports so
how about four wired controllers no just
no Nintendo just go with wireless
controllers in the box
and number two better menu access on the
NES classic if you want to switch games
you've got to go to the console to
access the menu that made plenty of
sense when you were physically swapping
out cartridges on the original Nintendo
however how about adding a way to head
back to the menu screen without having
to physically go over to the console and
number one availability the NES classic
was in short supply when it arrived
pre-orders for the SNES classic points
to big demand already Nintendo said it
will make more SNES classic units than
it did with the NES classic so should
Nintendo make a Nintendo 64 classic it'd
be really nice if it was available
without needing to pay a premium to a
reseller Nintendo has a really good
handle on nostalgic tech though it
imagine the reissued consoles will end
by the time we get to the Wii U classic
but maybe the company will just skip
that one entirely anyway for more top 5
