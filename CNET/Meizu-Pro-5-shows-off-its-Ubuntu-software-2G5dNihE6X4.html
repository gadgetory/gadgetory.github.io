consider yourself something of a
maverick don't like Android iOS or even
Windows Phone then you might want to
consider this it's the Mizzou Pro 5
Ubuntu Edition so the headline feature
of this phone is definitely that rather
than Android or iOS it's running Ubuntu
now this uncommon operating system is at
first actually quite frightening ly
simple so I'll give you a little bit
tour of the interface in case you're not
familiar so it's all done with gestures
if you swipe down from the top you get
this notifications panel that'll be
familiar to anyone who's used Android a
little bit if you swipe in from the
right here you get a multitasking view
of all the different apps that you've
got running be swiping from the left
that's where you get to your app
launcher so there's no homescreen as
such this is where you open apps from if
you press this home button on the bottom
here you'll get taken to the scopes
screen now the idea of scopes is that it
pulls in lots of information now that
could be from locations around you it
could be from other apps so you've got
things like news and calendar alerts
here if you swipe through you can see
places nearby you can see apps you might
like to install or new stories if you
want to customize these scopes pages
then you just swipe up from the bottom
of the screen here and you can arrange
all the different pages there software
side this is a pretty standard
smartphone so for instance this is a 5.7
inch display that's pretty big it's got
an octa-core processor on the inside
that's a 21 point 1 megapixel camera and
half so quite like the design it's got
this nice rounded back it feels pretty
good so of course not being one of the
major ly popular operating systems you
would have to put up with fewer apps on
this phone but I have to say I quite
like the interface is very simple if you
determine to have something different it
might be worth checking out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
