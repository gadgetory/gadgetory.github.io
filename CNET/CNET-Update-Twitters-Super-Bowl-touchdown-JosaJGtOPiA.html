Twitter I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your seen it update there's always some
social media story that comes out of the
Super Bowl and its commercials and this
year's big game Twitter was mentioned in
half of the 52 national commercials
usually as a call for fans to tweet out
a hashtag about that commercial Facebook
only got mentioned in for commercials
Instagram and YouTube each got one
commercial shout out but Google+ didn't
get any love from advertisers but this
year a 34-minute power outage in the
second half made things more interesting
both in the game and on Twitter
advertisers were acting quickly and
while the game was still suspended Oreo
came out with a brilliant add the tweet
read power out no problem with an image
tag line you can still dunk in the dark
tide detergent also tweeted a gag
advertisement during the interruption
saying we can't get your blackout but we
can get your stain out it's not just the
expensive commercials that are getting
attention on game day advertising
agencies are working in real time now to
push out viral messages on social media
BlackBerry's much-anticipated ad for its
new smartphone give viewers lots of
special effects but it didn't show any
of the features of the z10 phone it went
with the silly angle with the tagline in
30 seconds it's clear to show you what
it can't do well if you have more than
30 seconds you can see what the z10 can
do and our full review on cnet in this
past football season head injuries were
a big topic of conversation there were
160 head injuries this season alone and
it's become a larger problem when you
have stronger players taking more hits
and many concussions are going
undetected so one new product hopes to
change that it's called the shock box
and it's a helmet geforce sensor that
measures the impact of player sustains
and a message will be sent to a mobile
device if you should see a doctor it
costs 150 dollars today's apps to watch
are ones to avoid to android apps have
been masquerading as cleanup tools but
they are malware that snoop on your
computer's calls and your chats the
programs are called super clean and
droid cleaner and they were uncovered
recently by security software company
kaspersky when a user plugs their
android device into a Windows computer
the apps would auto run a program that
recorded audio from the pc and then sent
that data back to the malware creators
but the apps were also able to tap into
text messages the contents of a phone's
memory card all the contacts and photos
as well as the device info these apps
are no longer in the Google Play Store
but it is another example of how Google
users can't just blindly trust any app
