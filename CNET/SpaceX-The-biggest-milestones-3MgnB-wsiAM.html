two days
the September of 2008 SpaceX's Falcon
one rocket took off from Alma lek Island
making it the first time a privately
owned liquid-fueled rocket reached
Earth's orbit the Falcon once
successfully delivered a non-functional
spacecraft into orbit in July of 2009
the Falcon 1 rocketed into space again
and became the first privately owned
liquid-fueled rocket to deliver a
satellite into orbit around the Earth
that satellite was Malaysia's Razak's at
satellite which is currently in a near
equatorial orbit around the planet in
December of 2010 the Falcon rocket
blasts off into history again from Cape
Canaveral Air Force Station carrying
space X's Dragon capsule space X
successfully recovers the Dragon
spacecraft after three hours in orbit
parachuting back into the ocean this is
the first time a mission like this has
been carried out by SpaceX
in May of 2012 the Falcon 9 becomes the
first privately owned spacecraft to dock
with the International Space Station
space X delivers food water and clothing
to the astronauts onboard the ISS
the delivery also included the ashes of
more than 300 deceased people including
the remains of Star Trek actor James
Doohan better known as Scotty from the
iconic TV series must confess gentlemen
I always held a sneaking admiration for
this one
in December of 2013 the Falcon 9 took
off again but this time entered into a
geosynchronous orbit around the earth
the geosynchronous orbit is when the
spacecraft orbits the earth at the same
speed as the Earth's rotation
in April of 2016 the Falcon rocket
completes its first successful ocean
landing on the now-famous space x-drone
ship
this is a first for any space program in
history
in March of 2017 the Falcon 9 rocket
completes the first relaunch and landing
of a used orbital rocket this is a big
win for SpaceX improves their concept of
a reusable rocket booster
in June of 2017 the Falcon 9 Dragon
capsule completes its first reef light
of a commercial spacecraft to the
International Space Station
three
in February of 2018 the Falcon Heavy is
launched and becomes the world's most
powerful rocket
this launch marked the first time a pair
of recycled rocket boosters help send a
heavy payload into space
that payload was Elon Musk's personal
Tesla Roadster carrying a dummy named
star man
both rocket boosters traveled back to
earth after the launch and landed
simultaneously at Cape Canaveral in
Florida
in March of 2018 space X launches its
50th Falcon 9 rocket and successfully
delivered a Spanish communication
satellite into orbit
so what's next for SpaceX
Elon Musk has said the ultimate goal is
to send humans to Mars and for
Earthlings to become an interplanetary
species
