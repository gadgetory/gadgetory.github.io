CES 2014 I'm Bridget Carey and joining
me is my cnet colleague Jason Jenkins
from our London office and Mike Fasulo
Sony's president in the US welcome Mike
I'm glad you brought a few toys with you
today always thanks for having me you
guys had a great keynote this morning
kicking things off on the first day of
CES but also lots of gadgets for showing
off at press day so could you tell us
some about what you brought today sure
hard to figure out where to start
because we had so much exciting things
to talk about but let's start here with
this camera this is a 4k camcorder for
Sony yeah i'm dubbing it for cape or 2k
so it's a two-thousand-dollar camcorder
you can see you can hold it in the palm
of your hand chasing our wonderful model
here it's in 4k you look beautiful k
yeah thank you thank you i look better a
few years ago but yeah what are you
gonna do no why did sony want to come up
with a 4k camcorder proper personal
creation it's a personal content we look
at 4k we look at it in the broadest
extent of personal content TV shows
streaming downloading obviously sony
entertainment network 4k is a download
service you know we announced last
evening with netflix with Reed Hastings
streaming for K through netflix so
looking at giving customers the variety
of choices and making it easy and simple
for them to really enjoy the technology
do people still buy camcorders I mean
surely people just using their phones to
this sort of thing now right well they
will now I mean now they have a good
reason to i mean this camcorder like I
said it's it's more than half the size
of our previous camcorder in 4k it
shoots 4k but also high definition right
so you could use this to do your little
film creation for up-and-coming
filmmakers or you could take it on a
wedding take it to a wedding or a
recital are on vacation so it's a reason
for customers get back into camcorder
but yes they do we do use their
smartphones you guys are really pushing
into 4k televisions that this year two
of me or something that kind of started
the ball rolling last
yes so where do you see consumers kind
of getting more into 4k televisions is
it still an early stage is going to take
a while for most people to buy them for
the living rooms it will take some time
for adoption you know it's a brand new
paradigm it's new technology what we
witnessed in HD took quite a few years
quite honestly but I'm seeing a lot more
adoption in the industry which should
push the technology forward quicker than
we saw in HD so from a standards point
of view we've you know block and tackle
through some standards we've got the
motion pictures industry capturing
content and creating entertainment and
4k we've got TV shows in 4k as i said
earlier distribution digitally through
streaming and download so it's a little
different actually a lot different than
HD but it still will take some time for
mass adoption I and I imagine to the
size is an issue because to really see
that quality of a 4k television has to
be little bit bigger than most people
buy typically for TVs well the great
thing with 4k is you can go right up to
it and you get no pixelization right so
two inches away and you've seen a great
screen and there's a projector you guys
announced today to as a fourth row
short-throw hundred forty seven inch
projection but last evening I announced
nine new 4k bravia televisions from Sony
which is quite a nice assortment and you
know I've been I've been trying to
explain to folks is that consumers
should really do their research they
should really go out and get a
demonstration at retail or online and
get a quality understanding of what 4k
can do because there'll be various
versions of 4k in the market some will
simply be panels but without the engines
behind the panels you know the color
purity the upscaling the immersive pneus
the sound you're really not getting the
full experience so I encourage people to
do their homework and go out and get a
demonstration so you see that is the key
to getting 4k to take off here it's just
that people need to see it in action
right I do i do I
I think once you get a demonstration
there's no turning back seeing is
believing we also have two other things
we can see today so you have a new
smartphone here I do this was also
announced last evening for the u.s. it's
the xperia z1s and this will take a look
this will be through t-mobile and we'll
be coming to the US soon and what's
interesting with this smartphone is
inside the phone or all of Sony's core
technologies from our imaging sensors
that we have in our cameras to our audio
from our audio innovation in the home to
our television display technology built
right into the smart phones there was a
lot of talk about imaging in the keynote
today and this phone itself has a 20
megapixel camera so how important is
that becoming in the selling factor of a
smartphone to have the camera power
behind it well I think it's it's
becoming critically important and as an
imaging company we're more than happy to
provide that we announced not too long
ago lens-style cameras so right a camera
you can actually attach to your
smartphone or keep it detached with NFC
or for a Wi-Fi and actually use your
smartphone as the remote right so smart
phones you know the penetration of
smartphones is significant and why not
give the customer better ways of
capturing images it's so hard to imagine
that to stand out when you have so much
competition in the Android space me is
that where you guys see a strong point
for / Sony to kind of make a difference
and get the consumers attention with
with cameras imaging is clearly one of
our pillars all right but so is great
televisions and great audio you know we
really try to get to evoke emotion and
hit the senses of consumers and the
passion points I mean that's this year
our theme is play right and play is fun
so let's have some fun with it so this
phone's been in Europe for a while how
comes it take so long to come to us
because they are where I'm from we
reviewed this a while ago it's a great
phone we like if it's unusual to see
something come out here at first to be
honest in phones it alone why why'd it
take someone to come to us well
when we went through the merger I you
know frankly we had a larger share in
Europe through the merger our primary
focus during that time was the Japan
market and now we're not going to enter
a market and just tiptoe in so we're
ready now to enter the US and what a
great way to do that the device is this
and your sub something on your wrist I
mean wrist where is the big talking
point of CES this year the SmartWatch 2
which is a phone on your wrist and you
can put apps on it and get your phone
calls on it to your emails on it what
are you getting back from feedback from
research when it comes to consumers and
their interest in and understanding of
smartwatches too because I mean I stuck
reporters we're hearing it all the time
but what do you guys see maybe a little
too early to actually speak with
confidence on that topic it's it's still
very new right and you only have two
wrists so how many things can you put on
your wrists but what we are hearing is
ease of use is critically important
people want to take their content with
them they want to be able to multitask
whatever the device may be and the
easier we can make that for them the
more though buy into the proposition and
there's also a camera here there's also
a camera this is our alpha five thousand
i announced this last evening as well
and that is a six-hundred-dollar camera
the world's lightest interchangeable
lens aps-c camera pretty cool pretty
cool and again a great great machine it
you know I could see a professional
photographer taking this with them
because it's so lightweight and it's got
such great quality or the point and
shoot customer that wants to step up
their game so a really nice camera very
affordable in a really lightweight
package what kind of features does that
have I know a lot of times the back has
a lot more connective features then then
we're used to yeah it's got the tiltable
screen it's it's got a 16 250 zoom lens
share that simple screen a guy was all
the way up like that it comes all the
way up yeah it's guides 180 degree tilt
table it's got the aps-c
see my sensor sensor in it so you know
it's it's a really great camera for an
affordable price well speaking of things
that bend what's your take on bendable
screens for televisions this is a very
buzzy thing right now but it's like ooh
and aww but but where do you see the
practicality and and and where that
might be going in technology for
televisions I i think you know we had we
brought one to market in the US this
year it's been a niche for us it's sold
okay but it's been a niche I frankly
prefer the wedge design that we
introduced last evening it's elegant
it's great design but it's also
functional with immersive sound built
right into the the cosmetic of the
television you guys also make a some
pretty good Windows PCs but windows as a
whole as I've been doing so well
recently what do you think it needs
really microsoft needs to change to
really drive that forward you should ask
windows microsoft that and I mean we
have a great relationship with Microsoft
we're constantly innovating along along
with them and you know our duo and our
fit this year have been really
successful so we're pleased with with
our bio business well thank you Mike I
really appreciate the time you taken to
show us some great gadgets and talk to
us about sony so thank you so much my
pleasure thanks for having me here well
there's lots more to come up here at
cnet next up we one of the most popular
super sessions at CES it's seen its next
big thing coming up at the top of the
hour brian Tong we'll have more details
after the break so don't go anywhere
