get more complicated I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your cnet update if you are
a DISH Network subscriber you won't be
able to auto skip commercials on ABC
primetime shows until three days after
the program airs this major change in
the controversial autohop feature is a
result of an agreement dish made with
Disney and by restricting the ad
skipping feature dish also gets the perk
of streaming disney-owned programming
online and that includes ESPN here's why
this is a big deal dish shook things up
back in 2012 when it introduced the
hopper DVR that would auto record
primetime shows from the four major
broadcast networks and then
automatically jump over the commercial
breaks when viewed the next day the four
networks were not happy and took dish to
court for this technology because it
could hurt advertising revenue they said
programs dependent on those commercials
well dish stood by the auto hop feature
all this time until now dish cracked
while renewing its agreement to carry
Disney's networks dish made an exception
on skipping commercials for ABC so
Disney dropped its lawsuit with dish and
in the process dish also gets to stream
Disney network programming online now
this could be a giant leap forward and
how we watch live TV over the Internet
that is if dish can also make deals to
stream other networks online you won't
be able to use bargain price competitor
cups in new keurig coffee machines
coming out later this year green
mountain coffee roasters is the company
that owns the single-serve Keurig
machines said that it's coming out with
new Keurig machines that have
interactive readers programmed to only
work with Keurig licensed k-cups so it
sounds like if you want to pick up
off-brand unlicensed cups you have to
hack your coffee machine yes I just said
hack a coffee machine we're officially
in the future folks moving from coffee
to xbox microsoft is adding videos to
its music streaming service xbox music
Microsoft wants to stream the video star
Xbox music will have 92,000 music videos
and it will automatically play that
video when the matching song is streamed
Lodge
Tech makes a really good all-in-one
smart remote control but now it's coming
out with a similar device in the form of
a keyboard the harmony smart keyboard is
a universal remote in the form of a
full-sized keyboard for controlling most
of your living room devices because now
set-top boxes and smart TVs often have
prompts to type in a password or search
for programming so instead of spending
ten minutes picking through a virtual
keyboard with arrow keys this can make
your life a little easier that is if you
don't mind spending a hundred fifty
dollars on a wireless keyboard that adds
to the living room clutter that's your
tech news update you get more details at
