welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
there's a lot of products that we can
expect to come out in the near future so
let's get to the show now all of you
waiting for new MacBook Airs might be
waiting a little bit longer after Apple
insiders recent report says Apple is
holding off on releasing new Mac
hardware until OS 10 line is completed
now it's believed they want to launch
the new hardware at the same time as
line which they've targeted for a July
release with no specific date announced
Apple's ultra thin laptops are expected
to bring Sandy Bridge processors and
Thunderbolt so we'll keep you updated
now many of you Apple biters have also
been asking about Final Cut Pro X that
was demoed in April Japanese blog
Macotakara reports Apple will be
launching their flagship video editing
suite next week and a new batch of
Thunderbolt equipped accessories like
hard drives will be released alongside
of it now there's still no signs of new
mac pro's that haven't seen a refresh
since july of last year and those are
ripe for an update as well but there are
signs in the latest airport utility that
includes references to a
fourth-generation time capsule and a 5th
gen airport extreme discovered by
macrumors a 9to5 mac apple inventory at
their stores have been tight over the
past few weeks and some expected an
announcement at WWDC so we'll keep you
posted on that as well now one thing
that I do not believe is coming at all
by the end of this year is all that
silly chatter about an ipad 3 but
there's more evidence if you dig deep
inside of iOS 5 suggesting iPads of the
future will sport a Retina display with
a resolution of 2048 x 1536 double the
current iPads resolution now found in
the Twitter frameworks part of iOS 5 and
apples newsstand app there are images
with the 2x designation as well and a
similar one was found in January for
ibooks now keeping with the theme of
books the back-to-school season is here
an apple just announced one of their
lamest back to school deals ever when
you buy a qualifying Mac with apple's
education pricing from now until sep
the 20th you'll get a 100 dollar gift
card that can be used on the Mac App
Store the App Store the itunes store and
the iBookstore see the past three years
used to get an ipod touch evaluate at
199 or you could use that credit towards
the purchase of a larger one but it's
better than nothing but this seriously
has to be the worst back-to-school deal
ever Plus Microsoft is promoting their
own promo for students who buy a
computer 699 and higher they'll get a
free Xbox 360 which one would you rather
have all right let's take a break to
show you how to use the hidden keyboard
features on an iPad with mr. Donnell
bell the iPads built-in keyboard is one
of the best reviews on a touchscreen
device but seemingly doesn't offer all
the extra characters you'd have access
to on traditional computer but with a
few tips and tweaks you can really push
this keyboard to its limits first up
check out the general settings menu and
select the keyboard option here's where
you can find access to the iPads
international keyboards and selectively
enable features such as auto correction
auto capitalization caps lock and a
shortcut that inserts a period any time
you press the spacebar twice for the
real hidden gems press and hold any of
the vowel letters on the keyboard and
you'll see options for all kinds of
special characters if you click over to
the numbers and symbols keyboard you'll
find that many of the symbols also have
press and hold options in Safari you'll
also find that the dot-com button can be
used to enter net org and edu at the end
of a URL so there you go some tips on
using the iPads keyboard prasina calm
I'm Donald Bell alright thanks to the
Donald for that one now last week WWDC
brought a bunch of new features to iOS 5
but that doesn't mean they were all
original the jailbreak community has
created apps and utilities that Apple
wouldn't allow like Greg Hughes who's
Wi-Fi sync app would let you sync your
iTunes collection over your own Wi-Fi
network well apple rejected his app when
you submitted it but guess what one of
the new features in iOS 5 is syncing
your iDevice over Wi-Fi but the worst
part of it Apple not only use the same
name
from his appt pulling their new feature
Wi-Fi sync but they also deliberately
ripped off the logo as well so that's
Blaine and week so much for thing and
different we're giving you guys the bad
apple apple now for the international
man of mystery business travel Apple is
also now selling an unlocked version of
their iphone 4 that means no contract
and you can pop in a sim card with
compatible carriers around the world
yeah baby oh now here in the US it will
work with tmobile but only on their edge
network for data and the magical price
649 for the 16 gig or 749 for the 32 gig
now also if you ever want to know what
the most common iPhone pass codes are a
developer included a pass code screen on
his app that looks pretty similar to
Apple's and assume most people type in
the same passcode for their phone he
collected the data and the number one
pass code is 1234 followed by 0000 and
2580 which are the four numbers down the
center now people let's get a little
more creative than that really 0000
that's pathetic
now let's take a peek into what Apple is
looking to do based on a new patent
application the big a is attempting to
use the iphone location services and
your personal interests to make new
friends now instead of an awkward
conversation that I've never had apple
says interest can be determined by
questionnaires and you'll be able to
find people in your area that show the
same interests and introduce yourself
through your iphone now that girl in
there mock-ups is either winking at me
as allergies or just one eyeball but how
about you just go out to an area where
people eat lunch and make friends like
we do highclere Lamborghini cos y a gun
in the clutch hey you guys what is so
funny lunchtime man just get are you
serious it down yeah I got I can get
another one's gonna need it hey Cody
Mitchie baby let's go let's go oh poor
poor Arielle alright that's going to do
for this we show send us your emails and
questions to the Apple via cnet com i'm
brian Tong will answer some next week on
our show and we'll see you next time for
another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
