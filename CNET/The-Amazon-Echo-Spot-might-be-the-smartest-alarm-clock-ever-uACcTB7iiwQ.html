devices today including this guy this is
the Amazon echo spa it's a hundred and
twenty nine dollars this holiday season
what it basically is is the Amazon echo
dot and the Amazon echo show with that
touch screen kind of smashed together
into a new product that's sort of like a
smart alarm clock for your bedside you
can ask Alexa to play music access any
of her skills set timers have a video
flash briefing with clips from the news
and from your favorite shows all that
will show up here on this device
whenever you want to ask for it it also
has bluetooth and lineout compatibility
with your existing speakers so if you
wanted to hook it up to your existing
speaker setup or a Bluetooth speaker
across the room you can do that it does
have a speaker of its own though it two
watts which should be more than enough
for a casual listening at your bedside
like the echo show it's got this camera
up at the top so you can actually use
this to make video calls or to drop in
on somebody you can set up drop-in and
Amazon's Alexa app so that if you want
to check in on an elderly relative or
drop in on the kids room see what's
going on you can do that you also get a
variety of different clock faces to
choose from really customize this thing
and make it the bedside Alexa buddy of
your choice
om oh I think this is a pretty smart
idea for Amazon a lot of people already
use the echo dot as sort of a bedside
alarm clock this doubles down on that
adds the actual visual element of the
clock face and also lets you do a lot of
the things that the echo show can do at
a lower price point of one hundred and
twenty nine dollars the echo spot will
be out for the holidays we'll be sure to
test it out and let you know all about
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
