it's episode 209 of the 359 podcast and
in the house today as Joanie souls minh
and Roger Cheng good morning everybody
morning how you doing what we talked
about we are talking about the galaxy
has state launching but launching
without Bixby only night you actually
care we will talk about Fitbit delaying
reportedly delaying the launch of its
first smartwatch and lastly store the
m's of benro he's on here about amazon
parent dashboard a new way to spy on
your kids fire tablet activities
actually I want this for other tablets I
don't know if I want is for a fire
captain I don't own a fire but anyway
anyways as usual give any questions on
any of these topics live in the comment
section Brian will get to them but they
all the best we'll get to them in three
minutes 59 seconds hopefully from
approximately 32
welcome to the 359 when we talk about
top tech news of the day and all the
crap we want to throw in I'm Roger Cheng
I'm Joni salzman we're a little bit more
than a week away from the launch of the
galaxy s eight but when it comes to us
it will be missing one key feature bixby
that's right the digital assistant that
played such a big part in its
announcement isn't quite Floyd baked and
will come out in the spring Joan you
think that's going to make a difference
for samsung well considering no consumer
in the US has ever heard Bixby's dulcet
tones before it's not like they're gonna
be missing something that they already
were counting on right right but um from
reporting that sharra tooken as done
Bixby's a big linchpin to some of
Samsung's strategy right they really
want to put big speed in multiple
products they're using this phone as far
as the pilot gadget to put vicks be in
but it is kind of weird that it's gonna
be like they made such a big deal that
they spent a lot of time to the
announcement and then to have it
launched without Bixby's a little weird
I i really wonder and i vas samsung this
haven't got a response but what happens
with a button there's a dedicated bixby
button on this phone what happens about
pun when it launches are you just gonna
have a bun that you push nothing happens
well I mean there's a lot of opportunity
there there is what uh what if like um
it brought up like if there's a fire
call 911 or something yes just in case
just to like hedge all bet if there was
a way that sort of PSA it's there was a
PSA if you could program it to do
something else at pulp a camera or pulp
a specific app that would be fantastic
they haven't said anything about this
but I'm really curious what they end up
doing with the Bixby blood a problem
with that would be people get used to
like I love having my shortcut to
Spotify or Facebook whatever and then
when Bixby comes on like get out of the
way I don't know all right next up
Fitbit is reportedly delaying the launch
of its first SmartWatch Joan you've got
all the details yeah there was a report
out from yahoo finance late yesterday
that some production and design snafus
are delaying the follow up to its blaze
kind of SmartWatch fitness tracker
hybrid so it's supposed to be a phone
that really takes on the Apple watch
sort of world of smartwatches but
problems like being
tenes in the wrong place and so GPS
doesn't really work that great also
especially with go if you're taking on
Apple waterproofing isn't working
allegedly reportedly that's causing it
to them Fitbit to move the planned
launch from the spring in the United
States to the fall okay all right so i'm
not a huge delay but still a bit of a
setback do you think people even want a
Fitbit SmartWatch I don't know do people
even want a SmartWatch period that's
probably a better question and we need a
much longer podcast to dedicate to that
subject alright so lastly if you're a
parent concerned about what your kids
are watching amazon has a feature for
you it's called parent dashboard it's a
site that provides a report on what your
kids watching which sounds all great
except it only works with fire tablets
Jonas is something you would want to use
well as a mother as a parent um I'm
terrified and confounded about what's
technology could do to my kid's brain so
I would be interested in learning more
about how to you know leverage a fire
tablet so that my kid can use it for
good things and not for ill but it's I
don't know I also don't actually have my
kid on any kind of tablet so I haven't
gotten into that realm yet yeah i mean
my my my kids too young obviously to use
a tablet but i guess the point of them
is on doing this is you know the hope is
these kinds of services will get you to
buy a relatively cheap fire tablet for
your kid to use this is an extension of
free time which is an app that already
limits the amount of time that you can
actually bet you can use it the tablet
which provides age appropriate content
I've got stuff like flash cards and
gives again the add the site gives
parents a quickly digestible report on
what they're looking at in the apps and
videos for me would be YouTube videos
right like seeing what kind of content
watching is pretty clutch so all right
for more of these stories check us out
on cnet I'm Roger Cheng I'm Joe nice
osmond thanks for listening
alright so we're opening it up to the
chat send us in your questions and
comments about the stories we cover it
and maybe even beyond we'll see what we
can get to today most notably a lot of
people are kind of in agreement with
like then if Bigsby's not ready why are
they still Hawking it all right but
there's a great comment I from from
Pamela that on the other side is that
the reason they're they're not launching
with big space because it like we said
it's half-baked they're taking the time
to make it better launching with a
little longer they want to then and then
she calls us after having a problem with
him for the record I don't think we have
a problem well I mean literally the
headline was pretty neutral like I'm
asking if you care that big speed is or
isn't on this phone I think one of the
reasons why they're delaying it they are
launching this for they said they'll
launch them for the global version which
probably means that the key to work in
Korean I think they need some work or
some time to get it to work in English
properly we had demos with Bixby none of
us were actually able to use it
ourselves whenever did they use Bixby it
was always a samsung person who did it
and it was very it was a very controlled
demo and they were very limited kinds of
uses for it in the demo so I mean even
even a few weeks ago during our
briefings with what Samsung I mean it
was kind of clear that they were still
getting the kinks out on this thing so
it yeah I mean to to the commoners point
like it's kudos to them like for pushing
it back and making sure it's it's fully
ready before launches it's just like a
weird thing to that makes it a big deal
of it during the announcement and then
that had it long yeah they were counting
their chickens before they hatched a
simple case of that I mean it's one
thing I mean Apple did this with
portrait mode with iphone 7 plus you
know they said this isn't beta this
isn't gonna be out quite yet but they
actually were pretty clear and upfront
about it Samsung have implied that this
was going to be like the big feature
that you'd be able to you know boot up
your phone and turn it on immediately
while radit we talked about the big
speed button being reappropriation zwi
got to hear what you would use a big
speed button for if not big speed what
would you guys use I like Joanna like
your idea about Spotify yeah for you I
don't know what I would honest I'd
probably do it on Twitter I seem a tweet
a lot Twitter Instagram
I hope we have it on actually Instagram
would be pretty nice I would like my
calendar to pop up on the fly that'd be
nice yeah I mean I get it cuz I'm super
over organized I get notifications a lot
for calendar I feel like I'm pretty
covered there but ya know I probably
change it up week to week yeah just uh
just to have a new flavor on my phone
every week XP isn't on the US phones um
what's the next opportunity for samsung
to like have like the splashing
introduction of bixby if it's not going
to be the the no date would be the next
the note 8 or the gear s and that's not
that well no date isn't that far off
that would be well it's like the timing
works out it's August September is
usually when they launched its there's a
couple months away and but it's not like
a year no no no and it with what they're
saying with the fall launch I mean it
seems like the timing would work for it
to not only go on the s8 but also the
note 8 as well run the same time so that
would be I would guess that would be
their biggest most marquee product for
the year second to the essay there's the
gear s4 which is their SmartWatch but I
don't know if that's that's a high
profile of product it's not yeah not a
high profile of product but it's a good
use case for a boys absolutely i was
actually using the s3 this weekend
trying to text my brother and I was like
typing in his name and it was it took so
annoying took a really long time I mean
once you got a contact i was able like
send a voice text message which was fine
but like finding your contact was was
not super easy so having bixby to do it
would be super helpful yeah uh Danny
Green our buddy Danny Green says I would
have the big people in order papa john's
pizza ya know what I actually think
that's a great idea I know I wanna
repeat enjoy some free pizzas on Danny
and expanding on that he's my hero right
now don't make the big speed button mad
you wouldn't like it if it's a mad there
you go it's how will be taking that long
to come up with that joke uh I feel like
there were enough there were enough
bixby jokes initially or a Hulk jokes I
came out for the first run right yeah
but not enough no no no that there's
still plenty more room to go when it
comes to Bixby jokes question from Chad
in the chat so we'll galaxy s a
Microsoft edition
have big speak Cortana and Google
assistant seems a bit much that's a
really good question i don't i don't
know that's yeah that is that's a lot
they can't it's redundant well you can
do anything yeah you can do whatever you
want really it's all software right um i
don't know i know the the google google
system will be active for them home
button and then bixby will big with a
big speed but i don't know if there's
gonna be like a dedicated Cortana button
so that kind of leads court on on the
coal that's going backwards on
everything they're taking buttons away
from everything where they had more
buttons you know they wanted to go retro
with with a big speed more button they
kept calling it a walkie-talkie like
experience then the next year they just
pull out a calculator well they do have
their own calculator which is kind of
insane like they decide to put people to
work on a dedicated calculator app even
though android has one they wanted to
create their own uh here we go jerod in
the chat says would like it to be a
dedicated camera button just to do it
shot snapshots just one boom without
even having worry about the load screen
I think that's they would hold it down
for video so they've argue actually
that's really that's smart yeah it's
really smart I mean they argue that
there's already a dedicated camera
button the home button if you push if
you double tap is the cameras quick geek
oh nice for samsung yeah I would oh
there's no there's no physical home
button anymore so you kind of to like
find it now yeah yeah is there a
confirmation with like click for you if
you'd I don't maybe I haven't had a
chance to actually click the home button
on that as ridiculous as that sounds so
I don't know if there's like a haptic
feedback thing like like iphone but I
imagine there is i don't know i would be
worried about having a dedicated but I
there be a lot of videos on the inside
of my pocket I like at least a double
panel extra insurance did you sexy a key
grazed by yeah
a lot of people are saying that they are
pretty different about the Bixby
situation they're more interested in the
screen yes specifically nubs did not
order for Bigsby i pre-ordered for that
screen the screen is pretty gorgeous
yeah yeah yeah it's like it blows the
iphone away I mean that AMOLED screen it
stands out too i went to i was wandering
around a bit high the other day I needed
to go by rogue 10 and i went to a
physical store to buy a physical DVD
woohoo oh my god so retro about a DVD or
blu-ray blu-ray okay to be fair not
quite all right totally retro but in the
phone displays yeah the s8 pops it
really yes and it's not even like the
displays all that fancy you can see it
from a mile away yeah it's it's huge and
it's just it's colorful vibrant I mean
that really is a marquee feature i mean
if anything that's what people are
buying the phone for it it's all about
the screen yeah uh have you guys had any
experience with the i mean we don't have
an essay in office here but from
anything we've gotten exposure to has
anyone seen the vr in action people are
asking about uh I didn't get a chance to
try it out Scott did I imagine it's
going to be better but not like
significantly better I mean the screen
quality is it's bigger and I think they
packed up a few more million pixels
which makes a bit of a difference but I
mean it's not like it's not 4k it's not
AK or anything like that that's really
what you'd need for to make a difference
in the VR experience I mean I think
incremental bumping up the number of
pixels like this I don't think holy
changes the VR experience should have
Scott on some time to kind of lab right
on it oh yeah yeah yeah the big change
is the the controller right yes yeah
exactly isn't a screen thing note on
screen thing but you're right it's a
it's like daydream it has its own
control that's motion sensitive which
yeah I've argued like they should have
been from the beginning is the control
scheme is kind of weird you're always
you're touching the Saudi or your
headset you're not really sure what to
grab minutes no well just orienting it
can be a little awkward yeah but I i
mean i'll give them kudos for coming out
with us so much earlier than any other
absolutely and doing it cheaply yeah
doing it
yeah I like David's comment hi Cortana
ask Google assistant to open big speech
haha i love that wasn't ever viral video
not too long ago about an echo fighting
back and forth with the Google assistant
yeah yeah yeah which was it like at
which live theater some probably I just
kind of remember the popping through
like a Twitter feed or so yeah it was
golden though yeah I got real esoteric
when we get the essay 10 let's see if we
can get it to fight itself but bigsby
won't be around well eventually though
oh yeah yeah when it comes I would like
to see that wouldn't you yeah yeah you
get them all come on a circle here it's
Syrian law although Syria probably
wouldn't interact with this you'll just
sit out the whole say yes there's like
style I'm too good for this Jerry's
asking to elaborate on the VR does it
come with free VR yes if you pre-order
the galaxy s 8 you will get a the new
gear VR with the controller as part of
the bundle and is the note 8 going to
get 4k I have no idea no idea that's
that's coming in the fall that's months
away yeah to really there isn't a lot
there are rumors on the note 8 yeah just
because everyone's been focused on the
essayed uh bridging into competitor
territory Zachary's asking when do you
think apple will ditch that giant home
button Oh little question I'm thinking
this year this is it man you think so
the anniversary edition kind of makes
anniversary edition yeah for one of
their models at least they're gonna
ditch the home button it seems like
that's the trend of the year is getting
rid of the home button you saw LG do it
you saw samsung do it obviously and now
pressures kind of on Apple to do it or
else it's gonna look like it's it's a
little slow if it doesn't get it in this
version yeah right it's all just turning
into giant slabs a glass right i mean
the key that i want to seize whether
Apple can figure out getting the the
fingerprint sensor underneath the screen
like if i can work on the front like it
does now the home button like i think
that's that's a pretty big leap
concerned samsung couldn't quite get
that done the fingerprint sensor is in
an awkward spot like kind of right next
to the camera yeah that's still weird
yes still weird that always bugs me hey
before we wrap it up for the day because
we're getting close to the end
our friend Jesse gateman the UH
contributor winner yeah on to Roger in
the face thank you thank you photos he I
