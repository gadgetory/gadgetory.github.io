hey Spencer why say I lasted a video but
I'm back now looking better than ever
you guys you don't notice but let me
bring your attention down here this is
the brand new 8:02 pine in AC or AC for
short cloud router from dealing now if
you're wondering there are two of them
here there used to it that's how I do my
business but actually because since
there are not many Hardware AC client on
the market have to use one as a router
and the second one has a media bridge to
create a AC Wi-Fi connection for testing
most of you however or we need one of
them to be cool
now as a router the dealing comes with
four Gigabit LAN port and one gigabit
WAN port you also have USB port right
here to support an external drive for
its network storage features on the
front it has two small LED lights or
stutters and one WPS button right here
to quickly hook up a Wi-Fi client with
network at the bottom here it has a
detachable base but you do not want to
detach it because for one that would
void the warranty
and for two that the only option for
placement you cannot put the router any
other way not like that like that and
the router is not full mountable as a
wireless router the dealing support all
existing wireless client ranging from
the ATO 2.11 B to aid 0.7 AC now apart
from the support for the new AC standard
the dealing also come with a novelty is
cloud feature when hook up to an account
from the my dealing website you can
manage the router via the internet using
a web browser or a mobile apps and of
course under than that the router also
support all the feature collectively
available in other dealing router to
find out more about those feature as
well as the new router his performance
make sure you check out the in depth
review and calm for now just know that
this is a cool video of a cool product
and why am i asked and that's because
once again my name is Domino and this
has been the first look at the dir 865 L
