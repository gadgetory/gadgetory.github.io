here bright and early in San Francisco
sundar said the nexus 7 launched a year
ago and it's a great device and it's
been a huge success really for three
reasons first of all it's an incredibly
portable tablet and it fits perfectly in
your hand second it's a powerful device
at a really affordable price it's a
top-of-the-line tablet that's great for
reading books browsing the web or
playing games so today together with
together with a sous we're announcing
the new Nexus 7 and here it is
it's super slim it's almost two
millimeters thinner than the original
Nexus 7 we kept the same display size
but reduced the side basils by almost 3
millimeters on each side so the device
is now close to six millimeters narrower
it's also 50 grams lighter and you're
going to notice these improvements right
away the first time you pick up one of
these devices it actually makes a huge
difference when you're holding with one
hand it's a much more comfortable grip
and of course it fits easily into your
purse or your jacket pocket now in
building this device we really focus on
simplifying to core elements we decided
for pure black on black design with the
soft touch that everyone loved in the
original Nexus 7 we added a few glossy
finishes as subtle detail it looks
really amazing and it just feels great
in your hand the new Nexus 7 has the
same 7-inch display size but packing in
a lot more pixels we're going from 1280
by 800 in the original Nexus 7 to true
1080p HD at 920 1920 x 1200 pixels in
the new model that makes the Nexus 7 the
world's highest resolution 7-inch tablet
we've gone from 216 pixels per inch
which was great in the original Nexus 7
2 323 pixels per inch in the new model
that's the highest PPI of any tablet in
the market and of course you can watch
movies and YouTube videos in native
1080p HD resolution which is completely
unprecedented for a 7-inch tablet the
new Nexus 7 also features front and rear
facing cameras front facing camera 1
point 2 megapixels for video calling and
hangouts and we've also added a 5
megapixel rear camera for photos and
1080p video let's talk about performance
the new Nexus 7 ships with a quad-core
1.4 gigahertz Snapdragon s4 pro chipset
it packs the CPU that's eighty percent
faster and a GPU that delivers four
times the graphics frame rate compared
to the original Nexus 7 this is of
course particularly great news for
gamers which we're going to come back to
in just a bit we've also doubled the
system memory to two gigabytes which
means you can have more apps in RAM and
of course app switching is much faster
you get all the networking options dual
band Wi-Fi Bluetooth 4.0 and we're
shipping a 4G LTE version of the new
Nexus 7 it's unlocked and in the US
you'll be able to get LTE data from AT&amp;amp;T
t mobile or verizon all from the same
device it's a single US model you get
hdmi output via slimport NFC and
wireless charging which works as you'd
expect with any qi compatible charger

pixels and almost double the Cu
performance CPU performance you get one
extra hour of power compared to the
original Nexus 7 up to 9 hours of HD
video playback and up to 10 hours of web
browsing and E reading it's a
