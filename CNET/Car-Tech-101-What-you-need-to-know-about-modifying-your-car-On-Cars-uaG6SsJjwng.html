Warranty Act of 1975 it basically says
you have freedom to choose where your
car is worked on and what brands of
parts materials and fluids are used this
applies to aftermarket parts parts that
improve performance and remanufactured
parts
now beyond repairs you're also free to
get your routine maintenance done
anywhere as long as it follows factory
intervals and with substantially
equivalent parts materials and fluids
now the gotchas if the repair is done
poorly using lousy parts are incorrect
fluids you can be denied warranty
service on that part of the vehicle and
any other parts of the car that might be
damaged downstream the onus is on the
factory and/or dealer to prove that your
non dealer repair caused an issue the
dealer can charge you diagnostic fees
while they dig into your car to prove
that your non dealer repairs caused a
problem and when the factory is
providing free service like during a
recall they can direct which shop does
that work now quick reality check if you
show up at the dealer all of a sudden
one day out of the clear blue asking for
a pricey warranty repair and you've
never been there for maintenance be sure
you're carrying with you a tidy thick
meticulous folder of receipts and
procedures they're gonna deny you like
Steve Jobs daughter also another today
dealer service records are typically
stored on networks that all the
dealerships of that brand have access to
next up is CPE coverage this is customer
provided equipment things like running
boards custom tire wheel combos trick
suspension or exhaust upgraded audio
gear even a custom paint job all this
can fall under CPE now you likely have a
base level of coverage for this kind of
gear in your policy perhaps $1,000 or so
under comp and under collision which by
the way covers permanently installed
equipment not your smartphone claimed as
a nav system because you use it that way
once in a while in the car custom
equipment that is dealer installed is
probably covered under your normal
limits not CPE you may want to add
additional CPE coverage to have your
add-ons fully covered most insurance
companies are happy to sell that to you
but of course and an additional premium
cost then there's the DMCA and your car
this is the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act goes back to 1998 it's a
wide-ranging piece of legislation that
isn't really about cars but it does
apply to vehicles in that they have
electronics that contain software and
that is proprietary intellectual
property of the car maker a typical bone
of contention would be when someone
chips their car with new powertrain
management firmware to get more power
out of it that may also increase
emissions of which sent owner may avoid
detection by flashing the car back to
the factory setting temporarily when
they go to get a smog test now the
latest move in this area came in
November 2015 when the US Copyright
Office declared that it is legal under
DMCA to modify the code in your car so
long as it doesn't do so in a way that
increases emission this is roughly
analogous to earlier rulings that made
it legal to jailbreak your phone so it
could be used on other carriers than the
one you bought it from however there
could be a Magnuson Maus intersection
here if you mod your car and that causes
damage say sending too much power to the
transmission that could put you out of
warranty even though it was legal under
DMCA to make the changes in the first
place and don't take for granted that
the dealers diagnostic gear is going to
be fooled if you flashed your car in a
way that damaged it and then flashed it
back thinking you left no trace I've
just given you a lot of ammo to defend
your cars warranty but here are some
ways to end up out of pocket real fast
some warranty killers buy a salvage
title or totaled car that includes one
that has flood records so before you buy
used title search three ways a
commercial venture site the government's
nm vti-s sites and the NI CV title check
site run by the insurance industry
racing even vehicles that are shown
tearing around a track in TV commercials
are not covered if you do that there are
even apocryphal tales of dealers
monitoring auto cross Club websites to
record license-plate numbers for future
warranty denial tampering with the
odometer a huge no-no if the factory or
dealer can't be confident of the cars
mileage they have no way to know if
you're in warranty or not and all bets
are off
plus you've just broken state law so the
dealer is gonna feel pretty good about
telling you to lump it and take it up
with the DA if you're unhappy and as we
mentioned earlier aftermarket parts if
they are shown by the factory or dealer
to have screwed up some partier
car in the end it comes down to a fairly
simple set of rules take care of your
car document that you've done so and
don't let maintenance slide deferred
maintenance scans to create a rat's nest
of layered problems in your vehicle
which can make it harder for all parties
to figure out who's on the hook to fix
what because it's not so easy to figure
out where one pump bands and the next
one begins more car tech demystified
