experience it provides distinguish it
from interchangeable-lens competitors
but it's slower than it should be and
JPEG photos don't match the rest of the
field the camera has essentially the
same body as the NX 200 saw lidly built
and larger than most competitors but
that's what helps make it more
comfortable to grip for those unfamiliar
with Samsung's i Function system it
consists of a button on the lens which
invokes shooting settings such as ISO
sensitivity or shutter speed you then
adjust them using the manual focus ring
the eye function system distinguishes
the NX cameras from other il C's in a
way that adds to the shooting experience
rather than detracting from it the
alternative adjustment system is
Samsung's smart panel interactive
control panel interface which you pull
up with the function button it's easy to
use but I miss the type of customization
control that Panasonic's cameras offer
over the interface as well as the
capability to save custom settings as
with a host of Samsung's 2012 cameras
the NX to tens built-in 802 11 and
wireless can be used to connect to a
Wi-Fi network for a variety of things as
well as some peer-to-peer operations
with your smart phone well it's much
better than nothing the interface is
still fairly cumbersome you have to go
into a special Wi-Fi mode it can't save
passwords for Wi-Fi connections though
it will remember and reconnect if you
try to connect to the same access point
that's the last connection mobile link
which transfers photos between devices
in the camera basically lets you select
and copy and remote view finders exactly
that a second screen with a capture
button and the ability to toggle flash
self-timer and file size the camera
produces extremely good RAW images up to
ISO 3200 but JPEGs begin to show
noticeable artifacts as low as ISO 400
then all other respects the camera
delivers very nice images in an unusual
move it defaults to the neutral color
settings rather than the more typical
saturation and contrast boosted standard
like other cameras do I prefer that and
even the NX 2 tends neutral images come
out reasonably saturated rather than
that looking the exposures look good and
it meters consistently video looks
typical it's fine for most travel kid
and animal clips the autofocus pulses a
bit but color and exposure look good in
low-light there's some clipping in the
shadows and some color noise but
otherwise it's acceptable as with most
OLED displays the screens bright and
contrast II and it remains sufficiently
visible in direct sunlight so the
absence of a viewfinder is not much of a
problem
I like the NX 210 I enjoy shooting with
it but I think there are too many
confusing choices for automatic
operation and the JPEG quality needs to
be better and while the speed of the
autofocus never really got in my way it
should be a little more responsive for
the money I'm Laurie grinning and this
is the Samsung</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
