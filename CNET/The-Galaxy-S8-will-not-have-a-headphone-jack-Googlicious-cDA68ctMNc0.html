welcome to google issues for everything
google you can think of now google Wi-Fi
is shipping and the reviews have been
stellar for their home mesh Wi-Fi system
that starts at 129 for one unit or three
hundred dollars for a three pack that
covers up to 4,500 square feet with
speeds up to 1,200 megabits per second
using both 2 point 4 and 5 gigahertz
band now one big selling point you can
easily set up and control the system
through the google Wi-Fi app like it's
stupid easy it transitions you to the
best point for the best connection and
you can't really beat a similar system
at that price now Cena's don't know says
it's the best Wi-Fi system on the market
right now and you know why you should
believe it it's because I'm domu also
the googs is having a stellar year with
this price and this is just the icing on
the cake you know what I like all right
the Android seven-point 1.1 update we
talked about is out now but it brings a
new feature to the pixel phones from the
nexus days it's called ambient display
and it's in the move section of your
settings you can either double tap your
screen or lift your phone to show the
ambient display with the latest
notifications and time it's another one
of those subtle bells and whistles that
keeps making this phone a great one and
yes that deserves a good goal alright
the google app on android is making it
easier to keep up with the things you
care about starting now it will divide
your cards into two sections your
current interests like sports scores
stops and weather will be in one and the
other will be for upcoming stuff like
future appointments flights or even
upcoming games it's really a slight
tweak but it helps break it up nicely in
the update will be rolling out to iOS
soon as well and after a slightly
earlier than expected roll out 4k movies
are now available in the Google Play
Store prices range from 799 to 24 99 and
can be rented purchased and streamed on
Android TV devices and the new
chromecast ultra now a nice library of
125 movies starts things off but no TV
shows are available in 4k just yet and
let's get on to the latest rumors
surrounding the samsung galaxy s 8 and
there are plenty of them thanks to Sam
mobile now buckle up for the
Sam mobile has exclusively confirmed
that the s8 will not feature a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and you will
instead need to use a USBC adapter just
kind of like the iphone 7 now this also
means you won't be able to plug in and
charge your essay and use your wired
headphones at the same time maybe it
will be a good thing so the s8 will have
more space for the battery so this time
it doesn't explode but yeah everybody
get ready to accept change the top two
phone manufacturers are really doing
this moving forward now another
exclusive report from sammobile says the
new s8 will retain its 2k resolution and
not jump to 4k like some rumors had
hoped for instead the Super AMOLED panel
will be made out of a new material for a
better image quality beyond just more
pixels the report also says the screen
to height ratio of the phone is going to
be very high in samsung will ditch the
home button entirely and have a
fingerprint sensor embedded into its
display it would be the first handset to
feature optical fingerprint
identification on the market if it
arrives on schedule an additional
reports support that it will feature a
USBC port Samsung has also trademarked
the term smart AF we know the kitties
will just call it smart at samsung is
calling it smart auto focus to bring
their feature to the front facing camera
for selfies and snapchats and you know
what it will make them look that much
better and if you're all about size and
you think size matters a new Galaxy S a
rumor claims the next version of the
phone could come in at five point seven
inches and 6.2 inch screen sizes that's
an increase of more than half an inch
but if the screens are curved like they
have been in the past the physical size
of the phones may not be all that
different now we expect to see the
unveiling of the new Samsung Galaxy S
eight at Mobile World Congress in
Barcelona in February of next year
alright that's going to do it for this
week you can email me at Google licious
at cnet com or tweet me at brian Tong
thanks much for watching and we'll catch
you all next time for some more of that
