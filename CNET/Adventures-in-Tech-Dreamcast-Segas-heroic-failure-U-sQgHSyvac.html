deserving of their inevitable trip to
the landfill but the Dreamcast was one
of the best consoles ever made and yet
it failed so hard that it killed Sega's
entire gaming Empire is how
in 1997 the Sega Saturn was losing its
battle against the n64 and PlayStation
Sega needed something fresh a console
that waved could buy to the boring black
plastic and said hello to a new
generation of gaming little did Sega
know that what it was building would be
its final console but when you look at
how invented the Dreamcast was you can
see why it's still held in such high
regard for instance as well as advanced
graphics the Dreamcast featured a
built-in modem for playing games online
something that's now a huge part of
gaming meanwhile the controller played
host to the vmu memory card which played
mini games or showed extra info during a
game like how much ammo or health you
have left Sega had basically invented
the concept behind the Wii U years
before Nintendo something that Sega and
I had in common the Dreamcast Hardware
was invented but so were the games in
its short lifespan it played host to the
visually striking jet grind radio and
the sprawling Shenmue then there was
Crazy Taxi Soul Calibur Power Stone
Virtua Tennis Sonic Adventure 2 2 rakats
Skies of Arcadia
Phantasy Star Online and seaman arguably
the most disturbing game ever made I
guess you are just very comfortable with
seeing your naked body in all those
positions with innovative hardware and a
great lineup of launch games it seems
like Sega had done everything right so
then where did it all go so wrong
the Dreamcast hit the West on the 9th of
September 1999 making Sega 100 million
dollars in its first day on sale in the
US two and a half months later North
American sales hit 1 million and it
seemed like Sega was back in the console
race but the following year something
came along that extinguished the
Dreamcast hopes overnight the ps2 was
more expensive than the Dreamcast and
required a network adapter to go online
but Sony's console had a few superpowers
but Sega just couldn't compete with for
example the ps2 played DVDs at a time
when dedicated players were still
expensive it was backwards compatible to
making it tempting to those who already
owned the first PlayStation Sony had a
good rep with gamers and his last
console had been a big hit so
loads of cash to spend on promotion
sager on the other hand was losing money
slashing prices in an increasingly
desperate bid to make the dreamcast to
success
but shoppers just weren't interested
with the Xbox and GameCube looming Sega
couldn't afford to keep fighting in
January 2001 it confirmed it was
abandoning the world of consoles to make
games for other systems the Dreamcast
had been on sale in the US for less than
18 months
Sega's last console was the bestest ever
built but it wasn't enough
however the Dreamcast spirits can be
seen living on in another system
altogether Microsoft's Xbox bears more
than a passing similarity to the
Dreamcast from its controller to its
focus on online gaming Microsoft
contributed to the Dreamcast offering a
version of Windows CE II that powered
some Dreamcast games and giving Bill
Gates &amp;amp; Co away to quietly experiments
with the world of games consoles there
are even rumors that Sega wanted
Microsoft to make the Xbox backwards
compatible with Dreamcast games but it
was not to be those the Dreamcast have a
special place in your inside e bits or
did it deserve to fail let me know and
check back next time for another
adventure in tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
