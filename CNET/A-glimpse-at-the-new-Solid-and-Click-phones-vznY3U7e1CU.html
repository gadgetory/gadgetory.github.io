here at CES 2012 in las vegas here to
show you to Emporia phones now this
phone is the Emporia solid and as you
can see it's built pretty tough and I
think it's perfect for kids or people
who have a rugged lifestyle and this is
built for military specifications so it
has an extra thick glass and it's
shockproof splash proof and it has an
LED flashlight that comes with it now
another phone I have for you guys is
called an Emporium click it was made for
seniors in mind and you can see that
there are huge buttons here and these
are three pre-programmed buttons that
you put in for your most dialed phone
numbers on the back there is an
emergency call button and this is when
something happens to you and you can't
be able to dial your phone immediately
you can hold down this button for three
seconds and it will automatically start
calling five pre-programmed numbers that
you put in sequentially so you can
contact people that you might want when
there's an emergency now both these
phones are going for less than $150 each
there's no word on the carriers yet but
emporia told me that they're most likely
going to come on t-mobile again this is
the solid and the click and I'm Lyn law
was seen it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
