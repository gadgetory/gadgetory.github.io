cnet bringing you guys the Virgin Mobile
venture now the venture is your standard
entry level Android Gingerbread phone as
a 2.8 touchscreen display a 600
megahertz processor and a 1300 milliamp
per hour battery on the back there's a 2
megapixel camera with an accompanying
flesh be aware that because a processor
is on the slow side you're going to need
to hold the handset pretty still after
clicking the shutter as you can see the
venture also has a physical on board
QWERTY keyboard though each key is
contoured in a unique pointed fashion
instead of the usual bubble shape it's
still pretty cramped I have petite hands
and I had to use the very tips of my
finger to type which can get really
annoying really fast if I laid my thumb
flat I could pretty much type out half
of the alphabet in one press plus you
have no choice but to type with a
physical keyboard since the phone
doesn't offer an on-screen keyboard one
texting or emailing the venture also
comes with mobile ID which are these
package set of apps wallpapers and
widgets that revolve around a certain
theme like the environment or the e
entertainment channel you can download
these ID packs for free but as a default
this device immediately starts loading
the essentials pack which includes apps
like BuzzFeed Twitter and Facebook now
this handset is aimed for people who are
maybe looking for the first smartphone
and want to start off with something
simple if you're interested the device
is going for 79 99 average and mobile
again I'm link resina and this has been
the Virgin Mobile venture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
