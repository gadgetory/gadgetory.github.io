Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update google is venturing into new
territory with its smartphones and it
has to do with price some of its latest
models are so cheap you don't need to
sign up for a two-year contract with a
phone carrier to just afford one take
for instance the newly announced Moto G
it comes in a few colors and it's got
pretty decent specs including a
quad-core processor but it's only one
hundred and eighty dollars unlocked and
off-contract one downside with the low
price is that it's not 4g it only gets
3g wireless speeds but there's also the
Nexus 5 and that top-end phone with 4G
is just three hundred and fifty dollars
unlocked and with no contract normally a
top phone like that could cost around
600 or 650 dollars Google pricing phones
like this can certainly make the
wireless industry more competitive when
folks aren't stuck in contracts another
fitness tracker has arrived the jawbone
up24 is an upgrade to the previous
wristband and it has a similar look but
now it can sink its data to an iphone
ipod touch or ipad with bluetooth sorry
it doesn't work with android yet since
it has no screen you need to open the
app to keep track of your day's progress
it's one hundred and fifty dollars and
it has a few tricks like vibrating to
wake you up from sleep depending on your
style preference though you might want
to go for the fitbit force instead it's
slightly cheaper and has a screen to
display your progress without the usual
dramatics and fanfare Apple quietly
began selling the new iPad Mini on
Tuesday this new model of the 8 inch
tablet has a high-resolution Retina
display and it starts at four hundred
dollars but you can expect it to be in
short supply recent reports indicate
that there were issues producing enough
retina screens to meet demand and that
could be why Apple didn't promote
exactly which day it would go on sale
for your gmail users out there the next
time you get an email with an attachment
you'll be able to save it directly to
your google drive storage instead of
downloading it to your computer it works
with all types of files and this
option will roll out to desktop users
over the next week the PlayStation 4 has
arrived at cnet and it's going through
testing be sure to read our first
impressions of Sony's new console which
hit stores on Friday unless you're a
fanatic gamer you may want to wait just
a little bit to buy this $400 machine
because there will not be many
blockbuster titles available at launch
and don't forget it's not compatible
with your older ps3 games that your tech
news update but you can find more
details on the blog sina com / update
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
