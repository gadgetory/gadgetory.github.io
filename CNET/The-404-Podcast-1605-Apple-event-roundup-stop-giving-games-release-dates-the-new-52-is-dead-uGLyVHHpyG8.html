bro and what's cool
you
today going 32 hey everyone welcome to a
brand new episode of the 404 show on
this Friday March 13 2015 it's friday
13th that's a very special holiday for
me and i'm joined by two very special
people John Falcone to my left how are
you sir I'm good good to be back I know
we'll talk about how long it's been just
second and then of course Bridget Carey
fill in for is today how are you Bridget
doing good so friday 13th it's like i'd
love that day because everyone thinks
it's scary and it's not just a regular
day and i think of doing is taylor
swift's 1130 oh why are we grouping me
in with Taylor Swift she's got like a 13
tattoos yeah I know it's her lucky
number damn it for that same reason I
can't even have one thing oh man alright
I'll deal with that in my own way they
so you're excited this year i believe we
had to write baby I in March right
whenever it's uh yeah there's not a leap
year it'll be the same days in a row
yeah which is pretty great I got engaged
on februari 13th friday 13th that's good
look what can I say it's been that's
been working out great for you so far so
far so well I have no complaints that I
would talk about publicly um so mr.
Falcone you are the executive editor
you're basically in charge of all things
cnet edit in New York here say don't be
ashamed sure yes you could say that okay
good I'm glad I did um I want to talk
real quick so last I didn't even look at
it reviews cnet reviews yeah what and
you know you pull a lot of weight in
other categories yeah let's not take
away from other people no let's um so
what was the lad do you remember the
last time you're on our show no okay my
question is gonna be like was Obama
president now that's definitely not the
case i'm looking it up with like a
crappy little search right here it's not
even pulling up yeah i think it was in
the hot maybe the hundreds or the 200s I
know that I'm possible or I feel like
it's insane I feel like um just tree was
dead like you know it would've been like
a
sanara Oh death situation definitely I'm
look so we have a wikia you know that is
you guys know a wikia is it's like sit
wiki or wikia that depends on you where
you're from um so I'm just trying to do
like a crappy little search here and I'm
going into the guests category which is
is relatively fleshed out um here you
are those to whoever is maintaining this
okay wait and keeping that picture of me
also from the era we're talking about
it's amazing it's a it's like a stock
photo of you juggling a bunch of
all-in-one remotes and it says you might
have been on episode 58 Wow which we
never got out of double did you never
got a or 34 where you want to you're a
pioneer do you miss possible like I
Randall yeah that's how long ago yeah
this is this is all Randall Wilson
uh-huh yeah so either way the last time
you ron was two thousand eight and seven
years ago how you been since then what
have you been doing I didn't even know
he still works here razy yeah easy um
how about that I also wonder if I was on
maybe one or two of the test ones that
were never broadcast all that like
certainty yes you have a suitcase Wow
see the dude cast Falcone's and OG he
knows all about the dude cast do you
know about the day I never heard of this
so in our infancy we were just this
nascent trio of morons dudes I mean not
a lots changed but we that was the first
idea for the name of our podcast and at
the time we'd I don't even remember
whose idea was it to just call it that
but we had that's what we sent to mark
Larkin who was running seen a TV at the
time right and he's like you this is
good you just can't call it the dude
cast cuz that sucks which I my question
that decision but okay hey Nightside
maybe it was better than four we're not
gonna split here yeah it'd be
interesting to SEO dude cast right now
yeah it comes feel like in my whoops
yeah still be worth keeps which names
before we broadcast this will cut this
all out in
I just do it I'm still open to it all
right let's get into so it's been a
while yeah but I'm glad to be back as am
i and I directly are you upset like no
we come back I was never a big I'm never
big fan of being on video yeah so audio
only sure all right glad to know your
doors open to that thank you wonderful
let's get into this week's stories a lot
of stuff happened right off was
announced some stuff was announced
obviously monday was it monday was the
other day and it's amazingly i just the
other night was like did that happen
monday how is that possible weeks go by
so quick yet this felt like it was ages
ago massive apple event their spring
preview okay so let's go through this
all the stuff everyone in the subreddits
like all you guys have to talk about
apps up obviously we're gonna hit the
watch first so let's talk about the
watch the big story of the event where
do you begin I think you just begin by I
mean I'll begin by saying I am
legitimately underwhelmed with this
thing with okay and the other the coral
a question there is with the Apple watch
or the whole idea of a SmartWatch
whatsoever I mean I drank the kool-aid a
little bit with the Pebble watch mm-hmm
because I still think that's probably
the one to get because of the price and
the the specs and the battery life and
stuff like that and how it's just not
this intrusive replacement for your
phone watch you know situation yes so
funny story I don't think it was until
two weeks ago that on cnet we even had a
best smartwatches list because it has
literally taken us up to this point to
come up with a small list of watches we
would even consider consider
recommending right and i believe right
now they are the pebble steel okay not
even the time all the time we don't have
yet at right there they were just
announced that they can't be on a list
right if they're just look promising but
the pebble steel at 199 about to be
upgraded uh
and the Whiting's activity which is the
OP which is the analog looking watch yes
there's like some digital background
stuff going on there right so it is
communicate with your phone via
bluetooth for a couple of things but it
also less a year yes it's not doing a
lot of crazy large matter it's amazing
yeah and it's a hundred fifty bucks
right so beyond those two is there
anything else there's excuse me there's
a few more on the list i think those the
only two that are four stars okay so
you'd have to look it up but but if
people ask me they're the two I would
bring up first right yeah I think the
two weird things about the Apple watch
event where one it I think it was more
than fifty percent not the Apple watch
that a they spent their time on it took
a really long time to get to ya it was
like more than an hour I think yeah into
the Prezi event it was nothing new
besides what we saw the last words I
that when the other weird thing is they
really except for finally the pricing
and the hard release date details very
little new information to honestly kind
of up sell you on why you would want to
spend 350 400 what's the other ones 600
up yeah I mean and the gold one is just
a whole other which is just another
tragedy I mean let's talk about that
just for a second it's the way I look at
it why even say you have a
ten-thousand-dollar watch why even say
it now is it because it a I was talking
about alright so I was talkin to Vinnie
from giant bomb about it and he's like
no it sounds like it's just like Apple
one is they don't forget we still know
you're poor and yeah like don't forget
we still realize I think for some people
it will turn them off it has that like
apple looks like they're not your friend
yo meant you know but then they want to
play in that world they want to play in
that fashion like for example some
people love certain fashion brands and
I'm not a fashionista in that sense I'm
the one who shop it in the clearance
rack at Macy's but people see that
designer dress on the runway you're not
going to spend the money on that but you
will buy that brands lipstick okay
dollars of writing riddles oh it's that
concept of you know their high quality
and you may not get that multiple
thousand-dollar purse or dress as one of
a kind but you'll buy the shoes you'll
buy something else with that freaking
logo on it yeah that's interesting were
you gonna say a few things I mean she
just encapsulated a lot of it right
there um Apple as a brand went from very
aspirational kind of in the old days
where the max the prices on the old Macs
were kind of insane they were at a
control yeah um and post kind of
starting with the iMac which was much
more kind of like a people's computer
sure you turn with all the colors yeah
yeah the kind of first steve jobs is
back product is in school ya know that
was the cop the quintessential college
piece a mac fur for Maya it was kind of
a great value at a time yeah um then
when the iphone came out that started I
think that was like five or six hundred
dollars unsubsidized right and then
eventually came down to the same prices
every other phone is right where I mean
phones are weird now because the
subsidies are sort of gone away and
whatever else but long story short is
the iphone basically costs the same as
any other flagship phone sure and as ben
rubin point out his piece even like the
macbook air started as like this crazy
2500 dollar aspirational amazing laptop
and now it's like the meat and potatoes
low-end great value nine hundred to a
thousand dollar laptop which i look you
get a laptop four to four hundred
dollars wouldn't you argue the air is
still overpriced when you look at other
item I know nothing is as thin and as
light but the hunt couple hundred bucks
you're paying in that premium does that
qualify it I mean I guess so I would not
call it overpriced you just call it
expensive it's I think it's delivering a
lot of value at that price especially
considering what
the competition is up there that's like
a separate question about the new
macbook which I sure it also yeah well
get out of that but anyway long story
short I feel like this is Apple kind of
returning to that aspirational you know
shooting for the stars she sort of
started and number two why not try it at
those prices for I guess and on what why
is it ten thousand dollars it because
it's solid gold the enemy base is
supposedly solid gold but I gold-plated
but i think that much gold cost ten
thousand are I don't think it does but
you could look up the wait and see
exactly what the I guess meltdown rice
if it be it's I know like the price of
gold has gone up but sure but look the
other story we ran before the price was
officially announced was you know what
10,000 other price on that isn't crazy
if you look at the rest of the luxury
marque watch course but those watches
don't become obsolete in a year and that
is the really mm-hmm seventeen thousand
dollar question that's the seventeen
thousand dollar kickin because that's I
guess yet the nice band you're seventeen
thousand I would be shocked if they
don't have a lot of jewel encrusted
bands that get that up to right or
toward if T whatever there's gonna be
one from like suave our ski with right
and that's there's no technology there
that's just literally jewelry cosmetic
wear yeah ours it and that's fine i i i
heard the batteries replaceable so yeah
at least a couple years out of
thankfully the other giant problem yeah
right you get a tag war-era brightly
whatever i'm sure the battery less more
like a year show not a day or those
watches just power themselves with right
automatic you know movement another
great point another great point so I I
don't know i think going back to you
know stepping away from how absurd a
ten-thousand-dollar smartwatches arm
which ultimately i do think they took
more flack for then you know sort of all
right and I I think you don't like it
there they're in touch with you right it
felt like a massive massive sort of
snobby elitist kind of press
tation and they just sort of snuck it in
there too I think they kinda said it as
he was you know like in hey like and I
want to you know sort of under the radar
there yeah but to your point about was
it's I was is it so swell varsity I
don't think anyone pronounce it
correctly for years we've seen you know
here's a ten-thousand-dollar iphone
shares right but that was never sold by
apple and i think i've looked and be
like why are we in that market well I be
why are we letting this guy take the you
know the extra ten grand on top of our
product we dipped in Apple TV and
diamonds yet what's that about just
saying no I they can always lower the
price we can always totally walk away
from a high-end watch chum why not I'm
almost surprised it in put out as like
special first edition only I mean
they'll only sell a hundred of them
anyway right and the other day I there
are a lot of people out there who that's
not a big deal yeah I guess Konya was
about ten of them yeah there's the
celebrity thing and then there's um
it'll be like a weird gift thing you
know well also allegedly the goal thing
is very like china-focused for that
bucket interesting I don't know why it's
the same people who are gonna buy that
Lamborghini phone and it was like like
there's a market out there people who
are like sure why not I'll just toss
this aside and in a year I guess so
stepping away from the that part of the
discussion I like like we said there was
nothing fundamentally different from the
first Apple watch focused press
conference that's why they talked a lot
about health right they talked about the
whole health thing which I don't know I
still have this weird aching feeling in
the back of my head that you guys I
don't really necessarily look to you
guys for health research I I just think
a lot of this stuff is unproven we're so
flooded with fitness trackers and and
heartbeat monitors and not you know this
it's not like the Surgeon General comes
downs like you everyone in America
should have this sure you know they're
not necessarily endorsed by any
respectable Health Organization you know
I don't know how well that
health tracker heartbeat monitor is
really going to work and I had a bit of
a experience with the Moto 360 this week
sure I took it for a hardcore workout
over at Google's offices okay um and
that gave me by actually being with it
in a workout it gave me a little bit of
a different insight into how the fitness
world would like it to be more
convenient than carrying your phone
around it depends on the apps that are
made for it for example you're sitting
there with boxing gloves on and you're
punching a bag and you want to watch
maybe to just give you a little buzz
when when it's time that you did two
minutes you want another buzz for a
break buzz to go back and then after
you're done look you get all the stats
even for not exact stats you get a sense
of how you've done overall in a progress
way the absite also you can do that with
like how many times you want to get a
reminder of a routine quick right do 10
squats quick do 10 this and it buzzes to
tell you to stop to go again that kind
of thing is it is where people are going
to innovate first right if it helps you
get a more productive work out where you
can chart your progress over a given
amount of time cuz we don't care about
stepping into that but like this is more
like helping you out you say that and
that amazingly as one of the most
unhealthy people you'll ever meet in
terms of diet and no exercise I do still
wear every day this clip on you do man I
don't know why because it is a part of
me I you're holding what doubt this is a
the I think original or one of the
original fitbit's that you clip to your
belt okay whatever else so it's a
pedometer it's a pedometer and pretty
much and that's pretty much it right
that's how I use it but I you know I
guess you're supposed to try to get over
10,000 steps a day okay my average and I
think I'd probably weigh like 15 or 20
more pounds if I didn't live in New York
and I heard you know I don't own a car
like I walk and take the train every
where but average day for me seems to be
about 7,700 steps okay whatever that
means from so you just put in
what do you do with that information you
desire a video and I feel really bad in
lethargic aspect like everyone's mothers
like I think what tomorrow is gonna be
like a rainy Saturday or something like
now looking out there it was a sailor on
the TV or the PlayStation and like the
end the day it's like hmm hundred twelve
hundred that's brutal you have to charge
of that often do you this has has a
watch battery that lasts yeah six to
twelve months um and unlike your phone
does this now but even if I always have
my phone with me half the times like on
the desk right or whatever else all
right yeah I haven't charged the Moto
360 that I used during that workout so
it's just sitting on my night right now
I've been I'm not like I gotta charge
the other kind of dirty secret about
these which depending upon your opinion
isn't so bad is um very little of the
information so far is really accurate
from a medical standpoint yeah when we
were doing our like heart so that's a
big way to turn the watch like you know
the watch faces outside we had to turn
it inside in our wrists because where
our pulse is stronger because it was
having a hard time picking attacking it
right and I mean so there's that there's
those I mean that's why none of them
they always sort of an ass Chris and say
like for fun right exactly approve
exactly and that's what there's this
gigantic disclaimer on all this stuff
that being said even if this step
counter for instance isn't accurate I
feel like if I'm always measuring
against this one device at least it's
giving me on a spectrum right that the
numbers may not be accurate but I feel
like if it says five thousand verses
10,000 does mean I walked fifty percent
sure long this day is prayer in theory
yes if it's working correctly um so you
have that backdrop with the whole Apple
watching I think that has very rapidly
shifted away as the primary focus in the
use cases of the Apple watch but let's
talk about the watch itself now if
you're listening wherever you are unless
you're driving or walking you know try
this out pretend if you are wearing a
regular watch or whatever washer which
you both are and I am NOT okay so now
just like use whatever hand it's on use
the opposite hand and just sort of like
touch that's that face a lot
okay does that is that fun to you now
look how much how often do you touch the
face of your watch normal unit almost
never unless you said it whenever you
have to set it for you know twice a year
for daylight savings right so how does
that how is that going to play into the
experience it's another to check it's
another way to buzz you while you're you
know maybe you would have ignored your
phone in your pocket but it's so
freaking big now you can't take it out
of your pocket so you have to now glance
at your watch screen to know right Oh
someone Facebook tagged me now is that
does that sound like something you would
want to do over and over again and I
guess no one can truly wrap their heads
around what it will be like to own one
until they have it on their risk for 23
months already so my hang-up is that
where I don't I don't want to do this
like constant handcuffed weird hand
gesture crossover thing that you're
going to have to be doing not to mention
uh using a crown in the fashion that
they would like you to do if you're not
touching it seems mostly awful that was
it seemed like one of the initial
complaints was it wasn't as possibly
intuitive as it was to use like the iPad
or the iphone which one of the true
things about those products was you
really didn't have to teach anybody use
them in right see that a lot of times
you give it like a three-year-old and
iPad they they're just like oh like this
is how the world around all right um and
I I still don't it's weird how it has
the crown and then also that giant
button and the button is the button the
home button or something else I don't
know not to mention ok so we've we've
we've digested that but then you have
this weird honeycomb layout where icons
seem smaller than you know any like any
sort of it just seems like how am I
navigating you really need to have just
like three or four apps I don't see how
you could not go crazy when you have 20
of rights as they show a stack of like a
hundred of them and you're like haven't
use the kind of like zoom in and out of
that right is that how that works is
that faster is that more efficient like
are you gonna sit there and all that I
gotta find
gotta be that guy tinkering with my
watch like like some you know
seventh-grade girls do you like uh you
know Siri google maps so so maybe yeah
but again you wanna be that guy I hate
all voice recognition yeah I still I'm
sitting there like trying to get to the
home then I have to get to the list of
apps and that upsets you that's annoying
well it doesn't make me really
encouraged to do that yeah so I just
kind of let it sit on my wrist and have
it push notify me anything right CII
that's where I would like it i think i
would like to know what i'm getting a
call especially if the phone's not on my
person mm-hmm I'd like to get that text
message I'd like to get updates on maybe
like scores of a hockey game or
something I would be okay with that a
vibration like to know what the hockey
score yeah why not really yeah just like
a vibration shopper Nicole you know or I
don't know but that's it's you know I
think notifications is probably the
killer app on these watches and as long
as the notifications are different than
what you get on your phone already yeah
yes I mean that's the question but but
getting that fine tuned to where you
want it is still a real challenge I mean
Android wear look like it was heading in
the right direction with that but it's
still according what Scott says when
he's right like not quite where you want
to be I don't know I I noticed on my
phone I actually became a lot happier
when I turned off some of the
notifications I understand really what
honestly email okay where they were like
all popping up my screen I was getting
really anxious if I just see the number
ratcheting up and check it when I want
to that works better for me so they got
to make it customizable enough that it's
it's not I mean something like you
probably a state both you guys have to
get paint on Twitter like every 30
seconds it happens yeah that would you
wouldn't want that active or you can
just send we're only only when someone
tags me in a photo do I want right like
they'd have to be granular enough that
you can if it starts to get aggravating
if one of your posts takes off the right
kind of temporarily disable it or
something so think about this okay
when we went from desktop to mobile we
made a lot of sacrifices right we it say
what you will and i know it accounts for
but loads of traffic but the mobile
experience compared to the desktop
experience is handicapped it's a it's an
inferior experience i think guys opposed
to a mouse and keyboard it's it's
different and i always work yeah well I
get when I want to its up if I'm reading
something yes sometimes mobile still
okay there is there are other signs like
if it's a longer piece or something I
want to get out the laptop right what
would you rather write a story on what
would you rebels right is to write
laptop I got left sending an email do a
lot of things even you know it even make
a facebook post in some ways can be kind
of tricky on it right exactly you do a
lot of sacrificing in and you you adapt
right but that's yet so that's funny and
what you consume on mobile you create on
desktop exactly so now here comes this
third platform where it's like wrist ok
so it's wearing it right so you go from
desktop to mobile and now a more sort of
you know watered-down fake version not
fake but you know granular version than
what you're used to it to me all too
hyper mode yeah hi right and now for me
that's my big sort of hurdle with it
that's my big hang-up with it like how
am I going if and look maybe they figure
it out maybe they look you know it looks
like this is the way to do it but that's
what I'm the most cautious about one
supposed reason for that is they're
going back back to a really tiny screen
because the small mobile screen is
actually grown to be in the past yeah
six years to five and a half inches for
other people yeah communication changes
with a small screen like that too and
what's going to happen is you're gonna
always preset responses to your friends
so you have to get out the phone and
type something custom you just simply go
yeah going to be there is and like three
other choices are your automatic replies
you know or whatever you speak to your
watch you know will be dictated that's a
bit another biggest gonna be LOL for
everything
it'll be easier coming tonight LOL i
guess that's a yes great my and you know
and I do want to cover the other things
they announced but um you know I guess
that's the biggest sort of glaring
issues that I'm more curious about than
anything else so you know all that stuff
is coming very soon so we'll see how it
shakes out arm before before we move on
um staying with apple stuff real quick
and then we'll we'll get into the next
story the powerbook the computer that's
just a bunch of batteries inside of it
which when when I first it sounded like
it felt like a joke it felt like an
onion story or they're like hey we've
strapped you know 1900 batteries inside
this poor you know aluminium aluminium
case you know guinean we've strapped so
many batteries inside this power book
it's practically nuclear you like that's
essentially how I saw that play out and
it you know look the engineering-wise I
you know I think when you show me that
it's just jam-packed stuffed with
batteries I'm not that impressed I don't
know what it is what do you think your
phone is gay I get it it's one big
battery with like a screen I get and
that's what your iPad is to uh it just
looks funny I don't know a cross section
of this thing is funny to me that aside
it's got a really small motherboard it's
only 13 millimeters thick and but if
like a butterfly keys which all right
everyone I talked to bets use those keys
says it's mostly awful and like it
you're basically typing on a touchscreen
everything every time something like
this comes out I'm I actually think this
is a very lame product I don't care how
gorgeous the screen is touched you know
you're right I haven't but it's a twelve
hundred dollar severely underpowered
machine I feel like some phones rival
this this computer it's more like a
phone doesn't have any poor Epona's no
port it is not a life specs wise it is
not impressive at all so far as we know
you're correct but a couple important
things here the only person here is
actually touch the thing is Dan
uh-huh I guess comes out April 10th
which is also the same day the you can
check out the watch in the store and
pre-order it right and also PS the same
day that the galaxy s6 comes out okay
nicer without a program there right uh
yeah one the the keyboard it seems to be
concern to me because I'm not I really
like the current macbook air which is my
work machine and that of a lot of you
right here I'd say the keyboard is maybe
the weakest thing about it I don't love
it and I don't that's kind of true a lot
of these super thin laptops I mean you
lose travel distance on the key right
and I'm it's a it's a it's a weird feel
that you kind of to get just get used to
write and that the thing that scares me
about this one I'd almost I mean almost
nobody here will get this reference it
runs me the membrane keyboard unlike the
Atari 400 but you guys all remember from
1976 I know I don't but you know but is
it what are you thinking more like that
surface keyboard uh sewing oh yeah yeah
that the other one yeah the other lower
end one right exactly which does not
kill me whatsoever and it's like a
twenty dollar difference to get the real
one right I'm sure is a lot better but
that when you were talking about really
you know fine movement between the keys
and the you know the mechanism below it
and I am that turns me off so there's a
keyboard there's this force touch
trackpad which jury's still out feels
well we have we have a version of that
here now in the Pro and it is kind of
interesting because it does give you
this like you can do this double click
with just a depending how far you
depress it right and it kind of clicks
back on you and does ah got about an
illusion of a double click so you've
used that what do you think you've used
the to Bridget yeah ah I I mean just for
a moment I was kind of air today I
needed to learn how do you promise now
on it was unusual even that one has more
travel because then the Kiro is yet a
more normal sized library is one it's
just kind of paper I think I think it's
yeah cuz it's muscle memory it's it's a
it's a
elene you am sure even typing on a
touchscreen was different for all of us
but I don't know if I'm used to that
right away right off the bat right I was
like oh wait wait how hard do it oh oh
there oh there it is it someone I mean
this to me this is a perfect example of
like we went to thin well you should at
least go into the store and try this
angle and that's what what is great
about Apple now is their stores are
everywhere and then even if they're not
this will be in best buy and all I'm
sure I just hope someone at some point
was like hey guys do you do you think we
made this too thin because I can't wait
for that dude to try and put her in his
back pocket and bend it yeah right
exactly it doesn't Bend I I really try I
guarantee you that was a concern whether
like okay we actually may have may have
gone too thin on this one because now
it's just silly now it's like a knife
and that's stupid right 13 millimeters
they're pushing that you know that's
that's insane but not the thinnest
laptop out there right actually lenovo
has right yes probably got a better
keyword on it huh all right so there you
have so the last issue on this is the
processor which is called underpowered
yeah intel core m that is in my opinion
the successor to the atom which was not
a great processor we've only tested one
pc one computer that had the Quran that
was the yoga 3 pro okay and that didn't
get up to 4 stars it was three and a
half and was kind of like you could tell
how heartbroken akron was because he
really wanted to love that thing because
the design is super cool super thin and
it did not do great in the benchmarks
now important caveat Apple unlike lenovo
controls the soft the operating system
and the hardware so you think there's
going to be a little finagling going on
they at least have the expertise and
opportunity to do that on this type of
product whereas lenovo I don't think
really and quite get into windows and
fool around them can I just say like
even with the hardware talking about the
keys and I'll last if I feel I can get
used to I don't think we're ready for a
world to become
wheatley wireless yet like they were
kind of pushing for like like everything
could just be Wireless and free and
ruined maybe you need an adapter no you
definitely need an adapter do you mean
yeah I mean we're just staring at a web
of wires in front of us it's not i'm not
ready for that like and that and that's
what makes me think ok who the hell is
this for like who is this for they're
trying to show that it's possible same
person is pre-ordering the watch on the
first day yeah but even the watch
Persian I I have like more respect for
them than the macbook person look this
again is what they do they create
aspirational products and they start
them at this isn't by the way this is
not insanely it's thirteen hundred
dollars for the entry level one right
but with I think 256 gigs of flash
storage right which i think is only a
hundred dollar difference between this
in the air so it's not in it of that
same storage capacity right no I just
think you're better off getting an air I
mean that's to me if someone's ask me
should I get a macbook no get an air and
I think the retina pro um is maybe the
exact same price yeah i mean just yet
but choices thick choices thick because
it's probably ten times as powerful when
you're a college student and you just
want something light in your backpack
you'll probably look at this little
closely and actually debate well do I
have wireless headphones do I have all
these wireless things I'm you don't need
why I was head on those of this one
review what I mean do you have all the
like do I really want to stream a lot or
do i need the towards and you might
actually say it I'll just get it after
yeah maybe but you're gonna make this
thing choked out with like three
browsers open I'm telling you it's I
have no fear all I'm saying on that is
we're going to test it with exactly that
and we'll know within a month what the
deal realistic performance yeah which is
good um the only last thing I would say
on this which i think is interesting is
there's also this rumor of later this
year of the 12 inch iPad this was the
day I think they're yeah seriously it is
well that's just a touch me if that
product does come out and they surprise
surprise happen to have a companion
surface like keyboard for it
that getting it really we've split apart
the macbook now offer them separately
yeah IAM keyboard yeah perfectly
designed he it's starting to get on my
nerves hey I'm just sorry I just that
dude I don't know I think we might have
to do a parody videos all I'm saying is
all I'm saying um other news this week
if you're a gamer and you own a ps4 and
you were looking forward to playing
uncharted 4 well you're probably gonna
have to wait a year now instead of this
holiday because it is officially delayed
till next spring and you and I talked
about this in the office the other day
should every video game far out video
game should these guys should these
developers and publishers just stop
putting dates on games I used to
complain that games were announced too
early primarily because they would
always have these super loose release
dates attached to them so now I'm saying
okay announce your game that's fine but
don't go and say holiday 2015 when you
know very well that is a subject to
change you become the beta tester if
there's any bugs if they haven't got it
all set up right by the time they hit
that date yeah I mean well that's a mean
that's a great point of course that has
become kind of scandalous was like sure
sometimes they hit those dates but man
is that not a fun experience for the
gamer you really don't have a choice
anymore you are going to get in on
finished game that pretty much goes
without saying with the exception of a
few titles these days but my whole thing
is you know just stop saying this game
is coming you know like look at eight of
the major titles that are being released
this year okay every single one of them
suffered at least a three month delay
when you look at like from now till June
and that's battlefield that's the order
that's blood-borne that's uncharted
that's Batman they've all been delayed
every single triple a title has been
delayed so what are we doing what kind
of this is a weird game we're playing
where are we just supposed to now have
this baked in you know denial with the
release date or you know you know I'm
saying like why even have it
anymore and just say we'll let you know
when we're gold and we'll go from there
I guess there's so much pressure from
the console makers to be like during our
big event we gather people know why you
should buy this console so give us a
date right so that's so there's one
answer right where it's like there are
plenty of things attached to that verse
you know stock prices and and and you
have to please members of boards and and
you know shareholders and all these
different sort of ariel's variables that
get baked into what it is to be a
developer / publisher so I don't know I
just I I know there's no answer to this
question but I I think we just stop
doing that stop making dates and we can
all kind of live a little more
stress-free as people who put a lot of
stock into when games are coming in how
far in advance do we get some of these
dates like over a year those whales yeah
I'd say the most you get is maybe 18
months hmm I know Last Guardian can hear
oh my god that's a game that you know
forget at least they never had a date
true right and but so the bigger and
easier pill to swallow when you don't
have a date I mean obviously a game
that's been in you know development
he'll like that Brett is an exception
but if they just came out last year and
said hey here's gameplay footage of
Uncharted we don't know when it's going
to come out but it's coming and it's
coming you know me I you just can't put
it I understand the fundamental
difficulties of not attaching a date to
a game but this is getting ridiculous I
mean everything we just talked about his
stuff that's coming soon so uh it's no
it's really no different it's exactly
the same now in tech mm-hmm in certainly
for movies sure um Star Wars coming up
yeah and games and movies kind of go
hand in hand weirdly movies very very
rarely seem to get delayed like every
once in a while it happens but once they
announce a date they usually hit it I
agree yes that is very interesting they
even have dates for like movies in in
2018 right that's how crazy that a
Marvel roadmap
and they'll hit all those dates so what
is it is it because a movie is sort of
this non open-ended situation where it's
it's not software it's not something
that has to be interacted with or
installed oh so many games now have so
many multiple choices to test every
little as possible thing you could do
you have a loss of control yeah and
we've also been making lots of movies we
see come out a guy like that could have
been baked for another right maybe six
months we have in the oven for a couple
more minutes but but here's the thing
movie we've been making movies for a
hundred years now I'm not saying we've
been making Avengers for a hundred years
but it is something that has been
streamlined and kind of put through its
its streamlined extra 8,000 people
working on each movie well what the why
would I mean you look at we compared to
what what it used to be yeah of course
sure I'm sure the same man people worked
on Casablanca not hungry title cards and
food right it's over and that was it man
you would see like you know the key grip
in the director in the same title co
there you go on studio system but that's
but still it now just scaled and it's
become this you know well oiled machine
and even these mega ultra over-the-top
blockbusters seem to have a very rigid
you know architecture where they can pop
them out and sort of do it and like I
said maybe that's the non open ednas of
the entire moviemaking process but uh
for a game you've got so much more
intangible so many more intangibles and
so many more things that are just you
know how many how many things get left
out of a game that you know how many
promises go unfulfilled it's total happy
to sell you that promise a couple months
later as an add-on pack in 3 she had
private DLC promises and speaking of
movies yeah speaking of movies and this
is more in the comic book room but
nevertheless on are you a comic book fan
reform performed what it look how do you
grow out of that what is that long story
all right fair enough for another show I
know Bridget I minute I'm going to
appreciate such but I haven't bought a
lot of comics recently so DC in August
of 2011 did this brand new initiative
called the new 52 where they took 52
frame
choices and rebooted them so you had
Batman rebooted uh you know Superman
every every popular or and not so
popular character series storyline got
reset to episode 2 issue 1 and it made a
lot of headlines with some of the
choices they made rice characters a lot
or is a woman right you know a lot of
origin stories were smart wait there was
marble oh god yeah oh my god I'm gonna
get so much hate mail now I know that I
using fanboy tears okay I know but the
fact is both Marvel and DC it's every
once in while they clear the decks and
they go we're wiping out the 200
parallel universes we've created and
starting over and Thor's a woman and you
know Batman is a kid that grew up in
Portugal man is making out with someone
else you know that means an alien um yes
when is it Superman making out with one
Roman yeah i'm looking at a photo right
here oh yeah yeah well George make such
a cute couple they do um I just uh you
know I have no problem with reese's
hitting the reset button the thing
though is you know you have this
gigantic branding initiative that they
did in 2011 and now only five four years
later they're hitting the reset button
on that it's kind of clear indication
that this was not a good move I mean
something happened where they just
dropped the ball I mean I know and like
spider-man and the amazing spider-man or
for Fantastic Four and the new fantastic
I mean it's the same sort of thing but
you know at least within the world of
comics I mean you the Hulk movies to
kind of totally totally and I guess you
look there's no rules you do whatever
you want they are keeping the story
lines of about twenty three or so comics
so if you're still reading you know
there's a few new 52 storylines that
happen to be fantastic like the new
Batman is really good a lot of people
like the new justice league those are
all staying intact but they are also
going to do brand new titles nuke new
universes and stuff like that I feel
like there's always an alternate
universe thing that comes up every so
often like oh how many times it's
Superman die
Batman's did or whatever the case is um
but maybe they just want to keep
inspirational was all the trees
yeah basically which is fine which which
I'd say is fine it's it's fine i think
to say like what if which in fact i
always just like the DC elseworlds thing
you're like one off spacing them like
right Batman was in Victorian London go
Jack Jack the Ripper's yeah what if
Superman was from Russia you know I like
that one a lot it yeah yeah uh yeah he's
just all right i was called red Sun red
says oh and uh uh not bad pretty good so
it maybe they're just trying to have a
you know a straightforward old classic
storyline for the new movies they want
to come out with so that way the kids
can have the same kind of storyline in
both yeah I mean I on a branding uh you
know point of view I think new 52 was a
bad branding thing I think most people
saw that and were confused by it
especially uh newcomers to comics people
who weren't super familiar that was
confusing I'm sure because you did have
you know series that were in the 800 and
900 s in terms of numbered issues and
then all of a sudden it's like new 52
you're like wait so is that 52 issues or
is it fifty two characters what's going
on so I guess when the dust settled but
Marvel is doing something again not too
different which is um what are they
calling their-their infinity uh yeah or
it had two names and one of them was
like the 80s with the Secret Wars or
something infinity ward yeah yeah that's
I think that's the movie roadmap okay
yeah that's a that's a whole different I
don't know which and the whole thing
with DC's movie I don't know there am I
crazy or except for Batman and Superman
may be wonder woman I don't know they
don't have as good of a backbench on DC
is maybe Marvel does I don't know that
Aquaman I'm pretty hardcore I guess if
you say I always don't Aquaman Drago
yeah right such a don't an opposite in
your they get out of the water you dork
I don't
uh speaking of water all you need to do
is add water you like that too what's
now legal powdered alcohol United
totally legal now they tried to do this
a couple years ago ah but then it was
taken off store shelves because there
was no regulated dosage people this they
were putting basically like I mean just
looking at these I guess package that
you have up on the screen I feel like
that needs to be at the bodega across
the street right next to the horny goat
weed yeah with all those weird strange
vitamin pills that they offer in these
convenient packs that are very
affordable and yet ineffective great for
camping but now the ACR powdered alcohol
so the alcohol tobacco tax and trade
bureaus is not the ATF there's way too
many letters there ATT TP yeah the 83 b
is how they refer to themselves it's
called palcohol and it's powdered
alcohol that can be mixed with water to
form liquid alcohol arm so they
basically branded as like the tang of
alcohol which is just but we're
marketing to kids yeah we exactly like
cartoon characters seem to be attracting
my four-year-old um yeah so you mix it
with eight with six ounces of water
sorry also looking at the package here
it's just a eight like Tony Montana
style uh mound of white house yeah on
the back it's like a bunch of cocaine is
it's really is silly uh you add six
ounces of water and you get what's equal
to one shot of liquor whatever it is so
they're going to release all these
flavors and palcohol be in stores this
summer there are fears though that
consumers are going to snort the powder
obviously because like we said it just
looks like a bunch of blow mix it with
more alcohol to create like a
Frankenstein lien you know powdered
alcohol cocktail or use it to spike
non-alcoholic drinks as it is to go into
a stadium that's it all just bring a
little vial a powder which I guess they
would confiscate upon entry anyway well
that is like a you know emergency pack
sure I guess there's a lot easier to
stow so definitely definitely okay I'll
take that minute maid orange juice now
it's like we make it so ma'am why are we
make it so easy to get wasted right
Americo you too easy for people to get
wasted now which is like hey can you get
here's ten bucks can go buy me some of
that alcohol powder I don't know I just
don't know last night on Jeopardy a
super-rare eclipse worthy event occurred
okay I have some I have some audio from
the events last night listen to this
it's figuratively and the bad news for
Brad and Stephanie this was not one of
our greatest days both of you figuring
in the red and at the end of double
jeopardy that means you're not around to
play in Final Jeopardy so it's you all
by yourself Chris and I think you're
gonna win the game it all depends how
you handle this final no she lost I'm
kidding that would be amazing right keep
that zero I hope so oh my gosh less than
or that include giving maybe yeah so
that's crazy I that is I think that did
happen before but only once before and
then I was talking with Bridget before
we started recording apparently on two
separate occasions all three of them
finished in the red and they must keep
playing with all they must keep gather
that do they or is just like trees like
tell some jokes it's a commercial skits
night later dammit Johnny good night I
uh isn't that crazy feel like I remember
you know the Oscar show always just
drags on yes forever I feel like one
time in the 50s she were not around i
guess i don't i just read this somewhere
okay um I think Jerry Lewis was hosting
which so it's gets even better sure they
went like pretty short so they just like
pulled up a bunch of people on stage and
saying there's no business like show I
hope there's the urban legend but I want
to believe it's true of course I want to
believe in that as well uh so I watched
that and I'm just like men that should
have been in idiocracy we're like
jeopardy goes away because
we can win it anymore yeah I I feel that
those two be it's just it's embarrassing
do not get me wrong jeopardy is a hard
show oh yeah but come on where's the
screening process no one should no one
should finish in red let alone two out
of three contestants right oh well look
full disclosure I once took the test to
be on Jeopardy and didn't even make the
cut okay those things are smarter than I
am right but that's not they should
therefore not get finished in the red
you just got that itchy trigger finger
like what happened up there huh it could
be like a another reference you guys
when we had a Cindy Brady just goes dead
when she sees they the camera on her I
don't know I'd it's just yeah what the
hell is that reference what is that
Brady Bunch man Oh Cindy Brady huh huh
unless it's a snickers commercial I
don't know what Brady Bunch yeah yeah
okay you all remember the Thomas Edison
version of the Great Train Robbery Oh
bed so that happened last night pretty
uh pretty funny stuff all right time for
our subreddit arm John you don't know
about this but uh we have a sub you knew
we had a sub better days ahead you
actually of its existence but I think so
we've got a bunch of people who go out
of their way and take time to submit
questions and comments and whatnot to be
subreddit and we pick a few that we want
to talk about first thing I want to chat
about everyone who's written in in
regards to listening to podcasts two
times the speed playback I know savages
shaking my head here right so the three
of us are in agreement it's maybe it's a
generational thing I can't even wrap my
head around doing that it's annoying
yeah and I was saying like so does
normal conversation just sound super
slow to these people now like how does
that work I guess if you're may be
listening to an audiobook I don't know I
know it is maybe young people who are
cramming for tests who maybe watch you
know I don't know lectures online they
kind of speed it up so they can you know
watch it faster and
as far as podcasts for you know enjoy
men's also in some cases an art form and
how they pause and wait for everything
right deliveries everything in some
cases so I thought about that and then I
said okay well that stuff still
translates is just obviously played back
twice the speed so your brain probably
has to do a little bit of like time slow
down time traveling a little bit to
compensate I mean what 1.3 x already
sounds really bad and awkward to me like
everyone's on helium II yeah well they
did that modulation thing where it
doesn't make everyone sound like
munchkin but it's I don't like it yeah I
mean obviously individual choice yeah
it's a picture on all these but just it
doesn't to your point like you're
supposed to be enjoying it i hope it
doesn't sound ramming super enjoyable if
you're just like yeah like power
listening to these yeah which I guess
look pockets are huge these days if you
listen to a bunch of shows you know
sometimes you got to do it flying donkey
04 says once you past a certain
threshold once you pass a certain
threshold of subscribe podcast you have
to bring in faster playback speed
they're simply not enough hours in the
week to listen to a big library of shows
so um he says for something like NPR
like this american life listening back
to two times the speed actually probably
sounds normal when you think about fer
stuff I'm kidding uh you know then you
gotta do it the stuff you should know
crew also talks pretty slow says long
podcasts get one and a half to two times
the treatment so that's Joe Rogan Jill
Schlesinger original money and hardcore
history and a lot of news commentary
also gets the one time one and a half
times that is fear of missing out it's
like my spike and go on knowing I didn't
catch every podcast that week you know
but if you were just like I need to know
what's happening in all of them then
you're just cramming and you're just
it's just this culture like I got to see
everything on my feet before I go to bed
I have to scroll through every they
scroll through Twitter did I scroll
through Instagram there completionists
mm-hmm um shows that he does listen to
you for pure entertainment value get
played at normal speed which thankfully
we're in
food in all right made the cut sick
Kokesh says though I've listened to the
44 on about sixty-five percent speed so
it covers while my bike commute Jeff
sounded wiser at that speed thanks bro
appreciate that uh back to other regular
I talk too fast you can't put me onto
time speed all right I mean we are
trying to hit a time to and a lot of
your programming yeah I that's my
favorite part of days when I'm walking
by bridges des and she's timing herself
on though I like a crazy person yeah
that's funny uh okay here's some other
stuff obi-wan shinobi Jeff to use
justins little black book of tech news
just in fact some pretty obscure
articles I do I got a couple of those uh
in in the rundown today from frugal rock
this is to Don Falcone down at frugal
Roth yeah do you like that they don't
they don't spend their money a lot there
Don Falcone with offices in San
Francisco and New York how does cnet
spread the workload so very carefully uh
so it's but it's what's interesting me
it's not just San Francisco New York at
San Francisco New York louisville
kentucky now louisville uh london right
sydney australia lots of lots of
different time zone go around yeah so
there's beats with editors assigned to
certain concentrations but there's also
a lot of switching off based on product
availability event locations and all
that sort of stuff I mean we started
with once upon a time San Francisco was
the mobile team and New York was some
terrible name like home and hardware
yeah remember that was when I first got
here and it still kind of breaks down
along those lines but it's much more
catch-as-catch-can now so San Francisco
still does a lot of phones and they do
car check out there and they'd use
software and apps which also is kind of
a legacy from way back when when
download.com was closer you know more
integrated to us which it really isn't
any more right and New York is more TV
home audio cameras and that sort of
thing but it's I mean we do phones here
now in New York with Scott we do
wearables here with Scott dan it's way
more interconnected now yeah yeah and
ideally we just honestly because of the
nature of the market more than anything
else there's a lot more people doing a
lot more stuff across the board for sure
including understands international
offices and down in Louisville of
courses again mostly smart home and
appliances but there's already been like
occasionally we'll go to up a press
conference here that's for that stuff
and learning some of the coverage here
and they'll pick up the rest so okay so
there you go the point is everybody
stays incredibly busy that is true um
and then how hands-on is CBS do they say
out of the day-to-day operations or
blink twice if you're being held against
your will I'm not I'm not you can't see
this on the on the audio podcast but I'm
not blinking yeah he's totally detached
yeah i would say except for one notable
instant back in 2013 that you might be
familiar with sure and that's why that
best of CES thing was so weird because
it was out of the blue but otherwise
we're really independent and what's cool
though now is where i think someone else
is mentioning um just Dan and Tim and
Scott and a lot of people like and you
guys to on CBS n and on CBS this morning
it's a much better partnership now than
ever before I would say definitely and
that answers the next question of uh you
know it's cool seeing it or i guess it
was more comment about how it's cool to
see us on CBS n and CBS proper arm
another question how do you think tech
reporting and reviews have changed from
when you first started doing it I'm
interested in this yeah right cuz it's
it you know it's been has been a great
deal time it's been a while but like it
on
internet it's been well I started here
at 2000 lifetime the read yeah so for
you it's been about the longest person
here either yeah um it's a lot more
competition quite and the interesting
thing I think is it's it's not even
necessarily like us competing with other
sites so much as as we all know people
just on YouTube right on twitter or on
tumblr buying something or seeing
something interesting and just reporting
on it or right-wing a review so you're
literally competing with everybody now
um which is I think the main thing
that's changed whereas back in the day
it was kind of just seen it and not a
lot of other people then the blog
started and now it's kind of off to the
races right that's what I but like when
I first got here blogs were getting
super popular and I remember that's when
like crave was first starting and it was
like okay not everything we do now is an
article the you know drawn-out review we
got to start doing these small little
stories and that made sense to me but
then once Twitter broke and everything
happened it was like all right now it's
just you know we've got that we've got
the brand and we've got the reputation
and you know everything just sort of
comes together in this massive
competitive you know yeah the other
interesting thing is there it's in a way
a little crazy how I almost feel like
there's fewer product categories now in
a certain way and part of the reason is
these phones or a perfect example of and
this has also been well-documented they
they kind of killed off 12 other brian
oh I don't need a camcorder if I have
fun i'll need the camera if I have a
phone I don't need yes if I have the
phone so it's uh in one way like fewer
more high-value devices for four people
and that's why the shopping and product
recommendation experience is a lot more
intense and intricate than it was before
definitely because it's like look if I
make one mistake
a lot of things I yeah I mean I remember
being here and doing pda's remnants well
like this Sonia palm powered sounique
liege oh man were where the coolest
product of the day I like a clamshell
design yeah that's crazy well uh and
then finally and I think we can ask this
to both of my guests today what is your
first memory of the 44 podcast and what
do you think of it now now that the last
one is loaded question so don't worry
about that but was your first memory of
it let's start with Bridget well I mean
when I was coming on with you when you
first get here again um 2011 ok so 2011
yeah so no Simon award I I was watching
it and like within my first couple of
days you had me on as a guest and I sang
reading rainbow oh my god I remember
that and so it that also follows me on
google oh sure sorry we get twice as
high as with Bridget Carey but ya know
better yeah i know i love it it was a
lot of fun um and so a shaky it's funny
how much things change yeah for sure
audio and then studio but yeah now that
was a good memory all right okay so we
were able to make a good first
impression I Bridget I'm not sure we
able to do the same thing with jhad but
what do you think what was your first
memory of it were you like me because
people would there be a get used to work
for you alright and yeah I feel like the
day those were the days and I feel like
you know what was your first impression
when I was like all right I'm gonna
start doing this what do you think um
first impression was I mean it it was so
long ago it was you and Randall and
Wilson doing these test runs that we
used to call the dude cat right right um
and that's just my first memory of it
and eventually morphed into the 404 and
then it was ended up just being you and
Justin for a long time and then it was
video and then not video and that's just
I always liked and preferred audio only
for these yeah the video I you know I
get why we and other people do it but it
just seems you know like that weird
video for the excuse of it being video
basically yeah I can't disagree um not
that you can't do interesting things
with that but I would when possible
prefer more of like a planned show sure
know where it's uh not the guy with
headphones on huddled over microphone
right and you know when we first went to
video whenever we did we only had like a
bird's I think sort of like peeking in
it wasn't something we were hosting
necessarily it was just like an option
first generation Howard Stern yeah
basically and that's it that's
immediately what I thought I was like oh
this is just like the e show on the air
for Howard Stern and then it you know we
got this set and it's sort of it did it
was it took us a very long time not to
feel weird doing what we were doing but
anyway that's a / thee you know people
listening to it it twice the speed like
I am after kind of walking away from
them for pretty long time feel like I'm
listening to more podcasts than ever now
yeah which is kind of this whole rebirth
podcast thing and it just it is in my
opinion because the audio is just so
much more accessible and I can just
leave it running if I'm making dinner or
a lot of times right before i go to bed
and it's really enjoyable that way and
it's not that you're not concentrating
on it but that's what's cool about audio
versus video i think as you can be doing
other stuff and still really enjoying
the podcast right so and to just
directly contradict that last thing you
just said we had pulled the show off of
youtube obviously because you know who
why you know no more video no more
youtube but for whatever reason we've
had a lot of requests to just upload our
audio to youtube which i didn't really
think we'd get a big response for but we
we did you know that's interesting and
that's still that there's still this
loss about YouTube I don't understand
and that whole thing about it being like
the number one source for music and
radio yeah because it's convenient for
some people they just get in the habit
of streaming that way I know a lot of
people who when you want to look up
something you first go there obviously
but then also they have playlists since
yeah I'm I I get it but I don't get it
so we we you know I said look if we got
a certain amount of people to send in or
up vote I would do it when will over
that so now I'm committed to figuring
out a way to do it it's not hard it's
just finding a the right channel within
seen it so hopefully the show just like
a title card up there yeah that it's
really no harder than that but I think
the way we publish and how it sends
stuff to YouTube has to be deconstructed
a little bit but it's not going to be
hard we are going to do it and I might
even start today so we'll let everyone
know on Twitter if today's show is in
fact available on YouTube hopefully it
is that's gonna do it for us guys thanks
