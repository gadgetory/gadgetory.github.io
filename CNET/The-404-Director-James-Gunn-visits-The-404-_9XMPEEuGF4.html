where we're going one-on-one with James
Gunn writer director producer
extraordinaire James Gunn in the studio
and applause for James thank you we're
very excited because your first foray
into the world of gaming yes
professionally at least yes is with the
new game from grasshopper manufacture
lollipop chainsaw right which is a very
big deal there's a huge cult following
behind these types of games from that
developer from guys like suda51 yeah now
you are getting the chance to work with
these guys how did this happen how did
you get involved in about chainsaw two
years ago Sudha Sudha 50 one's great you
know game developer rated games like no
more heroes and he's uh he's just a cult
game guy and he came to me along with
Warner Brothers who's putting out this
game and they said hey you know we have
this idea for a game we want to see if
you're interested I'd even know what
they meant or what they wanted me to do
so I sign this non-disclosure agreement
all this stuff and when in saw this
little bit of footage of this like you
know sexy high school cheerleader
chopping up zombies with a chainsaw and
having them explode into like these gory
glittery rainbow hearts which is
fantastic and I flipped it I mean I
truly flipped for the footage and I
thought it was so aesthetically
interesting right you know I mean we you
know we get compared to other you know
stories and games and everything since
since this game has been announced as
the trailers of coming out but
aesthetically to me there's never been
anything like it and I was fascinating
but I said I listen what do you me to do
I'll do whatever you want me to do and
they said we want you to help us to
write the story we've got part of the
idea down but we needed to you know be
further crafted and we want you to you
know come up with the characters and
write the characters and so I did that
and I just became involved and like I do
with most things I become involved with
I i'm crazy i go all the way so i was
basically hired to write the cutscenes
and oversee writers to write the rest of
the dialogue and stuff like that but
instead i just did everything myself
because i became attached to the
characters i really love them and i just
wrote the whole thing and then I went
and I hired all the actors to play the
different characters in the game I've
directed them
in the voice-over sessions it was my
first experience doing that and it was
it was great it was a great experience
so I'm happy that sounds amazing so so
you know you're obviously very well
versed in the world of film and writing
for film and directing for film how does
that translate over because I would
imagine there's a lot of similarities
but at the same time it's probably sort
of a different day well it's all
experience just I mean just technically
it's a very different thing write a
screenplay it's a you know 90 to 120
page then little screenplay you have to
keep everything contained everything is
about making sure every single scene
leads to the next thing and it's all
very constricted writing a videogame you
write on Excel sheets or at least we did
with this game and the script is like
you know this sure so it's like this big
huge just thousands and thousands of
lines of dialogue and you know you'll
have a scene in which a girl is you know
say you know the juliet starling our
hero will stave a girl from a zombie or
she won't and so we'll have to write 30
lines of dialogues if she says the girl
and 30 lines of dialogue if she doesn't
save the girls either running away or
she's complaining that she's dying so
it's like nothing gets left on the
cutting room nothing is left i mean is
and i found that to be a remarkably like
freeing creative experience because you
do you know when you're in this industry
for a long time and especially you have
the spotlight on you you you get at
times sort of you know wound up and you
may be overthink things a little you
come perfectionist and especially with a
movie when you make a movie once every
two years or every three years even it's
it's it becomes such a big deal but with
this it was just like I just had to
write and write and write and I'd sit
there and write for 12 hours and just
turn it all in and that's the game I
mean there was everything when you
everything you do I mean because you
have to write so much yeah
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
