podcast I'm Veronica Belmont I'm sure
you've heard the Coke Pepsi challenge
where people try to choose which is
their favorite soft drink well today
we're gonna do something a little bit
like it when you have two different mp3
players the iPod and they're soon and
we're gonna find out which sounds best
to people off the street and to help me
we have Donald and Jasmine our editors
of mp3 here at CNET you're gonna
represent the Zune today you're gonna do
the iPod cuz you have one so let's go
see what people think about these
players right all right well we found
our first victim he is Chris hi Chris
are you ready for the challenge today
we'll see
all right so Jasmine has our first
player and you don't know what it is
correct correct
all right so let's get to put the
headphones on we'll play your first song
and take a good solid listen now this is
gonna be the same song different player
okay this one's better all right
he likes player number two better and
shall we reveal which one it was
you picked the iPod on with the
challenge what's your name nidia all
right we're gonna put the headphones on
and see which one you like better
close mmm
the first one yes the first one not this
one
take the first one I think the the highs
were touched on a little bit better with
the first player let's see which one it
was the first one and what was the first
one oh it was the Xun all right well we
had a landslide victory today the Xun
beat the iPod at four to two and so
that's pretty that's pretty deciding
right there these are people just off
the street they didn't know one way or
another so let's talk to our experts and
get their opinions on it Donald how do
you feel about the iPod losing so poorly
I'm a little bit upset I thought it
would be kind of a harder match for
people to judge but people kind of came
up with their decision pretty quickly
but I still think there's a lot going
for the iPod beyond audio quality that
would help people be committed to an
Apple product like all right in Jasmine
what is there beyond audio quality come
on I was pretty certain that this would
come out on top as far as audio quality
it's concerned it is it is a very good
sounding player and the iPod it's okay
but I've seen it be beat out in the past
so I am I was talking it yeah well the
Zune is a better sounder and the iPod is
okay thank you guys so much for your
health today if you want to read the
crave blog you can do so at crave
