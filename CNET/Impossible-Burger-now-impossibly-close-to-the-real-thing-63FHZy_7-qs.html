grilled burgers this is like a lettuce
wrap
these are little skewers with the
chimichurri sauce the product is really
made up of four different components so
there's the proteins the flavors and the
aromas and the binders and the fat now
in the the new recipe is a soy protein
so that's different than before which is
a wheat protein so it now has a much
like beefier two and this sort of coarse
grind that consumers expect from a
really high quality meat and what we do
is we take the dry soy protein and we
hydrate it with the water and potato
protein and then the magic ingredient is
scheme in the potato protein is also
where we have all of our flavor
precursors in beef and then we replicate
that exact same flavor generation upon
cooking but just by starting with
ingredients from plants and so all of
these sort of nutrients and amino acids
and sugars that then create like the
natural delicious flavor when you brown
meat you know the smell and everything
that is all in this in this ingredient
here once it's been hydrated then we add
heme so heme like I said is our magic
ingredient it's the iron containing
molecule that's found in all living
plants and animals we use a cellulose
based binding system and that is a
really important ingredient that helps
to create juiciness and our product so
actually as it as you cook it and it
sort of solidifies it releases water so
it helps to hold it together in the raw
state and the cook state one of the
things once do is lower the total fat
and the saturated fat and the way we're
able to do that is remove some of the
coconut oil and replace it with some
flour
and now that we're using the soy protein
it's made without gluten and the
gluten-free claim is is pending and
should be next year so the major
improvements are the entire sensory
experience where we now have a much
beefier juicier product the nutrition is
better where we have a higher quality
protein lower lower fat and lower sodium
and then what we're most excited about
is the improved versatility so now you
can grilled it you can do meatloaf and
meatballs you can do a bolognese sauce
so it now holds up to soups and sauces a
chili anything you could possibly think
of with ground beef you can do we have
tried it in in sapota since the pots are
getting more and more popular and yeah
it works it works really well we have
been learning how to create the flavors
of all kinds of meat you know chicken
pork even fish and we have a tremendous
amount of idea around that and knowledge
and so forth but strategically we have
for now decided to really focus our
energies on beef because that's where we
can have the greatest impact as quickly
as possible
the next major distinct product is
reasonably likely to be a steak
the whole mission of the company is to
completely replace the use of animals as
a food technology globally by 2035
that's our mission I'm just coming out
of Impossibles Foods lab where I got to
taste test their new burger
they let me sample the burger cook the
various ways beef skewers there's
hamburger
there was a Thai style orab dish and I
must say I was completely fooled I would
have thought this was beef if someone
told me and not a plant-based meat
earlier versions of the burger
definitely tasted like beef to me but
they didn't have the same texture they'd
hold together as well this one really
held together it was really juicy had
that charred meat flavor and it was
delicious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
