but at least it was a pretty great year
for laptops and so based on my decade
plus of testing and reviewing computers
here are my personal favorites for 2016
the touch bar on the new MacBook Pro is
actually the least important thing the
real reason it's still king of the
premium laptops is that everything
inside has been updated from the thinner
lighter design to the brighter screen to
a touchpad that's twice as big a lien
wears new 13-inch gaming laptop pretty
much runs the table on my wish list it's
got an OLED screen which is amazing to
play games on an excellent keyboard and
an NVIDIA GeForce 1060 GPU which means
it can run all the big VR headsets the
think pan version of the Lenovo yoga has
always been my favorite yoga because the
key is disappear inside the body when
you fold it into a tablet now it's
available with an OLED display which
makes it more expensive but just looks
amazing HP makes thinner laptops like
the spectre but I prefer the EliteBook
folio gene one from HP's professional
line it looks great it's very portable
and it has an optional 4k touchscreen
the samsung galaxy tabpro s beats the
surface pro on price by including its
keyboard cover in the box rather than
forcing you to buy it separately it also
has a very impressive AMOLED display
it's a great value for a very premium
feeling hybrid apples 12-inch MacBook is
my pick for people looking for an
alternative to the aging MacBook Air
it's very thin and very light and
includes all those magic Mac OS touches
from long battery life to an amazing
touchpad it's my hands-down current
favorite for coffee shops and airplane
ride</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
