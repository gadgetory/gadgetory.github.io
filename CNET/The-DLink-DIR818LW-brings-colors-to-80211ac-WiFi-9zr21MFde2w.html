vacation which explained why I'm so tan
now and not white anymore
but speaking of skin colour this is the
AC 750 dear 8 1 8 LW router from dealing
now this is the very first AC router on
the market that comes in four colors and
naturally I have all of them wait there
you go
plug Y orange and teal no discrimination
but very randomly let's pick one for a
closer look there you go
good choice as you can see this very
compact rare in fact it's almost compact
enough to be a travel writer though not
quite on the back here you can see there
are usual for LAN port and one one or
Internet post all of these port though
are gigabit is very impressive for aware
of this size and there's also this HP
2.0 here to host a storage device on the
front there are two antenna lights the
top here is for the power stylist and
the one below is for the rest if it's
green everything is ok it is amber
something neat attention now on the
inside the router here is a lot less
impressive but one is actually support
the slow speed of the 802 point and a C
Wi-Fi standard to offer this top speed
on the 5 gigahertz frequency band
obsessed 433 megabit per second on the
2.4 gigahertz band it support the second
tier of the 802.11 and Wi-Fi standard
with the top speed of 300 megabits per
second now note though those feet are on
the paper the wheel won't sustain speed
of the Wi-Fi is always a lot slower than
that and with this one here it was slow
indeed in my testing it offered the
sustained speed up just hundred and
thirty six megabit per second on the
fighting headband and only 36 megabit
per second on the 2.4 gigahertz band and
that is when I tested in the close 15
feet range when I increase the rain
further out he was much slower basically
is about as fast at a
good and 600 router now this one he also
have very short range which is about 100
feet away and that means it will not
work well in a large home but if you
live in a small apartment or a studio it
would do just fine to make up for that
the router here support dealing cloud
service allowing you to manage your home
network remotely with the Internet
including a mobile app for that
in although I don't feel like it has
enough to justify the $80 price tag the
good news of this this white one here
can be had right now for just about $60
and now that's a good deal if you live
in a small home now for more on this one
you check out my food with you at co.com
by the way still have all four of them
here I did think about giving them away
to make myself look friendly and
likeable but then I realize it would be
so unnecessary because you like me
already
even if you think you don't and that's
because I'm don't know and this has been
the first look as the dear 8 1 8 l ee
router</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
