headphone the rebranded version of the
company's popular o2i headphone it
carries a list price of one 7995 but
costs around a hundred and fifty dollars
online hi I'm David Carr noise and I'd
like to tell you that Bose has improved
the sound of the headphone but alas the
changes are really just cosmetic with
this new model coming in new more
eye-catching colors that are perhaps
designed to appeal to a younger
headphone shopper Bose also makes a
larger around-ear sound true model and
both of these headphones are among the
most comfortable in their categories
their sound is good - that you can find
competing models that deliver arguably
better sound for the money aside from
being very comfortable for an on-air
model what I've always liked about this
headphone is how light it is and how it
folds up into a very small case that
fits easily in your bag when traveling
it's a great travel headphone though it
does let some sound in and doesn't
feature any sort of noise canceling
circuitry of boses quiet comfort models
as for features the headphone cord is
detachable and that cord has an
integrated three button remote and
microphone for making cell phone calls
this is an Apple friendly model so not
all the remote features will work with
Android and Windows phones as I said
this headphone sounds good and delivers
smooth generally well balanced fairly
open sound this is a pleasant headphone
to listen to but not necessarily an
exciting one and it doesn't offer the
refined detail that a more expensive
model like the bear dynamic t51p offers
nor is it as forward or aggressive as
the beats solo2 which pushes the bass
and treble more all that said it's what
I like to call a safe headphone in that
it makes most music and most music
sources sound decent so I think that as
long as you're not expecting audiophile
grade sound quality most people should
be pretty pleased with the sound and
around $150 I wouldn't call this a
bargain but does offer an excellent
combination of comfort and decent sound
in a lightweight foldable design that
travels well I'm David Carlo and that's
the
bose soundtrue on-ear thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
