with a 4G data connection let's check
the tech in the 2015 Buick LaCrosse
if it weren't for China the Buick brand
probably would not have survived GM's
2009 bankruptcy but last year GM sold
800,000 Buicks in China that compares to
200,000 in the United States so you
wouldn't have the LaCrosse if it weren't
for the Chinese market now the La Crosse
is Buicks full-size sedan app it's got a
very high roofline at a big cabin
there's a lot of headroom and legroom
inside it's a very comfortable car but
it's not precisely a luxury car it's
actually front-wheel drive which really
isn't a luxury market thing so what they
call it is premium or near luxury now
for 2015 they've added a head-up display
adaptive cruise control and they've
added the active safety seat which
buzzes your butt to warn you about
things such as if there's traffic ahead
that you're about to hit or cars in your
blind spot to the center stack we have
what they call Buick IntelliLink and
we've got this home button here which
brings up this is a basic homescreen
with these icons we've got audio phone
navigation a Settings icon
Pandora icon whether a text messaging
thing if your phone works with this
system and an OnStar icon my usual audio
sources here I'm actually on bluetooth
streaming but I can also plug in my
iPhone or a USB Drive to a USB port in
the center console I can also switch to
radio and that will get me FM AM and
satellite radio navigation actually
looks pretty good on this system in 3d
perspective these these maps look really
good there's a lot of nice detail and if
you're in a downtown area like the
middle of San Francisco you see all
these buildings rendered too there's
traffic for your major roads but there
isn't a lot of traffic coverage this
doesn't have as extensive traffic
coverage as I've seen on other cars so
that that's a little strike against this
system I've also noticed that the system
is a little bit sluggish when I push the
various icons sometimes
things don't happen right away and I
have to push it a couple of times or
it's just a little slow to work the
Pandora function will work if I append
all running on my phone and my phone is
connected to the system for whether this
actually comes through satellite radio
and here it's showing me the local
weather for San Francisco and hourly
pattern I can also switch it to a
36-hour or a daily one which will give
me a five-day forecast when I go to
OnStar here actually this is the real
party trick of this car this little
cross is one of the first cars to come
with a 4G data connection that's part of
OnStar and they use that to enable a
Wi-Fi hotspot so to test this Wi-Fi
hotspot I've got a nexus 7 tablet here
and I've got a band with the app here to
tell me how fast this connection runs
looks like it's actually an average
speed of 12 megabits per second so
that's really fast you might wonder why
you'd want a Wi-Fi hotspot in your car
if most of your devices are connected
out of LTE anyway well it's good for
tablets if you have wireless only
tablets and actually the Wi-Fi
connection in this car is going to be
have a little stronger signal than the
one on your phone because this car has a
more robust antenna so you might get a
connection further out then when your
phone might might drop at this car watch
they have a connection for a longer
amount of time this IntelliLink system
is pretty good a little sluggish on
response and I would actually like to
see more apps on here too and I would
also like to see the 4G connection power
more things in the system
I'm pretty comfortable in the cabin of
this Buick LaCrosse
it's very roomy I've got a lot of elbow
room and there was a passenger in the
back they'd have a quite a bit of room
too it's nice in here under the hood
we're running a direct injection 3.6
liter v6 that does 304 horsepower 264
pound-feet of torque direct injection is
a pretty efficient technology it means
that it's mixing the fuel and air in the
cylinder instead of in an intake
manifold
that leads to fuel economy of 18 miles
per gallon city 28 miles per gallon
highway highway number is pretty good
but the city number kind of kills you my
total average has been about 20
six-speed automatic transmission that's
the only transmission you get with this
car it's not really a driver's car it's
just very comfortable this doesn't have
an air suspension or anything like that
like a real luxury car would have but
you did a really good job of tuning the
suspension for comfort now there is
another engine available with this car a
Buick does a 2.4 liter direct injection
four-cylinder have driven that one
before I like it actually and that will
raise your fuel economy quite a bit fuel
economy on that model is 25 City 36
highway so you'll probably average about
30 with that that's a pretty big
advantage over this so we have adaptive
cruise control I can set that with the
buttons on the steering wheel here and a
radar looking forward will slow this car
down to the speed of slower traffic
ahead I've got blind spot monitors too
so that will flash an icon in the side
mirrors that there's a car in my blind
spot if I were to turn the signal on
while a car was over there to give me a
little warning about it the active
safety seat that this car has will
actually buzz my but it also uses that
for the forward collision alert if I'm
approaching stop traffic or slow traffic
too quickly and the car thinks you know
this could be a potential closing
situation it'll also buzz me like that
give me a warning
that's price out our 2015 Buick LaCrosse
the example we have here has the premium
two trim level so that puts the base
price at forty thousand eight hundred
ninety five dollars that also comes with
the direct injection v6 engine we add
the driver confidence one and two
packages that gets us adaptive cruise
control blind spot monitoring and that
active safety seat that adds three
thousand three hundred seventy dollars
for a total of forty four thousand two
hundred sixty-five dollars for this car
now personally I would actually scale up
back I would start with the mild hybrid
version with that 2.4 liter
four-cylinder engine up the fuel economy
and also save about five thousand
dollars on the total price</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
