scene at CES tradition it's our coolest
laptops of the show chat show where we
get the best stuff from CES line them
all up and talk about laptops and
tablets and hybrids I'm very excited
this year to be joined by Xiomara blanco
and josh goldman we got three people and
a lot of laptops to talk about let's
just jump right into it I think one of
my favorite things I saw was a
Chromebook and Chromebooks could be kind
of boring sometimes this is the new
Samsung Chromebook pro and or plus they
have two versions of the pro and the
plus and they actually look identical
it's a kind of a higher-end version of a
Chromebook because it's got a
touchscreen in a metal body and a 360
degree hinge and the difference between
the pro and the plus is one is an Intel
processor one has an ARM processor which
is interesting because you don't see
that outside of a couple of Chromebooks
in the laptop field and I like that
it'll run Android apps from the Google
Play Store because it's built around
that and I feel like Chromebooks are
kind of limited you know people feel
like they're kind of the boring low-end
laptop and people now making higher end
ones and I think adding Android apps
makes up for the fact that you can't you
know run other stuff but I think price
is pretty important with the category I
don't know how much of these cookies
this is like foreign change for the ARM
version the Intel version might be a
little bit more so you're getting up to
kind of that premium price there I will
show you one bonus you get here tilt it
for me and then you click right here and
you get a stylus and that works on the
screen it works with Google keep and
things like that so that's probably
cooler Chromebook I've seen here been
any other Chromebooks here they're a
handful but I don't think anybody has
liked this kind of set of features and I
know that
Xiomara really like this guy what is
this yeah this is the Asus Zenbook a3
deluxe and i really like it i use a
macbook air for work but this feels just
like it it's super light it has three
USB sea ports to which work as a
thunderbolt ports and i just really like
the way it looks I think it's super cool
and sleek it's really got the aesthetics
down oh sorry I got a little bit of a
mic adjustment there yeah no it's great
and then the other thing about it right
is the the screen right it's got a 13
inch laptop with a 14 inch screen which
sounds impossible but it's really not
you
and compares well with the ThinkPad
right that's true that's trick that over
there Lenovo always brings a ton of
laptops here this is one of our
favorites it's the ThinkPad x1 carbon is
that it right two and a half pounds just
over a half an inch thick mainly made
for business but we like them so much so
there's dr. stuff and use them just at
the regular home laptop where some of
the best ones rely and this one - has
the almost no bezel on it so you get the
full 14 inch display in a tiny 13-inch
like yes 13 line does the same thing
with the thin bezel um and then we it
also Windows hello it seems to be big
this year right windows hello at the IR
cameras that I did right so very secure
and this has mobile broadband - if you
are traveling around very cool a little
bit bigger in the in the hybrid space
you usually don't see a big hybrid like
this with a 15-inch screen it's the HP
spectre x360 15 inch Edition and when
you go like this you know it gives you a
nice kind of portable almost TV screen
quality to it and the difference between
this one and last year's I'll fold it
down to a tablet shape for you is they
actually made it a little bit thicker
than the previous version of this and
that's because I added a much bigger
battery and I feel like you know people
are struggling to make the you know
racing to make the thinnest laptops
possible but I will trade a little bit
of that for some better features some
better battery life and I think that's
it that that's a smart trade-off here
and you don't see too many 15-inch
hybrid so I always like big cool stuff
like this yeah
integrated graphics in this one or there
is there is an option where you can get
in a video GPU but not like a super
cambree one I think it might go up to a
nine a nine forty but if you want
something a little better with graphics
this is my little dark horse favorite
laptop of the show this is a it's not an
alienware it's a dell inspiron it's the
Inspiron 15 7000 and they had one of
these last year two that had an NVIDIA
960 GPU in it for like 800 bucks and
that was a really good deal well now
they've updated it it's got a little bit
of kind of gamer reef later but it's got
some like red highlights and cool vents
and stuff and it's got the the backlit
red keys and they've got the Nvidia 1050
carnot which is in videos new card you
know it's it's a mainstream
budget graphics heart but it's perfectly
fine for regular games on this guy $7.99
it's tough to get more gaming laptop for
800 bucks than this right and Acer has a
similar model also scoring the 1050 and
about the same price Lenovo has their
new Legion that's the same thing and
Samsung has the Odyssey that also does
the same thing they're all like seven
eight nine hundred dollars with that ten
fifty or the ten fifty TI but that's not
enough because iam re want to tell you
this gigantic gaming laptop here that's
a little bit more expensive just a
little bit starting at $9,000 this can
be all yours if you've ever wanted a
gaming laptop that's more of a computer
than a laptop unless you want this heavy
thing on your lap it weighs about 20
pounds it's a pretty incredible machine
like I'm not going to pull out my back
or anything but it's huge and it's got a
curved screen 21 inches a trackpad that
you can take off and use as a number pad
v cooling fans I mean I could list the
specs but I'd be here all day and the
big mechanical keyboard like the kind
you only see I like standalone desktop
keyboards which is just crazy
yeah this thing is massive so you're
taking that on the plane on the way home
right yeah it's coming home with me for
sure you might need the extra leg room
seat for that I'm I'm just gonna say is
this the one that has two power supplies
yes it does have two power supplies
because I plugged in I had to hunt
around backstage to find two outlets
next to each other to plug it in and
this is actually actually coming out you
know this is a row almost ready to
release product and they'll be selling
this in stores if you have $9,000 and
really want a really cool gaming laptop
a little bit further out is this guy one
of the cool concept pieces here at the
show razor always brings a couple of
cool concept pcs prototypes this year
this is one of the most popular things
here it's called project Valarie and
it's a 17 inch gaming laptop based on
one of their you know current models but
the lid is really thick because inside
there are two extra screens and and and
in the final version you'd press a
button or use a software command and the
extra screens would come out from either
side and arrange themselves and then you
have a triple screen laptop which I know
I've never seen before
don't remember ever seeing a triple
screen laptop it's probably why they're
crowded around it out there on the floor
sure they have it under glass and like
you can't get close to this thing
because everyone's always always
crowding around trying to look at it and
it's got an Nvidia 1080 card in it which
is the desktop / laptop you know pretty
much top of the line right now and those
are I think three 17-inch UHD displays
so that's a lot of pixels and I actually
play battlefield one on there for a
little bit you know it ran perfectly
fine they mention a likelihood of
December coming out or like a lot of
these concepts pieces you never know
what's actually going to happen but they
do have it up and running which which I
appreciate in a concept piece and they
have as a mirror to that they have
project Ariana which is the big in-room
projector that then it sends you know
game images and lighting effects all
around you and we talk about all this
big expensive stuff I want to whip out
one last little thing here I have in my
pocket to give you something a little
more budget minded this is the Lenovo
500 multimedia controller and it's also
from that Xiomara and I were talking
about what do you do if you have a
computer in your living room and you
want to control it it's hooked up to
your TV like what do you do right now I
mean I have a Bluetooth keyboard that's
about this big and it's fine but if I
could use that instead why not a little
it's almost like a blackberry --is--
style keyboard and you can see it's got
it's got the the QWERTY keyboard but
there's no touchpad and that's because
if you just run your fingers over the
keys without pressing them down
that's the touchpad and I tried it out
one finger work two finger for scrolling
worked if you tap once like this that's
a left click if you tap with two fingers
that's a right click and you know what I
was dubious I tried it out like this
actually works kind of good and this is
I think a cooler solution than the giant
laptop with the touchpad attached I keep
in my lap when I'm trying to like you
know get the stuff on my on my home
theater PC I have hooked up to the TV
and I think it's going to be like 55
bucks yes I'd buy that Yeah right cool
well this is some of the coolest laptops
and and tablets and big gaming machines
and accessories we've seen here at the
show and nice thing is most of these
you'll be able to go out and and buy
this here yeah I love how they range in
practicality like this is practical for
a completely different person then what
this is practical for and we've gone
from like four hundred dollars to nine
thousand dollars to two who knows how
well thank you Josh Goldman Thank You
Xiomara Blythe thank you for watching
our coolest laptops of the show at CES
and then coming up at the top of the
hour we're going to join Brian Tong live
from the show floor with his backpack</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
