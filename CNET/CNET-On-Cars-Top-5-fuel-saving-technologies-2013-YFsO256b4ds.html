gas pump but actually it's true cars are
getting better mpg then even a handful
of years ago
I'm Brian Cooley with the top-five
latest reasons why that's the case we're
gonna rank these guys by the percentage
improvement each one is made in how much
your car guzzles number five a
multi-stage oil pump total savings about
one percent yeah we're starting small
here
the idea here is an oil pump that only
pumps as much oil as the engine needs
radical idea because most oil pumps
today are dumb and they just pump more
oil as the engine revs higher not as it
needs more oil and lubrication the
upside here is the engine spends less
time turning all the load against a pump
and more of its fuel moving your car
down the road which is what you want it
to do number four CV tees and dcts
six to seven percent improvement
continuously variable transmission
that's the first one and dual clutch
transmission that's the second one have
become much more common lately the
former saves fuel by keeping the engine
running at the perfect sweet spot the
latter by always having a locked
engagement of the gears like a manual
transmission because it is it just does
the shifting for you
number three active cylinder management
about seven-and-a-half percent
improvement you may have a six or a v8
in your car but that doesn't mean you
need one all the time
engines with active cylinder management
can shut down say half their cylinders
when not needed it's not a new
technology but now it works so
seamlessly you won't even know it's
happening and if it sounds wimpy and
green know that it's standard on the new
Corvette Stingray for example that's
part of how it does 455 horsepower and
29 mpg on the highway number two brake
regeneration about an eight percent
savings hybrids have always done this
but they no longer own the technology
many conventional gas engine BMWs for
example today recharge their battery by
harnessing the kinetic energy of the car
when it's coasting or braking instead of
always driving this draggy alternator
with a
less drag on the engine means better
efficiency before I get to number one
and Wow
what an improvement it makes I just know
you're adding up all these numbers in
your head saying hey Cooley if these
numbers are right cars would be getting
an average of 50 mpg right about now
well here's the problem we prefer
comfort safety and speed to go with our
fuel efficiency on MIT survey found that
between 1980 and 2006 mpg went up 15% on
average but at the same time cars
average weight went up 26% and
performance 107 percent had those last
two numbers set still mpg would have
been up a giant 60 percent and yep we'd
be averaging somewhere close to 50 in
most cars ok our number one fuel saving
technology that's really gaining some
traction lately is clean diesel this is
the big one thirty to thirty five
percent more efficient diesel engines
get a lot more energy out of each drop
of fuel largely thanks to the fact that
they compress it more for a bigger bang
no other technology has such a huge
Delta the downside Americans hate
Diesel's we still think that they are
slow stinky loud and smoky I've driven a
lot of the latest ones they are none of
those things and you probably still
don't care to stay on top of more
fuel-efficient technologies as they come
down the road and all other tech around
cars go to CNET on cars calm I'm Bryan
Cooley thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
