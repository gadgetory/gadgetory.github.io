it was a simpler time the time which
while way apparently squats out I say
that because the May 10 light has four
that's right four cameras two on the
back and two on the front taper your
excitement though this is a mid-range
phone one that you can import from
around 300 bucks so the cameras are more
about quantity and quality they're
competent with good lighting but
overexposure is a problem especially in
portrait products but even if the quad
camera setup is a gimmick the rest of
the phone is it's build quality is great
and avoids the cheap field that many
inexpensive phones can suffer from plus
it's got a distinct design thanks in
large part to its crisp 5.9 inch full HD
screen it didn't fare as well as more
expensive funds and our benchmark tests
but I rarely noticed any lag when
actually using the phone browsing the
web and watching videos is perfectly
Pleasant and the front also managed
30-day gaming fun with Sonic - there's
enough battery life to last you at least
a full day as long as hearing to get to
keen on that Sonic - there are some
noticeable missing features like NSC and
water resistance however there also some
nice touches
flacco responsive fingerprint scanner
and a spacious 64 gigs of storage plus a
headphone jack
the main ten light isn't spectacular but
it is solid in almost every way that
makes it worth your consideration if
you're looking to spend around about
$300 on a phone
