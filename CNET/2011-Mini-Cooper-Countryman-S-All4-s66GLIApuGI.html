crossover almost unheard of so how did
many make it this long without one well
no matter it's here now let's drive the
2011 Mini Cooper S Countryman all4 and
check the tech it sports a new face for
many for bucket seats for wheels driven
if you like and five doors a first for
these guys but when your mini the most
important thing is to make sure every
mini is clearly am in to push the
boundaries too far and you can lose all
your models so what is a countryman well
first of all this is a big part of the
store you got a lot more cargo space in
one of these guys as you can imagine by
the overall packaging in fact twice as
much interior space as a standard mini
it's got higher ground clearance got
longer wheelbase our car is equipped
with an optional dual pane panoramic
roof it's got a little more of an
off-road II look because as you can see
on ours it's an all four it's got
all-wheel drive but they don't all have
that that's an optional level on this
car and they can also be had as an S
which our car is or not and one thing
about a Mini is you always know you're
in a mini because the speedometer is
Mexi and that's iconic for them though
increasingly silly to me yes it's the
size of a dinner plate it's basically
just a speedo with some idiot lights and
the segmented fuel gauge but you know
I've kind of tired of the stick at this
point this is a BMW style display with a
mini style set of controls I actually
like how simple and clear it is you know
I see so many elaborate screen based
displays sometimes it's kind of nice to
go back to simple and this one's very
effective now on the input side your
basic sources are am/fm HD radio and
Sirius with a full year of Sirius by the
way quite generous and an ox Jack's
standard analogue Hawks down here
upgrading like you can upgrade to Harman
Kardon on the output side you can also
upgrade to getting
this guy here that's a USB plus iPod and
you've got a little pigtail you use with
that it's one of these dealios here it
goes into aux and USB and it's got iPod
on the other end now they tell us and I
think it's true they've upgraded the
materials the plastic on the dash and
the whole fitting here in this guy it is
a little nicer graded materials a little
more toned down but there's something
ways to customize this thing who knows
what yours will look like one thing
yours will have it's very novel is this
a set of aluminum rails here kind of
like one of those really expensive
European rail systems people with their
bicycles on runs here all the way down
through the back seats which by the way
our dual buckets there's no rear bench
available on this car and what you do is
you clip accessories in there for
example here's a cell phone holder you
put the little ears down in there like
that and you click it into place the
only problem is I can't put it where I
want it because they've got this part
blocked here a whole bunch of it because
they had to leave room for this the
parking brake handle although I would
like to put my phone right here right in
front of it I'd be okay with that
now sort of so it's more kind of promise
than it is theory now I've got the base
gear box here it comes with a six-speed
manual this vehicle great big old
vintage style knob you can also get an
automatic that's optional extra cost it
would have paddles on the wheel with the
LCD connected head unit you'll also want
the free connected app it uses your
phone for Google search and send to NAV
streaming web radio driving efficiency
analyzer the ability to compose non
canned updates for your social media
accounts by voice I assume and it now
has a new feature called dynamic music
that doesn't just increase the volume
the faster you drive but also ramps up
the tempo I think I might hate that
okay under the STEMI little hood up here
on this guy we've got a ninja that's
quite familiar this is at 1.6 litre
inline-four turbocharged a twin scroll
turbo real BMW lineage type stuff
generates 181 horsepower 177 foot-pounds
of torque when it runs this is the first
time on a car Tech we've had a car
flat-out die well as I was saying 177
foot-pounds of torque 0 to 60 B about
7.3 seconds with the manual seven point
seven with the automatic transmission
while delivering 25 31 mpg now I'm going
to go restart the car
well that's that what I'm thinking a
bill me for the car yes our minis engine
did tank when idling during our shoot
never started again went home on a
flatbed now that doesn't mean anything
statistically but Consumer Reports does
they slot the 2011 minis near the bottom
for predicted reliability my single
gripe about driving the countryman S
all4 is that it seems the nummis mini
now when you lean into it especially in
sport mode it's a lively point-and-shoot
thing it's that other 90% of your
driving where I found it the least fun
of their line that stuff I call nibbling
anything from stop and go to just
stoplight to stoplight driving here the
countryman has all the torque of a moped
unless you jump on the gas pedal which I
don't do all the time so that makes most
everyday driving kind of tedious all of
us on the car tech team complain that we
kept dumping the clutch and killing the
car because it has zero low rpm guts
okay let's price a countryman our guys
top and so it's 27 6 base because we've
got the S turbo motor the all for the
all-wheel drive now on top of that you
got to spend several grand to go seen
that style first of all I'm gonna get
this thing called the Premium Package
that gets me the dual panoramic roof I
get automatic temperature control and
the Harman Kardon audio upgrade then go
for convenience and connected that's 2
grand for six and a half inch LCD voice
command USB plus iPod smartphone
integration auto dimming rear view rain
sensor the full keyless access deal and
all of that and then on top of that two
thousand dollar package you add in 750
more to build navigation into that
screen and of course you're going to
want the mini connected app
we killed the car today it's alright
that was a short shoot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
