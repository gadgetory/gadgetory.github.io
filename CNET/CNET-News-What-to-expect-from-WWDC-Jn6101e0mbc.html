I'm cnet's cara de Savoie joined by
senior writer Josh Lowensohn we are on
location outside of moscone west and as
you can see behind us they're putting up
the apple logo in preparation for next
week's WWDC Worldwide Developer
Conference Josh a little preview of
what's to come next week yeah you know
the big deal is iOS and Mac os10 Apple
said they're going to introduce the new
versions of it of course that's just for
developers we're fun I gotta get their
hands on it for a couple more months
right what are you expecting in this
upgrade uh you know for iOS there's been
a lot of talk about redesign maybe
something that looks a little bit more
flat iOS is basically have the same look
since it came out in 2007 ok with the
iphone so it's it's kind of overdue
especially in terms of what's in
competitors like Microsoft and Google
are doing so that's the big thing and
then on Mac side there really hasn't
been a lot known besides the fact that
they put that new version every year now
we're overdue okay so what what do we
know though about a new mac that could
come out I mean obviously thinner
lighter cheaper but what about on the
hardware side a lot of its gonna be
about the pro notebooks things like the
macbook air or the macbook pro in terms
of the macbook air it's been a year
since the last update intel just put out
new chips that actually came out this
week so we were gonna get better battery
life probably some thinner designs a lot
of things that typically come with chip
upgrades but for something like the
macbook air this could be a big change
something like 9 10 hour battery life
which is just crazy Wow any other
hardware update or hardware
announcements were expecting absolutely
I think we're gonna see some stuff on
the wireless side so routers probably
move to the speedier 802 11 AC which is
you know faster than n a lot of other PC
makers are moving to that I think we can
also need to expect a new mac pro this
is apple's desktop tower and a lot of
the rumors have been pointing to
something that looks a little bit more
like a beefed-up mac mini so that could
be really cool i mean it's it's hard
because that's always been the apples
most expensive and expandable computer
and it might just be something that you
can't actually change anything on it
which is kind of crazy but historically
WWDC is not the place for new iphone
ipod updates that's not always the case
but it's true so like the iphone 4 was
introduced here and we've seen upgrades
like the iphone 3gs those kind of
products are so big now that they do
kind of warrant their own events a lot
of times just to explain features so I
would expect to see either here but you
never know and what about a watch I'll
talked about this for months are we
gonna see it I don't think we're gonna
see watch if this thing we're not gonna
see a television things like that are
again worthy other own things um I don't
know yeah you never know but I don't
think we're gonna see that or any sort
of new TV stuff so this really is for
developers it's a five-day-long
conference and what really is the point
for them right so I mean the big thrust
of course is keynote on Monday which
runs about an hour to and the rest of it
is basically just sessions so they're
learning about new platform stuff it was
probably be the iOS and mac side it's
really time for them ask questions
meetup there's also a couple events like
a design awards show and they usually
drive people down to cupertino to go see
a concert for them it's a lot of face
time with the company that they don't
normally get great the coverage begins
Monday morning yeah we'll be there live
join us awesome thank you so much senior
writer Josh Lowensohn I'm car soo boy I
hope you tune in to WWDC coverage
starting Monday June tenth thanks so
much thanks for watching the inside
