Crees new par38 LED this is an 18 watt
bulb that's gonna put out fifteen
hundred lumens worth of light and that's
pretty good the other part of 38 from
the competitors we've seen put out about
950 or a thousand something around there
so that's a noticeable uptick in
brightness it's also a bit more
affordable than those bulbs which tend
to cost at least 30 bucks the Cree bulb
costs twenty four and ninety seven not a
huge price drop but still if you're
doing a whole house worth of bulb you're
gonna like that it's five bucks cheaper
per bulb so what exactly does par38
stand for well par stands for parabolic
aluminized reflector and all that means
is that the diode sits right above this
metal bowl type thing that reflects all
the light going down back up and that
shoots all the light forward focuses it
it's the same technology you'll see in a
car's headlight so you see all the light
goes forward but none of its shooting
back towards my face as for the 38 that
just refers to the diameter of the bulb
which is 38 eighths of an inch or about
four point seven five inches like the
Cree bulbs that came before it this LED
has a 10 year warranty attached to it
which we think is a pretty good deal
it's also rated for wetness as well as
dampness and that means that Cree claims
it can stand up to rain and not just
humidity so if you're using this light
outdoors it should be fine it should do
very well in those settings the par38
LED comes available with a 47 degree
beam angle or a 27 degree beam angle
it's a little tighter it's more like a
spotlight and it shines at a yellowy
color temperature of 3,000 degrees
Kelvin thanks for watching I'm seeing
that's right Crist and this has been a
first take of the cree par38 LED
