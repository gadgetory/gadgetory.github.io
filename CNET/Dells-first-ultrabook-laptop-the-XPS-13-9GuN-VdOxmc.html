what do we have we're going to go kind
of in order looks like you've got three
and Scott's got 3 i'm going to start a
fee with the dell XPS 13 now del was of
course a little late to the Ultrabook
party they took their time but they've
got a 13-inch system right here that's
part of that high-end XPS line you know
it's super thin it's not quite as super
fancy of some of the other ones but
that's because it sort of meant to be
that consumer business hybrid crossover
system where you can get it and take it
home but you can also ask your IT
department together because they have an
IT version with like a TPM chip and
other stuff like that and it's got the
rubberized bottom if you feel that
that's kind of cool yeah that's nice and
it's super thin and what I like is the
footprint it's a little bit smaller than
some of the other 13 inch ultrabook it's
closer to what you'd find a 12 inch
screen system in so so it's a little bit
it's a little bit more petite and still
super thick I gotta say too right off
the back I am really struck by the
similarity to the macbook air they're
just really they're not even pretending
not to be making a macbook air clone it
really looks like it and frankly I
consider that a plus I think everyone
stop pretending and the last couple my
connection okay fine here it is and what
they title mean it's you know it's the
perfect size perfect shape get it done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
