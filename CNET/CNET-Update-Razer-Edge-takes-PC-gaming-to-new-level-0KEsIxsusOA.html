I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update the review is in for the razor
edge gaming tablet it's one of the most
inventive PC gaming devices we've seen
in years it's a Windows 8 tablet that
has the graphics processor of a gaming
laptop and there are several accessories
to buy that transform this tablet
there's a snap on gamepad controller for
gaming on the go a dock with HDMI out
and extra USB ports to connect it to
your TV and the company is also coming
out with a keyboard accessory to make it
more of a laptop but all those
accessories that make it unique will
cost you the tablet itself starts at a
thousand dollars and you'll be adding on
the two hundred and fifty dollar gamepad
case that's a lot to pay when you
consider that it doesn't have the top
end performance that you find in
high-end gaming PC's you're paying for
the unique ability to make it portable
it's also worth noting that the battery
life runs short when you're gaming and
it's heavier than other windows 8
tablets but this could be the first in a
new category of products for mobile pc
gaming you can check out the full review
and a breakdown of the specs at cnet com
google has been busy this week with
upgrades to several of its products for
one google maps will show more live
transit info users can see several
subway and bus departure times in new
york and salt lake city and there are
service alerts for Washington DC's metro
rail Google Maps now has transit info
for 25 countries around the world but
Apple has yet to add any public transit
info to its Maps up even Microsoft's
Bing has public transit directions the
google play movies and TV app for
android it now shows information about
scenes you're watching like data on
actors and what song this plane in the
credits amazon is also doing the same
thing on its video player for the wii u
and kindle fire it's called x-ray and it
gives viewers instant access to the bios
of the actors that are appearing in the
senior watching google is also starting
to test a same-day delivery service for
online shopping called Google Shopping
Express it's only for San Francisco
residents right now but the idea is that
you would shop from one website to buy
items from many
taylor's like target walgreens toys r us
and even some food stores and then
Google will deliver the items to you for
the same day for free iPhone and iPad
users can relive the days of the
Tamagotchi now with a free tamagotchi
life app it's the same as the old-school
toy that let you take care of a 16-bit
virtual pet but the app adds color and
more features like being able to share
details about your pet on Facebook the
app first came out on Android devices on
Valentine's Day and has racked up more
than 600,000 downloads that's your tech
news update you can find more details at
