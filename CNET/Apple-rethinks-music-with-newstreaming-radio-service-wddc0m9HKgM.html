the best music player we have ever done
the first thing you'll notice is we
provide you with beautiful artist images
right in your library you just tap an
artist and you see the Sun but it's not
just the songs on your device you see
all of your purchase music from iCloud
right in your library and if you want to
hear one of the songs you just tap and
you get our beautiful now playing screen
but it's not just your purchase music in
the video apps you get all of your
movies and TV shows right for my cloud
right in your library it's really really
great
you turn the device sideways you see
your albums you can just swipe to see
more and once you see when you like you
tap and zooms right in now the music app
is the best way to listen to your music
but today we're introducing an amazing
way to discover new music and we call it
iTunes radio
and here's what it looks like it's built
right into the music app but rather than
tell you about it I'd love to show it to
you and will launch the music app and
the first thing you'll notice is we've
got a set of featured stations that our
programming team have created so you can
see the songs that are trending on
Twitter right now or even the songs that
you guys are all going to hear this week
at WWDC but I feel like summer songs so
you just tap and once you have a station
you love you can just tap the eye and
you could share it with a friend or even
create a new station based on this
artist or song i can easily skip to the
see what's the next song
I'll go back to stations but it's not
just the featured stations that we
provide you can create your own stations
here are some that i've previously
created what i feel like doing something
new now our music team is providing you
with hundreds of stations based on
alternative country classic rock but i
feel like doing something a little more
specific how about some Led Zeppelin
so it starts off with a great Led
Zeppelin song let's go ahead and see
what else is on this station and a great
thing is I can always modify the station
I can just tap the star and I can say
play more songs like this we're never
play their song or add it to my wish
list now I like this so let's play some
more songs like this now another great
feature of iTunes radio is it keeps
track of all the songs that you're
listening to across all the stations all
your devices and you can get to them by
just tapping history you can see them
all here you can preview and buy right
from there and that's iTunes radio
so iTunes radio is built into iOS 7 it
works on your iPhone your ipod touch and
your iPad it's also built into itunes on
your mac and pc and even in your living
room built into apple TV itunes radio is
free with ads and if you're an iTunes
Match subscriber it's completely ad-free
we're starting in the US and we'll be
adding other countries over time and
that's the new music app on iOS 7 it is
the best music player we have ever done
