to the Apple buy for all the good and
bad inside the world of Apple we've got
a few iPhone stories as usual and some
fun ones as well so let's get to it the
China Times says Apple's new backlight
component will only use one brightness
enhancement film instead of two that's
been used in the past now this could
reduce the size of the LCD and helped
rate the thinnest iPhone today but it
will allegedly also make manufacturing
more difficult and we've heard about
early manufacturing constraints and
reports also the latest from digit Times
says that Samsung has received orders
from Apple to be the first to start
manufacturing they're a nine processor
using its 14 nanometer process with
volume production set to ramp up in the
next year now Intel and tsmc have also
been named as potential partners but
we're still waiting for the a8 to make
it into this year's devices so the a9 is
still a long ways out and if you're not
blown away with the progress of Siri
you're not the only one
a report from Wired says the big a is
now forming its own in-house speech
recognition team to power the next gen
Siri
iOS 8 will still run the current
evolution with additions like saying hey
Siri at any time which means she's
listening all the time and built-in
Shazam song recognition maybe they're
finally working on my day 1 complaints
because it still hasn't made any major
improvements with its speed or accuracy
and since I'm not in the best of moods
we can talk about Apple killing aperture
it was a product that never really truly
caught on with professionals maybe
because it's last update was in 2011
that probably had something to do with
it now Apple mentioned their new Photos
app at WWDC and it looks to replace it
allowing you to import your aperture
libraries and maybe third-party
extensions really seems like the most
exciting edition but photos isn't only
replacing aperture it's also going to
replace iPhoto so it's basically an
iPhoto Pro and we saw how that worked
out for Final Cut Pro X out of the gates
I might take this back when I see it but
right now this smells like a bad apple
all right on to the quick bites Apple
adds a ton of new partners from the Fiat
Chrysler Group for carplay support
including Chrysler Dodge Fiat Jeep Ram &amp;amp;
Alfa Romeo Mazda is also on board as
well and Apple refresh the iPod line
with a new introductory level iPod Touch
this week in the US and internationally
starting at the lower price of $1.99 for
a 16gb model previously it was priced at
229 but there's no major hardware
upgrade here and the big a has launched
their back-to-school promo for qualified
education purchases with a $100 Apple
Store gift card with the purchase of a
Mac or a 50 dollar card with the
purchase of an iPad or iPhone on top of
your education discount now Apple
continues to promote that you could
really do anything with your phone and I
believe it after two new products have
been launched
now this one's for the ladies and some
of you gents I give you ringly it's a
high-tech smart ring that can notify
users of incoming messages notifications
and phone calls you can even set
different vibration patterns for
different notifications it's an 18 karat
gold ring with the semi-precious stone
and a battery life of roughly three days
with a presale campaign starting at one
hundred and forty five dollars a pop and
even cooler the marble Kickstarter has
been funded for the world's lightest
skateboard that lets you control it with
an iOS app it can hit speeds of up to 20
miles per hour it can travel 10 miles in
a single charge as well this thing
weighs 9 pounds and I'm keeping my eye
on it because it says chick magnet all
over it seriously
alright that's gonna do it for this
week's show we're working on and ask me
anything show so all you have to do is
send us your emails to the Apple bite at
cnet.com or tweet me at Brian Tong and
