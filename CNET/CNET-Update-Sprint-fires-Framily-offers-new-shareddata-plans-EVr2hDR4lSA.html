starting to act like cable plans I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update Sprint is making changes to its
plans to better compete in the wireless
world Sprint is killing the poorly named
framley plan and replacing it with its
first-ever family share plan they call
it the family share pack it works like
other family share plans we're a family
gets unlimited texting and calling but
they all share from the same bucket of
data the key is that sprint gives twice
as much data for the same price as the
other networks for new customers Sprint
is also tossing in tons of promotions
but it can be a little confusing so I'll
break it down for you if you switch
sprint will pay your cancellation fees
up to three hundred and fifty dollars
per line which is what t-mobile also
offers there are several data packages
to pick from on the low end twenty-five
dollars a month against you two gigs of
data but no matter what package you pick
you'll also have to pay a fee for each
device you use and the fees are
different if you have a two-year
contract or financing plan or if it's a
tablet but if you're a new customer
buying a phone with a financing plan and
you go for the hundred-dollar monthly
package with 20 gigs of data the device
fees are waived and for every member of
the family Sprint will throw in an extra
2 gigs of data as a bonus but there are
catches you can't get the fees waived
with a traditional two-year contract and
all these waive fees and discounts go
away in 2015 so now your cell phone bill
is becoming like a cable bill after the
promotional period surprise you have new
fees and your bill just went up not all
tech stories today are this complicated
in fact Roku is making things easier by
putting its much-loved streaming box
technology inside new televisions soon
you can order Roku smart TVs made by TCL
in four sizes starting at two hundred
and thirty dollars for the 32 inch model
there are also some coming out in
September made by hisense now after
spending a little time with these Roku
TVs our editors say that the interface
is easier to use than the Smart TVs you
see by Samsung LG and Vizio not to
mention these Roku TVs are priced
cheaper HD
see just debuted the HTC One m8 for
Windows the HTC One m8 is one of the top
Android smartphones out there but now it
comes in a Windows flavor with the exact
same hardware specs verizon is carrying
it for a hundred dollars with a two-year
contract but if you buy that Windows
Phone you will not be one of the first
to play the sequel to flappy bird the
creator of the viral game flappy bird is
releasing another app called swing
copters which lands on the Android and
Apple App Store's this Thursday just
like before you tap to fly and avoid
obstacles and if we're lucky it's
probably just as annoying to play that
you're seen at tech news update from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
