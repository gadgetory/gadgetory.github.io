cnet.com and I'm going to give you a
quick video tour of the Harmony ultimate
logitech's new line topping programmable
universal remote which is designed for
folks with components hidden away in
cabinets and closets in many ways the
ultimate is a dream remote adding RF and
Bluetooth capabilities to last year's IR
based Harmony touch remote either RF or
Bluetooth require line-of-sight like IR
so your remote commands can literally
pass through walls and doors
the ultimate looks identical to the
touch except for a small but important
design change to the bottom of the
remote that improves its ergonomics a
hump that pushes your hand forward make
it easier to access the transport
controls at the top of the remote when
key difference between the two products
is the addition of the Harmony hub an
accessory that lives near your TV and
serves as an IR blaster and Bluetooth
link between the ps3 and Nintendo Wii
and Wii U game consoles also the 2.4
inch touchscreen display on the ultimate
adds vibration to you back so you know
it received your touch screen commands
and finally the ultimate has tilt sensor
so it wakes up upon being picked up and
you can program buttons for both short
and long presses doubling the available
functions in addition to Bluetooth the
hub also features integrated Wi-Fi so
you can now update your Harmony settings
on a computer and sync them wirelessly
with your remote that's nice it also
allows you to use any iOS or Android
device to control your system via the
Logitech smart phone app note while the
app can be used with tablets it's really
a smart phone app even with the new
features the ultimate may still face
resistance from those who dislike the
fundamental changes introduced in the
Harmony touch the aforementioned
transport controls still don't fall
right under the thumb and the
touchscreen isn't as responsible or
nearly as crisp as the screens you'll
find in today's smartphones and tablets
and some little things are missing for
instance seen an editor David cast
matter lamented the fact that there's no
dedicated hard button for thirty second
commercial skips when you're using your
DVR a feature that's found on the
entry-level
Harmonie 650 but the ultimate does have
loads of customization options so you
can assign that function to another
button perhaps one of the four colored
ones at the bottom I think the ultimate
still has some economic issues in using
the touchscreen to input channel numbers
and perform other commands will appeal
to some folks more than others overall
however the ultimate is a significant
improvement over the touch in my case
after a couple of hours of tinkering
with my setup on my harmony comm it
worked well with my home theater rig
which is all but two of its ten
components tucked away in a closet a
small part of that improvement is due to
the tweaks Logitech is made to the
remote itself but the addition of RF
simply makes the remote work more
smoothly and responsibly with your
equipment I don't have time to dig into
all as features but it's worth noting
that the ultimate which is a built-in
rechargeable battery can control up to
15 components and is geared to those
with higher-end home theater setups it
comes with two of these IR blasters to
cover your equipment while the Harmony
smart control which controls up to eight
components includes only one the smart
control package also includes the
Harmony hub but instead of the
touchscreen remote it bundles in a new
very basic Harmony remote with no
display it's sleek and lightweight and
operates on a single battery for months
or even years depending on how much you
watch TV the smart control offers all
the features of the ultimate RF control
bluetooth communications and the
capacity to turn your iOS and Android
device into a remote using the Harmony
smart app and those with the little
simpler setups it's clearly the better
deal at $129.99 vs. 349 99 for the
ultimate at that price point the
ultimate is pretty pricey but then again
the fancy RF Wi-Fi tablet style remote
setups offered by custom and sellers can
end up easily costing triple that I'm
David Carr noise and that's the Logitech
Harmony ultimate programmable universal
remote thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
