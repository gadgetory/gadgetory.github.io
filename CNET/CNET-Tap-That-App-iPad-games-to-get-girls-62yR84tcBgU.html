song and this is the show we cover the
hottest apps in the mobile space and we
showcase a lot of games and apps really
the best way to use technology is with
the ladies so we're going to show you
the best ipad games that will help you
get girls based on my extensive research
now forget about violent games like
infinity blade or gun brothers girls
don't care and please don't say angry
birds are fruit ninja those games are
played out and trust me you got to be
different from those other nerds so
here's my favorite ipad games to get the
girl now first up is harbor master HD
and it's absolutely free just ask the
girl if she likes water do you like
water what water here let me show you
then bust out the game and all you do is
send purple boats to the purple docks
and orange boats the orange docks by
drawing pass with your fingers you'll
need to move boats in and out of the
docks and it gets good when the game
gets hectic and trust me you'll be multi
touching in no time now remember it's
free and the best date guys is the one
that doesn't hurt your wallet now if you
really want to get your game on with the
ladies check out what's the difference
it'll cost you a chicken may not get
happy meal at 399 but this is the
classic game where you work as a team to
spot the differences between two
pictures side by side you'll be saying
things to each other like oh you good at
this anymore ooh nice move very nice and
best of all you can sure that you're a
guy who knows how to use his head 'yeah
and my final recommendation little
things I know I know don't let the name
discourage you it's 299 and it's an
innovative seek and fine game you'll
work together to find items in a
colorful collage of cute icons it's a
game that more than two people can play
and you know the same the more the
merrier but trust me when I tell you
it's a good thing when a girl ass can i
play with your little things so there
you go fellas three games you haven't
really heard of to break the ice with
that special someone and what's the
trend having fun working together and my
friends the rest is up to you now if you
have any other apps you think are worthy
to be here that we missed send
to tap that a patina calm i'm brian Tong
thanks for watching and we'll see you
guys next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
