welcome to tomorrow daily these best
geek talk show in the known universe are
you ready for some rapid-fire headlines
let's do this
all right the EPFL is developing a
technology that can be stretchable
potentially bio skin in the future
flexible electronics have been popping
up here and there in screens and other
devices that we've seen but this is
expandable circuitry that can still
function after being stretched up to
four times its original length a liquid
metal combo of gold and gallium makes
this concept possible with the gold
keeping the gallium from separating into
droplets and the gallium conducting the
electricity the material can be
stretched twisted and folded and still
send currents properly potential uses
for the technology include prosthetic
skin where you get your feeling back in
your hand if you lose it kind of amazing
and also robot skin that's awesome but I
feel like it's gonna expensive because
it's made of gold you literally have
gold skin gold nerves that's kind of
you'd have gold and gallium nerves
amazing stuff but I want to see how they
sort of develop that sure and now for
something completely different this is
the Venter Garten marble machine from
Swedish musician Martin Mullen it's a
humongous music box that's played with
2,000 marbles yes there are multiple
instruments on board including a
vibraphone a bass kick drum a cymbal and
more they activate as the marbles move
through the machine all 3,000 parts had
to be designed and built from scratch
taking a year and a half to complete his
process is documented pretty thoroughly
on YouTube - so you can check it out and
see how the machine was made can't tour
with this thing though it's too big and
intricate looks very fragile - but it's
amazing yes pretty incredible stuff I
just saw this and it brought me so much
joy described seeing stuff like this get
built did this guy lose his marbles no
they're all innovate they're all inside
they're all inside his music box
never lose them what story do you wanna
talk about on Thursday I think it would
be fun to talk more about this music box
see how it was made a little bit and
maybe talk more about how instruments
future instruments if you guys have any
future instruments you want to see us go
look for in research you can use the
hashtag hay TV yeah that's how you shot
at us on social media if you say
something fun cool and interesting well
incorporate it into our discussion on
Thursday when we deep dive into these
stories indeed we will and with that
being said let's check out our photogra
