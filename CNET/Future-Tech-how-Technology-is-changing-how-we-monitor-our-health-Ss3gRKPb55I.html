at stage at CES 2017 I'm Lindsay
Turrentine editor-in-chief of cnet com
and for the next few minutes we're going
to focus on what the future holds for
the intersection of Technology and
health discussing this growing field
with experts from pharmaceutical
companies and device makers and
insurance providers so joining me now to
talk about meds and tech and insurance
are two luminaries we've got busy bar
vice president of innovation and head of
Humana health ventures and doctors
should be in a loop senior vice
president of medical and regulatory
affairs at bearing ER ingelheim which I
think I got correct okay thank you so
much for coming and I wanted to start I
think what we the interesting thing that
we have to talk about here is how
technology can help us reach patients
and people who might otherwise be under
served in the medical world and Sabina I
know that you have a lot of interest in
reaching people who might not be part of
a conversation about developing
pharmaceuticals and why don't you talk a
little bit about how you think about
technology and what it does now and what
it could do to reach people who are
otherwise underserved thanks for thanks
for your question so my team is working
on developing new medicines as well as
taking care of those who are on the
market and help and support patients now
when I think about clinical development
of new drugs and what digital and
technical innovation could do we are
using it already but the future could
bring much much more we basically can
bring Crillon clinical trials to the
patients at the moment the patients need
to come to us they need to come to their
doctors they need to find an opportunity
and yes there are information offerings
but if you're really better enabled
using electronic healthcare records and
other systems to fight the right
patients and right physicians for the
right trials be able to get more
diversity into those patient groups you
work with and then work with they're
much closer from identifying them
getting their data in giving them
feedback getting more data
I think that can in the future really
help making drug development more
touchable for the community and
hopefully also faster and a little bit
simpler so does that mean that there may
be people who otherwise you know a
typical drug trial would be possibly
near where you are physically in a
certain urban environment this means we
can get more rural participants we could
get participants from different
backgrounds and ethnicities and how does
it how would technology help make that
faster it would help make it faster in
identifying them earlier and it would
make it faster because at the moment you
collect data once a patient then visits
a doctor for a predefined visit if with
technology from variables to what you
can could see in the future and smart
homes could get a more more fluent and
fluid data transfer you might be able to
learn much more yes you have you
predefined measurement points but you
can get much more information and
depending on the therapeutic area
sometimes when it's also about behavior
what you're interested in for example
you can get much faster much more so in
other words you might get information
about how somebody is sleeping or how
they're eating without having to ask
them I just say how much they move right
yet you can get data and you can get
data from in the home that has its data
that's not typical that you would see in
a clinicians office and so that helps
research because you can get data in
context about what's actually happening
we think about it at Humana about being
able to have ways for our seniors to be
able to stay in the home because we can
have more monitors more ways of allowing
them to interventions before something
bad happens and they end up in the
hospital so you think that there is
technology that will be available to
consumers that will help them talk to
say their families about their personal
health but then also to their insurance
providers at the same time or do you see
that this is still sort of fragmented
what are the challenges around getting
into people's homes and getting that
data for you as an insurance provider
right now so we while we are an
insurance provider we actually are a
very health focused company we're very
consumer focused and
or consumer-facing company and many of
our members are where Medicare Advantage
providers or our members are senior
citizens and living in the home and we
want them to be in the home for as long
as possible so in order for that to
happen we can provide more kinds of
tools for them to be able to have more
smart monitoring kinds of devices not
just in their home but on their person
that the downside of that and I think
we're at a tech conference we all love
technology here that's why we're here
the downside of that is that we don't
want to become so overly reliant on
these little tech devices in the home to
take care of mom and grandma that we
forget that actually health is driven by
human connection and by voice and by
touch and and if we if we get too
reliant on technology as the solve we're
going to miss the whole point of what
health is about which is about heart and
empathy and love and connection do you
think and they're all kinds of strange
to the show right that people need
physical touch for instance to feel
healthy do you think that there's a
there's a role either one of you for for
bringing for this personal technology
for data collection and monitoring to
get people to make that human connection
more often I mean we talk a lot about VR
headsets the work that Facebook is doing
with oculus and you can see that not
that far down the road they're probably
thinking about how we have a virtual
human experience as ironic as that
sounds is that something that you think
about that sends it could make it more
often but more importantly it could lead
to this interaction at the right point
in time but often the question is when
is the right point in time when does
someone need support and to better find
that moment in time that valuable moment
I think that's that's where a lot of
opportunity lies another challenge I
think in addition to that you really
need to Intel as human beings i think is
especially from our perspective how
valid are the dead are you collect right
how good is the quality and there are a
lot of regulatory aspects which they
need to be taken into consideration
because in the end if you develop a new
medicine or if you have a medicine on
the market the data you collect need to
pass a certain standard and you need to
be really able to rely on it so that
they find regulatory acceptance and it
isn't just about data data is something
that you need for research it's
something that we all need but it's what
you do with that data and how you create
personalized interactions we were just
talking about how data and analytics are
great but we actually don't want to give
information to people we want to give
going to communicate with them we want
to find ways to communicate with them in
personalized ways and so that means
really understanding how they want to be
communicated with and what kind of
intervention they need so the data is
fabulous and it's the first step but it
actually isn't the solution have you
seen an implementation of technology in
the home that you think is particularly
compelling when it comes to having this
kind of human augmented or additive
human experience you want talk about
yeah I mean I think when you talk about
in the home the question is what you
mean do you mean the variable do you
mean something which you can attach to a
device for example to like like we are
having a partnership with propeller
health where you can add a device to an
inhaler that that's in a kind of the
first stages so so what technology are
you talking about that that's kind of
the question so there are first examples
but in the end how do you link
everything together you need to connect
the patient the provider the insurance
company or the health system in order to
really get to meaningful information in
the end and have something to talk about
and learn from and sometimes it isn't
just the home sometimes it's a device
that's smarter and it can be mobile you
know a Livan go some of you guys are
probably familiar with LaVon go which is
a smart glucose meter which has
intervention it goes its data goes to
the cloud it has intervention and
coaching built right in so it can engage
and communicate with our members and in
a way that they want to be engaged with
at the time that matters the most so it
isn't so much plopping a robot or a
device in the home it's what solution
are you trying to provide for and what's
most personalized and how do you do it
in a human way so that doesn't seem like
nagging it's so or or creepy right like
this thing is watching me like
no because you know we were we were
talking earlier with I was starting with
some colleagues and that sometimes we
think about monitoring the home is this
way that we can help keep you know
grandma and grannies safe and it makes
us feel great like Oh phew I don't have
to worry about grandma granny but really
it may be that that isn't the best solve
for Grandma it may not be the right
answer might make us feel better but it
may not be the thing that makes grandma
feel better she wants to get out of the
home she wants to get out she wants to
engage she wants to be with people and
the kinds of kinds of smart home devices
that can be there that can help her
remember to go to an appointment things
that can help her not feel nervous if
she's running late those kinds of things
are going to help her stay engaged
outside of the home there is there's so
much promise in this and thank you so
much to both of you for coming to talk
about it we're going to take a short
break and we're going to bring back
three more experts working in this space
and we're going to continue to talk
about how we get the numbers and the
information that matters thank you very
much
hi I'm Lindsey turn time with Cena and
we are back to continue our conversation
about health and technology in the home
joining me now are Colin Lawler CEO of
ResMed and consumers sleep dr. ted smith
of revonnah CEO and Rick Valencia the
president of Qualcomm life and and we
have a lot to talk about in a short
period of time let's talk about how
really technically and what's talking
about the technology behind gathering
the data that we were talking about
earlier in this segment there's so much
exciting development going on right now
in both treating people at home and
getting the information that we need to
treat them and I want to start with you
and talk about Qualcomm a little bit and
then really exciting work you're doing
with x prize and the tricorder I know
you're looking way into the future how
do you think about accurately gathering
data that's actionable you bet so what
we're doing is we're we've been focused
on building the Internet of medical
things where we see every time in the
very near future where to manage a
patient's care better we're going to
need to manage it continuously in the
hospital in the home and everywhere in
between so we've been building this
network that helps us capture this data
from patients wherever they happen to be
makes the devices that they use to
manage typically a chronic condition or
maybe they've recently been discharged
from the hospital and they're in a
sensitive period we want to help their
caregivers better manage their care and
so we've worked with medical device
manufacturers of all sorts plus
pharmaceutical companies plus provider
organizations to get these devices not
only connected but also working
interoperable they weren't really
designed to work together and typically
a patient with a chronic condition isn't
using just one specific device in an
island there they're working with
multiple medical devices and they need
to work together and they need to send a
single stream of data that's meaningful
to a doctor's so that's what we're
primarily focused on and our partners
are typically the the service companies
that deliver on the
care and they're the ones that we
deliver up the data in a meaningful way
and they're the ones that present it to
the patient so so the patient can act on
that data without having to worry about
multiple screens multiple logins
multiple issues that they have to do
with so you're talking about for
instance somebody who's diabetic and
having their their blood monitor and
their insulin pump talk to each other
and then integrate that data in a
meaningful way exactly so that so that
when they get information it's not a
flood that they have to sift through
exactly right and they may also have a
CPAP at home and so and typically there
are these patients sleep isn't isn't in
isolation they have sleep issues because
of a chronic condition or they may have
a chronic condition because of their
sleep issues so having that data having
it come together in one stream and
having our our partners very quickly
able to connect with these other
companies and their medical devices and
that stream of data is what Qualcomm is
all about that's what we call the
Internet of medical things getting all
these devices connected so the doctors
can manage their patients wherever they
happen to be not necessarily just in the
hospital or in the doctors make sense so
calling you CPAP came up you're working
on you tell us a little bit about what
you're doing and you're working on on
the intersection of that information and
and products that actually help you
sleep better absolutely absolutely so
sleeps a huge issue a huge health issue
and it's connected to almost every
significant chronic disease and the
great thing about technology is we have
more and more potential to measure
asleep and understand it but up until
now it really hasn't been good enough in
terms of the accuracy and we think that
that's the key issue that's available
this year and what why we decided to
announce the launch with dr. oz and
Pegasus of sleep score labs so we've
developed a technology which is truly
reliable and precise that enables you to
objectively understand your own sleep
but we can also use that to help
companies in the 58th billion dollar
sleep aids market evaluate which
products work and which ones don't and
there's a whole gap in that area and
we're setting out to make a big
difference but at the heart of it it's
not just data it's about accurate data
because in the system we've all
generated a lot of data for the last
number
years but particularly in sleep
inaccurate data is a big problem and
that's something that we need to do a
lot about so we're delighted to announce
that today I've heard I went as I've
been talking to all of you backstage
there's been at this actually an
undercurrent of concern about inaccurate
data its head this is something you
probably think about a lot based on what
you do once you explain a little bit
about what you're thinking about as
you're designing apps to help streamline
this sure so r Yvonne systems is very
much focused on helping us all make that
shift from sort of fitness sort of
lighter weight understandings of health
and well-being which are great in those
categories but are different than your
experience at the hospital they're
different than having clinically
valuable information that can really
change how long you live either the
quality of your productive years right
these are serious matters and they
really do require a little more rigor a
little better data and so r Yvonne is
very very much focused on how can we
establish the quid pro quo for those
patients because everybody has the great
idea that people should just donate
their data to a clinical trial or donate
their date I mean guess what everybody
else everybody has something else to do
today than that so we're focused on to
help get something back after we give
away our information so if I give away
my blood sugar I get something out of it
is a quid pro quo I mean quit if I'm not
delivering some value immediately to the
patient in our case we develop machine
learning algorithms to help them
determine how serious their symptoms are
when they're short of breath and you
know that's actually helping them it's
helping us because they're contributing
those data insights we're getting high
quality data but we're in return handing
them actionable information relieving
anxiety the kinds of things that you're
excited about when you talk about smart
homes like oh my life is better for this
stuff we need to do that in health care
like we don't need to study people on a
petri dish we need to help them have
better lives and I think we're all
committed to that case everybody kind of
complain a little bit about the accuracy
of the data that we collect through
consumer devices Rick how far out do you
think we are from from getting up Saul
having wearables or sensors in our homes
like in our beds that are that are you
know ready
we have them today it's really a matter
of how we integrate them and how we
treat that data once we receive it now
there are different levels of quality
certain devices were made as consumer
devices and they weren't intended to be
real medical devices but medical grade
quality devices is what this group here
is primarily focused on and yeah it's
the probably the biggest challenge is
patient Association making sure you know
that it came from a very specific
patient because the doctor is not going
to be willing to act and tell that
person to do anything differently unless
they're absolutely certain that in
context what is that what is that person
doing when that reading is being taken
but in terms of data accuracy I think
the the really big challenge beyond
those two is it once the data is
received how do you treat that how do
you what do you run that data against
the algorithms that come in and give you
an actionable insight as a clinician
providing care or as a patient who can
take that on themselves it's manageable
and and and I don't think it's an issue
of the technology's not there I think
it's a matter of again how we integrate
that that technology and and make that
data more meaningful not through the
next generation of technology but
through through insights that we have
already today I think we have clearly
two major challenges it's true that some
data is very reliable generally speaking
if you have a blood pressure monitor or
glucose monitor the data from that's
reliable and generally if you're active
and you're using a device to help you
count your steps that's reliable but
there's a lot of other areas where the
data isn't reliable and sleep is
obviously something we are greatly
concerned about we see the Delta between
devices which are poor and devices which
are good overestimates people sleep by
between an hour and an hour and a half
that's the difference between you've got
chronic insomnia or you're perfectly
normal and that's not good enough so we
think you've got to do both so we've set
out to solve the accuracy problem first
but we've also coupled it with
sophisticated personalized coaching
engines to help people to know what to
do with the
what changes in their lifestyle what
changes in their activity and their
daily lives can help improve it and I
think both are important and
particularly when we're talking about
serious issues we've really got to make
sure that the data is robust sleep score
labs is about doing that just about a
minute left but I want to ask each of
you I would maybe dead how far out do
you think we are in terms of this is
it's a hard question but how many years
until most people feel like they trust
the devices that they're using in their
home and that they are hot that they
keep with it because we know that when
people have trackers they use different
devices they often just ditch it how
long do you think it's gonna take well I
mean here so I'm not going to answer
your question with the number because
this is being recorded but the I think
the inflection point has been the shift
towards your device is completely
passive right it sits on the nightstand
so I didn't ask you to strap anything on
remember to charge it all that you know
you guys revolutionize the industry with
a lot of passive bluetooth just
siphoning and sucking the data right and
and that's the change so when I had used
my Amazon echo at home I'm delighted
that I don't have to do anything right
and that as that continues I think
you're going to see the healthcare use
cases materialized immediately because
the friction is in all the stuff the way
it was originally conceived but we all
know people don't want to have extra
stuff really they don't want to think
about it set it forget it that's really
where we're going so we're here today we
just haven't caught up with the vendor
community that's making this stuff if
you think about even your phone when you
think of your phone as technology
usually it's because it's the problem
it's it's an experience that you're
really looking for in that phone and
everything else you do and in health
care the same things so i'll go back to
a point you made earlier and that is i
think we'll get there when the payoff is
big enough and the path unfortunately
isn't big enough today to tell a patient
that if you keep doing what you're doing
you're going to die sooner and a
not-so-good death it's got to be more
media and it could be in the form of an
experience but it could be in the form
of cash we have a program with united
healthcare where people can learn $1,500
a year towards their health costs if
they're just active
that's great we're gonna have to wrap it
up I could talk about this for a very
long time so I'm sorry that we have to
say goodbye but thank you so much for
joining us here and and thank you to all
of our guests on this panel still much
more to come here on the scene at stage
live in Las Vegas next up we are going
to have a lot more exciting programming
including nvidia who's here down thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
