best phones money can buy and now that
may seem like some really strong words
but I think I can make a pretty good
case for it let's start by taking a look
at the dis display it's a six point
three nine inch AMOLED screen it's
really really bright and it's pin sharp
this thing looks brilliant when you're
playing those high-definition games full
of colors that pop and sear out your
retinas in a horrible way it's also an
absolute powerhouse of the phone it's
got qualies latest caring 980 processor
inside but as an octa-core beast and it
means that this thing can absolutely
munch through anything you're likely to
throw at it from photo editing to gaming
video streaming any of that and actually
just swiping around the interface is
really really buttery smooth so it's
actually a nice phone to use but of
course it's a high-end phone you'd
expect a good screen and plenty of power
but it's the extras that make this phone
that bit more exciting there starts with
the in screen fingerprint scanner which
is exactly what it sounds like built
into the display is a fingerprint
scanner now you can't see this when the
display is in use it just looks like any
other phone around let's just unlock it
and you can just see that there's
nothing here it's just a regular phone
regular screen but somehow underneath
that display is a fingerprint scanner
and it works exactly like any other
fingerprint scanner you have used on
previous Android phones on the iPhone
it's secure enough that you can use it
with Android pay and if that isn't good
enough
there is also 3d face scanning just like
on the most recent iPhones it uses depth
mapping so you can't trick it with like
a print out picture of your own face
believe me I did try but that face
unlock might not be quite as secure as
the fingerprint scanner because at the
moment you can't use face unlock to
verify your bank account details nor can
you use it to make purchases in the
Google Play Store one of the other cool
new features that I really like about
this phone is with the wireless charging
now of course wireless charging is
anything new why am I talking about that
well this is a first phone that has
two-way wireless charging so what that
means is that if you've got another
phone let's say for example and
phone tan and this is running low on
power you can actually use the battery
power from the mate 20 to charge your
iPhone 10 just by putting them together
it's two-way wireless charging sending
the power from the mate 20 into the
iPhone 10 now they'll work with any foam
it supports the qi wireless charging
standard it could also mean that your
headphones if they charge using that
standard you can place those against the
phone give them a bit of a boost or just
give your friend an extra few cells of
juice if they're running low at the end
of a night now you probably noticed that
the back has this square camera unit now
that includes three cameras and a flash
three cameras we've got a standard wide
view we've got a zoomed in view which
can go up to five times zoom using both
optical and digital zooming without much
loss of quality but it's also got a
super wide angle view which gives this
huge field of view into the scene that
you're looking at it's a super wide that
I really liked using around London
that's of course you've got these big
wide cityscapes these tall buildings and
a standard camera view can't really
capture all of that very easily but with
the wide-angle view you suddenly get
this huge scene which really opens up
some different creative possibilities
when you're out shooting in the city
it's also got the same night mode that
we've seen before on highways p20 pro
now I said on that phone that it takes
the best nighttime shots I've ever seen
on a phone and the mate 20 pro is
absolutely no exception this thing is
killer at night it is brilliant so yeah
you can see that I am very impressed
with this phone but it's not completely
perfect my biggest gripe is that it
doesn't use micro SD cards to expand the
storage instead quawi has actually
launched its own proprietary storage and
it calls nano SD now these cars are
smaller than micro sd and it may well be
that in the future all phones use this
new storage standard the problem is is
at the moment you can't even buy those
cards so you can't expand the storage of
this phone until those cards become
available so you may as well see them
820 Pro right now as non expandable
that's not a big deal maybe because the
standard storage is 128 gigabytes so
we'll take quite a while for you to fill
this phone up competition in the elite
smartphone arena is certainly fierce
we've just seen the oneplus 60 and the
Google pixel 3 - brilliant phones but I
think the qua wait mate 20 Pro offers
some serious competition to both not
only is it packed with all of the top
tech you would expect a flagship phone
to have but it's got those cool new
features that actually makes it an
exciting phone to own and it's no reason
then that Huawei is the second biggest
smartphone manufacturer in the world but
what do you think of the may 20 pro is
this cool whatever color you call this
twilight midnight they've got a name for
it is that enough to catch your eye or
is your money going elsewhere do you
