back from CES now I got to talk to Shaq
and Kenny and Charles what a war he's
got a great team but it's a bad haircut
and San Francisco and even try out VR
porn which for the record was rated
pg-13 so let's get to the latest an
apple still doesn't have it streaming TV
service set up for the Apple TV but it's
shown interest in buying time warner's
assets after their CEO told investors he
would entertain a sale of the media
company according to the New York Post
now time water isn't even up for sale
yet but maybe Apple could work their
magic with the over 200 billion dollars
of cash they're sitting on Time Warner's
assets include networks like HBO TNT TBS
cartoon network CNN and more and that in
itself along with its disney-abc ties
could help lay down a foundation for the
service but up to this point talks with
Apple and the networks have been put on
hold with no TV service in sight apple
also released a new batch of beta
software updates across the board
recently normally these updates aren't
that big of a deal but iOS 9.3 brings
new major features like night shift that
uses your idevices clock and geolocation
to shift the colors on your display to
the warmer end of the spectrum it gets
rid of that bright blue light exposure
that can make it harder to sleep in you
all know what I'm talking about when
you're staying up late at night playing
on your iPad doing god knows what you
can keep your notes locked down with a
password or a fingerprint now the news
app has become more personalized to your
taste if you even use it and the health
app now displays activity for your
health metrics Plus Apple apps like
weather and settings and more get 3d
touch capability for better shortcuts
now they're only previewing it for iOS
9.3 in education but multiple users are
finally coming to iOS after being three
or four years too late now we have to
imagine this is coming to regular users
as well it really should be a no-brainer
now the TV OS 9.2 beta gets features
that should have come out when it
launched the biggest one the podcast app
has finally returned it's technically in
beta is
doesn't have Siri functionality but get
this the current app will not play any
video podcasts at the moment are you
kidding me that's still a bad apple
bluetooth keyboard support is finally
here the app switcher looks more like
what we've seen in iOS 9 and you can now
group apps into folders in the home
screen similar to what you can do on iOS
also watch OS 2.2 beta now allows a
single iphone to pair to multiple
watches and that has to be great for
that iphone's battery life but do not
fear you can always slap on there
amazingly horrible-looking battery case
on it now I can't give that thing enough
bad apples and trust me it looks even
worse in person alright a new report
from the commercial times in Taiwan
claims an early trial production run of
the Apple watch 2 is expected to start
as soon as the end of January it will be
manufactured by quanta who is also
responsible for the original Apple watch
rumors for the new watch include a
thinner body the FaceTime camera and a
Wi-Fi chip for more independence from
the iphone but still no GPS now look
I've actually gone back to my regular
watch until the Apple watch just does
more also reports that apple will be
getting rid of the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack on the next iPhone aren't
going away and it looks more and more
like it will happen 9to5 mac reports
apple is prototyping a new set of
bluetooth headphones with a chance of
launching them alongside the new iphone
7 the earphones are said to be
completely wireless and similar in
concept to the motorola hint or braggy
dash headphones apple's rumored wireless
earbuds are expected to include a noise
cancelling microphone system that will
also enable phone calls an Siri without
their current inline mic and remote
system it will be considered a premium
alternative and will include a carrying
case that doubles as a rechargeable
battery for the headphones in fact Apple
already registered the trademark for air
pods three months ago which is what the
new earbuds might be called crushing my
dreams of ever having apple earbuds that
might look something like this see I was
really hoping they'd make it happen all
right now I was in Las Vegas for cnet's
annual
Trek to CES but I didn't come away
empty-handed from there so here's one of
the gadgets that was worth checking out
at the show especially for macbook users
may not be the biggest product here at
CES but this is really one of the
hottest this is Griffin's break safe
magnetic USBC power cable try saying
that five times fast now what makes it
special right if you have something like
one of the new macbooks that's only USB
see you have a Chromebook pixel you want
that magsafe experience this cable gives
it to you you plug in 1 into the USB and
then if you have any pressure you might
trip over your cable it pops right off
and reconnects with magnets and prongs
this is going to be available sometime
in April for the price of 39 99 and when
you think of all the USBC compatible
products that we're expecting to see
moving forward this is going to be a big
thing and it's here at CES 2016 alright
that's going to do it for this week's
show you can email us at the Apple by to
cnet com or tweet me a brian Tong with
your final nostra Tongass questions for
next week's show thanks for watching
we'll catch you all next time for
another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
