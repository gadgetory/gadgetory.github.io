as improvements to a wide range of apps
I'd like to share some of the highlights
with you let's start with night shift so
studies have shown that exposure to blue
light in the evening can actually make
it harder for you to fall asleep at
night so night shift automatically
shifts the colors of the display to the
warmer end of the spectrum which may
help you sleep better at night so how
does that work
well when it's enabled night shift uses
your iOS devices clock as well as its
geolocation to know when it's sunset in
your location and then it automatically
shifts the color of that display to the
warmer end of the spectrum which reduces
the blue light which may help you sleep
better notes let's talk about notes
notes is actually one of the most used
apps on the platform it's used by
literally hundreds of millions of people
every day and customers are loving the
newly redesigned Notes app in iOS 9 well
today we're adding the ability to
further protect your most personal notes
with a passcode or fingerprint carplay
carplay is the safer smarter way to use
your iPhone in your car and with iOS 9.3
with that even more useful features to
carplay for instance your Apple music
experience gets better with new and for
you which provides songs artists albums
handpicked by experts as well as
selections based on your own preferences
and maps gets even better with the
nearby feature which allows you to find
gas parking restaurants and more with
just a tap of your finger so that's just
some of the highlights of iOS 9.3 we
think that's turned out really great and
it's gonna make the best mobile
experience even better and it's
available as a free update for all of
you today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
