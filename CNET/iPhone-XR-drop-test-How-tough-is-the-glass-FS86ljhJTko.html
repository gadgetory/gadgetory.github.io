look a lot like it's higher in siblings
but is it built as tough the screen is
made of the same glass as the iPhone 10s
which survived our previous drop test
but the screen on the 10r is bigger the
frame is made of aluminum not stainless
steel and the glass on the backside is
different too not to mention the camera
boom is more pronounced now does this
mean it will break faster and well
that's why we're here at the scene of
the crime I have a brand new yellow
iPhone 10 R that's ready to be put to
the test now before we begin let me get
this out of the way this is not a
scientific test but more of a real-world
drop test scenario which could happen to
you but results may vary so with that in
mind we're gonna start our first drop at
about hip height or pocket height where
most of these accidents happen and I'm
gonna drop it screen side down now just
bear in mind that it's the same type of
glass as the 10s so I'm personally not
expecting it to break let's see three
two one
now this was originally intended to be a
screen test but since it flipped and it
landed on the back first this is kind of
a back test as well and we're going to
take a look I'm going to let you guys
see the back which is what landed first
and I can already tell you that the
screen is okay but that's to be expected
because it bounced and it hit the screen
second now the back is bad the cameras
already cracked the side already has a
bunch of dents on this aluminum frame
the glass back itself is not broken but
I would argue that you'd be more upset
if your camera broke then the glass back
because now photos are definitely going
to be compromised
there appears to be just some scuffs on
the side but it's looking a lot worse
than what the 10s looked like after the
first drop but we're going to continue
our testing and I do want to test out
that screen so I'm gonna drop it again
this time with two hands making
absolutely sure that it's gonna land
screen side down but from the same hip
height three two one
well it definitely landed on the screen
all right I'm gonna let you guys look at
the screen first it did seem like it
landed twice on the screen there's some
scuff marks but I'm as I'm peeling it
off over here it seems to be more more
of the actual pavement than scuffs the
sides have a little bit more scuffs on
the front side but overall the front
glass performed really really well
considering it landed face first I am
going to have to keep going because
there's still a lot more damage that can
be done to this phone I'm gonna take it
now to about eye level to imitate what
happens when you are taking a photo from
about this height and your phone drops
so I'm going to actually drop it on the
side this is what we did with the 10s it
may not land on the side as you know
this phone is kind of weighted
differently but we're gonna see what
happens when I just let it freefall from
its side three two one so it looks like
this time it landed on the side and then
on the back
I'm gonna take a look at how the back is
looking I can tell you now the screen is
still fine pause the back looking the
back is still fine it's just the frame
that has more damage it looks pretty bad
at this point I'm not sure if it's
cement or it's just that it has more
scuff marks some of it is coming off but
it does look pretty bad the frame on
this phone at this point is really
really banged up I am trying to look for
any kind of damage on the actual glass
though and it's proving to be really
really hard but there is a tiny little
crack on the bottom corner of the back
glass over here it's pretty
insignificant but I have the feeling it
already compromised the back and I for
one don't think it's gonna survive
another drop let's take a look I'm gonna
drop it one more time from about eye
level five feet but this time I'm
actually gonna put it screen side down
which is what we did was a 10 s because
I was really wanting to break the screen
three-two-one
that really did not sound good I
honestly think we did break at this time
but let's take a look I gotta say that
this was a nearly perfect landing and
this is the fourth drop for this phone
so I'm gonna let you guys take a look I
don't want to look oh yeah that that's
the one that did it that's definitely
the one that did it this phone is broken
the screen is shattered from the top
it still works it's still in working
order but you would not want to put this
up to your ear there are shards of glass
literally falling off as I am touching
it so I'm not gonna touch it too much
now the back still looks pretty good
except for that little little scratch
that I had pointed out previously on the
bottom corner the aluminum frame however
is pretty banged up at this point
and obviously that shattered screen does
not look good now this is the same type
of glass that the 10s had on the screen
and that one didn't break so whether
that's because of the aluminum frame or
their larger screen size or just the way
that it landed we probably will never
know because again this is not a
scientific test but at least this screen
is cheaper to replace than the one on
the 10s now that said it did survive
three drops including one from eye level
so that in and of itself is pretty
impressive at least more impressive than
the phone
the iPhones of the past what is a bummer
though is that the lens on the camera
cracked on the first drop so for that
reason alone you should absolutely put a
case on this phone as soon as you get it
and of course do not try this at home
so go check out our full review of the
iPhone 10 our and our drop test of the
iPhone 10s on
calm so I broke the iPhone 10 are but
