enforcing and appliances and today we
are looking at another range this is the
Maytag M ETA t 720 D s one thing you'll
notice right away is that this is a
double oven range so we haven't tested a
lot of those yet but there are some
obvious advantages and disadvantages one
clear advantage that I like is that you
can cook different types of food at the
same time so if you have a casserole
going in the top oven you can have a
couple racks of brownies baking in the
bottom rather the disadvantage is that
you don't have the same oven capacity
that single oven ranges do so if you
want to make three racks of brownies
you're kind of limited so this oven
costs one thousand five hundred ninety
nine dollars at that price point I'd say
that this is a decent looking range at
best it has some nice design elements I
like the way the wrapped stainless steel
looks on the double doors but it has
some plastic key accents like on the
handles and on the knobs here that give
it a cheaper look
moving on to performance I broiled
burgers baked biscuits and boiled a ton
of water on the cooktop and it was kind
of hit or miss so for the large burner
boil test it was one of the fastest for
the small burner boil test it was one of
the slowest and for the broiled test it
was pretty middle-of-the-road it wasn't
the fastest and it wasn't the slowest as
far as features the two ovens are pretty
much it there aren't extra accessories
or special oven modes that would give
this model any special appeal so if
you're the kind of person who regularly
cooks different types of food in the
oven at the same time this could be a
fair choice although it is a little
limited in terms of design and features
I do like that the preheat times on the
upper oven are a couple of minutes
faster than on the lower ovens so if you
have one rack of food to cook it makes
sense to use the upper oven aside from
that there's not much else going for
this double oven electric range thanks
