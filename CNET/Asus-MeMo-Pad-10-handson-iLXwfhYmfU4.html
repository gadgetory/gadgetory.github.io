and this is the Asus memo pad smart ten
kind of a mouthful for what is really
kind of a 10 inch version of the nexus 7
asus has got chops in the tablet game in
android you know they make the
transformer pads they make the nexus 7
what this is is kind of a little in
between in the sense that it's a budget
tablet that's three hundred dollars that
really has the same guts as a nexus 7
you're talking about a 1.2 gigahertz
Tegra 3 processor 1 gig of ram and a
1280 x 800 screen now that resolution
matches what you get in the 7-inch Nexus
7 and you're paying one hundred dollars
more here it seems kind of like not that
great a deal you do get more battery
life here because it's a larger tablet
but you're not getting that much new
under the hood it runs Android 4.1
point2 but can't be upgraded up to 4.2
and in addition it does have a couple of
nice little bells and whistles if you
like hdmi if you like micro SD card
slots those are both included here and
those can be quite useful and those are
probably the reasons why you'd like this
most that and the idea that is a front
and rear facing camera 5 megapixel here
one point 2 megapixel in the front but
it doesn't really feel next-gen and
doesn't even really feel cutting-edge
current-gen I consider the fact that the
nexus 7 came out last summer and that
was a 199 tablet so you're dealing here
with something that comes out in March
2013 it's bigger and it is more
expensive you've got stuff out there
like the Nexus 10 which is a super high
resolution screen you've got iPads which
have retina displays I know that's not
something that Android users always like
to hear but there are other better
options in the Android landscape too and
this very plastic design here is really
not going to make you fall in love with
the form it kind of feels like last
year's tablet in this year's mode and
the savings are not as great as you'd
hope but then again it doesn't really do
anything that terribly it's just
probably not going to be ready to go on
board with where androids going next and
considering that we still a lot of 2013
left to go you might want to get
something that's a little
more future proof I'm Scott Stein and
that's a look at the Asus memo pad smart
