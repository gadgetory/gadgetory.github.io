we want to have the utmost control over
our heating and cooling system connected
thermostats can help with that you can
use them to adjust the temperature from
your phone whether you're just feeling a
little lazy at home on the couch or on
vacation thousands of miles away and a
smart thermostat like the nest 3.0 with
built-in sensors and a learning
algorithm that can adapt to your
schedule can find the most efficient way
to heat and cool your home without a lot
of management on your part
we were always planning to outfit the
CNET smart home with a smart thermostat
to actually because this 5,800 square
foot house has an upstairs and a
downstairs unit but deciding on the nest
was another story entirely you can go to
Home Depot or Lowe's today and snag an
app enabled model that's under a hundred
bucks so why did we go with nest it's a
combination of factors really it looks
awesome
it works incredibly well and the nest
brand now owned by Google offers a lot
of connectivity with other nest devices
as well as third party stuff like IFFT
whirlpool mercedes-benz and beyond but
it isn't an ideal solution mainly
because it doesn't come with a remote
temperature sensor like the home kit
compatible ecobee three yes you can sort
of work around that if you have the nest
protect smoking carbon monoxide detector
because it has a remote presence sensor
that knows when you're home or away but
it isn't exactly the same so while we're
starting out with a third generation
nest because it's the most well rounded
option available today we're keeping our
eyes open for other options and we'll
update the CNET smart home accordingly
be sure to check back in the coming
months as we do even more to turn this
house into a smart home we'll see you
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
