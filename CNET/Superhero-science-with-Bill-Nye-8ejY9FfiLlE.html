the world and you're a big fan of
science so I thought why not talk about
superhero science Yeah right
yes superhero science oh sure yeah let's
have some fun I wanted to talk about if
things are possible or plausible and
some of our favorite science fiction so
I wanted to start with an iconic you
can't do that that stores hammer you
can't do it are you empowered Thor flies
by spinning it around really fast
throwing it and hang it on for the ride
you have an intuitive sense of it when
you swing a bowling ball or a bucket of
water you can knock yourself over you're
converting this angular momentum to a
linear momentum
what about Wonder Woman's lasso it
compels people to tell the truth we know
that truth serums exist there's no
science elasto truth however maybe there
is when someone is caught in a lie
that's the verb we use right so if
you're caught in malaria of truth then
you've got to tell the truth when you're
caught and alive and you start telling
the truth the flash going as fast as he
does yes it would have an effect on your
body and he has a super suit but I
always think about how the fact that his
face is not protected and I wonder what
would that do to your skin to travel
really really really fast for the flash
runs at supersonic speeds or near
supersonic speeds and his face is
unaffected so his face must be stronger
than yours and mine what would happen to
our faces who watch the guys on the
rocket sleds where their faith or a
guy's ejected from airplanes who
survived it their faces get in blown up
by the wind
one of my favorite movies The Rocketeer
where are we on jetpacks is it still is
it possible to have a jetpack and flower
we're just going to burn our buds so
there is not enough energy in alcohol
which is the supposed fuel to draw fly a
guy around like that however there are
rocket packs that use hydrazine and
hydrazine is conventional rocket fuel
it's very energetic you don't have to
light it you just need a catalyst to
start it you got Captain America shield
that's a material that absorbs the
impact vibranium right
so this is a classic second order
differential equation the spring depends
on how much you compress it how fast the
damping depends just on how fast so the
more you squeeze it the more it pushes
back
so vibranium Captain America's shield
this really has great damping spider-man
okay a material that is condensed enough
that can more than flip and and hold the
weight of a 15 year old boy well where
are we on the science of that some bad
guys hey could you do me a favor hold on
to that he has the through pible web
material that squirts out sticks to
buildings and can support his weight and
he's so skilled he can make that spiral
web pattern just like that are we
getting any closer to having that
material be real yes
so goats have been genetically modified
so that their milk produces the proteins
of spider webs and I remember when I was
working full time as an engineer the
Navy was very US Navy was very
interested in this material so the very
near future may have spiderweb protein
material everywhere the same way we have
plastic everywhere all right kidding we
are busy and important thank you very
much for having us and you know watch
out for this hammer
