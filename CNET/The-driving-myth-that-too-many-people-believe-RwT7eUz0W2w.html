you're doing it all wrong
growing up you were probably taught that
you should let your car warm up before
you hit the road so you sit there
killing anywhere from two to five
minutes while you wait for the
temperature dial to make its way up but
unless your car is about twenty years
old you're wasting your time
early your car isn't just unnecessary it
creates more pollution waste gas and as
an open invitation to thieves if you
leave your car unattended cars made in
the last couple decades can be driven
cold without causing any problems in
fact your car will warm up much faster
if you start driving it that's much
healthier for your vehicle than letting
it idle there are three common
exceptions though one is that it's
literally freezing outside
you need to clear frost off of your
windshield or you really just want it to
be posted before you start driving
otherwise in all other cases all you
need is about 30 seconds of idling
before you can start to drive and now
you're doing
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
