Barcelona with the Huawei talk band and
one headphones now these are smart
headphones that actually act as fitness
trackers to the magnetically connect and
you can wear them around your neck
Huawei says this looks like jewelry I
think it looks like I had fun around my
neck but they are very attractive
they're meant to be put into the premium
headphone market so sound better link to
the competition at 119 euros these are
coming out later this year and they also
do fitness tracking not heart rate but
they do fitness tracking just put them
in your ears the pretty low key you've
got a little controller here you can use
them as you're talking headset go
wireless
seven hours of battery life taken with
you remember to recharge and there are
other products like this out there the
Samsung gear circle and others that are
trying to put more smart features into
headphones smart idea and maybe an
accessory to things like smartphones in
the future and the talk band is pretty
affordably priced so I brought his talk
band you think it would wear it on your
wrist but the talk van m1 these are
headphones not a wristband though Huawei
also makes those I'm Scott Stein here in
Barcelona with the talk band m1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
