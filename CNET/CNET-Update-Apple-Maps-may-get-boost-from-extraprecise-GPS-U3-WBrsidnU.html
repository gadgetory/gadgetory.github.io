I'm Bridget Carey this is your CNET
update Apple is mapping out a path to
give you better directions Apple has
purchased the company coherent
navigation which created an extra
precise version of GPS it tracks
location by combining normal GPS with
low-orbit communication satellites that
means it knows where you are within
inches rather than feet like most
services Apple has bought several
mapping startups to help boost its own
map app it faced criticism over early
bugs and a lack of some features since
it launched three years ago Apple Maps
still do not include transit directions
but that could change this year a while
ago Apple did buy a company focused on
tracking public transportation ultra
specific mapping directions can be
helpful when you're using the Apple
watch on your wrist to get notifications
of when to turn but you know what else
this tech could be good for sending you
location specific advertisements when
you were in front of a store entrance
hey you never know
in other news a cybersecurity researcher
is raising serious questions on the
safety of passenger airplanes after
seeing he was able to take control of a
plane from the entertainment system at
his seat according to an FBI affidavit
the security researcher Chris Roberts is
said to have told the FBI that he has
been able to hack the in-flight
entertainment system on numerous planes
through the boxes under the seats and
that one time he was able to send a
command from his seat to cause the plane
to change course briefly reports say
Roberts went to the FBI several months
ago to warn them about vulnerabilities
he discovered but Roberts told Wired
that the statement highlighted in the
FBI report was incorrectly summarized
and taken out of context Roberts has not
been charged with any crime he's not in
custody on Twitter he said his goal was
to help improve airline security and
that he's been advised to not say much
several reports are citing law
enforcement officials discrediting the
claims saying it's not possible to hack
into a plane steering controls from a
passenger seat which leaves other
experts questioning what exactly was he
able to control
or was something in the FBI's report an
exaggeration based on a simulation so
while we try not to have flight hacking
nightmares the Wall Street Journal
reports Google is planning to put buy
buttons on its search results the
journal sources say the changes may
arrive in the coming weeks
under the heading shop on Google you'll
see it inside those sponsored ads and it
will show up when you're searching from
a phone or a tablet Google isn't
shipping the items rather it seems this
just handling the whole checkout
experience it's another example of
Google keeping up with Amazon as an
online marketplace that's your tech news
