standing next to me is the Panasonic TCP
50s 62 50-inch plasma TV in 2013 it's
the second cheapest that Panasonic makes
this series also comes in a 40 to 55 60
and 65 inch size so nice breath in the
s60 series this basic 1080p plasma
series includes a little bit of Smart TV
but the real benefit here is the picture
quality the picture quality TV is
excellent for the price one of the best
pictures you can possibly get for the
money we'll get to that in a little bit
but first let's take a look at the
styling Panasonic didn't try to do too
much with the exterior they're set it's
a pretty basic black all around the
bezel is relatively thin this glossy
black there's also a little bit of
accent mark above and below the stand is
not swivel but it is pretty low profile
so all in all a very understated design
feature set on the s60 is bare-bones the
top of the list is this Smart TV suite
it's really not like this Smart TV
Suites of the step ups Panasonic's or
even the Samsung's and LG's of the world
however it's extremely basic you really
only get six apps Netflix Amazon Instant
boudu Hulu Plus cinema now and YouTube
that's really all most people are going
to want however most people don't really
utilize all those bumpty and other apps
found on a lot of those Smart TVs Suites
so and that way if you like simple this
is pretty good
Panasonic also has built-in Wi-Fi so
that's a nice touch on the flipside
you're not going to find 3d or any of
the other fancy features found on some
of the step-up sets the real downside to
that stripped down feature set is the
back panel there's only two HDMI inputs
available on this set we really feel
like three is kind of the minimum these
days with the amount of things that you
want to connect of course you can always
buy an external switch or something like
that we do really nice Panasonic
included that third HDMI input other
connectivity includes a pair of USB
ports and a component video port this
set is also missing the SD card slot
found in its step up brethren picture
adjustments on the s6 you're actually
pretty extensively going to the newly
redesigned and much better menu system
and find things like a color management
system as well as five different picture
presets there's also a few settings that
address image retention which with a
plasma TV like this if you use it
normally isn't a big deal at all
I mentioned the real story here is
picture quality for the money the s60
isn't quite as good as the ST 60 we
reviewed a little bit earlier but it is
spectacular the real strength is deep
black levels when you get into a door
room that blacks on this-tv or as in
keys and you'll see the downside happens
when you turn up the lights however
under bright lighting this TVs image
does wash out because it doesn't have
the same kind of dark screen finish
found on more expensive plasmas so for
extremely bright rooms I think this TVs
not the best choice but if you do have
pretty good control over ambient
lighting it's an excellent deal that's a
quick look at Panasonic's TCP s60 series
