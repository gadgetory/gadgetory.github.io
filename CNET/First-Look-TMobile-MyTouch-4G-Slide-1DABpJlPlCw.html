CNET taking a first look today at the
t-mobile mytouch 4G slide you could call
it the successor to the mytouch 3G slide
but it's much much more advanced than
that because there's 4G dual core 1.2
gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor
and Android 2.3 Gingerbread all onboard
it also has the most recent version of
HTC's Sense 3 UI like all other
smartphones in the mytouch family this
one is made by HTC as I mentioned it's
got these typical brushed metal accents
around it that make it pretty darn heavy
it's 6 and 1/2 ounces it's got a 3.7
inch WVGA Super LCD screen which is
pretty nice and bright there are five
buttons here beneath the screen they
correspond to home menu back and then
there's the genius button on all the
mytouch phones and this one calls up
voice commands and voice-to-text
features there's also an optical
trackpad here that doubles as a select
button given that it's called the slide
there is a slide-out full QWERTY
keyboard it's nice and spacious and it
has some handy indicator lights and a
few shortcut buttons on it but I wasn't
crazy about the keys which were pretty
flat and then slowed down my typing
quite a bit I've definitely felt much
plush or keyboard buttons that really
bounce back when I'm done pressing them
and I prefer that there is a
front-facing VGA camera here for video
chats but the real story is this camera
on the back it's an 8 megapixel camera
lens
there's dual LED flash and it has
support for 1080p HD video capture and
playback it also has a few other goodies
that lead HTC to call it the most
advanced smartphone camera there is for
example there's a special lens and light
sensor that emulates the way that
digital cameras work with light there's
a ton of fun software inside that lets
you switch all sorts of shooting modes
and settings so for example their sweep
shot which makes a smooth panorama
there's burst mode that takes five
photos in quick succession and then
there's clear shot which is for HDR mode
there's also portrait mode blink mode
and smile mode all of which have
different settings and properties I
thought that that outdoor photo
were really good but I still had some
problems with some of the indoor shots
and those low level lighting solutions
did not work quite as well as advertised
granted I really haven't had the phone
so long at this point so I will be
updating my written review with more
tests and some comparisons with other
camera phones including the iphone 4 so
back to this HTC also claims that there
is no shutter delay which I did not find
to be the case at all
overall the camera is pretty good and
the options are definitely more exciting
than normal it's really fun to use but I
wouldn't say that it's quite on par with
the digital camera not yet anyway the
phone itself is a nice little package I
can definitely compete with the big boys
it'll cost you 100 $99.99 with the new
two-year contract so I think that's a
pretty good competitive price for this
caliber of phone once again I'm Jessica
Dahl court with CNET this has been the
key mobile mytouch 4G slide I've got
many more details on my full review on
