here with Boz's soundtrue ultra the
company's first boys isolating in-ear
headphone don't confuse noise isolating
with active noise cancellation these
aren't a powered headphone however what
makes the ultra different from boses
earlier in your headphones is that it's
tip is designed to fit snugly in the
base of your ear canal and block out a
lot of ambient noise now a lot of people
don't like having ear tips jammed in
their ears which is why boses earlier in
your headphones which have a looser
fitting open design that lets some sound
in have become so popular the ultra on
the other hand is designed more like a
traditional in-ear headphone but once
again the key to its fit is the soft
silicon state ear tip which Bose calls
stay here ultra for this model not only
are these among the most comfortable if
not the most comfortable in ear
noise-isolating headphones you can buy
but the state year ultra tips keep the
buds securely in your ears it's a great
design and you should be able to wear
these headphones for long stretches with
little to no discomfort it also helps
that the buds themselves are lightweight
they are plastic which may leave you
wondering why they cost $150 but they
are made of high-tech plastic if that's
any consolation the headphone comes in
black or white and in two flavors one
with the remote that's designed to be
used with Android phones and another
that's compatible with Apple iOS devices
the headphone works well for making
calls you can hear people better in
noisy environments thanks to the noise
isolation and it does come with a nicely
designed compact carrying case as for
the sound the ultra is an even-handed
very clean sounding headphone that's
designed to make all music sound good
the bass may be a little lean for some
who craved that extra thump to their
low-end but it was punchy enough for me
the trouble was smooth and the mid-range
clear and warm without being too laid
back I didn't have a problem with the
volume level but some people have
complained about it not being high
enough the ultras top bottom is about 10
to 20 percent lower than a lot of in ear
headphones on the market I believe Bose
did
that on purpose to keep people from
damaging their ears but if your hearing
is a little bit shot these may very well
not play quite loud enough for you
anyway I like the alters a lot for both
their comfort and their sound and I
wasn't the only one in the CNET office
who did home audio editor type
Pendlebury also approved of them true
they are a little expensive at $150 if
you're looking for a clean sounding pair
of really comfortable in e'er
noise-isolating headphones that really
stay in your ears the sound true ultra
should be on your shortlist I'm David
