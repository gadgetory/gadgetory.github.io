Wars well do you have a Star Wars laptop
even the box itself is covered with cool
Star Wars graphics I'm sure you're gonna
want to keep that around and inside when
you're taking out the laptop for the
first time the box the power adapter
comes in has cool Darth Vader graphics
on it and even the foam things that hold
the laptop in there look like little
thai fighters okay so once you've got
the laptop out of the box you can see it
is fully dressed front to back and kind
of battle worn Star Wars graphics on the
back of the lid we've got Darth Vader
and some Imperial looking stuff and on
this side we've got a stormtrooper we've
got some more sort of battle scarring a
little death star in the background some
Star Wars language up here one of the
cooler parts I thought was the touch pad
which has that x-wing targeting computer
view from Episode four just printed
right on top of the touch pad and of
course the keyboard is backlit in
ominous glowing red when you dive into
the actual system itself you're gonna
find the Star Wars control center and
that gives you access through a whole
bunch of different Star Wars windows
themes with rotating background images
and even system sounds whether it's the
original trilogy or the new movie that's
coming up also image galleries lots of
behind the scenes stuff and sketches and
production photos if you take away all
the Star Wars stuff you've got a fairly
mainstream 15-inch Core i5 laptop the
nice touch here is that starting at
$6.99 this really isn't more expensive
than if you just want a non Star Wars
version of this although I will say for
the holiday season in 2015 there are
some pretty stiff discounts on the non
Star Wars pavilion 15 laptops right now
but as it is it's a reasonably
inexpensive way to get a cool piece of
Star Wars ephemera and that also works
as a perfectly fine mainstream everyday
laptop
