huge bets on the Lumia 900 but does it
have the hardware to compete with
Samsung's Galaxy Nexus and Apple's
iPhone 4s I'm Bill Detweiler head
technology editor at CNN sister site
tech Republic and I'm going to find out
by cracking open the Nokia Lumia 900
opening the Lumia 900 isn't difficult if
you know how to do it if you don't the
task is frustrating time-consuming
and you'll be lucky if you don't break
your phone trust me I know so here it is
using the included sim removal tool pop
out the SIM card holder next insert the
SIM tools small end into the hole next
to the SIM card slot at an angle and
remove the front panel locking pin that
runs down the right side of the phone
with the pin removed you can now open
the front panel using a thin metal tool
pop loose the pound's right side where
the pin was then lift the front panel
and body away from each other but take
care the display and digitizer cables
are still connected to the motherboard
to disconnect them we'll first need to
remove the metal plate that covers the
motherboard and battery using Torx t5
and Philips triple zero screwdriver bits
remove all the screws holding the plate
to the body then remove the plate itself
you can now disconnect the digitizer and
the display from the motherboard and
completely remove the front panel next
you can disconnect the battery button
connector and remove the front-facing
camera and sensor assembly the
motherboard is next followed by the
battery after removing the EMI RFI
shields from the motherboard the
teardown is pretty much complete so what
did I learn about the lumia 900 from our
teardown and how does it stack up
against the Galaxy Nexus and iPhone 4s
well let's start on the outside the
Lumia 900 has a single piece
polycarbonate body which gives the phone
solid sturdy feel as for its dimensions
and weight it's about the same width and
height as the Galaxy Nexus but it's
slightly thicker and heavier compared to
the iPhone 4s it's just bigger and
heavier all around
looking at the displays the Lumia has a
4.3 inch AMOLED screen with a resolution
of 800 by 480 pixels in an approximate
pixel density of 217 pixels per inch now
this is lower than the resolution and
pixel density of the displays on both
the Galaxy Nexus and the iPhone 4s and
don't get me wrong the Lumia has a nice
display but I wouldn't say it's so
resolution Airy or anything like that
moving inside the phone let's start with
the processor in ram the lumia has a 1.4
gigahertz single core Qualcomm processor
and 512 Meg's of RAM the Galaxy Nexus
has a 1.2 gigahertz dual core Texas
Instruments processor with one gig of
ram and the iphone 4s has a dual-core
Apple a5 processor which appears to be
clocked at about 800 megahertz and like
the Lumia it has 512 Meg's of RAM now
unfortunately these numbers don't really
give us a clear winner in the raw
performance category at face value the
Galaxy Nexus seems to come out on top
but a handsets performance is also
determined by its operating system the
efficiency of the software you're
running and a host of other factors I
can tell you that in the limited testing
I did the Lumia was responsive and
didn't suffer any noticeable lag as for
storage
the Lumia only comes in a 16 gigabyte
version which is 1/2 the 32 gigs you get
with the Galaxy Nexus and of course
Apple is all about choice with the
iPhone which comes in 16 32 and 64 gig
versions as for battery life
the Lumia also appears to be on the
bottom of the list according to nokia
the Lumia can provide up to 7 hours of
talktime samsung rates the Galaxy Nexus
at up to 12 hours and apple says the
iPhone 4s gets up to 8 just remember
that all of these values are subject to
how you use the device sure I can get a
full day out of my iPhone 4s but not if
I'm constantly browsing the internet
taking photos or streaming video and
don't even get me started on what
running the Nexus is 4G radio does to
its battery life
the Lumia 900 may lack a dual-core
processor
and have a lower resolution screen and
less storage capacity than the Galaxy
Nexus and iPhone 4s but it's definitely
the best Windows Phone 7 device I've
tested and even with its less than
cutting-edge hardware
I found the Lumias overall performance
on par with the other two phones
so why didn't no Kia pack the phone with
the newest processor best display and
more storage well I think it all comes
down to price at $99 with a two-year
contract
the Lumia is definitely the most
affordable high-end smartphone on the
market had Nokia pushed the envelope on
Hardware they would have needed to raise
the price to see more Lumia 900 teardown
