3200 Wi-Fi router G H and model s PR ay
C 32 @p and that's crazy name someone
call it Bob from now on okay Bob is a
tri-band Wi-Fi router meaning it has one
2.4 gigahertz band and 2 5 gig hood man
basically it means it can handle more
 hood Wi-Fi clients before
slowing down and in my testing that
worked pretty well with fast Wi-Fi speed
and very stable Wi-Fi signals but it's
range or than the best at the sink which
brings us to what makes it very special
it has built-in support for fast power
line and that means when you plug it
into a power which you have to do to
make it work in the first place it will
also turn that power socket into the
first end of a power line connection
which basically turned the power line of
your home into network cable now for the
other end you can use either this every
support ticket beat G dot H and extender
Model S P X 1000 P which I couldn't
consume from now on or this every
support AC 1200 Wi-Fi hotspot' extend
the G dot H and model SVX
AC 1200 P which I will come Cindy from
now on Suzy is a powerline adapter she
has one gigabit that were put here to
host a white client such as a desktop
computer in my testing she worked really
well with the top sustain speed up close
to 310 megabit per second which is about
four times the speed of a regular fast
ethernet connection quite impressive but
it's quite large so fighting a good wall
socket for her is a bit tricky but it
get worse because Cindy over here you
actually must larger that because a part
of the network ports you also have a
built-in Wi-Fi access point and the
coolest thing is one's plot in sequin
immediately and automatically replicate
the Wi-Fi network
of the router and that means you can
quickly extend Bob's Wi-Fi network to
that far corner of the house by plugging
in Cindy at that corner and all that
looks pretty well in my testing so the
question is how much now Bob costs $300
Suzy here $60 and Cindy $100 so
basically if you're going to spend $400
for Bob and Cindy even for sure have a
Wi-Fi network that is large enough to
cover a big home and if that is not
enough well spend another no dollar for
another Cindy and he will be all set
however there's no reason to get just
Bob alone because he is more expensive
why not better than any competing
devices and neither Suzy or Cindy would
work with our Bob and that's about as
true as networking would be so boring
and way less sexy without me and that's
because I'm dumb know who you would
continue to call down low because that's
no need for a change like at all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
