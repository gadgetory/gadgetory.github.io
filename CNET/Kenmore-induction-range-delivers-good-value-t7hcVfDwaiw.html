appliances and today we're going to be
talking about the Kenmore nine five zero
seven three induction range
now this cooktop is a little different
than other induction ranges that we've
seen because instead of marking the
burners with circles it marks it with
X's which can make it a little hard to
Center your pot or pan directly on the
correct X so you definitely need to
watch out for that but there are four
burners on this stove they each use a
little feature called power boost which
will provide some a little extra energy
for up to 10 minutes at the beginning of
your cooktop but with the largest burner
which is in the front right of the
stovetop we found that when you put the
power boost on it can boil one hundred
and twelve ounces of water in less than
six minutes one of my favorite parts of
this oven was its convection roast
setting the chicken that came out of
this oven was especially tasty Kenmore
actually did a really great job of
roasting the chicken on the outside so
it had a nice crisp golden skin but
still stayed moist and juicy on the
inside and it really makes this oven
shine now there are a few drawbacks with
this Kenmore oven it doesn't pack a lot
of the extra features that you would see
on other induction ranges such as the GE
induction range or the Samsung induction
range that we've tested here at CNET
appliances the oven also has some really
lackluster performance when it comes to
broiling the broil times were pretty
slow it took about 17 minutes to get six
burgers to the correct temperature
another disappointment with this ovens
performance was its small burner we
boiled a small pot of water on the
burner and it took a long time to get
the water to boil this is definitely not
a burner that you would use for a lot of
multitasking this is a burner left for
the low temperature items and even there
you need to be careful because it loses
its heat pretty quickly what makes the
Kenmore nine five zero seven three
really stand out is its price point this
freestanding range is sick
tene 9999 which is a steal when you
compare it to other induction models so
if you're really interested in trying
induction cooking but you don't have the
budget for a slot in higher end model
the Kenmore is a great range to buy and
introduce to your kitchen for more check
