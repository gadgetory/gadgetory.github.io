levy and you're watching rumor has it
where we round up the latest tech rumors
this week we're going to talk about
iphone 5 samsung Retina display and
maybe a new sony tablet if you're
watching on cnet you can vote on all the
rumors to our first rumor is about the
successor to the sony tablet s which
will supposedly be branded with the
experian name which is sony's line of
smartphones the site mobi flip posted
leaked internal documents showing that
it'll be thinner will have better
cameras 10-plus hours of battery life
Android Ice Cream Sandwich and the
aluminum case will be splash proof so
that Mollywood could torture it by the
pool since the tablet s was due for an
update this rumor seems pretty legit now
for iphone 5 rumor watch threat level
burnt sienna which is more serious than
orange sight I more citing sources who
have proven right in the past aka
anonymous drink Cheers these sources say
the iphone will be released on sep
tember 12th at a special event but won't
go on sale until nine days later the
soothsayers don't stop there their phd
resistance is the prediction that an
ipad mini will be in attendance at this
huge event i heard some rumblings that
the iphone is actually going to be
released october fifth which is the
anniversary of steve jobs as death well
if it's October fifth or sep tember 12
either way I bet that it's going to be
available the same day as the
announcement our third rumor will make
fans of our old podcast very happy court
filings in the Samsung vs apple patent
battle show that Samsung appears to be
working on an extra large 11.8 inch
tablet codenamed p10 with a retina like
display in fact the samsung screen would
have a higher resolution than the ipads
you know what this means that the
samsung retina display that we predicted
on episode 12 of the podcast may
actually become a reality roll the tape
Samsung's next tablet will sport a true
HD display and could come out before the
ipad 3 they're going to call it the
rutina dice play and i hope that nobody
Sue's them
for copyright infringement our weirdest
rumor comes from the most respected of
sources the New York Times the bits blog
says Apple has been in serious talks to
buy a stake in Twitter why in the world
would they do that I think it's because
they're facing increasing competition
from social media networks for
everyone's time and money if Apple can
get you on its own network it just
drives more people to iOS the easiest
way would be to buy an existing social
network which Apple tried wouldn't
wanted to integrate ping with Facebook
but failed now Apple could have bought
Instagram but Facebook beat it to the
punch which leaves just Twitter as
Apple's best bet for a social Alliance I
personally thinks that this makes sense
if Apple wants to buy a social media
network Twitter is cool Apple is cool
and by the numbers and demographics
they're both sort of exclusive clubs
that cater to people who want a sleek
design and interface and don't really
care about a million features there also
has been a lot of Twitter integration in
Apple products and it seems likely that
apple will want to have a financial
stake in twitter so it could have
control because you know how Apple loves
to have control of things and has
control issues so and in that case I'd
prefer this to an apple made social
network because I can barely keep up
with the social networks that exists now
and I'm talking to you google plus what
do you guys think is Apple looking to
buy a stake in Twitter don't forget to
vote we're going to go ask the people on
the streets of San Francisco what they
think
make one no I think they everything that
I've read about that that story is that
they just want to invest in one I can
see him doing that yeah I would
definitely check it out would be awesome
I would say no I don't I don't think
apples can say it they already failed
with ping my guess is that they'll be
trying to sell their products through it
somehow I think the whole deal is just
going to try to integrate you as closely
with the family of products as possible
what do you think it might look like if
Apple did back something like Facebook
well the people in the street actually
had a lot of information about this
topic and they all seemed interested in
trying out an apple social media network
let's go see if the cnet Council of
experts agree the cnet councils composed
of five editors who cast their votes
anonymously their opinions are not an
endorsement by cnet or CBS interactive
obviously because these are rumors folks
and the cnet council's verdict is nay
Apple is not interested in buying a
stake in Twitter according to our
experts although three said no and two
said they should be that's very
interesting don't forget that you can
meet the cnet council in person soon
we're throwing a rumor has it launch
party at cnet headquarters and you could
be invited sadly we can't cover
transportation costs so if you can get
yourself here and you want to party with
us tweet tew/cnet rumor show using the
hashtag rhi party that's our show
everyone and thanks to ebay this week's
sponsor and coincidentally where we got
our vintage glassware see you next time
