home and do so in one place things like
lights and door locks peb cams garage
doors and thermostats well we thought we
could bring some rationality to this
space now one of the things I found most
interesting from Apple's recent
developers conference was their
announcement of home kit it's one of the
least developed at this point but it has
amazing potential seen that began
reviewing connected home technology
summer of 2013 and one of the first
things you notice is how many vendors
there are of devices that have their own
apps their own logic their own behavior
and their own quality of interface it
can be a little chaotic we need a place
for all of them to come together as
simply as the home itself pretends to be
products like revolve or the staples
connect home hub are a middle layer of
hardware and software that seek to
broker the relationship between your
phone or tablet and the devices that now
control your home Apple's home kit would
seem to give us a place to get closer to
our connected home devices in a more
simple transparent manner giving
developers a single place to tie back to
where they know they'll find enormous
critical mass and where they can get
together with some degree of
interconnection so that I'm not handling
every single device in my home
discreetly but having some degree of
sort of macro relationship where one
behavior on my part can command several
devices to do what I need for example if
I pull out of the driveway in my car my
phone can sense that geolocation change
and perhaps tell lights thermostat and
security system to go into the right
mode for an empty house now Apple has a
well-known elegance with how they pull
these kinds of things together and of
course an extremely loyal an enormous
developer based on the other hand apple
also has a way of deciding what will and
won't be possible within their universe
and doing it in sometimes a conservative
fashion we also need a very clear
analogue from the Android camp to answer
home kit or a huge number of users will
be left out of this home simplification
revolution also it's interesting how
many of apple's carrier partners are
also in the business of selling you
smart home devices and the connection
and app software to opera
eat them elegantly that puts those two
at odds but with a partner they can't
afford to lose Apple in some I would
watch for developers who understand that
tight integration down at the core of
the OS is a smart place for home control
the home is a simple place we want it to
get better but we don't want it to get
more complicated there's very little
tolerance for that making this kind of
home control as core to an operating
system on a mobile device as is
messaging or decoding web content seems
the smart path to me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
