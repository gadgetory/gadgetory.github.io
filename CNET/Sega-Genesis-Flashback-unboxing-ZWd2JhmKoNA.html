all the sake of consoles and now there
is a new Sega Genesis retro console at
games has a new HDMI compatible Sega
Genesis flashback let's get right to the
box and take a look at it the packaging
is nicer this looks like the NES classic
they clearly took a note from them there
are 85 games ok but they're not all
Genesis games the list showed a lot of
games that seemed like they were from
the Sega Master System and also a
handful we don't even know about they
could be totally random games which is
pretty common for these systems the
Genesis games the big ones are featured
here you've got Alex Kidd in the
Enchanted Castle that's not the best
Alex Kidd game I like this the one for
Master System kid chameleon great
underrated game you've got the sonic
games
that's great fantasy star games sure
Shining Force 2 really good role-playing
game there's no ecco the dolphin though
there's no Streets of Rage games at all
that's weird they've just got dropped no
third-party game so you're not gonna
find any Aladdin or you know that 7up
game that I used to play jewel master
that's okay he swats pretty good should
calm the forever man very good you don't
want to play Virtua Fighter 2 that is a
really bad port of a Sega Saturn game
vector man cool game so there's a good
handful in here at least let's take a
look at what it looks like
certainly it looks like a Genesis it
doesn't look exactly like the original
Genesis though when you open it up now
you got a poster here oh no it's like
nothing greatest it's not a great poster
it's a very retro not really a true
retro poster it's kind of lame has
fantasy star for mortal kombat on it ok
whatever and it's a basic instruction
manual we'll get back to that
here is the flashback it's like a much
smaller Sega Genesis it's bigger though
than the NES classic we don't know how
this compares to the Super NES classic
because we don't have one of those yet
but it's got a power switch it's got the
you reset button it also has a cartridge
slot this thing can play old Genesis
cartridges it's also a complete retro
game system it sounds too good to be
true
HDMI on the back power adapter so this
is 720p HDMI and there are two
traditional controller ports if you
happen to have Sega Genesis controller
is lying around do you actually want to
plug into this the two that come with it
these are wireless now they don't look
exactly like the original Sega Genesis
controllers and they don't feel like
them these this d-pad is super wobbly
and these buttons feel pretty hollow and
flimsy there's also a third button here
there's Start menu and rewind this says
game rewind so not just saved games but
to backup while you're playing the games
like game DVR that sounds great is that
gonna work really well we'll have to see
and there's also player 1 player 2
toggle up here so off to try that out
and we'll see how the wireless works
whether you have to be in direct range
or not with these so there are two
controllers open them up here and
they're able to pop the batteries in do
you kit no you can't just open them up
to have to unscrew so bring a
screwdriver philips head screwdriver and
you can exchange the batteries there's
the Sega Genesis flash back here is an
HDMI cable that comes with it and there
is the power adapter plug so that's all
that's in the box plus this
commemorative egg crate so that's Sega
Genesis flashback now you could actually
plug in old Genesis games which we do
have lying around here's a Latin and you
should be able to pop this in and play
your games in HDMI so that's why Sega
Genesis flashback looks but how does it
actually play well we're gonna get to
that soon we're gonna play as many of
these games as we can with as many
people as we can
sonic fantasy star golden axe and no
Streets of Rage so stay tuned
