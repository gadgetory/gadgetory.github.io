simplest upgrades for your smartphone is
a new pair of headphones but don't spend
too much on them just like umbrellas or
sunglasses you don't really buy
headphones so much as you rent them from
the universe doll bell and in this top
five I'm going to tell you the best
values and headphones price under $50
handpicked by executive editor David
Carr Noi and for the sake of this list
I'm going to order them by price well
start the list off with the cheapest
pair at number five the Panasonic
Peugeot fit you're not going to find a
better pair of headphones for under ten
dollars they come in more colors than
skittles and they're lightweight in your
design helps to block out a little bit
of noise now I wouldn't say they're
super durable for six dollars why not
buy a handful of these just to keep a
few spares around now if you can spend a
little more check out its cousin the RP
HJ e 355 closer to $20 but you get
better design and sound quality on par
with anything in that 40 to 50 dollar
range at number four the JVC Flatts a
proper pair of headphones that can be
snapped up for around 15 bucks padded
your cups and a design that as the name
implies folds down flat for easy travel
no innovative microphone or carrying
case but you get a detailed sound and a
comfy lightweight design for a great
price you can get a few color options if
you're feeling sassy coming in at number
three emo she me throw $30 gets you some
in ear headphones with some real style
and an integrated microphone for taking
calls
now the remotes just a single button for
answering calls there's no volume rocker
but that's better than anything else on
this list good sound for the price and
in my opinion the aluminum design is
really pretty cool looking and there's a
few cool color options too at number 2
Panasonic our PhD x7 $40 guess you in
some retro-styled over ear headphones do
a great job keeping out noise and
keeping your music in there like a
little sonic cocoon that looks like they
fell off the set of madmen a great
choice if you're looking for headphones
for listening to music at work without
disturbing people in the next cubicle as
you listen to Pharrell's happy on repeat
and cry into your spreadsheet wondering
how your life got off track great
headphones which brings us
to the number one pair of headphones at
just under $50 audio technica ath m30
a momentary steal as Audio Technica is
phasing this model out in favor of the
new $70 M 30x which as far as we can
tell is virtually identical to the m30
no built-in mic no colors and the cord
is long like a good pair of hi-fi
headphones they sound great though and
arguably offer better low-end than
anything else on this list comfortable
over ear design padded headband and
extremely sturdy construction it's
another great option for work or home
but probably not the sort of thing you
want to go jogging around with still a
great value so there you have it 5
headphones for under $50 with options
