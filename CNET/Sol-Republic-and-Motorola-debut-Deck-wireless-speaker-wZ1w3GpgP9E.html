cnet.com I'm going to give you a quick
video tour of another wireless Bluetooth
speaker the deck by Sol Republic and
Motorola which has a list price of $199
for the office speaker phone the idea
behind that design is that since it's so
slim it'll slip easily into a bag so you
can take it with you wherever you go I
liked how it looked and it's pretty
lightweight weighing only eleven point
five ounces if yellow isn't your color
it does come in a few other color
options including simple black it does
have volume controls on the top of the
speaker as well as this multifunction
button with the Motorola logo on it that
pauses and plays your music answers and
ends calls in speakerphone mode yes
there is an integrated microphone and it
also skips tracks forward and back the
deck does have a few notable extra
features like the Jawbone Jambox
there are voice prompts on board to let
you know your device is paired and how
full the battery is battery home it does
get around 10 hours of battery life
according to Sol Republic and for those
who have NFC enabled devices such as the
Samsung Galaxy s4 and the Moto X that
the speaker is launching with you can
tap the speaker with your device to pair
it more interesting as the hice mode
after you flip a little switch on the
side of the speaker shifting from single
user mode to multi-user mode you and
your friends can pair up to five devices
to the deck each of which is assigned a
different color LED you can only stream
music from one device at a time but if
you hit play on a second device that's
connected the SOL logo on the top of the
speaker changes color and that device
takes over music playback thus the name
heist the other feature worth mentioning
is the speaker has both an audio input
and audio output so you can connect a
non Bluetooth enabled audio device or
daisy chain multiple decks together to
get bigger sound now about that sound
it's pretty good but it's not $200 good
since the speaker is designed first and
foremost to sit on a flat surface and
fire upward it's not surprising that
it's being billed as delivering 360
degrees sound
the so-called surround effect does have
its limitations and you do have to
experiment a little with placement to
optimize the sound quality for a small
speaker it does play loud and can fill a
small room with sound it also has an
outdoor mode that boosts the sound and
changes the soundstage a bit to make the
speaker better suited for outdoor
listening but other $200 competitors
such as the UE boom and Bo's sound dog
mini deliver bigger fuller sound with
more bass both of those speakers do way
more however don't get me wrong though
after using the speaker for a few days I
came away liking it is a very appealing
design it's easy to carry around and has
some cool extra features the only issue
I had with it is the price tag
performance wise it just doesn't measure
up to the to another competition but
other than that has a decent little
Bluetooth speaker I'm David Carr noise
and thats the deck by Sol Republican
