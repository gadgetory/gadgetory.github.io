Microsoft is having a secret press event
in Los Angeles Monday afternoon and
everyone is buzzing about rumors on what
Microsoft could possibly be unveiling if
it's being shown off in LA you know
there's an entertainment focus around
this thing so expect movies or music to
be involved the word from some insiders
is that it could be a tablet but really
a tablet it could it be something that
upstages the Windows 8 tablets coming
out this fall because that would really
get Microsoft's and vendors upset so
could it be something different like an
e-reader or a 7-inch entertainment
device and let's not forget that last
month Microsoft invested six hundred
million dollars into the Nook and became
a partner with Barnes &amp;amp; Noble's so it's
all very intriguing Vizio is known for
making televisions and blu-ray players
but now for the first time it's selling
computers available today that start at

like their own little entertainment hub

HDMI ports so you could just hook up
your cable box or video game system

looking keyboard and a trackpad for a
mouse vizio also launched a 15-inch
laptop as well as the thin in light
ultra book in both a 14 and 15 inch
model in the tablet races the nope just
inched ahead of Amazon's Kindle a web
traffic report in June shows that more
people are browsing the web with a nuke
them with a Kindle but the iPad is still
by far the leader of the race followed
by the samsung galaxy tablet Facebook

phone number to increase security on the
social network if your password is
compromised Facebook will be able to
reset it and use your cell phone for
verification The Wall Street Journal
reports that Microsoft is spending 1.2
billion dollars to acquire Yammer a
service for creating internal social
networks for workplaces think of it it
as a private Facebook just for your
employees that would mean Microsoft will
have more tools to compete against
Google's cloud offerings and a
nine-year-old schoolgirl in the UK is
making a difference thanks to her lunch
blog she took photos and commented and
rated the school lunches she got and it
quickly became popular it's at more than
three
views the blog went viral causing
worldwide debate about the quality of
school lunches and many children also
sent her photos of their lunches the
school asked her to shut it down because
of the attention it was bringing but she
won this food fight on Friday the school

the litter keep the block which was also
raising money for charity that's your
