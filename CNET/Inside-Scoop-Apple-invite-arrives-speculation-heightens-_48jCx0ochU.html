I've seen at Saqqara tsuboi joined by
Shara Tipton cnet senior writer and
Shara the tech community was caught off
guard little this morning when the Apple
invites went out for September ninth
tell us more yeah so Apple finally sent
out the invites for their event
everybody's been waiting for it we've
all thought that it would be September
ninth but nobody actually expected the
invites quite this early right everyone
thought maybe they'd come out after
Labor Day yeah they usually send it out
about a week early okay and of course
Apple is still pretty mum about you know
what the yeah it is all about yeah this
this invite was actually a little more
coy than most of them typically Apple
gives a lot of hints about what they're
going to announce in the invites this
time it just said which we could say
more very vague phrasing very vague
photo is kind of a gray Apple below the
other logo yeah so you know not a lot of
hints in this one but of course everyone
is expecting a new phone announcement I
mean this is what they've been doing
like the last three years yeah if
there's no new phone people are going to
be completely shocked but you know
they're it's gonna be a new phone so
what are we expecting with this new
phone or phones I should say yeah yeah
one thing is bigger screens so most
people are expecting a 4.7 inch screen
there also could be a 5.5 inch which is
more like a phablet so it's kind of a
hybrid between a tablet and a phone
right now that the iphones are four inch
screens so it's it's much smaller than
what they're going to be going to so
that's you know kind of the huge news
for the iphone any other features you
guys are expecting I mean besides like
upgraded camera the basic upgrades yeah
there will definitely be upgraded
components one rumor is that there could
be NFC which is a connectivity so you
can like tap your phone on something to
make payments sure or to tether things
together so like you could tap your
phone against the speaker to have them
talk together the market is heating up
for the SmartWatch carry the wearables
are just exploding right now it's Apple
going to introduce anything on sep
tember 9th in that i watch category
there could be you know there were some
rumors that came out that they are going
to show a wearable of some sort we don't
know if that could be an iWatch or a
fitness band or something
none of us have thought about all right
well we will obviously be chatting
leading up to September 9th the day of
the big apple event thank you so much
chef napkin I'm car tsuboi thanks for
