was VHS the chunky video format that
ruled Home Entertainment through much of
the 80s and 90s here are our fondest
memories of this analog superstar if
you're having a little trouble with the
picture on the TV now maybe you just
need to adjust the tracking on your VCR
VHS stored info on tape which could
easily be misread by video cassette
players if that tape got worn out or
stretched meaning the tracking would
need to be painstakingly adjusted using
a little dial or you could get a halfway
decent picture the most famous format
war in history Sony's beat Mack's tapes
couldn't face the might of VHS which had
an early advantage in terms of tape
running time and grabbed a stronger hold
of the growing movie rental market
a technological inconvenience that's
long since vanished in the digital age
VHS tapes of course had to be
mechanically wound back to the start
before you could watch them again if you
rented a VHS rewinding it before giving
it back was only polite the widespread
popularity of VHS and VCRs meant
anything that's aired on TV could be
recorded and watched again meaning your
house would quickly get cluttered with
recordable tapes that you probably
forgot to label VHS also made home
movies more popular than ever
instant replay instant replay hey I want
to see those pictures finally perhaps
our most powerful VHS memory the amazing
sounds of analog tape tech you may want
to pop your headphones on this bit
those are our VHS memories but what are
yours let us know and stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
