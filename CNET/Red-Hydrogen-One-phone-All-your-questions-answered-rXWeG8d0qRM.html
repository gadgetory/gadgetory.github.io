one phone it's a phone with a 3d
holographic screen but it's not made by
Apple or Samsung it's made by the
company red who does high-end cinema
cameras these cameras have been used to
make movies like The Hobbit Straight
Outta Compton and pretty much anything
on Netflix well recently I got to see a
prototype of the red hydrogen one phone
and it's for view screen and I'm here to
answer your questions about it as best I
can
well for view is kind of the name red
calls display and the prototype I got to
see we saw a bunch of clips on it some
were from movies some were actually shot
with the phone with and there were
photos and videos and when you're
looking at the screen it's basically as
if you're wearing 3d glasses it's the
best way to describe it but unlike when
you're in a movie theater and you move
your head a little bit and the 3d effect
is off the cool thing is if I move the
phone a little bit or twisted it I could
still get the same 3d effect and I
didn't have to wear 3d glasses I think
that's really important the downside is
we weren't able to take photos or videos
of the screen
and I think the reason is with you saw a
2d photo of this screen it wouldn't look
very impressive at all and seeing it in
person you get the whole effect and it
worked really well and this was just a
prototype it's it's pretty big actually
it's not unwieldy though I would say
it's probably about the size of an
iPhone 8 plus in a big case maybe a
little bit bigger than that think of
like OtterBox size case so it's
definitely something that is not petite
it's not small but what's interesting
about it is the way it looks - it has
these scalloped edges and the edges are
reminiscent of the scalloped edges
around the lens lock on the mount of a
red camera which I thought was kind of
cool when you hold the phone there
fingers fit perfectly in the scalps and
it felt very comfortable to hold but
yeah it's definitely not going to win
any tiny phone Awards
I did not get to use any of the cameras
disappointingly but when he walked into
a vent and a red employee had a phone
and took a picture of us and they showed
us the photos and what was neat about it
was the speed with which this phone took
a holographic 3d photo I think they call
it 84 v is the file format and he showed
it to us in the screen you can see it
right away and it looks really cool
I thought it would take longer for it to
process or there would be like a
blackout screen but he was just taking
them like a regular like a regular
snapshot we think of modular phones we
think of things like Motorola's line of
phones or central where there's these
little mods you can put on them as far
as the red phone we know there's gonna
be a cinema module that can go on and
has like a larger camera sensor and they
could attach cinema lenses on it we also
saw a really cool thing at the event
there was an actual red camera that's an
8k camera that shoots 3d and you use the
phone as a viewfinder so you could
actually see 3d images on a screen as
you film it which unless you had a VR
headset you're not able see so another
fun thing about the event I went to is
they had other companies come in
including a Lela and Lela had a platform
that allowed people to take video games
and turn them into this for the format
so they could turn a video game into a
3d game that could be played on the red
hydrogen-1 so that's promising that
RIT's already looking into how you might
get not only moves at TV but also games
on there
I hope it goes on sale it's a really
cool looking phone we know that they've
had a bunch of pre-orders and they've
shut that down for right now last week
we heard four Rison an 18 tear on board
to sell the phone and that's pretty
exciting but we still don't know exactly
when they said maybe August or September
the proof will be when it happens they
said they would actually be selling it
earlier this year and obviously they
push it back but I have a feeling
they're actually gonna sell the phone
eventually when that will be is the big
question
I hope it's sooner than later because it
looks pretty exciting as far as it is
called the hydrogen one phone and that
last word is the part we don't know
about yet because we haven't had a
chance to make a phone call on it or
send a text message or log on to the
Internet I know it runs on Android and
but right now what I saw was a very
early prototype there's at least two
more prototypes they have to go through
before they are ready to actually
manufacture
this phone is not for everybody and I
don't think red thinks it is for
everybody either I think this phone is
for Jim Jannard who runs red I think
he's making the phone he wants I think
he's making it do things that he sees
phones can't do right now like a 3d
display filming this unique content but
also using the modularity that some of
his cinema cameras have and putting that
into a phone I think he's interested in
not only the phone but also making this
whole ecosystem that can support the
phone and perhaps that leads to other
phones from other companies like this I
think if you're someone who's into
cinema the phone with the cinema module
is very interesting because red cameras
are amazing but they are definitely on
the higher end of pricing and if you're
buying a 1200 or $1700 phone and a
module that goes on that they can
actually shoot red its quality cinema
video that will appeal to those people I
also think it's good appeal to people
who are early adopters who just want to
see what this phone is all about but I
don't think this is gonna be something
that you're gonna see in everyone's
pocket that being said a little
background kim Jannard he ran the
company Oakley the sunglass company and
when he was pivoting from that into
making cinema cameras a lot of the same
questions that were asking about the
phone people were asking about how a guy
making sunglasses is gonna make cinema
cameras so I would short sell him an all
effect I'm really excited to see how he
evolved it I think he's got a very
pragmatic approach to it all and I think
that's kind of appealing to me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
