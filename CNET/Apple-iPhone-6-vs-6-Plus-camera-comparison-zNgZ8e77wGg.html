in terms of optics both iphone 6 and
6-plus
that's some pretty significant updates
when it comes to image capture ability
let's walk through some of the
differences
now both cameras have an 8 megapixel
sensor that's on the back of the phone
and it actually protrudes from the body
of the phone now which is a little bit
disappointing for some design purists
out there but it does give a little bit
more room for better optical quality
inside major difference between the two
both 8 megapixels but only the iPhone 6
plus has optical image stabilization
whereas on the 6 it has only digital
image stabilization in our testing and
low-light photography we did see that
the 6 plus was able to take better
pictures in low-light because of this
exposure times are able to be a little
bit slower
that meant that ISOs could be a little
bit lower and that meant less film grain
a little bit better quality and overall
better image quality in low-light but if
you're out there shooting a well-lit
scenario we really couldn't see the
difference between the two in terms of
video capture with really good
stabilization on both in fact video
capture is impressive on both these
devices Apple has new digital image
stabilization for video recording that
looks fantastic on both of these now the
iPhone 6 and the 6 plus can both record
at 1080p 60 frames per second by default
so you'd be much clearer field of view
but if you don't like the 60 frames per
second you can turn that down to 30
frames per second if you prefer if you
want super slo-mo you can now go up to
240 frames per second and get some super
extreme action I'll slow down to share
with your friends the front of the
device we've got FaceTime camera is on
both with now an F 2.2 aperture this
gives you more light into the sensor
which gives you better image quality in
low-light scenarios if you're fond of
taking selfies at the bar this feature
is for you great image quality overall
from the 6 and the 6 plus either the
front or the rear again a 6 plus is
slightly better performance in low-light
photography with the rear 8 megapixel
sensor but overall you going to be
taking great pictures and great videos
from other device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
