combines home automation and
professional monitoring for complete
smart home package the starter pack cost
five hundred and fifty dollars and
includes a 7-inch touchscreen panel and
choice of six sensors viven offers a
wide variety of smart home products in
addition to its starter pack content a
$200 paying indoor camera offers 2-way
talk and one way video allowing you to
monitor a room and speak to its
occupants via the visit app or sky
control panel the same is true for
vivint's doorbell camera which alerts
you to visitors at your front door a
$300 outdoor camera is also available
all three cameras include wide-angle
viewing night vision and twenty second
recorded clips when motion is detected
like all of the vents products these can
be viewed and controlled from your visit
app professional monitoring is the
foundation of vivid smart home structure
a smart home service claim for $40 a
month gives you access to the vivid app
24/7 customer service and professional
monitoring for 50 bucks you'll get the
smart home video service plan which
includes 30 days of continuous DVR
recording for up to four cameras if
you've purchased the Vivint smart drive
for two hundred and forty-nine dollars
though these plans don't require
long-term contracts the biggest downside
to vivid smart home is what you lose if
you don't want monthly monitoring forgo
this service and you'll also lose the
viven app voice control with Alexa or
Google and most major customer service
features without monitoring the vivid
smart home will still sound local alarms
but emergency services won't be called
and you'll lose the ability to monitor
your home via the app overall Vivian's
professionally monitored system and
range of smart home products is robust
if you're ready to commit to monthly
monitoring and want someone to set up
your smart home for you Vivint is a
solid choice
