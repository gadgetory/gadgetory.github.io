buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
mark zuckerberg takes over the world
some more the Gawker hack that ruins
christmas and then yahoo ruins christmas
even more but first it's the gadget of
the week the gadget of the week is my
choice for the top tech pick of the
holiday season a lot of you have asked
so i'm here to tell you it's not an ipad
or a droid x or a new router no no if i
had to buy a tech gift for everyone of
my list this year geek or not it would
be a roku box it's a hundred bucks or
less it offers streaming netflix amazon
VOD hulu plus pandora and more and it is
dead simple to set up so unless somebody
in your family is that annoying person
who refuses to watch TV the Roku is the
perfect tech gift for just about
everybody and there you have it you're
welcome happy shopping and now for the
news time magazine named facebook
co-founder mark zuckerberg its Person of
the Year love him or hate him you cannot
deny that he's made facebook into a
world-changing juggernaut that both
terrifies and delights hundreds of
millions of people he's worth six
billion dollars on paper and he's done
all of that at the tender age of 26 wow
that's amazing I mean he's only a year
older than me haha what have I been with
my life also this weekend gadget
reported that android 2.2 and the
android market might be coming to the
nookcolor early next year that would be
amazing and would turn the noke into
like a full-fledged tablet without you
having to root it awesome well not to
spit your Cheerios but seeing its own
ereader expert david carr noite called
shenanigans on the report no literally i
call shenanigans he says Barnes &amp;amp; Noble
is committed to the nuke developer
program they're not putting the market
on the nook and do not hold your breath
for downloading the kindle app on the
nook without some serious hacking
buzzkill logical but buzzkill in other
news this week Gawker got hacked and the
aftermath is seriously messing up the
interwebs a group calling itself gnosis
says it hacked Gore because they're
arrogant jerks granted but really you
are taking it a little far aren't you
gnosis stole usernames and passwords of
the entire staff and one and a half
million users and the password breach
was then used to launch a Twitter spam
attack noun on Gawker sites are sending
out reminders to their customers to
change their passwords actually Blizzard
went one better to protect its World of
Warcraft folks and just did a blanket
password reset that's a big deal and
come to think of it it's smart because
one of the more interesting things to
come out of this debacle is finding out
the top passwords that people used for
the Gawker sites the top 50 password
list has at number one 123456 followed
by password it lists gems like QWERTY
let me in and fu and also monkey cheese
and Michelle seriously monkey alright my
next cnet password is going to be monkey
cheese but don't hack me Yahoo laid off
four percent of its staff this week
almost 600 people and that's cold right
before Christmas but the tech community
has responded with offers of Bree beer
and jobs at sketchy startups for Yahoo
viens who want to get laid off this time
again next year but enjoy the beer no
actually I'm sorry guys that sucks send
us your resumes Facebook and Twitter
released a list of their top trends for
the year which are informative and also
designed to make me feel old again the
fastest growing meme on Facebook was the
use of HMU or as I might say if I said
such things hit me up you kids get off
my lawn also in top trend news linkedin
busted users with its top ten overused
profile buzzwords including extensive
experience and fast-paced really tho no
synergy week and Twitter put out its
list of the top ten most retweeted
tweets three of which were about Justin
Bieber and one was by him Oh last up in
headlines the US Army wants to give its
soldiers a choice of smartphone either
iPhone or Android go android and also
man i totally want to see some custom
army games for these guys like angry
Kurds
I know right it's so wrong I'm sorry and
finally let's take a look at what's
clogging the tubes there's nothing like
a good movie mashup but when the movies
in question are yogi bear and the
assassination of jesse james by the
coward robert ford well that's just
inspired don't that poster thirsty
you
see now he's deader than the average
bear haha no that is messed up don't you
people know it's Christmas and that's
the buzz report for this year everyone

show the best of the buzz and then after
that a long nice winter's nap before we
