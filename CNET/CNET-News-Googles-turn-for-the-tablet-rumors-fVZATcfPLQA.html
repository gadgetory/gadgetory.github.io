I'm car Tsuboi cnet.com my guest today
is Casey Newton senior writer in kc we
have a big google event coming up on
monday october 29th in new york tell us
about some of the announcements that are
coming out of that event supposedly
that's right well we're expecting to see
a ton of new hardware at this event you
know a lot of events you'll see one two
new pieces of hardware here some of the
things we're expecting to see from
google for starters an expansion of
their tablet line so you might remember
the earlier this summer Google came out
with the google nexus 7 tablet right and
pretty successful they still about three
million of these things well at this
event they're supposedly going to be
unveiling a new 32 gigabyte version of
the tablet the first one is 16 gigabytes
okay and they're going to be showing off
a version that has cellular connectivity
so you can use it when you're off of
Wi-Fi so we're going to see that but
then on top of all that Google's rumored
to be working with Samsung on a 10-inch
Nexus tab wow so this would be the first
time we've seen a big kind of premium
Nexus tablet from google and i think i
was reading something about some price
rumors how may be one of those 7-inch
tablets could be lowered in price that's
right so when the Nexus 7 tablet came
out earlier this year it was two hundred
dollars pretty competitive price point
particularly compared with some of the
Amazon Kindle devices sure the rumor is
that with these new Nexus 7 tablets
coming out that first version is going
to drop down from 200 to ninety-nine
dollars Wow for 16 gigs that's a pretty
great deal and what about other hardware
announcements well the one other thing
that we've heard is we're going to see a
nexus 4 smartphone made by LG they'll be
a modified version of the Optimus G so a
lot of people are excited to find out a
little bit more about a new Nexus
smartphone running the latest version of
Android and with some pretty great
internals this is a one event a lot of
announcements now going back to the
tablets we've got some new new tablets
coming out from google obviously we had
apple's ipad mini announcement recently
what's your take on the whole tablet
landscape and where are these google
tablets fit in that's a great question
and something actually wrote about today
and
it remains to be seen how good these new
google tablets look like and we should
sort of reserve our judgment until we
see that but from the analysts I've
spoken with everyone is expecting the
ipad mini to be a big hit and from the
moment it goes on sale it's kind of
going to own that mid-range tablet
market analyst I've spoken with say that
on a lower end of the market the the
amazon kindle fire the barnes &amp;amp; noble
nook tablets those should continue to do
pretty well but the tablets that are
kind of aspiring to be more ipad mini
like like the google nexus 7 tablet
those are going to be really challenged
because of the same old complaints we've
been hearing for months now right they
don't have all the apps they don't have
that same suite of services you get with
the iPad and they don't have the premium
feel of the hardware quality so maybe on
monday Google will be able to address
some of these concerns but unless they
do I think you're going to see the ipad
mini just being hugely successful this
holiday I almost regardless of price
point interesting thank you so much
