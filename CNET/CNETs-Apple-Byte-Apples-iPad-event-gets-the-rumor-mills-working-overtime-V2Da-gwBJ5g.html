to the apple pie for all the good and
bad inside the world of Apple iPad
rumors are a dime a dozen right now plus
we'll announce our winners for our
gelaskins giveaway now you probably
already know that Apple sent out their
official invites for their March seventh
ipad event in San Francisco I was kind
of let down because I was really hoping
for an entire event just focusing on the
classic ipod and mac mini but oh well
now apple's invitation says we have
something you really have to see and
touch you know i've been using that line
on girls for years now so why don't you
get original apple it doesn't work you
want some pie you're just told me no my
darling your tea Wow let's taste good Oh
Brian I wanted this now the invite also
started the endless flood of speculation
could Apple really be removing the
physical home button to an all touch
interface or is that just an iPad turned
sideways well let me burst your bubble
people after repair Labs has reportedly
acquired the front glass piece and
digitizer for the next gen ipad in both
black and white they point out it has a
different ribbon cable connection from
the previous generation and look closely
that's a home button then everyone went
all Ultimate Warrior saying things like
look at how sharp that icon is clearly
it must be the retina display you know
they're probably right but can you
really really tell that from the image
look I see two sentences call me crazy
but maybe it's two devices they're
announcing and one of them is an iPad
and the other is a product from Apple we
haven't seen yet people do your lives
really revolve around every single thing
Apple is doing is this so bad that you
would sell your soul to devil and do a
show every week about Apple just to pay
your bills what's happening what's
happening what's happening brian Tong
here apparently it is now with the
announcement in less than a week the
hype is at an all-time high and the
rumor mills are firing on all cylinders
and I guarantee you there will be 20
more by the time you watch this didja
times has an
always been the most reputable apple
source but it didn't stop there claims
that will see a 16 and 32 gig ipad 3 as
well as an eight gig ipad 2 that will
cover the lower end of the market for
Apple then because they need another
iPad story for what's coming next digit
times reports mass production of a
smaller 7.85 inch iPad will start in the
third quarter of this year now 9to5 mac
has their own report saying there will
be at least three different iPad
variants for a Wi-Fi 3g and 4g flavors
that will be available for pre-order on
the 7th or a few days later and with
apple TV inventory exhausted retail
chains everywhere the other device could
possibly be the new Apple TV guys and
gals it's getting so bad that sky Bet
was taking actual bets on the ipad 3
specs and then had to pull them because
it was getting a little out of hand see
how cray cray this thing is getting this
is bigger than Liz sanity Nixon beat the
wizard seven straight times get up and
throw it down baby you ride that wave
surfing tool internet okay it's things
back down to earth a little bit with
other exciting news happening around the
Apple world and it's all about the
revolutionary Lytro camera that launched
this week and it's changing how we take
pictures and how we interact with them
it's Mac only right now so check out
this look at the camera and some of its
new features
hey guys Brian song here with cnet.com
and we wanted to give you a first look
at some of the new hot features for the
Lytro camera is text most buzz-worthy
camera and it's shipping right now from
Lytro com now to catch you up to speed
the lytro camera is unlike any other
with a unique design that uses light
field technology to capture all the
light information color intensity and
direction the light is moving in a
single picture now you won't need a
focus you just take a picture and with
all this information you can choose the
subject or your object you want to focus
on after the fact with what they call
their living pictures now they've added
a few new improvements to their
interface where you can swipe from the
bottom of the screen and you'll get a
menu bar for battery life and the amount
of picture space available but you also
get a new mode called creative mode by
default the camera is set to light rose
everyday mode with their default
settings that's set to a 3x optical zoom
but it has limitations with how you can
compose shots creative mode unlocks the
8x optical zoom range and allows you to
control and composure shots like let's
take an extreme macro shot we've seen
shots like this in popular food
photography and also to showcase
textures or you've seen portrait shots
where subject is in focus but the
background is completely blurred out it
will also allow you to zoom in and out
of a subject after you've set the focal
point for a more dramatic effect and
better shot composition control now this
is all part of the creative mode but all
in focus mode that point of shoot camera
users are familiar with will be a
software update in the first half of
this year now you can also interact with
your pictures directly on the camera
screen but sharing is a big piece of the
puzzle now the software lives locally on
the camera and you can install it when
you plug it in it's only currently Mac
compatible but lytro says there will be
of Windows version of the software
coming by the end of 2012 now each
picture is stored locally on your
computer that takes up about 16 megs
through their Lytro app you'll upload
your living pictures that are stored on
their own servers they said it's
unlimited storage right now and they'll
process them down to about a 500k 21 Meg
file depending on how many multiple
perspectives you have now you can then
share that living picture through social
networks like Facebook Twitter and
Google Plus or embed them in light shows
flash or html5 player you'll also be
able to right click on a picture and
convert it into a 1080 x 1080 jpeg file
that's compressed down to size for you
now the lightshow camera is only
available through their website at light
road
starting at 399 for an aching model and
they say it will be available in unnamed
retail channels later this year so there
you have it I'm Bryant on with your
quick first look at some of the new
features with the launch of the truly
revolutionary light show Cameron I'm a
huge fan already and just think this is
the first version of the device and it's
a technology that's only going to get
better all right in laptop news it at
times claims apples expected to launch a
thinner 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro
sometime in April now there's no word
about a revised 17 inch model in the
report and even after some reported
delays with Intel's Ivy Bridge chipset
it sounds a little too early for me but
we'll wait and see now I've also always
believed the next platform Apple should
go into after the TV that's if they
really do it is cars and maybe there's
some real evidence to support that idea
now car news China reports that newly
discovered automotive job listings on
linkedin claims Apple is seeking a
supplier quality engineer and new
product integration supervisor pointing
to the possibility that the Cupertino
kids are finally looking to extend the
business into car related products it
wouldn't be the first time after
rumblings in 2007 that Apple is working
with Volkswagen on its own integrated
car concept and if they take too long to
do it mercedes-benz has announced plans
for integration between Apple's iPhone
4s and they're really affordable a class
line including support for this serie
virtual assistant it will communicate
through Mercedes custom digital drive
style app and the a-class line will make
its world premiere at the geneva auto
show this year so maybe they could at
least throw in an iphone with the
purchase of the car guys maybe okay all
right let's get to the winners of our
gelaskins forty dollar gift card
giveaway we asked you the Apple biters
for the names of the different kinds of
mountain lions and you delivered correct
responses included the Puma Panther hat
to mount and mountain cat probably look
exactly like thanks to wikipedia so
