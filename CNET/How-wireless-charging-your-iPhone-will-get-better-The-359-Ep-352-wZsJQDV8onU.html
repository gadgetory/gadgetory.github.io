is episode 352 of the 359 podcast I'm
BVG and your host today our Ben Fox
Rubin and Roger Chang what's up guys
good morning how you doing great how are
you very very calm very calm oh yeah I'm
in a mellow Zen stay after watching
history get made yesterday which we'll
be talking about later the nice little
hitchhikers guide reference I was thrown
into the little car I'll talk about on
the show I know what you're talking
about yeah okay I know what you're
talking is there is there still a live
shot of Starman somewhere in outer space
there is yeah I mean it was last night
it wasn't last yeah yeah and we're over
a hundred thousand people watching it so
so check it out as you can figure out
we're gonna be talking about the SpaceX
launch we'll also be talking about
wireless charging and how it's gonna get
a lot lot better and then lastly we'll
talk about uber and lame-o limos
alphabets self-driving car unit and the
ongoing legal battle and good ol Travis
comic making headlines again so that's
not the name you used for him earlier
good old that's a star man right there
you sure you know come on beautiful okay
the show all right let's do it
as always if you have any questions
about these topics I'll leave them in
the comments section Brian will pick out
the best and we will get to them in
three minutes and 59 seconds from three
to welcome to the 359 I'm Roger Cheng
I'm Ben Fox Raven
do you have an iPhone 8 or an iPhone X
and have tried out the wireless charging
on it chances are you might have been a
little disappointed it's a little slow
you can't exactly top it off top off the
battery quickly but the good news is
it's gonna get a lot better our own
Jessica dual-core breaks down some of
the advancements coming in to wireless
charging over the next year from faster
charge up times to potentially sending
power over the air
mm-hmm Ben you're you don't have a do
you have a phone with a wireless
charging keep it going right you're yeah
have some fun yeah yeah the SA you use
it no I don't why not because like it
came with like a quick charge thing yeah
it works pretty well for me already and
it's oftentimes much more effective than
wireless charging yeah I mean they have
the wireless charge thing and it costs
something like thirty dollars but right
I didn't really have much of a need for
it right because the quick charge works
pretty well already yeah that's sort of
the issue and I think especially for I
think iPhone users who've been excited
about wireless charging just realize
that you put this thing down your pad
and like it takes hours to like to get
how many full charge is he really oh
yeah and that's because apples jumping
in this a little bit late there but the
standards have sort of not been
finalized with point where they're
they're allowing for faster charging
that's going to come soon so is do you
need to get air power like the new air
exactly air power is supposed to work
with a faster standard that's not coming
out for a while they haven't really
talked about when come out but there's
that I think the future though is way
more exciting the idea of be able to
broadcast power over the air yeah you
walk into this room and all of a sudden
your phone or your your your speakers
start charging wirelessly yeah that
being said that has been a long promised
thing in tech and I'll believe it when I
see it obviously there are a handful of
startups that are working on this
technology already I mean like
technically you could do this at your
house right now but it's still a little
bit well it's not that good I think the
one reason or the one reason we're
optimistic is that the FCC has approved
this look there there's actually there's
actually approvals and there are
companies who are you know fully back to
a lot of funding who are able to kind of
invest in this area it's not gonna scope
with phone you're not gonna see in your
phone right away but I can imagine
smaller devices like headphones are
gonna get that capability sooner rather
than later it's yeah not just a pipe
dream so next up we want to talk about
the spacex falcon heavy launch Congrats
Elon Musk for successfully launching the
most powerful rocket since the Saturn 5
in 1967 and the capper he attached a
astronaut dummy driving a Tesla on the
rock and you got your sea star man yeah
a live feed and there's this great
Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy
reference
right the dashboard says don't panic
love that if you're a big Douglas Adams
fan can really appreciate that but while
this was going on live there were a
handful of people watching this in the
office and that's kind of like yeah
whatever not interested but then I kind
of got curious and checked it out later
it was really cool there were the side
boosters that then simultaneously landed
at the same time and there were a lot of
people on Twitter talking about like you
know NASA used to do this we were so
proud of like the space mission so you
know there's all this like camaraderie
around space yeah glories of it just
know the event was the second biggest
livestream in YouTube's history with
over 2.3 million concurrent views
alright lastly former uber CEO Travis
cosmic is back in headlines he took the
stand in day two of the uber whammo
trial of her self-driving car technology
one damning email know that he'd
requested or uber had requested data
road maps and a pound of flesh yeah
which is a weird weird thing to say and
when asked what he meant he couldn't
really could really remember he said he
said I used that term a lot yes
maybe on a roll and no checkout Kent
Sherman's feature on the knowledge this
is the special test that drivers have to
take in order to drive a black cab in
London basically you're supposed to be
able to drive or navigate without a map
or GPS from one point to another in
anywhere in central London mm-hmm and it
takes years to learn and these drivers
say that it gives them better insight to
getting around the city than GPS for
these stores or more check us out at CNN
I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox Ruben thanks
for listening
all right thanks everybody for sitting
through the recording of the audio
podcast you can download that later for
now I'm gonna go ahead and jump back
into the chat and start fishing out some
of your best comments and questions
about the historical day about wireless
charging so actually when we were
talking about that when you were talking
about that there was a video playing
that we had surfaced from CES this year
and I don't remember the name of that
company but that's that broadcast power
we were talking about yeah yeah do you
recall what that is can you expand a
little bit because seeing it in action
was totally badass
there are a couple of companies doing
this
sure specifically which company are
French I know energist is one of them
that they're they're trying to do sort
of the idea is like you'd have a it
works almost like a wireless modem you'd
have like a central modem either table
you know mounted on the wall of the
ceiling and it just said it just sends
out signals like Wi-Fi but it's power do
you want do you want do want do want
yeah alright oh you do want I do want it
yeah the three companies that Jessica
mentioned in her story are aasaiya
energy switch you mentioned in power
test oh yeah an apparently power cast
was the furthest along in development
and they're the ones that got the FCC
approval
obviously FCC approval in my perspective
is really important because like you
know this is a brand new technology and
I think a lot of people are obviously
concerned about health risk when it
relates to shooting power over the air
like electricity whatever so so their
their argument is this is this is no
more dangerous than Wi-Fi signals
essentially that said it is kind of
freaky the idea like power is going
through your body and the health risk
that that might theoretically pose yeah
it depends how people really look at it
if they look at it as something
completely new and different or they
look at it it's similar to your cell
phone which is sending and receiving
data and signals all the time so it's
board a note that you know you're not
just like wireless charging on your
wireless pad right now it's pretty slow
like this kind of over-the-air wireless
charging would be super super slow
because because they you know
broadcasting more power than just our
look a little bit of a trickle is would
be would be dangerous so you're saying
that I don't walk into a room and
literally a lightning bolt shoots into
my phone a physical lightning bolt yes
it shocked you so much it's dramatic no
it's it's the term is called trickle
charge the idea is like you're just
there all the time right it doesn't
matter where your phone is it's just
constantly getting it and the phone is
smart enough to know when it's already
been topped off yes so it's not trying
to give more charge than your phone
actually in terms of the sort of early
applications of this I
told like things like wireless
headphones hearing aids devices are kind
of small that don't but it that's tough
to charge it requires constant charge
that would benefit the most room so yeah
so one of the ones that that I thought
of that I didn't get to mention this
during the podcast is like different IOT
sensors they might have around in the
house that might actually be embedded in
the wall that you can't actually you
wouldn't be able to easily change the
battery at all yeah whether it's up on
the ceiling or inside the wall something
like that and depending on what
different types of sensors you have in
your house this is something that could
actually ensure that the battery will
just stay charged yes same with the
wireless speakers right like with an
echo Speaker I think imagine if it was
getting a wireless charge from just
something broadcast from the room you
can move it anywhere there's literally
no wires connected that thing anymore
right
so elephant in the room Matthew data
points out have we heard from the
hippies about how terrible wireless
power is now I wouldn't use language
maybe that accusatory but damn it this
elephant in the room yeah how long until
we find out there's some dangers
associated with this that's I mean
that's why I think the FCC approval is
so important because they've done some
of their due diligence now but things
change yes you see has been wrong in the
price pressure to do long term health
studies for any type of things like this
that sounds like they have their eyes on
this ears to the ground concurrently
because this is a weird kind of risky
situation yeah well look it's I think
it's an area that's gonna get a lot of
scrutiny
I would I would argue more scrutiny than
normal because it is such a freaky
concept I think a lot of people are
gonna want to take a really close look
at what those potential risks are yeah I
agree
and it's it's if you convey to people in
the right way that it's a very low
amount of power that's being fed through
and and related to something else in
their life I mean like everybody knows
radio waves are all over the place
right radios Wi-Fi raves I think that's
the analogy that I keep getting I'm
hearing from folks in the industry like
it's it's basically like Wi-Fi if you're
comfortable with Wi-Fi signals going
through the room going through your body
then this is the same this is basically
a kin to that mmm-hmm I would love to
have like a layman's chart to explain
that to me because I'm not a physicist
understand how power is related to a
power converted into airwaves
yay essentially not really sure how I
think it's magic might be sorcery this
is out like that right when you talk to
people about it I mean just the idea
that like power gets transmitted over
the air that seems like kind of
unbelievable
if you really kind of break it down well
manufactured power in the past we've
been able to convert things like solar
and yeah yeah but actually taking power
in one place and then moving it to
another it is the fascinating content
yeah like one other so this would be
really far out there but there is a
company I think it's called solar
something or other solar roads they're
there they basically turn the roads into
solar panels the concept of having an
electric vehicle that could then be
charged by the road while it's driving
right yep could significantly increase
the mileage and we're one of those cars
in a similar application and as we talk
about that toss-up between you know
keeping it at a low power low wattage so
that it's less dangerous and how much
that is the toss-up is like what is it
is it charging anything worthwhile
certain joy points out what about drones
like as of right now that could be a
good petri dish to test out low power
transmission before you apply to
something like a full that passenger
vehicle I would say that's a little bit
tough because how do you get that
especially with drones moving oh yeah I
don't know how you direct the power to
that drone open air that we use my own
pod technology where it directs the
music beamforming it beam for me that
Wi-Fi over that power right call it
right now 2019 buzzword beam foreign
Power Beam form power again I like this
stuff this stuff is all a lot of this is
like wish lists kooky stuff but we'll
see what's possible I mean like if if
that they do end up creating a lot of
movement with this it is really
interesting to think of what could
actually be possible with this type of
technology so there's a recurring name
in the chat right now you might have
heard of a Nikola Tesla say this is all
his dream coming true
I like that imagine saw he said didn't
Tesla want to give this to us a long
time ago it should be fine Nikola Tesla
also tried to invent the earthquake
machine just pointing that out to
everybody
whoa if we recall that little bit of his
three no I didn't even know that panel
patented it being able to generate
enough energy to topple buildings that
is terrifying right I will say there's
there's our middle ground pretty mantle
crazy over the air wireless charging and
just stuck on a pad there's something
that's like magnetic resonance which
allows it to kind of jump off like a
feet or two and the idea being like you
could have a charging plate on the base
of your garage you drive your evey car
right over it and then when you park and
garage it automatically starts charging
without having to plug anything in yeah
I'm like the plug can be cumbersome it's
not like I have an electronic vehicle or
anything but right you have to like
install it you have to plug it in every
having something that's a little bit
simpler than that might be bad so I
spoke to a couple called electricity a
year ago and they mentioned that they
were shooting for cars in 2020 to have
that capability
Merilee as someone who's worked in audio
engineering for 15-plus years yep kill
all the cables yeah yeah here you more
questions Megan Moyer will Apple be able
to equal Androids wireless charging I
think that's the goal with a plan yeah
and especially with Erica nothing are
they gonna do it yes because I think
everyone the whole Apple is basing its
wireless charging technology off of this
cheese standard and so basically it's as
soon as it catches up to the cheese
standard which Samsung already kind of
had a head start on and made some tweaks
to go a little faster but as soon as
they catch up to like sort of where do
those standard it's gonna be I think
they're all gonna be comparable after a
while mm-hmm and then in addition to
that Jessica mentions in our story that
the the expectation is is that these
wireless charging capabilities
especially the Qi standard are
eventually going to meet and then
surpass wired technology right I think
is pretty interesting that's not for a
little while right now it's not like an
immediate goal or anything like that but
once you actually can do better than
Wired that's when I think customers
start to pay a lot more attention to it
right now so right now the Qi standard
is for 15 watts you able to get 40 watts
so that's a lot of watts I guess so
so why don't we talk about space or as
tim korean command &amp;amp; Conquer said spiced
wild dream says this was disappointing
Wow heavy launch is such a failure
because they lost their core booster
utter failure that's pretty strong
language in Johnson saying did you guys
find odd and disappointing that SpaceX
kept quiet about the core booster
landing failure and the command center
audio of its loss went viral so what is
our takeaway from this is does this
stain the entire process because I think
by and large we were calling this a
success yeah I mean losing the core
booster is not ideal but I mean it was a
successful launch regardless and this is
this is probably one of the more
significant launches in in decades right
with yeah even had anything this
ambitious for a long time yeah not only
that but like SpaceX has also had
complete failures in trying to do
different launches so this was this was
obviously I would probably say this is a
positive takeaway for them and when when
you're doing something like this that
the that is so cutting edge there is an
expectation that it's not all going to
work perfectly yeah absolutely
so we were talking earlier about a
little hitchhikers Easter Egg yeah I'm
pulling it up right now of Starman Ben
would you like to enlighten us and what
you were referencing Starman yeah
there's a so the there's a YouTube video
right now just a live feed of a dummy in
the Tesla that you can see in outer
space just kind of hanging out and there
were over a hundred thousand people
watching this last night now it's down
it's trickle down to fifteen thousand
people but if you're you know kind of
bored and when I hang out with Star man
in outer space you can now that's kind
of cool it's kind of peaceful
yes very then yeah are you seeing I'm I
just caught okay now I'm getting another
advertisement but baby I just saw him
like just go by go by the beautiful
mother earth right there yeah YouTube
right now let's go and point out just
low of dead center on the screen right
in the middle of the dashboard where the
control panel would be what's that
phrase Ben
panic Oh hitchhikers I haven't wait what
well you ever read his records guide to
the galaxy
no I have I have the bug I just have I
have luck I have the book I cracked it
open and got as far as I I mean I feel
like it would be perfect for your sense
of humor there was something about like
always have a towel with you yeah silly
this is practical advice man it is
probably zap now have you have a towel
with me right now so Matthew Dodgers
concerned over spaceman or star man
sorry star man are we tracking him how
are we sure that won't become space
debris like could it punch a hole in the
ISS oh that's isn't it connect the
International Space Station has incurred
a car accident it's attached to the
rocket or the attach the rocket like so
that's what I thought it or a path which
has likely been pre-programmed a
thousand times over yeah avoid any other
potential paths that are programmed up
there yes I would hope so boy does it
just get released oh it goes off and we
need a live stream cut away to Elon
Musk's face just do you ever uh have you
ever watched heavy metal no the the
opening of that it's like an animated
movie but the opening scene of it is
like an astronaut driving like a
convertible yeah yeah and it lands it
and it's like this is very much like I
feel like very heavy metal vibe to it
right another thing the next thing that
must meet the launch into outer space is
a giant flying turtle okay like make
everybody on acid be like wait a minute
that is either is that the hitchhiker's
reference or is that a Stephen King
reference it's I don't even know it's
like a reference to some like tapestries
that I've seen on Haight and Ashbury oh
okay what you've never seen flying
turtle in outer space yeah reference to
like I don't know what the direct
reference I thought that was a music
reference but for what it's worth Roger
you get bonus points today for
referencing a heavy metal that one is
one of my favorites of all time
it is gnarly as hell it is dark it is
evil and you know who was from know
Kevin Eastman I'm Ninja Turtle Fame oh
really
yeah it was a
election a short story is based around
characters that were developed in his
heavy metal magazine if no one's ever
seen it for what it's worth it's super
not safer work super not safer daddy
under the age of like 40 yeah is is
animated but it is one of those like
super dark super adult turtles by the
way they're apparently making it appear
injustice I was literally just watching
that trailer before we walked over here
to the studio
shall I go ahead and bring it up sure
why not whoa give me a second talking
about outer space is really gone for
something yeah tangents here come on
who's not excited about this
I'm quasi excited only because I mean
I'm a big turtles fan but the game
hasn't played like I'm playing a proper
video gaming just my kid was born so
it's hard to get excited about console
games now oh come on
this looks really really fun and those
injustice games are solid in they are
they are I've played them
I played the earlier ones but I haven't
playing justice to I haven't yet either
but just as a geeky turtle fan you know
the kid grew up in the 80s
that's not sure you know what I did play
well we did play cuphead and Dragonball
Fighters II I played one round of ink
got my butt kicked that was my my
limited experience here in the office
with console gaming I'm only playing I
just started playing Mirror's Edge
catalyst oh really
yeah it was on sale if like five bucks
the other day who I heard mixed reviews
about it so I waited how much five bucks
well it was five bucks I think was a
flash sale so it's gone are the Ninja
Turtles part of the DC Universe no not
officially but as of late there's been a
lot of crossovers there's some rumors
that there's going to be a Batman into
turtle movie because they've already
done three Batman Ninja Turtle comic
book crossovers with the current
incantation now Batman is way too dark
to have Ninja Turtles can be dark yeah
it's been dark they started dark yeah
started darker than Batman okay so by
the way anybody that's checking in to
the podcast right now we started by
talking about wireless charging and his
face somehow we have it's pretty clear
Ninja Turtles pretty clear star man
a very strong influence on this
conversation hey we're excited again we
should be excited again yeah absolutely
all right I'm going one last skim across
the questions to see if there's anything
good to keep the conversation going but
we are just about out of time what else
we've got coming up that we might want
to mention I wanted T's dark there
occurs still in the uber wham-o trials I
could go on here yeah exactly she's
there now from day three you can expect
a story in a few hours once the session
wraps up but she's already in the trial
tweeting away if you want to follow her
for any updates on the the courtroom
drama there yeah and definitely check
out Ken german's piece on the knowledge
this is part one of the two-part series
he's gonna have a second part tomorrow
kind of looking at some of the
technology but it's just fascinating the
lengths that London cab drivers have to
go to actually qualify to become a
London cab driver mm-hmm it literally
takes years and you basically have to
memorize all essential London which is
crazy yeah
it requires an insane amount of spatial
intelligence I can only do that you
couldn't do it yeah I bet you those
cabbies are probably really good at
chess because oh yeah and you have when
you have that level of spatial
intelligence usually it can you know
track over into other things but you can
see why those drivers would be a little
bit resentful of uber drivers who
basically just your only qualification
is you've got to film yeah which is
that's one of the issues that I think a
lot of people have with those
ride-hailing services yeah is that they
they've just completely circumvented a
lot of the other regulations so there
you go yeah I mean look we'll see how
the uber trial goes you know if it
doesn't go over swea could have
significant impact as we said yesterday
and there are autonomous driving efforts
and yeah well we'll keep a very close
eye on that trial one thing that I was
trying to allude to that you guys
completely missed on is what's coming up
in two weeks
yeah little thing show r350 ninth
episode which which is an absolutely
arbitrary number whenever
comes down yeah I think we do want to
read somehow we made it to 359 so that's
true we made that number of episodes
it's pretty impressive hmm
thanks to the audience thanks to you
guys yes yeah we'll be doing a very very
extra-special extra-long episode it'll
be 3 hours and 59 minutes starts around
the same time as usual 11:00 a.m.
Eastern but will run for hours and we'll
be on YouTube live Facebook livestream
periscope all the usual places and it's
gonna be crazy when we partnering with a
nonprofit called mouse mouse not org
which is focusing on STEM education for
kids and helping to improve diversity in
tech so totally worthwhile cause but
we're gonna be talking about that and
we're just gonna be when we hang out
with a lot of your favorites the
regulars you know Scott Stein Dan
Ackerman Katz Meyer yeah all through all
get ready for you all those guys all the
experts to get all your questions that
we can't answer ready since we'll
actually have real experts on hand to
talk about all these things gadgets tech
issues all that stuff I mean we got four
hours to kill so so what a lot it's
Wednesday February 21st
yeah tell your friends and we'll try to
get a schedule up so you can get kind of
a ballpark idea of yeah laying out cuz
we'll have a revolving door of the
guests coming in and out throughout the
day and I'm gonna have a pee bottle
underneath the desk because I won't be
able to leave yeah yeah sorry man
so yeah okay forward to have anybody
around thanks for all the yucks so far
yeah this is great
super fun to do and yeah we hope to see
a you know every day up until and beyond
but especially on the 21st
yep and on that note all right go for it
you liked anything you saw our heard
here check us out on SEANET the podcast
is available on iTunes tune in stitcher
feedburner google play music and the
amazon echo NC not calm sorry I just
have to thanks I'll see I'm doing it
eventually all right take everybody
season yeah tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
