missions will demystify head-up displays
because they're coming and the new
thinking on distracted driving it's time
to check the tech pc cars differently on
the road and under the hood but also
check the tech and are known for telling
it like it is ugly is included at no
extra cost
the good the bad the bottom line this is
cement on cars
welcome to CNET on cars the show all
about high-tech cars and modern driving
i'm brian coulis if i want to do a top
five of your most requested cars that we
take a look at this year based on your
email the acura TLX would be pretty near
the top at a time when acura is trying
to redefine where it sits in the world
of automotive brands and what it really
does uniquely the TLX draws some pretty
sharp lines let's drive this all-new
model per your request and check the
tech
this may look like a car it's actually a
lot more than that pimping for Acura
which has a brand could use a little
more definition to really help answer
what is inaccurate and this is the TL
actually think is gonna really do it P
Alexis comes standard with all-wheel
steering but optional is the all-wheel
drive a v6 like we have starts at 36 1
then we loaded up CNET style the tech
package is around four grand for
navigation GLS audio forward collision
warning lane departure blind spot lane
keep assist but if you want to get
adaptive cruise with collision
mitigation braking and technology to
keep you from leaving the road that's
another thirty to fifty now inside we've
got this Acura oddity of dual screens
the one above response to the controller
the one below responds to your finger
little silly when you've got
entertainment on both of them but it
gets more interesting when you hit the
nav button and now you've that full
screen navigable in tert Ament rig below
for example and it gets silly again if
you want to type in an address and you
get two different keyboards but in
general I think most drivers are gonna
appreciate the additional breathing room
beyond that apps are limited to media
apps Pandora and AHA which are well
integrated with all the other audio
that's smart but if you're looking for
other apps that are not about basically
streaming they're not gonna find them
here on an accurate yet you've never
lacked for choice when it comes to media
in recent Acuras and they back it up
with the LS audio which is one of the
better performing sets of amps and
speakers I've listened to Siri eyes free
is supported in your TLX if you've got a
modern iPhone the rear camera has three
angles all of which are sort of mushy in
the day and sort of insensitive to light
at night
now up here in the snout we've got the
three and a half liter v6 as we
mentioned earlier huh leave that on 290
horsepower 267 pound feet of torque good
numbers and we're coming out of an
engine that of course has direct
injection variable valve timing front
wheel drives the basic setup you can get
all-wheel drive and it's that super
handling all-wheel drive that Acura does
which is a pretty amazing system now if
you get super handling all-wheel drive
you also get auto start-stop on the
engine to save fuel interestingly
without all-wheel drive you don't
therefore in our car were looking at 21
city 34 highway 0 to 16 uh pretty
sprightly 5.8 seconds let's go for a
ride and see how it feels so there's
this pause stuff work I think it really
does maybe it's the power of suggestion
just reading about it's got me thinking
it but as you come into a corner the
rear end gets real tight II kind of
tucks itself in that to me feels like
some rear-wheel steering not any kind of
torque vectoring because we don't have
that this car doesn't have the all-wheel
drive now we do have the bigger of the
two engines of course the power is ample
but it's not overwhelming this isn't the
kind of car that has an edge to its
power even if you get into Sport Plus
which really sharpens things up it's a
nice car it's a sophisticated delivery
of power not brutal fun to corner with
it
that rear end is doing something special
that's neat I'll tell you I'm torn
between this gearbox and the DCT that
you'd get with the four which I imagine
is sharper this one's just a little too
behind the engine
you've got great response from this
motor and then the gear changes take
about a heartbeat too long going either
direction last impressions I leave you
with on this car is that it feels quite
light part of that is how the throttles
map how the transmission shifts but also
how the suspension is keeping things
from plowing it's overall a very tidy
experience juggling a phone while
driving not a good idea in anyone's book
but as this habit has entered our
driving culture why are accident rates
still going down the new thinking on
distraction in a mall
as cellphones have taken off so has
handheld calling behind the wheel
doubling from around 3% to about six
percent of drivers observe between 2000
and 2005 but since then it seems to have
leveled off at around five or six
percent observed texting behind the
wheel has increased from 0.2 percent
2005 to about one and a half percent
observed in 2012 and at the same time
auto accident fatalities and reported
crashes keep falling part of that is due
to separate innovations in safety
technology but to other things seem to
be going on here the Insurance Institute
for Highway Safety and Virginia Tech
Transportation Institute found that
while juggling a phone is in arguably
risky it also reduces other distracting
driver behaviors we'd be talking to
passengers declines from 12 and a half
percent to a little over five fiddling
with climate or radio controls dropped
from 3.6 percent to 1.3 eating behind
the wheel goes from 3 percent to less
than 1 even talking singing and dancing
drops dramatically from over five
percent to just over 2 secondly they
found that drivers on the phone tend to
slow down an average of 5 to 6 miles per
hour which may infuriate you behind them
but does buy them some reaction time
nobody says handheld phone use behind
the wheel is a good idea but distraction
has been here before the phone and it is
the enemy not just the phone so it pays
to double check that as you put the
phone down
you aren't just busying your hands eyes
and mind with something else
welcome back to see net on cars coming
to you from our home at the Mount Tam
Motor Club just north of the Golden Gate
Bridge well until recently head-up
displays in cars were a kind of
futuristic or be found only in really
expensive cars and even at that they
look pretty awful like something ripped
out of an old Atari machine now things
have changed head-up displays are
looking great portraying really useful
information and showing up in a lot of
cars at different price points makes for
a timely and important car Tech 101 but
in the car they're actually after the
same thing providing situational
awareness
it really is projecting a transparent
image but that image is also focused out
in the distance so then when you view
information the road stays in focus at
the same time so everything is within
your field of view the automotive hood
actually dates back to the late 80s the
olds cutlass supreme had a very simple
one a very crude one by the late 90s we
saw a color hood on a Corvette and in
the late 2000s they really came into
their home we started seeing some really
nicely rendered one on BMWs in
particular with all kinds of interesting
infographics and really sharp colors
today's HUDs give you glanceable access
to a fairly common set of information
points first off is speed they almost
all do that navigation prompts are very
common certainly when destination is
entered rpm shows up on some cars and
have an advanced sport profile a few
will show g-forces again this is a
performance car thing
now generally is skewed in hood design
is information that is not mission
critical to the job of driving so don't
look for media information metatags
about your music and such you don't eat
that in front of the road climate
settings ditto
and fuel temperature or other gauge
indicators other than speed and rpm so
far still live on the instrument panel
one of the biggest changes in HUDs is
not in the hood itself but in the way
they're being adopted this is a big deal
this year 2014 some 38 models of cars
are available in the u.s. that have a
HUD it's either standard or optional
that's nearly three times the number of
cars available with a HUD five years ago
according to Edmunds it's a bellwether
number if not entirely watershed and
there's an aftermarket in a country
where 16 million or so new cars are sold
each year but 230 million cars are on
the road this is important
not long ago Garmin had a unit you'd sit
right up here where a factory HUD would
go and they would give you a very text
oriented readout largely around
navigation of course startup navdy is
bringing up much richer version of that
idea to market soon there's this going
to deal with media communications as
well as nav of course and do it with
gesture recognition as well as voice can
you use hand gestures in your voice to
control read new text there's a major
problem with many of us being addicted
to our phone and you know not wanting to
stop using our phone while while we're
driving a car so we really wanted to
make using your phone in in the car
dramatically better and more intuitive
but also far more safer and we think you
know the head-up display technology is a
key part of the answer to that problem
the barriers that HUD technology is
conquering in the dash are largely three
first their size the space behind your
gauges where the projector needs to live
is tiny hot and under high demand by a
lot of other stuff but the tech is
getting smaller or lives on top of an
edge then there's cost it's coming down
as makers of the core technology are
gambling on mass manufacturing giving
the efficiencies we've seen before and
the aftermarket Tech is arriving in the
few hundred dollar range and there's
comprehension consumers are becoming
aware of what a HUD can do and are
developing a visual information appetite
that it needs to satisfy you can thank a
lot of this to the smart phone and
tablet revolution of the last decade or
so now the end game on HUDs
is to make them a primary display not a
secondary or in many cases non-existent
display today and then that logically
leads to getting
other displays this LCD in the center
console this dashboard in front of you
the instrument panel
maybe those don't need to be there at
all it frees up designers to do perhaps
more interesting things or more
contextual things with the information
our cars later in the show we're gonna
close the loop on this hood topic with
my top five reasons that the average car
really should have one
someone once said to me that one of
life's true great experiences is driving
with the roof down in a bright red
Ferrari
under the sound of a beautiful v8 right
behind my head
the 5/8 spider about experiencing the
noise we
by more from the ex car team of CNET UK
at cnet.com slash welcome back to see
net on cars I'm Brian Cooley time for
seven your email this time it comes in
from lis in Los Angeles who writes dear
Brian what are the five coolest pieces
of technology available on cars today
how do they work and what cars do they
come in well that's a bit of a big
question its but thank you for asking
you've raised the bar rather high it's a
big area to look at right now II like
cars have become motivated and marketed
by their technology as much as any other
aspect of the vehicle take a look at
some of their really glossy big dollar
marketing and notice how the tech these
days is often played ahead of
performance above styling even above
safety aspects now also make sure you
catch our December 5th episode of seen
it on cars but I'm gonna do a top five
car technologies to look for in the year
ahead through 2015 that's gonna interest
you a lot well speaking of top five
we've got one coming up now that ties
back to our discussion of head-up
display technology earlier in the show
now regardless of whether it's hands on
the wheel eyes on the road mind on the
task we've gone through all these
avenues trying to manage distraction the
bottom line is there's more information
in the cockpit so the thinking goes get
it up in front of the driver so it and
the road are in the same plane of focus
here for the doubters are our top 5
reasons why head-up displays do that so
well and our imminent
number five eliminate the center console
screen you heard me
get rid of that Center display I put
this low because yes even in the car
business
this is considered heretical talk but it
is talk you see that big flat immovable
LCD right now middle of your car is kind
of a big flat necessary evil for car
designers if they can get rid of that
thing and have more creative flexibility
in the middle of the dash they'll do it
hope it just doesn't mean more
cupholders that number four gesture
control in the car one of the keys to
powering future gesture control of our
dashboard gear is to have a tightly
integrated interface otherwise you're
flailing your arms all over not sure
what the car was expecting from you or
getting confirmation of what it thinks
you just flailed for a head-up display
can be that easy channel number three
information in context think about it
all the information your car presents to
you is basically in the wrong place
speed isn't shown laid on the side of
the road navigations not shown laid out
on the lane even your engine
temperatures not displayed on the hood
nothing else is such a digital Picasso
in your life but HUD could make things
live where they should be number two
faster refocus every time you glance at
a gauge or a screen you have to
dramatically change your eyes focal
plane and your center of focus and then
do it again when you look back out the
windshield and keep doing it over and
over and by the way it doesn't get
faster as drivers get older a HUD lets
your eyes stay in largely the same plane
of focus and the same scope of you
seeing everything number one is of
course the holy grail eyes on the road
because you can't react to what you
didn't see HUD technology for the first
time will let drivers see everything at
once integrating the information of
driving with the optics of driving while
you carry out the physical actions of
driving in many ways the fact that cars
were born before hug technology is kind
of a sad accident of history
