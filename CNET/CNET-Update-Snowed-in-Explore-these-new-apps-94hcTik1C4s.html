we're trapped inside for days I'm
Bridget Carey this is your cnet update
folks as many of you in the US have
probably heard by now there's a massive
winter storm coming to the east coast
with record snowfall projected in some
areas The Washington Post named it snows
yellow here in New York you're seated
update crew is stocking up on the storm
essentials bread canned food and
pointless apps drain our batteries as we
dull the pain of being trapped inside
all weekend but storm or no storm if
you're looking to spice up your mobile
life here are some new apps to try out
if you have trouble waking up in the
morning microsoft created something a
bit bizarre to get you moving android
users can download the mimic her alarm
it makes you play a short game to prove
you are really awake using microsoft's
facial recognition and machine learning
powers the app will ask you to make a
certain type of facial expression before
it deems that you are awake other
challenges include taking a photo of
something in the house of a certain
color or verbally repeating a tongue
twister musicians out there may like to
try out Apple's new music memos app for
iPhones and iPads it's a voice memo
recorder that can capture details of
your chords it divides the piece into
bars and adds a time signature and chord
labels so when creativity strikes you
have something more than just an audio
recording my colleague dan ackerman
tried it out with acoustic guitar and he
said he found it work best with strum
easy simple open chords in four-four
time you know that typical coffee shop
sound but if you get more complex you
may need to manually enter in the chords
it also is designed to work with piano
but you could try it with other
instruments or even your voice when you
edit it down to what you like you can
also add drums and bass and share the
clip or export it to another program
like garageband or logic pro the
GarageBand app also got a notable
upgrade with new tools for making loops
and also a smart drummer if you're
keeping occupied with the big football
championship games Facebook just
launched a new sports news hub called
Facebook sports stadium it's inside the
main iPhone facebook app but it's also
rolling out to other platforms in the
next few weeks
you can follow live scores and
play-by-play of games while talking to
your friends that are also watching the
game Facebook is trying to tackle
Twitter's real time magic and if you
want something different than facebook
there's the brand new peach app only
about two weeks are so old it's gotten a
lot of buzz since it was created by the
guy who made vine it's another place to
post the same stuff that you would share
anywhere but now you can feel like
you're special because you're one of the
first and we all like feeling special
that's it for this tech news update
being catch up on more at cnet com from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
