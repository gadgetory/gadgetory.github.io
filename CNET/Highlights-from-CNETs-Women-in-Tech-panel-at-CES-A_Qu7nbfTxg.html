was an article that came out in November
of 2011 in San Francisco magazine and it
was called who's the next female Mark
Zuckerberg and it really got me thinking
about sort of the state of the industry
there seems to be a lot of attention on
this question of women in tech lately
and so I just wanted to ask the panel
generally where do you think we'll start
with your Padma where do you think we
are in the industry in terms of women in
tech right now yeah I think they've come
a long way actually feel pretty good
about where women are in technology I
think if you kind of look at two of the
largest tech companies today IBM and HP
they have women CEOs and a lot of
amazing founders or creating technology
companies that have made a lot of
difference in our lives and so I mean
it's not that progress is ever you know
Don right I mean there's more we can do
and we should do to get more women
actually I was thinking as I was walking
the CES fleurs am I going to be on the
panel just to see some women I would
like to see more women and out out in on
the floor as well and I think that is
that is more we can do but I do feel
like in the last 10 years we've made a
lot of progress if you could put women
in some key areas in each of your
industries or business what do you think
they would be if you just make sure
there was a woman and you know a few
spots throughout the industry I'll be
honest I think that what we're really
playing is a numbers game right now is a
great time to your women in tech but
there's not enough more than intact
right but I worry that a lot of times
the conversation gets really focused on
what percentage of the pie is women
right and the truth is the pie isn't big
enough right we're not producing enough
computer scientist we're not producing
enough product designers we need a lot
more people to keep up with all of these
gadgets all this technology all these
possibilities the jobs of the future we
really need a lot more people interested
in mobile technology in computers right
we need a lot more people and if we grow
that number the number of women will by
its very nature go up right the
statistics are things like for the
advanced placement exam 200,000 students
a year take
cut the calculus exam only 14,000 take
the computer science exam so seven
percent of kids who think they're good
at math take both the math exam and the
computer science exam but if you talk to
Google engineers they'd actually done
studies only two percent of Google
engineers weren't exposed to computer
science in high school which means if
you graduate from high school and you
haven't been exposed to computer science
the odds that you're going to end up
being an engineer somewhere are
incredibly low so we really just need to
get that number up right imagine if we
had 200,000 or 500,000 students
graduating from high school every year
that we're taking computer science as
well as calculus as opposed to just
seven percent work-life balance can you
do you have stories that you can share
with us you know we've talked a lot
about the stories and I think that that
is obviously hugely influential if the
audience would like to hear it how how
do you accomplish it is it by setting
your own schedules how do you ask for
help so my my daughter was was very
jealous of me going to meetings so she
knew that reason whenever I was going to
a meeting it was something that excluded
her right so she would she started doing
these I'm sorry it's going to be a
little bit cute so she started doing
these sort of meetings with her stuffed
animals and things and I was like so
what do you guys talk about in your
meetings and she says balloons and
elephants and so I decided what we would
do is we would we would start having our
own meetings and we would kind of
include her and this feeling of being
involved in in work and so we started
having family meetings we have them
every friday morning at 8am and we sit
around the breakfast table and we
literally have a family meeting we talk
about what was good what was bad we talk
about our work we very specifically
talked about our work with each other
and have her meet one and then you know
what we want to learn in the coming week
and so we now have a meeting and it just
kind of like feels Roger that gets
meetings now the really big thing about
the meeting really is the
having the notepad and a really sharp
pencil and I don't know that's not a
good ended up reading it very well how
are you on the panel how do you feel
about taking that mantle in some cases
you do how do you think you be a hero to
women who are interested in technology
and do you ever see it as a burden for
younger women both male and female yeah
I know that Sheryl Sandberg has talked a
lot about how choosing not to get too
soft here but choosing it the right
partner is one of the best choices you
can make for your career and I think you
know I have a son and a daughter and
it's really important really important
for me to model for my son that I can do
both of these things and that he gets to
see a partnership at work at home and
that that model extends to our children
and also maybe to our high schools I
mean I really appreciate the comment
about getting people involved in
engineering at the high school level
because I suspect that not many high
schools have computer science programs
at all and certainly in them I doubt
there are many female computer science
high school teachers but it is value in
sharing your experience yes and that is
something I really believe it and I
think I often talk to people i canna
share my experiences and it's not that
anybody can translate your experience to
theirs and it's not something you can
extrapolate and say okay this work this
didn't work for me therefore it may or
may not work for you but it's actually
just relating a story of this is how I
dealt with the situation and I think
there's value in that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
