shows you do it CNET style why you're
obsessing on the wrong thing about your
engine and the top-five way is the man
decides what technology is in your code
time to check the tech we see cars
differently
we love along the road under the hood
but also check the tackle and are known
for telling like is the good bad autumn
longer
this is cement on cars
hello everybody I'm Brian Cooley and
welcome to CNET on cars the show all
about high-tech cars and modern driving
this week coming to you from the shop of
our friend Michael Vogel little later on
we're going to be digging into an engine
to explain one of the biggest mysteries
of them that you don't understand but
first not one engine but two the big v8s
that live in the bowels of the BMW 750
li and the Lexus LS 460 F Sport we put
these two head-to-head the other day and
never have I been so comfortable in the
field well here we have two cars that
really represent the pinnacle of what a
lot of folks mean when they say a really
nice car the 2013 BMW 750 li and the
2013 lexus LS 460 in the F Sport trim
let's find out how they really differ in
their essence we check the text
now rather than go through these guys
with an exhaustive bullet by bullet
head-to-head comparison and spend an
hour doing so instead I want to find out
how these two cars that both can print
CNET style do so differently to let you
figure out which one is really right for
you first off these two cars dashboards
speak tech differently
the Lexus says it's sort of loudly more
button rich and crisp and somehow busier
the BMW is by no means basic but it's
tech interfaces play second fiddle to
creature comforts in cars at this level
the basics better be standard so you'll
find GPS navigation with live traffic
Bluetooth calling and a backup camera
with good guidance overlays and those
are standard on both cars though it
wasn't that long ago that BMW nickeled
and dimed you for most of that stuff and
speaking of cameras are 750 has the
optional walleye cams installed up front
and while they're of somewhat dubious
value they're not found on the Lexus you
steer the Lexus interface with this
inverted puck they call the remote touch
controller it moves the cursor offers
punch to enter and uses haptic feedback
as it bumps over things on the screen
but it badly needs a back button BMW has
endured the years of sneers and jeers to
turn I Drive into one of the best in car
interfaces you steer it with this I
Drive knob and handful of associated
shortcut buttons including one for back
and interestingly BMW has removed haptic
feedback as I Drive matured I found
voice command the Lexus was quick to
understand me but requires parsing an
address into many parts or button
presses enter an address enter an
address see only the city name or say
change state San Francisco BMW is also
quick on the uptake but lets you blurt
out an address the most complicated
thing you'll typically do with voice all
in one phrase
one zero zero zero Vaness avenue san
francisco california processing your
input did you mean 1000s Van Ness Avenue
San Francisco most cars play the
greatest hits of modern audio sources
with just a few differences the Lexus is
the car of these two that supports
iTunes tagging with its HD radio but the
BMW has a 20 gigabyte hard drive - rip -
both are equally useless to most people
which brings us to apps Lexus is part of
Toyota that means they get the excellent
Entune app suite renamed enform here
it's a basket of name-brand cloud loaded
apps including Yelp opentable Pandora
Bing I Heart Radio and Facebook Places
and that's standard BMWs app support is
still optional and it just rolls up
Facebook Twitter and web radio via an
iPhone app no Android but built into the
car regardless of phone is Google search
which is killer and now Yelp as well and
note that BMW has built-in 3G in the car
where Lexus requires you tether your
phone to get connected whether you're
listening to one of those streaming apps
or AM radio mark Levinson's 19 speakers
and 400 watts on the Lexus or Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen 16 speakers and good grief 1200
watts in the BMW mean both cars can be
optioned with sound better than you can
hear cars like this don't just treat
backseat passengers like hitchhikers
the Lexus wins on total rear seat
comforts optional to include reclining
shiatsu massage butterfly headrests rear
seat cooler and air purifier you can
tell the Germans still inwardly scoff at
such nonsense but have dragged
themselves to include heated and cooled
massage seats where they score big is
the best dual rear screen entertainment
system in the biz there are generous
size they're nice and thin but notice
what's really interesting they are
iDrive interfaces with an i drive
controller you've got access to
multimedia radio navigation all the same
services you've got in the front of the
car you've also got connected Drive so
without having to bring an iPad to the
car you've got some modest degree of
online services right here in the
vehicle
built-in both these cars are v8 powered
the Lexus has the bigger 4.6 liter v8
but the BMW slaps a pair of turbos on
it's smaller 4.4 liter the BMW ends up
with more horsepower more torque and
it's quicker and even though that 7
Series weighs more and is faster both
cars deliver identical mpg so you got to
hand it to BMW here at least on paper
now to get that equal efficiency with
higher power and weight BMW had to add
complexity in the form of brake force
electricity regeneration borrowed from
hybrid cars an engine automatic
start/stop which I still find rather
crudely executed but luckily defeatable
being luxury rides both these cars come
on suave at first unless you dig down
into their powertrain but when you do
the BMWs power and Road handling make it
a more serious driver's car to my hands
even though the Lexus is an F sport both
cars have a handful of engine
transmission and suspension profiles
from eco to aggressive and they do offer
pronounced differences from one end to
the other though I think three settings
would probably be ample guys BMW offers
a head-up display to extend the
interface of the windshield as well as
night vision that is now actually not
totally disorienting but I really enjoy
the Lexus enform apps base on the road
and find its big interface and brands of
content more useful than BMWs rather
Stern translation of Twitter and
Facebook which I don't need in the car
anyway
if you need help driving both cars are
there for you Lexus has active Lane
drift technology but passive blind spot
tax the MW lane drift and blind spot are
now both active in the seven each car
offers adaptive cruise control the Lexus
can also do front collision warning and
even bring the car to a stop at city
speeds if you're too busy fiddling with
your coffee to watch what you're doing
BMW leaves you alone to rear-end someone
in independent Bavarian fashion okay the
bottom line on these two cars begins
with the bottom line which is quite
different I checked up that BMW dial
didn't seen that style and pushed
108,000 then a similar tech load on the
Lexus and I couldn't quite break 90 so
about an $18,000 Delta not silly money
in terms of their character the BMW has
a real serious executive sedan feel to
it but it's a real gutter fighter on the
street when you push it hard
the Lexus I think a little less so even
as an F sport but it has more of a schwa
devii about the technology in it it's a
real tech toy play it that way
okay I got to admit it that shoot was
one of those days where I probably
should have been paying see net think
about it I'm out in the 750 and an LS in
a place you should recognize not by name
but it's called Konzelman Road in Marin
County outside San Francisco you know it
from a ton of car commercials you've
seen on TV we're very lucky to have it
in our backyard by the way you can find
our specific reviews on the 750 in the
LS at cars dot cnet.com not a lot of
windshield to clip a Garmin on this 61
Juliet a vintage race car not a lot of
wind screen to stop bugs for that matter
but I'm sure in your car there's room
for either something on the dash on the
phone or on the windshield that is GPS
Navi related in fact if you're watching
this show you've probably got two or
three of the above but a few tips on
using them more efficiently as always of
interest to the smarter driver know what
this is a lot of you probably never even
seen one that's the paper map and that
used to be the essence of navigation in
a car
are you kidding they call these screens
distracting with this thing up I can
hardly even see out the windshield
forget that now just because you're
taking advantage of the ubiquity of GPS
Navi in - on your phone on a clip-on
device doesn't mean you're doing it
really well working with State Farm
Research or Steve Roberson we've come up
with interesting little toolkits simple
free tips to be savvy about using GPS
now clipping one of these GPS PN DS on
your windshield like that by doing so
you just broke the law in more than half
the states in the US and even ones that
do allow you to do this have very
specific rules about where you can put
it you probably didn't know that
now whatever kind of navigation device
you're using - pnd or smartphone know if
it accepts destinations emailed to it in
advance without you having to tediously
type it in and be distracted in the
process for GM Nissan OnStar Garmin
Google Maps just some of the companies
that support this kind of feature now if
you're using your smart phone as your
navigation device turn the screen off
and just listen to the vocal prompts
that'll come from just about any decent
smartphone now back and if this little
speaker is not loud enough to hear you
say head Southwest on Mission Street
toward first Street no problem aux cable
it or Bluetooth stream it to your head
unit and for most systems those nav
commands will come in and override music
or whatever else you have playing on
this device or on your head unit and
finally and this may sound low-tech and
frankly it is but familiarize yourself
with the route that this device is about
to take you on rescuers a warning of a
troubling tendency drivers who rely too
heavily on the satellite guided system
you've heard of death by GPS it's no
joke people have lost their lives or had
accidents because they've followed an
inaccurate or errant map
many of these navigation devices have a
preview mode that lets you basically fly
through where you're going to be taken
so heads-up and to know your route ahead
of time is good because then you really
know where you are not just finding
yourself somewhere and not knowing how
you got there or how to get out
coming up we'll explain the most
misunderstood and important part of your
engine's technology as CNET on cars
continues
you
welcome back to see net on cars I'm
Brian Cooley and I'm also a little
embarrassed that it's taken us this long
to get to the car check one on one we're
about to go to you see every time I do a
car video I take you to the engine and
we talked about the horsepower and the
torque but never have I stopped to
explain to you the complicated
relationship between those two and why
torque is so important we're going to
address all that right now okay aside
from emissions and heat the two big
outputs of any engine are horsepower and
torque you know all about the first one
you've heard about it since you were a
little kid it's in every automotive
advertisement everything the automaker
has ever talked about has horsepower in
there somewhere but torque as far less
well understood though extremely
important let's break them down and
define them first horsepower is a
measure of work its definition makes
that obvious one horsepower is equal to
33 thousand foot-pounds per minute now
torque is also a measure of work but it
describes work as twisting force it's
kind of like horsepower in a circle and
without the per minute factor torque is
measured in foot-pounds not a certain
number of them though for example it may
take 27 foot-pounds of torque to loosen
a particular boat on this engine without
regard for how long you have to apply
that force so at the risk of
oversimplifying horsepower expresses how
much work you can get done on a certain
amount of time torque is about how hard
you can twist something and that's key
because how does a car move itself the
engine turns it twists the gears in the
transmission they twist output or drive
shafts and that moves the car torque
really should be the star
okay seriously let me show you on some
charts how horsepower and torque work I
promise you won't fall asleep now these
are charts from cars and then put on
dynamometer z' basically treadmills for
cars you've seen these our partners over
at Edmunds do a lot of kind of testing
and gave us this data and it's very
instructive here's a 2011 Ford Mustang
here's how the chart works on the Left
you've got your vertical axis of either
foot-pounds of torque or amount of
horsepower down across the right is
basically your tachometer its rpms from
1 to 8,000 in this case now look what
happens the torque line is this light
blue one you start building around 2,000
rpm and you got more and more torque as
you increase the revs you peak right
around here at about o 4200 with 365
foot-pounds that's all that engine has
and you stay at about that range until
around 5200 rpm this is the sweet spot
this is where you've got peak torque
that just keeps coming after a while
more rpms the torque begins to drop
horsepower keeps increasing let's look
at another car here's a very different
engine in a McLaren mp4-12c supercar
here's our torque line again builds
gradually and then notice at about 4200
all the way out to about 6200 this guy
stays flat and right about at the peak
amount of torque around 415 foot pounds
this is a wider what they call fatter
torque band you've got more rpms where
you have full torque from the engine
mercedes-benz s63 instructed because
this is a twin-turbo v8 look what
happens with turbos this is the torque
line it's out of hand it Peaks really
fast and it stays broad chunky and 611
foot-pounds of torque that's a lot by
the way
for a very long time before it begins to
degrade
and finally a very different car a Scion
fr-s Peaks here early at only 143
foot-pounds of torque but then look what
happens you get this dip here if you
ever hear me driving a car and say I
feel like there's a flat spot in the
torque curve that's what I'm talking
about it's not flat at all it's actually
a dip where the car feels kind of
gutless and then up around 4800 rpm it
kicks back in again and stays nice and
flat all the way out to the mid 6,000
now you may have noticed in all these
charts torque tends to peter out as you
get to the higher rpms up near your
redline that's because the engine is
less able to breathe efficiently there
secondly notice that horsepower keeps
climbing even after torque drops off why
is that seems like it's two engines
doing different things well even as
torque drops off the RPMs keep climbing
and horsepower is largely a product of
rpms times torque so we can put those
two together and keep that horsepower
line moving up because torque is
dropping but only modestly as our PM's
go up in a linear fashion okay I hope
you've got a better understanding now of
horsepower torque the relationship and
how they impact the driving experience
of a car also note we do our car videos
I'll show you those two numbers and
horsepower is usually the bigger torque
is often the smaller unless that car has
a turbo or a supercharger which
artificially puts more in the engine and
allows the torque to come higher or as
high as the horsepower that gives you
another clue as to what that car is
going to be like to drive oh by the way
thanks to one of our viewers whoosh ik
of Arlington Virginia who nudged me to
get around to that car tech 101 that
topic was his idea as the little thanks
for sending him one of our new CNET on
cars decals you can get one as well if
you send me a show idea that we use
we're looking for ideas for car tech 101
or our top 5 segments shoot them at me
on cars at cnet.com when we come back
top 5 ways the man is calling the shots
on the tech in your car when CNET on
cars continues
you
today's graphical display radios with
RDS HD tagging and cover art were
unimaginable in 1957 when GM's
wunderbar radio was almost like voodoo
you pressed the wunderbar and a motor
would turn the tuning knob stopping at
the next AM Signori that's all it did
there was a little slider under the
wunderbar to set how staticky a radio
station you were willing to have it
stopped at a concept almost foreign in
today's digital radio world they say
today's head units are distracting I
could watch this thing motor back and
forth all day welcome back to see net on
cars I'm Brian Cooley you know modern
cars often seem like equal parts
hardware software and I guess what you'd
call law where laws and regulations
these days have an enormous impact on
what kind of cars are coming out of
factories and hitting showrooms whether
you or the manufacturer like it or not
here's some proof
you know it wasn't that long ago that
folks were grumbling that requiring seat
belts in cars was commie socialist stuff
today that commie label is applied to
decidedly more high-tech innovations
I'm Brian Cooley with the top 5 ways the
man is changing your car number 5
autonomous cars you know self-driving
Nevada and California recently forced
the issue by making these legal now the
feds are playing catch-up likely to
issue national rules by 2016 that's
going to signal it's time to open the
floodgates of investment in cars that
take over 80% of the driving that you
don't really want to do anyway number 4
distracted driving regulations the
National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration has been floating these
tortured proposals for limiting in-car
distraction like saying that a text
display should have no more than 30
characters at a time or any screen based
tasks should take no more than two
seconds they clearly haven't used an
Android phone have that whatever the
specifics this federal push will be what
moves distracted driving to the same
level of stigma as DUI number three rear
cameras this rule has been delayed more
times than BlackBerry's comeback but the
feds are close to requiring a backup
camera in all new vehicles perhaps by
late 2014 the car makers say it's going
to jack up the price of a car too much
but most likely they don't want to lose
the ability to make the rear camera a
desirable option instead of a standard
feature number two are black box data
recorders they're already in 90 plus
percent of late-model cars probably
yours that you didn't know that but the
feds will soon require them in all new
cars sold the gripe here is that the
feds are going to require the black
boxes but the state's control access to
the data and barely more than a dozen of
them even have laws that address it the
number one way that regulations will
change cars tomorrow is the new 50
four-and-a-half mpg fuel economy
standard that's the level that must be
met by the average of all cars sold by
any maker as of 2025
this incredibly complicated formula they
use to figure it out but still a huge
bump from today's 29.7 fleet average and
not that many years away that means
we're going to see three cylinder
engines turbos and almost everything
hybrids galore cars that shut themselves
off at a stop sign or red light and
electric cars on showroom Lots even if
nobody wants to buy one and it's
estimated to add some $3,000 to the
average MSRP by 2025 no federal rule
will change cars or the cost of them as
much as this one to stay on top of all
the new innovations happening in cars
the one you have today and the window by
tomorrow check out our show at CNET on
