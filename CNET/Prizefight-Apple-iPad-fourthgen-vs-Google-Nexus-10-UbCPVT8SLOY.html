and tablets are here to stay so we're
bringing on a battle between two of the
big boys it's a prize five-foot shout
between apple's fourth generation ipad
and Google's Nexus 10 our judges for
this fight our senior editor Donald
tacobell senior editor Eric the tank man
Franklin and myself ding dong Tom now
we'll take all three judges blind scores
and average them out to the nearest
tenth of a point the final prize fight
score will be an average of all rounds
using the same system let's get ready to
rumble round 1 is designed Apple's iPad
fourth generation is still the benchmark
for design for a premium tablet even if
it's a little heavier it's all metal
body is sleek and sturdy it brings a
nine point seven inch screen with
Apple's Retina display that's a slightly
lower resolution with 264 pixels per
inch and the only difference physically
is the smaller lightning port on the
bottom now Google's Nexus 10 brings a 10
inch widescreen tablet design with a
higher 299 pixels per inch that's
slightly lighter in weight with a great
design as well this is a sturdy tablet
but it definitely has a more plasticky
feel with its sticky faux leather finish
on the backside that were not all fans
of but this guy will be able to take
more of a beating the ipad takes this
round with the 4.7 and the nexus 10 gets
a 4 next round is user interface in
particular the ipad brings iOS 6 and
it's the easiest pick-up-and-play
interface on planet earth it's snappy
and intuitive the home button has
multiple functions to access current
apps and a few basic settings we get
that Apple wants to keep it simple but
they can still give us a little more
than just the notifications bar after
all this time now the Nexus 10 brings
Android jelly bean and it's a clean OS
that is fully realized while bringing
Android staple customization with
widgets that are resizable and adopt for
your apps that also lets you drag icons
on top of each other to create folders
notifications are still also a staple
here when you swipe from the center but
swiping from the top right now brings
you quick access to your key settings
now I think jelly bean can more than
hang with iOS but not everyone here
agrees the iPad takes us around with 4.3
and the Nexus 10 gets a 3.7 dr.
averaging two rounds the fourth gen iPad
leads next roundest features the Nexus
10 comes with 16 or 32 gigs of storage
and a dual-core processor
it also brings support for HDMI out and
microUSB directly on the device it
brings jellybeans Google now which
delivers relevant information like
whether public transit and nearby
businesses Google's voice search the
commands are still unmatched by any
mobile OS plus its maps are more
reliable including Google Street View
and public transit options its Google
Play Store is not on the same level when
it comes to apps but it's still a
legitimate enough offering plus gesture
typing to trace over your words instead
of typing them and multiple user
accounts on one tablet is big now the
iPad comes in 16 32 and 64 gig flavors
and bring the speed with the new a6 X
processor that doubles the graphics and
CPU performance of the previous iPad
Siri has a pretty interface but it's
still just not as accurate and its
response time lag significantly behind
Google's Apple maps with turn-by-turn
directions might work out for some of
you but in my uses it's not even close
and it still has a long ways to go
airplay works best in the Apple
ecosystem to play your content on an
Apple TV and lightning is both a
blessing and a curse charging is
significantly faster but it also makes
some of your previous accessories
obsolete but where the iPad shines is
its robust library of apps and the
iTunes ecosystem that really makes the
tablet more than just the hardware it's
really its greatest asset here and yeah
I'm an apps man both tablets have their
positives and negatives there's no
memory expansion on either device but
the Nexus 10
just gets an edge with the 4.3 and the
iPad gets a 4 next round is web browsing
and multimedia Google's Nexus 10 brings
excellent web browsing even without
flash support with its Chrome browser
that brings features like an incognito
mode for private browsing the iPad
brings Safari which is just as solid of
a browser it's snappy pinch and zoom
also features cloud syncing of bookmarks
on other iOS devices and a clean reader
mode video quality looks great on both
devices and the Nexus 10's widescreen
allows you to showcase more of the
content I might give the iPad a slight
edge with its color representation and
black levels even with the slightly
higher resolution on the Nexus 10
but really it's a coin toss here boe
tablets have front facing and five
megapixel rear cameras that shoot 1080p
video we'd give apple's ipad just an
edge when it comes to image quality from
taking pictures and videos but I would
just recommend that you don't become
part of that small but growing group of
people that take pictures with their
tablet these are two of the best tablets
for multimedia and the iPad just gets an
edge with a 4.7 and the Nexus 10 gets a
4.3 after averaging four rounds Apple
still leads but the Nexus 10 has closed
the gap round 5 is performance the Nexus
10 is one of the fastest Android tablets
we've seen but occasionally some apps
take longer to load than they really
should now in our video playback battery
drain test the 410 iPad gave us a
whopping 14 hours of juice compared to
the Nexus 10's
8.5 hours of battery life and that's a
huge difference
combine that fact with the iPads
processor boost and snappy UI and it's a
hard combination to beat the iPad gets a
perfect 5 and then
ten get up or after five rounds Apple
still leave the final round that decides
it all invalid the Nexus 10 16 gig model
starts at 399 and the 32 gig model is
$4.99 the fourth gen iPad 16 gig model
starts at $4.99 now it depends on what's
important to you but the iPad is really
worth its price with its extensive app
support and streaming performance right
now plus it's a device that will hold
its value over time when you're ready to
resell it the iPad takes this round with
a 4.7 and the Nexus gets a 4 so let's
average out all six rounds and in a
battle where the iPad jumped out on top
early it never let go and the fourth
generation iPad takes this battle 4.6
the 4.1 and is your prize fight win the
Nexus 10 is no chump and is still one of
the best tablets on the market but on
this day it's the iPad who reign supreme
I'm Brian Tong thanks for watching and
we'll catch you guys next week for
another prize fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
