how to contributor and today we're going
to take a really quick look at how to
add a bookmark shortcut to your home
screen using the new Chrome for Android
update this was a new feature added in
the last update and it makes it real
handy to quickly access some of your
favorite sites so I'm going to go ahead
and launch Chrome and then tap on the
Menu key and in bookmarks so here I have
my mobile bookmarks already pulled up
and there's my scene at how to bookmark
I have stored in there and what I'm
going to do is a long press on the icon
and then a menu will pop up asking what
exactly I want to do down at the bottom
you'll see Add to Home screen so I'm
going to go ahead and tap on that and
you see an alert down there saying the
shortcut was created so I'm going to go
back to the home screen and there you
can see I have a new icon on my home
screen that is a shortcut which will
then launch Chrome and take me directly
to the scene of how-to page now if you
don't already have your preferences
preferences set up for this it's going
to prompt you which browser you'd like
to use the first time of course we want
chrome beta to launch and there we have
it once again that was a quick look at
how to create home screen shortcuts for
in Chrome for Android this is Jason
Cipriani was seen at how to make sure to
