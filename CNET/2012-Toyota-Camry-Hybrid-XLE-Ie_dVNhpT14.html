some sharp pointy things on it but it's
still the Camry the car you buy bring
home and don't call and brag to anybody
that you just bought it's the most
maligned really good car in the world
let's drive the 2012 Camry Hybrid and
check the
now because we have an xle that means
extra luxurious etc or something you can
tell this cabin is not your typical
rental car Camry I mean nice stitching
and different textures and good quality
materials everywhere but again this is
the high trim car we're here really
though to check out the Entune head unit
we've also got a separate video on this
check that out it's seen at tv.com just
type in Entune en tu na it's all about
these five apps they've got here Bing
radio movie tickets
open table Pandora and all of that is
going to give you access to those
through a single sort of uh what I call
it a bridge app you put here on your
phone but the gripe I've got about that
app is that it doesn't seem to be shut
down a ball even when I have Bluetooth
turned off I'm nowhere near the car I'm
in a different zip code that damn in
tune out keeps trying to run but here's
where in tune got tripped up by the
Toyota lawyers and I get it
Toyota Motor Corporation doesn't want
anymore headlines for being dangerous on
the road these days but this went too
far
once you get rolling as in some other
cars a lot of things get locked out but
the problem is this voice button over
here doesn't work within - oh I know I'm
supposed to pull over and use it well
I've got news for you if I take the time
to pull over to use an online service
I'm going to do it on my phone where
it's got a better touchscreen better
graphics better apps faster processor
and a direct connection to the Internet
the one exception here is being luckily
does have its own voice command on an
icon right here but the rest of these
apps are voice dumb now because we've
also loaded this guy up with one of the
confusing packages that Toyota offers
it's got almost everything that includes
JBL audio what they call green edge
audio it uses less current so more
recharge can go to the battery this
being a hybrid of course beyond that
it's the usual complement of the right
things you've got a USB and aux jack
here iPod or USB Drive Bluetooth
hands-free
also has streaming Bluetooth support and
beyond that what do you care no HD Radio
most Americans couldn't give a rat's ass
anyway and those top-end packages on
this car will also give you blind spot
detection but not prevention and also a
backup camera but there's no lane
departure technology coming on your
camry now here was a problem with the
last Camry Hybrid it wasn't all that
efficient not compared to its newer
competitors who came along and made its
mpg numbers look bad but not tremendous
this one's trying to correct that first
of all the car went on a diet lots of
weight loss two hundred and fifty pounds
lighter than the outgoing Camry Hybrid
that is a big difference on a car that
weighs thirty five twenty or so now two
and a half litre inline-four and an
electric motor they're only quoting a
total horsepower number of two hundred
combined and not even telling us what
the torque spec is on this car we'll
figure that out when we get on the road
in a moment but this 3500 pound guy gets
up to sixteen about seven point six
seconds while delivering 40 38 mpg and
as we're about to see it really does
that that's the key oh and check this
out this engine is beltless now there's
an empty pulley down there on the
crankshaft but the power steering AC
compressor and water pump are all
electric not belt driven that further
frees up the engine to sip gas with less
drag okay under way notice we have a one
choice only gearbox as you might expect
the CVT not a cog automatic which is
what you would get on a gas engine Prius
but this Hybrid has a CVT only you've
also got an eco mode and Evi mode evie
makes it run electric only the most that
it can until it starts to deplete the
battery and eco mode softens up throttle
response to again give it the lowest
dynamics for the least interesting
driving but the best mpg very
interesting thing here you've got a
gauge on the far right that shows
historical mpg since reset it's odd to
use a needle for that normally you see a
number on a display which I also have
here in the middle it's redundant
and you'll notice that's a good number
and I've been getting 33 34 average on a
tank the whole time and driving this car
because we've got an electric motor in
here the performance is actually quite
good around town everyday driving I
don't know what it's like on a skid pad
or a track and I don't care it's a Camry
but I do know that it's got the snap
power delivery when you need it like
right now I've got to make a little hole
here in traffic get through that and
it's all over it my gripe is they went
too far in getting rid of the Camrys
floaty Bodhi image of having a big soft
suspension that kind of wallows they
went the other way
it still wallows a little but the ride
quality to me is too harsh for this
vehicle I'm getting too many road inputs
stupid road inputs like manhole covers
and pavement patches it's just plain
sprung hard and I don't want that in the
Camry
all right bottom line on the Camry
Hybrid this is a hybrid xle high trim
but I really like the interior so I'm
going to say go xle it's about
twenty-eight three then you've got to
add about $5,000 worth of options to get
navigation in tune the nice JBL audio
system the rear camera the blind spot
tech the keyless technology it's kind of
full boat at that price it's not a cheap
date but it's a really nice car and
those mpg numbers may actually do a
little bit to help you earn back the
price
