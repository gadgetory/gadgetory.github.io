and welcome to rumor has it the show
where we round up the week's biggest
tech rumors and vote on what sounds
likely what's probably BS and remember
that you can vote on all of the rumors
too so keep your eye out for the pole in
the interactive player if you're
watching on cnet first up 9to5 mac is
reporting that apple's airdrop feature
is coming to iOS currently air droplets
OS 10 users quickly and efficiently
share files between computers so
according to anonymous sources airdrop
will be embedded in the iOS 7 share menu
it's possible that it could allow for
sharing to max though right now it's
focused on sharing between iOS devices
only the sources also said that Apple
has tried to bring it to iOS in the past
but is backed out at the last moment
probably because air job is one of the
dumbest names anyone's ever heard and
because they reminds me that atrocities
like this were ever made wait you have
something against operation dumbo drop
that sounds like the cutest movie ever
made well have you even seen it no well
you realize it's basically a cash in on
the Dumbo name and oversimplifies the
atrocities of the Vietnam War right yeah
but it has like elephants in it or right
next up according to analyst Michael
Pachter the Xbox one is going to cost
399 and the ps4 will cost 349 wait where
do you get this information pretty much
out of nowhere he based the estimates of
the cost of materials needed to build
the consoles he also took into account
the prices the current gen model sold
for when they were released the xbox 360
premium edition debuted at 399 in 2005
and the 60 gig playstation 3 initially
sold for 599 so he basically took are
added y divided that by q and ended up
with F I guess we'll see if his crazy
math works at e3 on Monday and if that
math does work out then he just
justified his employment huh I don't
have to do that
what and lastly rumors are persisting
that Apple is just about to announce its
Pandora competitor I radio at WWDC next
week on Sunday was announced that Apple
struck a licensing deal with both warner
music and its publishing arm burner
Chappell sources say that I radio would
function a lot like Pandora would
integrate with iTunes and would allow
you to purchase songs directly from the
app and also allow you to do crazy
things like rewind from the middle of a
song what do you guys think well Apple
announced I radio at WWDC will you use
it will it be a pandora killer don't
forget to vote and leave a comment we'll
check in with a scenic council the cnet
Council is composed of five editors who
cast their votes anonymously their
opinions are not an endorsement by cnet
or CBS interactive obviously because
these are rumors folks and the council's
verdict is a unanimous yes they agree
that our video will likely be announced
next week that's our show everybody be
sure to check out seen out on Monday for
all of our WWDC and e3 coverage where a
lot of these rumors will finally be put
to rest and tune in next week when we'll
have some fresh new rumors how's that
duty game we have to do it again o
overdose of this show did that even work
should we cut it stunned silence
derelict left through done she handed in
her badge in there crying oh thank god
smile honey this is my last thing I get
