and it's a pretty competitive
alternative to Gmail if you were forced
to switch over or are just diving into
this new inbox you'll need to get
familiar with some of outlooks unique
features here are the five most useful
outlook comm features and some tips on
how to use them first up is instant
actions when you mouse over an email in
your inbox a few little icons will show
up there like shortcuts I'll let you
quickly delete a message mark it as
unread or flag it the best part is that
you can customize these actions just go
to settings more settings and select
instant actions here's where you create
your new actions click add actions and
choose the type of action you want to
add I'll select categorize define the
category and gives a shortcut of color
now hit save and back in my inbox you'll
see that the shortcut is now available
as an incident action now I can easily
categorize the messages as needed the
second feature to check out is keyboard
shortcuts by default outlook comes with
its own keyboard shortcuts but if you
just moved from Yahoo or Gmail you can
use the shortcuts you're already
familiar with just go to settings
keyboard shortcuts and select a set of
shortcuts you want to use there you go I
just saved you some memorizing next
check out rules like Gmail you can
create rules or filters that
automatically organize emails when you
receive them so for example you can set
up Outlook to automatically categorize
emails with attachments or automatically
delete messages from Facebook in
settings go to rules for sorting new
messages here's where you create the
filters just click new and follow the
steps first you define a trigger like a
sender then you define the action like
adding those emails to a category or
deleting them all together for people
like me who are obsessed with organizing
this feature will do wonders here's
another one you might have missed you
can send files up to 300
megabytes with Outlook comm using the
power of SkyDrive here's how it works
when you try to attach a file that's
larger than 25 megabytes you'll get this
warning below it you have the option to
send the attachment using SkyDrive click
it and the file will be uploaded to your
drive the recipient will get a link in
the email to download the file just
don't forget to delete the file from
your SkyDrive later and finally
scheduled cleanup so when you're viewing
an email you'll see a sweep option in
the command bar up top the feature lets
you move or delete messages from a
specific sender in one fell swoop but if
you select schedule cleanup you'll be
able to plan moves or deletions ahead of
time and you can always change these
scheduled cleanups by selecting manage
rules so those are the five bus features
on the new outlook comm but if you have
any other cool ones worth staring hit me
up on Twitter for a CNET I'm Sharon
