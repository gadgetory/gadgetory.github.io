welcome to google issues for all the
Google goodness that we can pack inside
of a show now let's get to it in samsung
is throwing their tab into color event
this thursday and we're expecting to see
both an 8.4 and a 12 point 2 inch model
high-res displays with a 2560 by 1600
resolution but even crazier the
unveiling of a 12 inch ultra HD galaxy
tablet with a 4096 x 2160 resolution
dang now you can thank qualcomm for
leaking that out at the French Open it
will have all the details next week but
let's just fast forward to 2015 and
according to Sam mobile samsung will be
pushing to release its bendable tablet
prototype that they showcased behind
closed doors at Mobile World Congress
now according to reports it's an eight
to nine inch full HD OLED display that
can be folded twice like a woman's
foldable wallet with a screen so that is
sexy now shifting to Google according to
android police the googs is planning a
location-aware feature called the nearby
as a possible competitor to apple's
ibeacon that could alert people places
and things to a nearby user it could be
potentially used for reminders ads or
promotions it would be built into
android's location settings you can just
control which apps access it but there's
no timetable when it will be available
just yet and sticky with location Google
now just keeps getting better with a new
feature for anyone writing public
transportation it will show you where
you are where you need to get off and
even offers to set an alarm that will go
off near your stop really slick stuff in
I could have used this when I was taking
the train back home and ended up at the
end of the line several times because I
was sleeping like a baby alright in
YouTube news Sony's e3 press conference
announced that gamers will be able to
directly upload game footage to youtube
later this year twitch and Ustream have
been huge already and this is really a
no-brainer and also this gives me a
moment to drool over the teaser trailer
for uncharted 4 again if there's one
thing I've learned in all these years
it's there's no such thing as a surefire
plan I don't really have an option here
you know that no all right youtubers
might also see a dip in their
subscribers after they announced a new
process to remove suspended accounts
from channel subscription counts sadface
alright guys we still don't know for
sure when Google glass will be available
for sale at retail stores but ever
leaked says that AT&amp;amp;T will be one of the
first retail locations to offer them
sergey brin recently said they'd be
released this year plus or minus which
could still pushed onto 2015 but we know
you're all waiting for this Diane von
Furstenberg collaboration with Google
glass that is expected to go on sale at
the end of June very stylish alright
let's get to the quick hits VLC
developers are currently working on
implementing chromecast support to its
media player according to GigaOM in the
next four to six weeks other platforms
like iOS windows and macs will also get
support and the UK like the u.s. is
updating its Road laws in making
preparations to accommodate self-driving
cars to allow driverless whips to cruise
their roads so all we need to do is
lower this guy throw on some 19-inch
rims and add a spoiler and I love this
story the Google Cultural Institute is
partnering with hundreds of museums to
allow more than 5,000 pieces of street
art and 100-plus exhibits to be
preserved digitally now sridhar can be
temporary but this google art project
looks to keep some of these amazing
pieces alive for us to look online and
what were you doing when you were 11
years old well if you're 11 right now
you're watching this show but I'm pretty
sure you're not Audrey Zhang who won
Google's 2014 doodle 4 Google contest
for kids K through 12 with her colorful
detailed and charming submission that
tackles the world issue for the need for
clean drinking water the reward a 30
thousand dollar college scholarship and
a fifty-thousand-dollar college
education technology grant for her
school Google even took it a step
further and helped her animate it and
that's just awesome but unfortunately my
submission over here was
consider actually this right really
niche oh no check this out so like I
detail the snake over here and added
some blue shading there's red hair okay
all right well guys email us at Google
licious at sina com or tweet me at Brian
Tom thanks so much for watching in will
see you guys next week for somewhere
that Google Isha's you delicious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
