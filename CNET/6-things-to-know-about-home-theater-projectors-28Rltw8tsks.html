ever and they're huge images and deliver
visual impact that makes your television
look tiny but they're not for everyone
you're considering stepping up way up
and screen size by buying one here's
some basic information to consider
number one the darker the better you can
watch a projector with the lights on but
the image will be washed out and tough
to see turn off the lights and draw the
blinds and it comes to life
better yet watch at night especially if
you're going to indulge in the joys of
outdoor projection number two screen
isn't necessary but it sure helps a lot
you can get a good image by projecting
on a patch of wall but for best results
use a screen the image will be brighter
and easier to see and the screens black
border can help enhance the sense of
contrast we're using a really nice
hundred twenty inch screen here but
excellent models can be had for not much
money number three
consider the source TVs have built-in
apps and tuners but you'll need to
connect your source gear cable box and
console video streamer etc to the
projector to display anything that means
you might have to run extra long cables
from your stuff to wherever you're
putting the projector number four
speaker is highly recommended many
budget projectors have built-in speakers
but you might as well listen to the
audio from your phone for a real home
theater feel you should use an external
audio system whether it's a basic
Bluetooth speaker sound bar or a full
surround system with huge speakers
number five setup can be a pain many
people set up their projectors
permanently for example on a dedicated
ceiling there you're going to keep your
as portable however be sure to budget
set-up time before you watch you'll have
to Center the image on the screen level
it and make sure focus is sharp
projectors with zoom lenses and lens
shift can be really helpful number six
good projector is cheaper than you think
the good news is they can get an
excellent forming HD projector for less
than a decent 50-inch TV you can spend
even less but you'll be losing out on
that high def image quality so our
advice is to save up a good projector
can make movie nights truly breathtaking
and video games larger than life
