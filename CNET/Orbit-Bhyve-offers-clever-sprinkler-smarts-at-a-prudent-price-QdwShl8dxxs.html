buttons and dated interface I definitely
would not have guessed at first glance
that it's a fancy new smart sprinkler
controller but it is this is the orbit
beehive it costs 100 bucks for the 6 own
model or 120 for 12 zones you've
installed the beehive in place of your
existing controller or timer for your
in-ground sprinklers hook it up to your
Wi-Fi and download the app then you can
let beehives schedule your sprinklers
for you
it'll monitor the weather ask you some
questions about your yard and set your
ideal schedule adapting as necessary you
can control the sprinklers with an app
better yet you can control the
sprinklers with your voice beehive works
with Amazon's assistant Alexa so I can
give a voice command to any Amazon echo
device I can even bring an Amazon tap
with me into the yard ask beehive to run
the sprinklers your timer is now
watering all stations the echo skill for
the beehive is actually really good and
a bit more polish than competitor ratios
Alexa skill now the beehive app isn't as
intuitive as ratios and there aren't as
many flexible scheduling options but the
beehive has full onboard controls and
rat Co doesn't but ratchet works with
more smart home devices than beehive so
there are pros and cons to each overall
I call the Rocchi of the smarter
sprinkler controller but the beehive is
more than competent it's good and it's
worth considering if you want some
smarts but also want to save one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
