comic-con and I'll be taking you on an
exciting adventure inside the world of
Apple now the big story this week the
ipod touch gets a refresh yes you've
been asking for us since it's the last
update in 2012 and it finally happened
the new ipod touch gets some major
upgrades with apples 64-bit a 8
processor the m8 motion coprocessor for
activity there 8 megapixel camera and an
apple first on any device Bluetooth 4.1
now these are all legit improvements
three years later now the ipod touch
starts at 199 for the 16 gig model and
goes up to 3 99 for the 128 gig model
but its biggest change and be prepared
for this we say goodbye to the ipod
touch wrist strap
cheer no I'm not really sad about that
but the ipod nano and shuffle get no
speck upgrades but all the iPods will be
available in the new dark blue hot pink
and gold colors we talked about a couple
weeks ago now the big thing I'm still
waiting for is the new Apple TV but the
new york post reports real progress is
being made with the major networks for
Apple streaming TV service we talked
about the difficulties facing Apple to
secure rights for live feeds of local
channels and it might have been one of
the reasons they chose not to show it
off at WWDC well according to the report
Apple asked the network's to secure the
local affiliate rights for them which
they have done the affiliates will now
in turn get a cut of the streaming
profits and talked are now moving
forward see how that happens when
money's involved reports still say Apple
hasn't decided on its pricing for the TV
streaming plan ranging anywhere from ten
dollars to forty dollars depending on
the bundle but this is really the best
news of the show to me so far and also a
rumor report from the economic Daily
News claims that Apple would produce an
ipad mini 4 and the larger 12.9 inch
ipad pro but will not announce a new
iPad air the standard size model they
claim the goal is to spotlight the iPad
pro and relieve pressure on foxconn from
producing three different iPads at
roughly the same time now this report
also says Apple will ditch the mini 7.9
inch form factor after this year's
refresh which doesn't seem to be
believable but we will wait and see and
let's talk about the recent apple watch
sales report from slice intelligence the
good news Apple has just sold over 3
million units three months after they
started their pre-orders now that easily
destroys the reported 720,000 Android
wear watches sold in all of 2014 but
then the bad news is they also report
sales of the new Apple watch have
dropped by ninety percent since the
opening week of sales yikes now let's
think about it from launch day or the
first month or so how many more people
you know bought an Apple watch after
that really for me it's none now I know
I've met plenty of you who love your
Apple watching others who think it's
so-so which brings me back to what I've
said all along people are still trying
to figure out how wearables
can really benefit them and not even
Apple has been able to give us a true
compelling reason well just yet all
right now a lot of times companies like
Apple make claims that are sometimes too
good to be true for example check out
this TV ad that they're running this is
an iphone and it comes with something
different ninety-nine percent of people
who have an iphone love their iphone Wow
ninety-nine percent of users love their
iphones I don't know that just sounds
too good to be true so like any
respected journalist we had to put this
to the test to find out for ourselves
