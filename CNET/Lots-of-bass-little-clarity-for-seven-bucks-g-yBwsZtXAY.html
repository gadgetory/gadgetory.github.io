cnet.com and i'm here with another pair
of very budget in-ear headphones be I
love city lights these retail for around
seven dollars online they generally are
considered a very good bargain and they
get very good user opinions I did think
they were nicely built they have a
little bit bigger drivers than some of
their seven dollar competitors their 13
millimeter drivers and those are really
designed to offer up more bass so these
deliver very big bass it's not the
greatest space you don't expect a whole
lot for seven dollars and really the
problem here is that there just isn't a
lot of clarity so the high end or treble
is lackluster so you just don't get a
lot of detail so they're a little bit
muddy they do deliver big bay so if
you're in big bass for seven dollars you
can get a big base in your ear phone
they are comfortable and they do seem to
be nicely designed they come in a
variety of colors and their court is
somewhat tangle-free not totally tangle
free but it is tangle free I'm David
karna and those are the I love city
lights in your headphones thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
