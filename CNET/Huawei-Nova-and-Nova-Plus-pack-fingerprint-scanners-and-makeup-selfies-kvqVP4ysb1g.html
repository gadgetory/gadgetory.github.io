from huawei the Nova and the Nova plus
let's start with the Nova so that's a 5
inch full HD display if you spin it
around that's a fingerprint sensor there
which is a nice addition camera wise
this is 12 megapixels on the back 8
megapixels on the front if you have a
look at the underside here that's USB
type-c that doesn't mean that any old
phone charges you have won't work with
this phone but on the plus side USB
type-c is reversible so you want a flap
around trying to figure out which way to
plug in your cable it's not the
flashiest phone in the world but there
is an octa-core processor in here using
it in our brief hands on it does feel
pretty snappy it's not going to be as
fast or as powerful as the most
expensive phones but you will save some
cash next up let's talk nova plus now
this phone is pretty similar but there
are a few key differences first of all
as the name would suggest it's bigger
there's a 5.5 inch display still with a
full HD resolution batteries a bit
bigger and there's a slightly high
resolution camera too it's 16 megapixels
on the rear instead of 12 a couple of
other interesting features both phones
have a mode that filter out blue light
to make the screen a little more
comfortable to look at if you so wish
you also get while weighs knuckle
gestures the phone can tell whether
you're touching the touchscreen using
your knuckle as opposed your fingertip
and you can do things like double tap to
take a screenshot finally alongside well
ways rather surreal beauty mode when
you're taking selfies which does things
like make your eyes bigger and can
narrow your face you also now have
makeup mode which superimposes makeup on
to your face
expect to see both these phones on sale
in the next few months for much more
