not forget' ibly like every other car
like when every other car its the
uniquely American Dodge Charger we got
it in the r/t trim that means we got a
Hemi let's take a ride of this 2012
American beast and check the tech doing
that next
now the first thing you notice about a
Chrysler these days is the J gunda
screen here in the middle it says 8.4
inch is very squarish it's one of the
better interfaces these days if not the
most elegant looking I mean the blue and
red color scheme I could live without
but it's really responsive and you've
got a persistent ribbon of your
functions here at the bottom now let's
see what's behind them Radio is am/fm
satellite radio no HD radios available
we also have serious powered travel link
for fuel prices and gas station
locations and in stock ticker because
you know you're always checking your
stocks while you drive under player we
have our more interesting media under
source you see I've got my optical disc
here
SD card here you're never going to use
that auxilary jack and USB are here in
the console I've got my iPod in there
now it does a really good job of putting
the information on the screen uses the
real estate very nicely bluetooth
streaming works pretty well I didn't get
any metadata on my droid running Android
2.3 dot something I also had very
intermittent transport controls that's
one of those things where they say check
our Bluetooth site I don't care I'm not
going to go buy a phone based on my car
and I'm not going to buy a car based on
my phone and of course we have bluetooth
streaming Bluetooth hands-free calling
phonebook transfer that's all pretty
much the price of admission on cars
today and of course these chrysler
products have a pretty good incoming
text message display you can have them
read to you if you're driving read them
if you're stopped and you've got this
new message area to send out some canned
messages without too much distraction
hey dog looking for half a key Oh hook
me up they should rename the controls
menu the place where things that should
have a physical button go to die I like
my heated seats my vented seats all that
stuff have a physical persistent
mechanical switch similarly I think
sport mode should be a button by the
transmission not a soft button buried
somewhere on a screen where I may have
to leave radio to go change to sport
mode that makes no damn sense navigation
as you may know by now is the childish
but highly rated Garmin powered system I
mean it looks like a cartoon right
however this guy scores like a son of a
bitch in JD power ratings it is
considered the easiest to use the
highest consumer satisfaction look how
simple that is duh or duh what I did
find though is it's great for navigation
very clear very simple it's not good for
browsing
ODEs I was out just kind of rambling
around the country yesterday and it does
a really crappy job of letting me follow
myself on a map with great detail of
small roads around me it didn't even
recognize most of them one choice on the
gearbox kind of antiquated 5-speed
automatic they call it a slapstick
because you can slap it right and left
to shift or you can use the paddles down
shift up shift here on the wheel and of
course that sport mode I showed you
before is going to do a few things it's
going to change your throttle mapping to
get a little more easy tip-in on the gas
it's going to also hold revs higher and
it's going to seek Top Gear less now our
high trim car has blind spot detection
cross traffic alert when you're backing
out to traffic and going to get t-boned
we have forward collision warning at two
different levels of sensitivity and
adaptive cruise control so the car will
maintain a gap and not just a speed when
you're in cruise mode this car has smart
beam headlights that means they try to
always be on high beam when they detect
oncoming lights it will Taylor down the
intensity and the beam pattern to pull
it down toward a low beam but it's a
very different technology than either a
two-position beam pattern or one that
defaults to low okay yeah it's got a
heavy that's what this RT is all about
couple things going on here this is a
car that gets decent mpg we'll talk
about in a minute they're using a fuel
saver technology it's cylinder
deactivation when you don't need the
power this guy turns into a four
cylinder they end up activating one four
six and seven and the other four Pistons
cylinders will go to sleep through a
combination of turning off the ignition
turning off the fuel flow and turning
off the valvetrain on those guys now
those numbers three hundred and seventy
horsepower out of this 5.7 liter v8 395
foot-pounds of torque moves this 4500
pounds today into sixty in a little
under six seconds while delivering 16 25
mpg not bad
15:23 though if you get all-wheel drive
get the rear-wheel drive be an American
not a communist
my main impression I get when I come
away from this vehicle is you feel its
weight as I mentioned it's 4,500 pounds
and it doesn't mystify you thinking it's
like 3,000 it feels like 4,500 pounds
that's not a bad thing it's a big ol
heavy beast of a car but that also does
tell the story the engine is somewhat
trapped behind software that is not
ideal I don't think the software is
reaching for higher mpg at all time
seeking top gear the sport mode doesn't
really transform the car that much it's
a real honey when you get into the
paddles and drop it down a couple gears
and lock it there that's what unlocks
the motor it's that thing I touch on a
lot responsiveness versus power big
difference this car has lots of power
trapped behind software keeping it from
becoming as responsive as it could be I
wish had a better exhaust note RT to me
means it has a little more growl when
you get into it this one doesn't really
have much now some growl there but
there's also some Dyson in there as well
it's doesn't make it feel real athletic
okay let's price this charger and do it
CNET style the r/t starts at about 31
but it's missing too many of the tech
toys and most of the good stuff comes in
trim level upgrades so go all the way to
the top to the RT max that's going to
add some six thousand dollars to the
price now we're pushing 38 but to get
all the goodies then and most of them I
like your Alucard options are
all-wheel-drive 2350 pass sunroof about
a thousand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
