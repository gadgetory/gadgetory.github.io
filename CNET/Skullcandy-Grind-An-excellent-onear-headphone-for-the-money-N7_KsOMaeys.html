grind skull Kandi's new on your
headphone that sells for a reasonable
$60 it comes in multiple color options
including some translucent versions that
I like truth be told we haven't been too
impressed with skull Kandi's headphone
offerings in recent years we finally
found one we like in this grind it's
lightweight but seems sturdy constructed
with the metal headband and it's very
comfortable to wear particularly for an
on-ear model it also sounds surprisingly
good for the price it comes with a
couple of interesting features instead
of having the remote and microphone
integrated into the detachable cord
they're integrated into the left ear cup
which is nice a button on the outside of
the ear cup Skullcandy calls it tap tech
lets you take calls player pause tracks
and skip them forward and back it's
compatible with both iPhones and Android
phones but doesn't have any volume
controls for $60 you're not going to do
much better for sound this is a touch of
bass and treble push a little dip in the
mid-range but overall it's a
well-balanced headphone that offers
decent clarity and is pleasant to listen
to
you've heard other on ears that cost
significantly more they don't sound this
good you're not going to get quite the
richness and refinement you get from a
higher and headphone and the on ear
design doesn't seal out ambient noise as
well as an over ear model would but for
both on-the-go and office use it's good
for someone who doesn't want to spend a
lot of money for a quality headphone I'm
David karna and that's the grind a
Skullcandy headphone that we can finally
recommend without reservations thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
