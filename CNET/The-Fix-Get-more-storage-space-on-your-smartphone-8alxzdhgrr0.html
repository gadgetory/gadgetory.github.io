about ready to download a new app on
your phone but you just don't have
enough space to do so what's even worse
is that you don't even know what's
taking up room on your phone or you do
know what's taking up room but you're
just not ready to get rid of your
favorite apps or songs I'm going to show
you a few ways to free up space on your
phone on iPhones using iOS 7 you'll want
to go into settings tap general tap
usage and from here you can see how much
space is available on your phone how
much is being used and after a few
moments of calculation you'll get a
breakdown of how much storage each app
is taken up so from here you can see
every app installed on your phone and
you can decide which ones you're going
to keep and which ones you're going to
get rid of for example I was in Spain a
few months ago but I'm really not using
my spanish-language app as much as I'd
like to so I'm gonna get rid of it
and here's how you do that so go back to
your home screen find the app do a long
tap on it until it starts dancing you
get this little X icon tap the X then
tap delete and then you tap remove to
confirm and then click the home button
after you're done
another thing that takes up tons of room
on your phone music but the great thing
is that you don't even need these songs
stored on your phone in order to listen
to them as long as you have an internet
connection you can delete any song you
want and then stream it that takes up
zero space for photos you'll want to
back them up first by connecting your
phone to your computer so on androids
pretty much the exact same process if
you have a lot of music or photos on
your phone deleting those will give you
a lot more space so how do you figure
out what's taking up space on your phone
well you go into settings tap storage
and then you'll see the total space how
much space you have available and you'll
see how much apps are taken up so if I
tap on apps I'll get a list of all the
apps installed on my phone I can tap on
one and get a little bit more
information and also uninstall from here
one of the cool things about having an
Android device is that you can download
a file manager one of the best is ES
File Explorer which allows you to better
organize an access to files and apps on
your phone so those are some quick and
easy tips on how to free up space in
your phone so that next time you won't
have to scramble we want to make room
for that latest greatest app more tips
