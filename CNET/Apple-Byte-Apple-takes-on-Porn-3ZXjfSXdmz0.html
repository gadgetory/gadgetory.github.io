welcome to the Alpha bye for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
that you guys just can't get enough of
now a couple weeks ago we asked you the
Apple biters if your battery life was
affected by iOS 5 and it was really a
mixed bag of responses Apple released an
official statement saying they've
identified a few bugs that are affecting
battery life for a small number of
customers and a software update is
coming in a few weeks now while you wait
the big a has already released iOS 5.0.1
to developers that addresses the battery
issues fixes documents in the cloud
syncing and brings multitasking gestures
for the original iPad so it's coming
soon and see who says Apple doesn't
support old hardware now if you're also
wondering what happened to the iTunes
Match service or completely forgot about
it
Apple said it would be available at the
end of October and if you look really
closely at your calendar
yeah it's November but the second beta
for iTunes 1051 was released to those
developers to continue to test the
service and it's also available for
testing on the Apple TV now Apple has
provided no new estimate for a launch
date up to this point now this one will
get your attention Apple is taking on
porn see now you're awake charlie now
Apple filed a complaint with the World
Intellectual Property Organization
against several domain names featuring
the word iPhone that then forward to
mobile naughty-naughty sites one of them
is the name of a recently released
iPhone product and they sure had vision
since the site was registered in August
of 2008 the big a doesn't want consumers
to be in for a surprise when they're
looking up iPhone information and in
this case talking dirty to Siri is
probably the least of their worries
alright let's stick with the iPhone 4s
and Siri with a how-to for updating your
Twitter and Facebook status with your
voice
hey everyone I'm Sharon Vaknin for
cnet.com and today I'll show you how to
update Facebook and Twitter with Siri
what we'll do is set up Facebook and
Twitter with SMS updating and send the
updates via text message through Siri to
get started texts start two four zero
four zero four you should get a reply
from Twitter asking you for your
username so go ahead and reply do the
same when they ask you for your password
once it's confirmed reply with okay and
you should be all set now go ahead and
add four zero four zero four as a new
contact on your phone and name it
Twitter for easy access now let's do the
same thing for Facebook text hello two
three two six six five click the link in
the reply and Safari will open up to
complete the setup process choose your
settings and hit save finally add three
two six six five as a new contact and
name at Facebook now you can use these
commands to update Facebook or Twitter
with Siri send a text to Twitter
artificial intelligence is the future
you can go back to driving jogging or
doing whatever you are doing one thing
you should know is that these shortcodes
are only good for the US and a few other
countries be sure to check the Twitter
and Facebook sites to find the right
codes for your area thanks Sharon for
all of our Android viewers you can set
your phone contacts up the same way so
that tip works for everyone now back to
the stories and what's in store for the
Cupertino kids in the future digit Times
reports that Apple plans to completely
overhaul its product lineups including
the iPad iMac iPhone and MacBook Air in
2012 and is expected to finalize order
volumes for key parts and components for
the next iPad sometime in December then
digitize started smoke in a little too
much of the good stuff and claims a new
iPad will be out in March of 2012 that
will be thinner than the iPad 2 and
offer better battery life and that a
real next-gen iPad 3 won't be launched
until the third quarter of 2012 so two
new iPads
a year right that's why this story is a
lot further down in our show
now earlier in the week Japanese website
Makoto Cara says the rumored ultra-thin
15-inch MacBook Air or pro whatever you
want to call it has entered the test
phase it makes sense for Apple to go in
this direction in I know a lot of you
had just started drooling but what about
the future of the Mac Pro that hasn't
been updated since mid 2010 Apple
Insider reports that even with the
coming availability of next-gen Sandy
Bridge desktop CPUs people inside Apple
are questioning the future of the Mac
Pro line and whether they will even
release updated models with the drop off
in sales for Apple's high-end
workstations and the same trend
affecting the entire desktop industry
it's no longer a profitable operation
for Apple and the Thunderbolt
connectivity might be able to assume
some of the roles that the flexibility
of a Mac Pro required and a super
high-end iMac might be in the future
instead now Thunderbolt still has a ways
to go but we've seen Apple abandoned
products that people aren't buying like
the Xserve so see how Apple reacts with
this one all right on to the quick bytes
Steve Jobs his biography was a success
with Nielson reporting that the books
sold three hundred and seventy nine
thousand copies and it's already the
18th best-selling book this year despite
being on sale for just over a week and
Apple announced the launch of GarageBand
for the iPhone and iPod Touch that was
previously an iPad only app so you can
make music with your fingers which is
the way music is still made today
all right let's announce our winners for
the Woogy to huggable stuffed thingies
