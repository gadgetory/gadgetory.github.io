on one of the beautifully styled Sony
Xperia phones but can't quite afford the
top-end said to cast your eyes over the
much more affordable Xperia m2 like the
said Ranger m2 has an old glass front
and back has curved edges a dedicated
camera button and the same silvery power
button on the side doesn't have the
aluminium edge of a set too but it's
very similar to the older Xperia said
this purple color won't be to everyone's
taste but it definitely stands out from
the crowd
unlike the Xperia Dead phones the m2 is
a waterproof even though some of its
ports are covered by a plastic flap if
you introduce this guy to water you'll
just be left with a wet expensive
functionally useless piece of glass and
plastic the 4.8 inch display has a 960
by 540 pixel resolution which is very
disappointing as it's far below the Full
HD of its siblings and lower even and
the considerably cheaper Motorola MOTO G
icons text and images all like the
clarity you find out higher resolution
panels for those brightness and color
reproduction on paths it's running on
the now really rather old Android
jellybean another big disappointment
from this phone Sony has heavily skinned
the interface so it looks aesthetically
identical to the Xperia z2 but even so
there's no excuse for such old software
onboard even with an affordable price
tag powering the phone is a 1.2
gigahertz processor the same chip you'll
find in the Moto G didn't exactly blow
me away with its performance but it's at
least capable of handling everyday tasks
like Twitter Facebook and Instagram
without much trouble
gaming was playable but the frame rates
dropped in more tense moments so it
won't keep dedicated mobile gamers happy
around the back is an 8 megapixel camera
which although a big step down from the
20 megapixel camera in the z1 and z2 it
is capable of capturing some decent
Facebook snaps so long as you're in good
light
although bostonia Xperia m2 has a more
affordable price for its flagship
sibling and it's glass design looks
pretty good it's far from perfect it's
low resolution display seriously let's
sit down as does its outdated version of
Android for not much more money you can
pick up the older experience dead which
has a better camera if full HD screen
and it's waterproof alternatively you
save yourself a packet and go for the
Motorola MOTO G I'm Andrew Coyle CNET
and this is a Sony Xperia m2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
