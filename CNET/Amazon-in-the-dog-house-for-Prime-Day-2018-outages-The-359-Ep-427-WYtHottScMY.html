Joanie salesman Amazon on Monday
experienced a rough start to this year's
prime day with outages plaguing the
website and app right as the company was
kicking off its big annual sale the
situation was obviously embarrassing for
the world's biggest e-commerce company
but it doesn't appear to have
significantly harmed sales the company
said Tuesday that Us sales so far were
quote bigger than ever
which I guess doesn't like surprised me
that much like we didn't really know how
big this outage was or how long it
lasted in Amazon wasn't gonna tell us so
I don't know do you think this is gonna
be a big hit to them reputationally or
not I think that's probably where the
hits gonna come is that Amazon banks
itself on being this flawless effortless
effortless making it easy for you to buy
and get whatever you need as easily as
possible and it was not easy to access
their site but find what you needed
things that you knew were there you
couldn't get to that hurts
yeah yeah they even like the search at
one point was broken for me but at the
same time I spoke with one analyst
yesterday who said that look if they're
able to fix a flaw fairly quickly then
sales should be able to recover fairly
easily which it looks like that actually
happened but either way did you spend
any time buying stuff I spent so much
money
wait what kind of stuff did you get I've
had a lot of like big-ticket things I
bought luggage and very expensive vacuum
cleaners and a robot vacuum cleaner and
impressive fancy headphones I spent a
lot of money but you your bail against
all things prime yeah because I cover
Amazon I almost feel like I shouldn't
buy things on prime day I mean like I
shop around a lot but I never actually
decide on anything one thing one theory
that I do have about this this whole
failure is is it possible that they
might actually benefit from it there was
so much news around the failure that
maybe more people started shopping
I don't know I don't know I think any
time they say no press is bad press but
when the press is we can't go to your
site and buy your things that's not
going to
helped them sell stuff really yeah
that's true if you can't actually go
there to buy it I don't know they threw
so much marketing behind primed a and it
makes sense that those sales would be up
considering the reason that it was
failing it's cuz so many people are
trying to buy things but after the end
of the day you don't want this to be the
experience people have and Bezos cares a
lot about the consumer experience
totally agreed also Netflix on Monday
missed its own estimates for subscriber
growth by 1 million customers in its
second quarter results causing its stock
to tumble Joan is this a big issue for
the company do you think it's just going
to be a short-term bump I think it's
gonna be a short-term bump you got to
keep in mind that this is a Netflix
stock people that invest in Netflix
stock they are very trigger-happy they
love these 14% ups and downs is not
unusual after an earnings report and
this was a significant miss for them but
you got to keep in mind for average
people they gained four million
customers just not the 5 million they
had told people and there's some
lumpiness that's the term there's some
lumpiness and their results sometimes
they beat by significant amounts and
sometimes they miss they don't miss
often but they do miss sometimes
generally speaking Netflix isn't
sweating it for one and it seems like
this is just a road bump talk to me a
bit about how much they spend on content
the last I checked it was something like
8 billion dollars which is significantly
more than competitors like HBO or Amazon
yeah so this year they're spending a
billion dollars are expected to spend as
much as a billion dollars on their
originals and other content and spend
another 2 billion dollars just on
marketing their original so all in all
their content budget is like 10 billion
dollars that's far out swell yeah that
far outstrips any other you know like if
you look at HBO they only really create
I think don't quote me on this but I
think they only make like 40 series they
only make 40 original pieces of content
a year Netflix got Emmy nominations just
Emmy nominations for 40 pieces of
content yeah yeah which is interesting
we're talking about how much money
they're spending and the other thing I
wanted to ask you about was it looks
like it's actually benefiting them right
I mean like the Emmy nods came in and
they actually broke HBO's 17-year streak
of the most Emmy nods yeah yeah so the
executives are happy to talk about that
yesterday too as everyone was selling
off all their sockets like wait wait
wait
Emmys loved us this year Danny's always
loved Netflix and that's what happens
when you are spending ten billion
dollars on content you can create so
much that you also and when you let
creators have mostly a hands-free
experience they don't have executives
giving them notes so they're getting
really sophisticated creators producers
and directors to make content there
because they're just like shoveling
money at them so they are creating good
stuff and it works in their favor
they've been growing like crazy even
though they haven't grown in the last
quarter quite as much as was expected
cool
Last Comic Con is coming up in a few
days our own Aaron Carson plans on
attending the show for the first time
and wrote about how to prepare for all
the geekdom so check out this story if
you want to read more about these
stories check us out on CNN I'm Ben Fox
Ruben I'm Jonas Osmond thanks for
listening
okay thanks everybody for joining us as
always that's a conclusion of the
recording of the audio podcast but now
it's time to take questions and comments
and keep the whole shebang going let's
find out what other people's horror
stories have been so far on the Amazon
experience I'm sure we've got a lot of
people see in the 404 pages and freezing
up Ben you said the search locked up for
you yeah
not only that but like I was stuck in an
infinite loop for the shop all deals so
if you clicked on the shop all deals
button it just takes you back to a page
that says shop all deals and that
happened for more than an hour
my initial impression when this was
happening was okay they just loaded up
the new primed a page because it has its
own like curated customized page this is
gonna have a little bit of hiccups while
they're actually getting like a flood of
traffic coming in but they'll probably
resolve it within like 10 or 15 minutes
this thing lasted for well over an hour
and had multiple failures associated
with I was having hiccups till in the
evening like hours later I was still
having problems yes it wasn't nearly as
bad but I definitely noticed that as
well where you would still get a 404 dog
every now and then when you were trying
to like find a deal or look for the
search and eventually they were able to
recover and fix certain things I noticed
that they took off some features that
may have been breaking the site oh
really which ones they like there was
there was one that I noticed earlier on
where it was shot by categories it was
this nice new feature where you could
shop for like toys and games and
whatever when they reloaded the page
that disappeared and it didn't come back
so it's possible that that may have just
been broken and I heard from them if I
remember correctly that that was a new
feature that they were trying to
announce they were trying to roll out
this year and and the problem is is that
the company is so secretive they won't
really say what happened what the cause
of the problem was everybody assumes and
everybody figures that it's this huge
flood of traffic I mean right that's
when the site started failing was right
when they right when they started primed
a but at the same time Amazon being
Amazon right they just won't
knowledge the problem but then they just
kind of want to move on and don't want
to provide details right I mean even
them saying that sales were better than
ever that's like classic Amazon way of
categorizing how they perform they just
say better than ever hundreds of
millions or whatever they use these
super generalized ways to say things are
great yeah and when they clearly weren't
yes yeah yeah they're intentionally
vague with that they use percentage
changes they do a lot of those like
little tricks to try to avoid actually
giving hard figures but you know it's
not it wasn't a good situation for them
obviously and I think that they started
prime day
in the middle of the day this year as
opposed to like I think it was at night
last year to make sure that there would
be all hands on deck to avoid a
situation like this so you know this
company tends to execute extremely
effectively they've had a bunch of
acquisitions a lot of new areas and
that's typically how they're known
they're known for like being sometimes
the smartest guys in the room and this
is this is an unfortunate situation for
them where when all eyes are on them
this is a big day for them they had a
pretty significant failure on their yeah
it's too bad but it's they'll probably
still do a big rah-rah thing tomorrow
about how much money they made I'm sure
they will so let's talk a little bit
about what kind of Domino effects might
have been in play here bombs a bomb was
asking if Amazon Prime video went down
bill harried says Amazon streaming video
was down on his Roku that they had
thought that it was connected to the
Roku restructuring their apps but it
must have been completely on the Amazon
side because he said that the Roku
device was functioning fine otherwise do
we think that the traffic ative impacted
that those gotta be absolutely really I
believe so actually I spoke to my wife
yesterday and she told me that one of
the echo speakers was malfunctioning so
this is all based off of Amazon Web
Services is a cloud computing business
so it's possible that the flood of
traffic may have also been impacting
some of its other features or its other
services and she was trying to do
something really simple where she was
just trying to set a timer which she
does every day and for whatever reason
it wasn't functioning properly no for
not for whatever reason it was because
Amazon even though it's in
it's profit all comes from Amazon Web
Services like they're giant gigantic
server we will serve up all of your
stuff they couldn't even rely on their
own what alone yeah yeah it's this is
the company that this shouldn't have
happened to they have so many redundant
systems for a situation like this to not
happen especially on prime day and it
probably is as significant
it probably points to the enormous
amount of demand especially when like
they just opened the sale so to a
certain extent that's like a good
problem to have
but if any company was gonna be prepared
for something like this it should have
been them Netflix actually they run all
their content through AWS right I think
yeah yeah yeah they are all in that's
that's the term that they use really
Netflix is all in I think that just goes
to show that nobody is completely
impervious to the end to the mercy of
the Internet and the miracle that is the
traffic miracle all that sound it's so
weird Commerce what's the bit what's a
better term that makes it sound less
weighty toidy what's helped me I can't
think of another word than miracle now
you've put miracle in my head I'm
thinking about you know what I'm trying
to say yeah of course of course we've
seen Netflix go down time and time again
Amazon can go down we've seen Google
down remember when Gmail went down what
was that like two years ago or something
like that it happens it obviously
happens and sometimes you sit back and
you wonder like geez how does it not a
train wreck more often yeah because they
do have so many services they're really
complex companies and at the end of the
day Amazon is still gonna make a
boatload of money that's that's like the
big thing here is how much our customers
really gonna remember this are they
really gonna drop Prime because of it I
find that hard to believe I think that
they'll they'll take the hit on it it's
it's embarrassing but ultimately I think
it may and they're we're like well we'll
talk about how it really was kind of a
faceplant but beyond that I don't know
that it's really going to harm them much
yeah
Matthew datcha reports that the he had
his entire shopping cart deleted
yesterday
about that Joan what was your experience
he said you had you bought a bunch of
stuff but you had more than a few bumps
in the road yeah so I logged on right
when it started and I was able to get I
wanted to get some headphones some nice
headphones wireless headphones and I was
able to get the headphones that I wanted
into my cart but then when I tried to
check out my cart I couldn't it just
gave me these there's heavy traffic
right now try again in 30 seconds and so
I did that a couple times and I managed
to check that out but after that point I
just couldn't I couldn't search deals
I couldn't search other things I
couldn't get to the deals I'd already
watched my mo I'd set some mobile alerts
for other deals through the Amazon
mobile app to be alerted when some other
things are gonna be coming on sale those
mobile alerts didn't arrive until like
40 minutes too late and then when I
clicked on them I couldn't even get to
the deal page anyways I just got an
Amazon dogs of Amazon page so and that
continued I mean I was able to get some
other things but like throughout the
afternoon I wasn't able to at least when
I was able to get something and put it
in my cart I could check out but it took
a while before it started working like
it felt like the way it should that is
that is a lot of problems in 2016 they
had an issue where a number of customers
were complaining that they weren't able
to properly check out but that was and
and that seemed to have lasted a while
but that was fairly limited this one
this is they're in their fourth year of
prime day granted it's bigger every
single year but you would expect
something like this not to happen I mean
like I'm not trying to be too hard on
them but at the same time they hype the
hell out this thing and then the
websites not working so it's it's hard
not to you know kind of take this stance
for for something like this right yeah
did we actually see any solid deals I
know there's always been a lot of
hemming haw over Amazon Prime being like
they're just kind of clearing out their
house I haven't participated yet been a
little tied down the last 24 hours
Alex Mitchell says that the Nintendo
switch deal kind of sucked in the long
run hmm which kind of makes me feel a
little better cuz that was a one thing I
was looking forward to is anything I
think my game library of course I'd be I
think he's probably talking about that
$300 console package in which is fine
that's not a great price but it's not a
terrible
any highlights from the sales so far
that we can objectively highlight our
reviewers have been all over this all
over like crazy what are some of the
things that are our colleagues and
reviews have pointed out the thing to
like if you're on in the market for an
Amazon device whether it's an echo or a
fire TV or whatever you're probably
gonna get the best possible deal during
prime day or also Black Friday Cyber
Monday so if you don't want to pay for
it now you can wait until later the year
during the holiday season you'll
probably get a very very similar price
but Amazon is doing as much as it can to
promote its own products and services so
if you're looking for things like
signing up for like Amazon Prime music
or devices like Kindle unlimited also
like they do a lot more of their own
like home decor and clothing now so I
would say shopping for that stuff you'll
probably find some of the better deals
because they control the pricing on that
a little bit more than for the other
guys so that's the stuff that I would
point you to probably the most I think
on CNET we've got by category I think
for like home for television for PC for
audio-visual you know speakers and
headphones and Lynette we've got pages
that'll explain some of the best deals
there are people slavishly monitoring
all the deals that are coming up sorry
yeah they're doing a lot of content
related to that so definitely check out
the website if you are interested in
checking out deals in specific
categories for sure there's a lot of
coverage from the reviews team on that
in before shameless self-promotion
Matthew dogger asks what was with the
dogs in the error pages so I know this
was earned I think this was genius like
I don't I don't care and i love that the
our headline pretty much everybody's
headline who was covering the story was
like well Amazon's broken but Elise's
cute dogs yeah
so the cute dogs aren't new those cute
dogs are just like what they populate
404 pages with and those are dogs of
Amazon's so it only was my favor I just
want to highlight cannoli for the
relevant movie convinced lots to love
about canal so these these specifically
are
Amazon employees and Amazon is very
dog-friendly when I was there in Seattle
last year there they like make a point
of having like doggy treats around and
like water bowls and they they let
employees like bring their dogs to their
office so to kind of up that even more
they have the the 404 pages or now the
dogs of Amazon so it's possible or it's
very very likely that people just didn't
notice that before but they were always
there so if you just punched in
amazon.com slash a bunch of gobbledygook
that doesn't make any sense
you will probably find a dogs on Amazon
page and it wasn't new for prime day or
anything like that it was just knew that
people were seeing it when they were new
because that doesn't usually happen it
was it was a nice bomb for a Ozzie
situation because the dogs are really
cute and it was just it was a cute idea
but they it's not that they did it
specifically for prime day so but yeah I
think you mentioned you kind of miss the
fail wail it's a fail we'll gone I think
I think so I think it's gone not only do
they have less failure in that respect
but respect only have less failure
failure on other counts but not that
kind of failure but I think they got rid
of that I think they did get rid of fail
well it's too bad there 404 is it's
different how soon until we see things
like nostalgic memes come around full
circle like we've got the Nokia 3310
like the nostalgia Tech has come full
circle how long until we start seeing
like uh well I wish I wish as much as
I'd like to believe that Jack Dorsey is
watching the show he's not but if you
are watching bring back the fail whale
jack
alright we got enough time for a couple
more quick questions over or at least
comments from our buddy Michael Brown he
says the best thing about prime day was
the competing sales on Best Buy Google
etc I think that is kind of a good thing
you know you could say money is the root
of all evil and commercialism is the
devil but jobs and business that mean it
is kind of nice to see like this is a
nice shot in the arm to the economy in a
time where there's
rarely any major commerce going on its
opposite like almost polar opposite of
Black Friday so props to Amazon for you
know kind of revving the engines a
little bit I mean Christmas in July is
something that happens happen to retail
jomeyer I have learned that that is not
as commonplace as we once thought I am
very familiar with Christmas in July but
I have talked to a lot of people are
like what the hell are you talking about
yeah it's definitely not the same as
actual Christmas but it's something that
you know I think real sellers have tried
this tactic before where you know it's
it's pre back-to-school it's a slow time
of year it's after spring when a lot of
you know like gardening and home
improvement places have a lot of have a
lot of business so I think like it's
something that like the people retailers
artificially drum up and have done for a
long time but never on the scale of it
was like something's ever been on the
scale of Amazon yeah one of the things
also related to Michael Browns comment
one of the things that I appreciate it
was apparently Macy's had had a specific
promotion where they were like look at
all the stuff that you can buy for a
hundred and nineteen dollars or less so
that was like a direct dig at Amazon
Prime membership fee which is one
hundred and $19 like look at all the
stuff that you can buy if you just don't
pay that membership fee which is their
heart which is great I mean like and
granted all of those other retailers are
really trying to do a dig on Amazon's
membership fee because it was they
raised it by $20 this year it's now one
hundred and nineteen dollars and so a
lot of these other retailers are
specifically saying here are these deals
and you do not have to pay a membership
fee for them so they are trying to find
different ways of competing against
Amazon even though Amazon it is still
very much their big day and they're the
juggernaut like they're the ones that
made prime day they're the ones that are
making the most sales for this
particular time all right let's take one
from Channing che they ask why is it the
Amazon keeps you from viewing prime day
deals if you're not already a prime
customer I'm not gonna sign up for a
service if I'm not allowed to see the
benefits is this an element of
exclusivity then you say it's not true I
know customer for years so on this
computer specifically I'm not signed in
to my account
I am able to shop on the prime day deals
and I makes more sense oh yeah they
don't they don't hide it from you
because specifically this is a big
opportunity for them to drum up new
prime customers exactly and to guys say
and to get people to sign up for the
30-day free membership so they want you
to see the deals they want you to get
enticed by it maybe you've never gone on
Amazon before you've never considered
being an Amazon member before this is a
big opportunity for them to do something
like that so yes if you are interested
in looking for the deals you're not a
Prime member you can go on Amazon and
absolutely shop around before deciding
whether you do or you don't want to pay
that money or get the trial membership
from Bom Bom
it's kind of an off topic question but
Joe and you may be able to floor this
one if AT&amp;amp;T merged with Warner bruh or
with Time Warner Warner Brothers do you
think Netflix would be pushed out of
business no because a it's pretty sure
that's happening and B Netflix doesn't
rely on Time Warner for very much of its
content that's part of the reason why
it's spending eight billion dollars ten
million dollars total on on content and
almost the majority of that is on
originals it's so they don't have to
rely on other people's content the the
terms that other people want to set in
order to have a robust catalogue of
stuff to watch so one of the things that
might be a little bit more threatening
is if Fox and Disney merge Disney is
already planning to have what people
refer to as Disney flicks next year it's
their subscription service that will
basically package in all the movies from
Disney that you love for a Netflix like
low low monthly fee that's more
threatening to Netflix because Netflix
has had those Disney movies like Pixar
movies the Marvel movies they had a
specific deal with just need to get
those
so that's Disney said we're not going to
renew that deal it's gonna end and
they're gonna launch their direct
Netflix competitor that's going to be
more threatening to it but 18 t buying
Time Warner isn't gonna have much no
effect in terms of the content you get
it'll be another competitor as they
launch subscribing streaming
subscriptions
services because they have that new
stuff but it's kind of Netflix's I mean
it's hard to underestimate how much they
lead this space they've got you know a
hundred and hundred plus million members
worldwide that's a really long runway
ahead of anybody else
yeah and they saw this coming that's why
they spent so much money on their own
even with Disney flex there they're well
ahead of the game and honestly from a
consumer perspective most consumers
would rather spend just the money on one
service like Netflix which they already
are customers of then you know all these
other players going out on their own and
getting you to you know not just buy
Netflix but everything else all right
yeah but that seems to be the future
that we're moving toward yep excellent
answer to close it out let's take one
more from bill harried any estimates on
the number of users who actually logged
in yesterday what is Amazon's breaking
point god that's a good question but
like Amazon everybody Jeff let's find
this Amazon never gets that close to
actually providing like real specific
numbers
I did get some hour-by-hour comparative
information from like a third-party
company called feed visor which
specifically mentioned that there was a
five percent decrease in total sales
from like you know the marketplace
sellers during the four pm hour so other
than that everything was up and by 7:00
p.m. it was actually more than double
but as far as specific numbers that's
that's harder to say but it was there
was an obvious hit during the early
hours and then after that like it was
all systems go and like people were
spending way more than they were last
year as we saw with Joan yeah well
that's lame I thought you would actually
be able to give us a little more
information sorry about the kind of fake
toss over blame Amazon they're the ones
that never give specifics about anything
that seems unnecessary to play that kind
of information so close to the truth I
understand is I mean that's hot tech
gears right now it's I feel like it's a
pendulum like and that's I mean I'm
gonna extrapolate this really far but
that's part of the problem that we're
seeing with like Facebook and like the
that all these tech companies are so
Chloe stirred and hold everything so
tight to the best that people are like
hey you need to tell me what you're
doing with my private information we're
not talking about privacy here obviously
it's different but it's definitely just
a cultural thing that may be stirring to
start swinging in the other direction
now there's been so much scandal one
would hope so but as a good example Jeff
Bezos announced just this year how many
Prime members there were worldwide prime
has existed for god I should know this
offices top of my head but it's
something like 15 no 20 20 plus years
right because yeah yeah because Brent a
started four years ago for the 20th
anniversary of prime or the twentieth
anniversary of the company but either
way wait a minute I might be getting
some of those numbers wrong but needless
to say and 100 and around over 20 be
been around like maybe seven or eight
okay either way they avoided
specifically mentioning how many Prime
members there were up until this year
and it was a huge number for the company
so just so you get a good idea of how
much they keep things close to the vest
that's a good example
whoops all right well we of course what
we are out of time for everybody still
prime dang out there we just want to say
happy hunting keep us posted if you find
anything good if you break it again or
you know tweet at us let us know what
the hell is wrong with the experience
overall or how disappointed you are and
how bad this Christmas really was who
wants to take us out today I'll do it
anyway sorry prime was founded 13 years
ago February 25th 2005 it's something
that I feel like I really should have
