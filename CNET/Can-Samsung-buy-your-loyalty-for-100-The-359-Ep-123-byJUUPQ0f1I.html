it's time for episode 123 of the 359
podcast with Roger Cheng and Ben Fox
Rubin good morning guys morning happy
Thursday greetings we're almost over the
week's almost done yeah alright alright
I was not sound too excited way I don't
have to look at you goons anymore there
you go that's something to look forward
to sure um so surprise surprise we're
gonna be talking about Samsung again
again yeah the new pokemon go it's
dominated the headlines and it continues
to do so and we'll talk a little bit
about the little incentive that Samsung
throwing in mm-hmm to get you to turn
your notes Evans back in yeah and we've
also got a feature about the NYPD and
smartphones they've yes you'll never in
the future you'll never guess which
phone yeah I actually can't wait to talk
about it's pretty awesome and also
Obama's budding cyber war with Russia
hmm the new Cold War the new Cold War 9
ends up happening right now China I so
let's get started yeah let's do it look
as always if you have any questions
about these topics leave them in the
comments section our producer Brian will
grab and we'll do our best to answer
them all right and we'll start the
recording in three two welcome to the
359 where we talk about the top tech
news of the day plus whatever crap we
want to throw in I'm Ben Fox Rubin I'm
rock cocaine Samsung is trying to
prevent a flood of customer defections
by offering a hundred bucks that anyone
who trades in their galaxy note 7 for
another samsung phone this offer comes
after samsung had to issue yet another
recall on its fire starting note 7 so
Roger 100 bucks is that enough to
rebuild trust no I mean it's a nice
first step I think it's nice a little
olive branch I think the real incentive
here the real motivation is Samsung
really wants to get people trade in
their phones there we've talked to a
number of hardcore super fans of notes
Evans who who say despite all the
warnings despite all the reports they
will keep their phone and they will just
take the r is really dumb yeah and so do
not agree with that
it's completely stupid by the way if you
have note 7 you should absolutely turn
it back in because there is you know
there is a real hazard the percentages
are low theoretically but they're much
higher than what any anyone in the
industry feels comfortable with right
and you will live another day right to
buy a note aid or whatever the heck they
call that new phone so yeah it look it's
it's definitely it's a couple couple
reasons for this right it's a little bit
of an olive branch it's also trying to
get people to actually turn in their
phones lastly this 100-dollar deal only
applies if you trade in for another
samsung phone so it's trying to keep
they're trying to keep you in to Samsung
right ecosystem or Samsung family just
to note that if you want to trade your
phone in for another brand another
device like HTC LG whatever they will
give you a $25 credit so it's not it's
not they're not giving you not as nice
that is nice but it's something well how
many folks do you think are going to
swap to a different phone maker it's
hard to tell because these folks are the
most loyal Samsung customers they said
time and time again if no 7 users are
almost fanatical about Samsung they love
their aspect literally do no wrong well
that's that the folks that we talked to
about why they want to keep their phones
because there's nothing really
comparable in the market you know the
nice i phone 7 plus you know the
upcoming pixel x all these are all big
phones but they're not quite what the
note is Note has an S Pen Stylus and
that's that's sort of custom-made for
the phone and the users of the note
franchise are just they're just they
love that thing so it there isn't really
another alternative out there that's
like the note well alright maybe maybe
we maybe the NYPD has found the solution
for them I don't think so actually so
next up the NYPD this year finally
caught up with the modern age by
equipping all its officers with
smartphones the phones can be used to
respond to crimes faster and connect
with folks in the community but I was a
little surprised by the phones they
chose these are microsoft lumia windows
phones yes windows phones even still a
thing not really the kind of i mean
their thing is in there
products out there but no one's buying
them right well except for the image of
the what and the worst part about is
these phones one of them came out 2014
the other one came out last year these
are all outdated phones I don't think
you could actually buy them now or you
might find them in a bargain bin
somewhere nice but good text that's what
to be fair the NYPD argues that you know
they picked it for security features and
the ability to remotely manage these
devices although I would argue you could
do the same thing with an iphone or
android maybe I don't know I don't know
anything about Windows no absolutely can
but just an interesting point that like
are you know the finance New York's
finest is protecting us with the power
of Windows Phone sure sure and last
Obama is waiting some sort of response
to Russia's alleged cyber attacks to
sway the presidential election this
could be some badass cyber warfare it's
already going on right now but what I
think is really interesting about it is
is that it's possible the US will never
actually admit to doing any offense yeah
I know it's like the secret war that's
going to go on look I have bhama if
you're listening to the podcast because
I know you are please enlist me on this
cool cyber war I want to ya know we had
Russian front lines of this cyber war
yes absolutely so if you want to read
more about these stories check us out on
CNN I'm Ben Fox Rubin I'm Roger Cheng
thanks for listening and go figure we
have a lot of hardcore Samsung fans on
the chat today really be bought back no
shocking no and as well they should
however one I found fascinating is
someone who's incurred like a double
whammy Joseph said they cannot buy me
back especially now that have a six
month old washer that's on a recall with
him they have no idea yeah he got the
exploding phone and exploding washers
yeah it's an ad hoc loading washer that
uh if you hey if you run it at syrtis
cycle like well the nuts and bolts will
I blow out dude that sucks like we're
sorry berries are you up but it yeah
it's pretty terrible yeah but i mean III
do hope that samsung bout I don't think
they they could possibly hurt so bad
from this like they're they're not
little bit okay will survive fatal move
not sure they can dig in bounced back
from the system take a wagon and still
around I mean
I know and they had to face a ton of
other regulars we were having a
discussion about sort of what comparable
to this in terms of what's happened in
the mobile industry there have been
other phone recalls and other and it's
like there's but nothing to this
magnitude right had to actually ship no
we had to basically compare it to the
Volkswagen incident recall of the Ford
Pinto the tylenol Tylenol pill recall I
mean those were that's the kind of like
that's a magnitude of terribleness that
this is now it's not just like a minor
tech recall it's like Samsung
transcended the tech industry by the way
they never would have wanted to go that
all yeah too little too late it's a
hundred bucks it is in in some ways but
I think people tend to forget sometimes
and so when they come around with the
essay and it's also hard to argue that
it's too late cuz a lot of this kind of
dragged on there were like multiple
developments to it that even Sam that
was kind of out of Samson's control
right like there was a first recall and
there was a the way for the CPSC to
weigh in and that happened and then the
second stuff happened like it just to be
fair or Samsung didn't do a really good
job of communicating these issues
especially during the second time around
but you know it part of it was out of
their control yes because their phones
were terrible this time they'll be back
probably better than ever though let's
be honest and I'm so really this is
going back under the microscope after
this oh absolutely what thing the thing
is fairly subjected to say how big an
impact this truly did have I mean yes it
was bad but it's not like the entire
line exploded right that would be a real
problem like if no kidding if the essay
came out a one-percent failure rate oh
my god that would definitely always
really tragic that would that would
cause them to return our business but I
think the most the the comment that rang
most true through this entire week's
worth of shows discussing this as we
drill it into the ground is the person
who said this is going to really put
shine a spotlight back on the concept of
quality control not only absolutely but
across yeah all consumer brands oh yeah
you know I had reported digging into
this in terms of looking at this
kind of issue we found that no one
really actually tests for this sort of
thing like maybe I'm sure Samsung
eternally does but in terms of like
government regulatory agencies the the
carriers phone carriers who also do
their own testing most of the testing is
on based on like signal quality whether
or not the phone can actually make it
works yeah no one really tests something
like this that's why I kind of like
slept through everybody's radar
interesting yeah I guess maybe they'll
be adding some additional testing later
just as a major you know what safety is
what I imagine is what was one one thing
that was really impressive with his
phone they packed in a lot into a fairly
thin device right his thin it was small
it was pretty compact for the the power
that had the screen size that it had I
think all those resources drawing that
battery I think they're gonna date a
second they didn't have give a second
thought to you know making the next
phone f thin or as slim as possible i
think it might be even a little bit
bigger just a comedy space well maybe if
the technology bakes for another year i
would say that that that could
potentially help them bring back
something very similar but they just
needed to spend a little bit more time
improving the blueprint yeah but because
that's what got people so excited about
the note 7 in the first place was that
they packed so much into that one design
yeah and i think it's the pressure of
just constantly trying to one-up
yourself eventually something like this
was bound to happen yeah yeah that's a
good point here's some interesting
information now this is from our friend
and listener mark in the chat and we
have no way to 100 sent validate this
data so take it with a grain of salt but
it sounds pretty believable so he says i
work for a wireless carrier thirty
percent of the note 7 trade ins have
gone to Apple fifty percent have
switched to another samsung device and
twenty percent have moved on to another
Android device now again they can't
present this as fact right but thank you
Mark for contributing information and
there sounds like there's some merit to
that like Nielsen well actually I'm a
little surprised but I didn't think that
note 7 users would move to Apple like I
didn't think well but you're only
talking about thirty percent 70 that's
that's a bigger chunk than I was even
expecting because if I'm if I'm a note 7
user on pretty hardcore about
some hardcore walk Android I probably
would have gone to another android phone
or gone to Samsung like most of the
folks I talked to who did trade in their
phones went to an s7 edge they weren't
happy about it they went to a they went
to that edge that sort of the stepped
outside that came out earlier this year
and I was really expecting people to
kind of especially with the second round
to kind of hold off maybe wait for the
pixel Excel yeah just not have a
smartphone for a while I guess that's
true that's probably that really option
is it no but I pigeons yeah no I think
I'm gonna keep pitching this until it's
completely done after the point I was
making like there's not really another
comparable phone like there's the
there's LGV 20 that's come out there's
deal like it's the boat 0 Z but there
aren't that many phones that could do
with the note 7 right so you might have
to go back to the note 5 yeah something
like that yeah well given that concept I
guess it makes sense that they will come
out with something pretty similar to the
note 7 next year like after they
actually I just don't know if they're
gonna call crouched afraid I saw her no
way your time yeah no I can really slow
down the process but yeah at first I was
like no way are they gonna kill off the
note name but after so many of these
podcasts no I'm starting to think you
know what like maybe they will get rid
of the note name and just be like it's
called something different you think
talking by next week our bosses will let
us move on to another topic of course
not no no no no silver talk about this
let's just go back to Pokemon go please
okay those are more innocent times right
right 2016 has become very very dark oh
yeah hey uh marks back in the chat and
he says windows phones oh my god ice age
for cell phones into which I assume
you're talking about the huge
blockbuster film hit ice age starring
Ray Romano and if that's the case yeah
or one hundred percent correct that is
right yeah it's kind of like switching
gears it's unbelievable the NYPD like
one finally just got phones smartphones
right like sedition note in know what I
you know what I thought about it I
realized maybe they got windows phones
because there
less likely to be stolen you know if
like somebody for doing what is yeah
like if a cop accidentally dropped it on
the street or sometimes though though
people try all the cops guns and you
know little don't know that it's a cop's
phone but if it's a Lumia they're like
here can I turn this and like I don't
even want and that's just like the
latest lube years too late yeah I'll de
lluvias picture that scene from The
Simpsons were they break in the Lenny's
house and he's like don't tell any what
I live like this which is done Ferris is
unlike knows what are the interesting
points of its Alfred story by the way
and is that before they got these phones
they were actually unable to give out
their phone number or an email dress
like or an email address like for
someone who's like for victim trying to
get in touch with that officer they had
to basically call it the precinct and I
leave a voice message in a lake group
phone right that like sometimes the
entire school on had to share oh it was
impossible to reach an officer if you
actually had to because it was against
the policy like give out your personal
phone number and they didn't have email
addresses or something so it's really
really rather strange I was just kind of
floored by the fact that I was just like
we didn't have smartphones yep like what
is what's going on here so all right
they have them now thank God yes and
eventually little the upgrade to Windows
10 mm hmm and so that would be great
yeah they're not even upgrade it that
one doesn't either there yet no because
they've got the old those are old phones
are running on Windows Phone 8 i believe
right vista vista their phones they're
fighting crime with the phones so before
we wrap it up before the inevitable
grand return of samsung because it will
bounce back hopefully stronger than ever
after this do you there's a there's a
question in the chat do we think that of
all people right now Google pixel can
capitalize on this fault yeah I think so
no really I understand the benefit the
most I would think that they would try
to rush the phones out earlier but we've
seen what's happened with that idea yeah
maybe they'll make sure but it's coming
out in like later this month anyway yeah
it'll be pretty soon and I
think that those phones have a lot of
what people are looking for the XL is
probably a pretty good note 7
replacement I think so similar size a
high-end specs all the out great camera
all stuff you really want it doesn't
have a stylist but then no other phone
has a stylist I mean it didn't really
there shatter any new ground here but
it's a good middle road pretty
attainable pretty adaptable I don't look
like I could probably get my mom on a
pixel if you're really interested in
there AI platform too I think that maybe
the note 7 people are curious about like
whatever cutting-edge technology right
is available out there and so you can
jump on board and start talking to a lot
you can have awkward conversations with
Google assistant yeah yeah definitely
kind of like what we do here Siri shut
this show down there you go big all
right good good place to wrap things up
if you like anything you saw here check
us out on cnet our podcast is also
available on itunes tune in stitcher
SoundCloud feedburner and google play
music that's it for the week see you
