the 3:59 podcast CNET's daily news
podcast my name is Vivi gene on
Wednesday October 3rd is episode 468 and
check out this little factoid today is
techy Appreciation Day a day to show
some love for the techies in your life
also virus Appreciation Day which is a
good time to maybe run a scan if you
haven't in a while
here's a little history on this in 1999
it was experience of new jobs would
require advanced technology skills that
Americans do not have techies calm and
CNET launched national techies day to
encourage kids to embrace computer
science and even the monikers that they
are sometimes attached to contemporary
technology and this is of course all
during national cybersecurity month as
well so absorb that enjoy the show
here's Rowan and Roger thanks for that
lovely intro yeah it's cyber security
month which all the time this cyber we
won't be talking about today that today
though we'll be talking about breaking
down the Microsoft Surface event
yesterday they launched a whole bunch of
products we'll break them all down for
you
and then quickies will talk about a gig
ability and I'll answer any questions
about gave it LTE that you have if you
want to smile
there you go all the answers it's pre 5g
so it's kind of interesting anyway if
you have any questions about either
these topics I leave them in the
comments section but I will pick up the
best and will get them in three minutes
or 59 seconds from 3:00 to Microsoft
well sorry welcome to unite around a jam
Microsoft unveiled a slew of new
products yesterday we got the surface
pro 6 a new surface laptop and update to
that ginormous surface studio but the
biggest surprise was a new pair of
surface headphones and it's funny that
Microsoft which is slowly been shifting
away from consumers and towards big
business they still keep experimenting
with these new products Joe what's your
biggest takeaway from this event I mean
I think it's interesting you could it be
very easy to make the criticism that
it's sort of a throwing stuff against
the wall sort of thing
like coming out like right but the thing
about the surface products is they
really do feel pretty like fully baked
yeah when they come out so the
headphones seem like they're that's our
David Carr knowing got an exclusive and
got to hear about how they've been
working on it for three years right but
aside from the headphone surprise you
know the laptop and the tablet they're
really just kind of our superficial
upgrades to a lot of internal spec
upgrade yeah that's not a full redesign
on those on those two people have to
wait until next year if they're looking
for something that really changes I do
want time with a headphone more because
the they've got the knobs or the what
are the dials the dials on this each
side of the head one for volume 1 for
noise cancellation which actually flying
kind of brilliant I think so dials are a
big part of surface studio yes exactly
they've got some experience with that
and so I've got a pair of bose
noise-canceling headphones I mean I just
got from sadly but I would like I would
at least try these I would get it's just
searching that Microsoft put up this new
product and I like I'm already kind of
interested in it one of the downsides
for the headphones it seems is that the
battery life via wireless not great oh
yeah it's like 15 hours which doesn't
hold up very well I mean I know with my
wireless noise cancelling headphones
like in good days yeah same here with my
Bose headsets but that's that's kind of
sad I guess it's it's got the touch
controls though it's got these little
gimmicks that are like oh that's kind of
cool I'm gonna drain your battery yeah
yeah and I guess it works
sadly works with just Cortana Wow I mean
what do you know they've got a whole
deal with Amazon so at least some Alexa
help but I don't know
we'll see alright lastly I want to talk
a little bit about Ortiz my explainer on
gigabit LTE it is a form of pre 5g
network technology that's been the the
Kara's have been steadily upgrading
already it's been around for a while but
it's got new good irrelevance was the
iPhone 10s and 10's max now support it
unfortunately the iPhone 10 R does not
yet or won't support it but like as the
name suggests it gives you theoretically
a peak speed of one gigabit per second
of LTE speeds and that is pretty much as
fast as your fastest home connection Wow
so it's noticeable difference
yeah it's noticeable difference I mean
you're not you're never gonna get that
theoretical peak but yeah if trials or
tests have shown that you can get speeds
up like hundred and like 100 mil of mega
bits per second which is you know a
significant bump from what we're getting
now I think T Mobile has the highest
average speed right now corner open
signal that's around 20 yeah so
significantly higher yeah that means
more I don't know that's buffering being
able be able download videos in in in
minutes instead of an hour hours
but yes for all that for all the details
on gigabit LTE check out the explainer
is on CNET today so we're full coverage
also seen it I'm Roger Chang thanks
listening alright thanks everybody for
joining us for the recording of the
audio podcast you can subscribe using
the links below right now send in your
comments and questions about anything
surface related now we spend a lot of
time on the headphones but we didn't
really get to spend much time on any of
the new products Joan you said it's
really just kind of a cosmetic upgrade
that's why we spend so much time in the
headphones it was something new
headphones did kind of come out of
nowhere yeah yeah yeah it was a nice
exclusive for David Carr Noah and for
CNET but yeah I think it was a surprise
everyone that they'd even would come out
with something like this know the studio
hadn't been updated at all since its
introduction in 2016 so even though it's
not a revolutionary change for the
studio that all in one giant computer
even though it's not a revolutionary
change for the studio it's still a
long-overdue update for their kind of
you know top tier big flashy computer
yeah I mean do people buy own ones so
like I have an iMac Azure but you know
many years yeah I guess yes and I
remember when they introduced it I was
at that event it was a really impressive
computer for people that aren't me I
still haven't tried it like how was the
dial was that like actually cool to you
but you you know if you're not somebody
who is if you're not an architect who's
drafting or making models or you're not
an artist or a designer I just don't
know if in those workflows if it really
is that's helpful
yeah that's integrating that new way of
interacting with your screen at some
rate I would really be helpful
I just don't know because I don't I
don't know if it ever I mean really
caught on like I feel like it still
looks really cool looks cool but like
that's great and Trello anybody who owns
a studio I mean although they give the
odds of someone in New York City owning
something massive like that it's pretty
pretty slim okay Brian what do we got
for questions for questions is take one
from Alex it says do you think others
will start to copy Microsoft's feature
to increase or decrease noise
cancellation oh that's a good question
you sound so surprised
no I'm gonna be surprised but all the
good questions you always
yeah I think Bose has that setting now
like I can I can adjust the level of
noise cancellation others do others do
too but I least in my experience which
is limited that it's just kind of tricky
you know like it's not as intuitive it's
just like yeah like it's true that you
have to like press certain buttons I
think mine and for mine I have to use an
app that's gonna be like a headphone so
it's not there's no physical button I
think that really controls it so having
a dial is kind of nice yeah and I'm sure
most people use their noise cancelling
headphones at the max of noise
cancellation generally but there aren't
instances where I have them on and it's
kind of like you know I would like to
have a little bit when I'm using them at
home and like I want to be able to like
if my husband's calling me from the
other room it would be nice to you know
just get a little bit of that
cancellation for street noise from the
window or whatever without being totally
tuned out right here's another one from
Alex that I found kind of interesting to
think of Isis unlike with Apple when I
see the windows logo I only think of PC
and I'm a Windows fan so to see that
logo on headphones kind of throws me off
even though they do look really good and
a lot of people do agree
the headphones are aesthetically
pleasing yeah we'll talk a little bit
more about sound quality in a minute but
that's an interesting thought is
Microsoft gonna become kind of a like
omnipotent brand much like Apple has
where they are on all kinds of different
products that aren't necessarily
computers you know maybe I mean yeah I
think they've done a good job of
cementing the surface brand is this
premium like yeah aesthetics they've
done a really good job with design for
all their products and the headphones
are no different in terms of like
expanding in all kinds of different
categories I guess I could we couldn't
say no at this point cuz who would have
guessed that a few months I'm not
expecting a clock from them anytime soon
kind of cool though the surface clock
with Cortana as well oh poor Cortana but
yeah they're definitely still far away
away from like Amazon we're introducing
two dozen I think partly because they
have kept their surface brand really I
mean like as much as I hate to flatter
Apple this way and sort of like an apple
like it's always gonna be a very well
designed yes thing um they're going for
that kind of thing I think they've
succeeded so far yeah generally I mean
the surfaces are surface devices are
generally well reviewed and and I think
they top a lot of our recommended list
so yeah done good job with it a lot of
people are asking a lot of specifics
about the headphones now just to
disclaim we don't have him in-house we
had to send car noise out to experience
them firsthand he wasn't available this
morning but we should have him on the
show to kind of talk about them totally
more detail he does have a review up the
link will be in the description so if
you want to go get more of a better
explainer when I had a little one-on-one
with him after just recording his
voiceover for the video he seemed like
surprisingly satisfied with him he goes
are they game changers no is it a game
changer for Microsoft maybe I says the
quality holds up across the board there
no Bose QuietComfort s-- but they were
damn good I'll be at probably overpriced
that was my summation of what I took
away from my conversation with David
Carr annoy that being said a lot of
people are asking about the sound
quality yeah well I haven't tried them
and you haven't tried them so I'm really
just kind of
on what karna has said in his review
which is that you know as you said that
the quality's kind of holds up yeah
generally speaking with the tier of
competitors that it's on let me see I
mean yeah I mean I think generally it's
pretty competitive in terms of noise
quality but I mean yeah like I said
they're not quite those I guess and
those is sort of kind of that standard
standard for noise cancellation
kay Jones asks can you play xbox with
those headphones well they don't have a
microphone on them so if you are just
looking for that I mean they have a wire
on them so you can just tap them into
any box it has an 8 engine there there
are microphones on the headphone
actually oh there are yeah yeah because
they can be used as your your smartphone
headphone as well my mistake I apologize
so in terms of Xbox capability I don't
think it's mentioned in the review at
all but it becomes dumb if it couldn't
work with your controller although a
controller doesn't have Bluetooth so
that's that would be I wonder if they're
they'll have some sort of USB C to like
Xbox controller adapter adapter yeah I
have to look into that thanks for that
question that's a great no that's that
really good question because it's not
really mentioned but it seems gonna no
brainer to have this work with Xbox how
much are they going for I school is
asking I think I saw a 350 yeah pretty
pricey
yeah and it's sticking to that Microsoft
you know surface premium in reputation
having a a premium price product there
and what about the rest of the surface
lineup how old radically have any the
prices changed for those products I
don't know about the changes but the pro
the surface pro tablet is $8.99 the
surface pro laptop to those surface
laptops who is looked
$9.99 thousand dollars yeah and then the
surface studio starts at 3500 which you
know a lot of money I mean the surface
laptop to you consider it when you rank
it against you know Apple laptops it's
the pretty decent price actually
sorry more awkward silence sorry sorry
sorry I'm usually pretty good about that
so speaking of the surface book and the
surface laptop what is the difference
between the surface book to and the
surface laptop - I'm gonna ask that
myself
well the laptop doesn't detach right the
book had the detachable screen so it was
kind of that hybrid where laptop is just
sort of a pure laptop it's I guess the
most direct competitor to him a MacBook
Air MacBook Pro I guess MacBook Air
yeah be the competitor whereas the book
was I think that was the more expensive
one right and has a detachable screen so
there but then is I mean those are
aesthetic changes is it really it's a
functional change you can pull if you
pull out the half of the display it
becomes a tablet right so it's like I
said it's it's more of that hybrid
category as opposed to a pure laptop
category but what's going on under the
hood oh I don't know the stats for the
book yeah the book hasn't been updated
so it's it's a little bit common it's
not a fair comparison at this point
because the the laptop got a refresh
next question is coming in from Matthew
dacher I find noise cancellation
headphones often give me headaches does
anyone else have that problem and how do
you deal with it I agree we do Matthew
I'm not a big fan of noise cancellation
also I live in a busy spot where if I
listen to my music cancelling out the
noise around me I'm probably gonna get
plowed by a truck I just I don't enjoy
the feeling I don't think it's worth the
results yeah I don't think I've had a
full-on headache but I don't find it
comfortable there's something about it
that makes me anxious maybe I loved
about you guys why I mostly wear them on
airplanes and that is when it really
kicks in because it it's most effective
with like ambient noise so having the
the plane engine noise completely
disappear it's just it's nice oh yeah
yeah but I don't get headaches yeah
here's a question from Vivek why is a
surface studio coming with a 7th gen
processor even though
a few months the ninth-generation is
going to be coming out I mean I think
that you mentioned this or like the
bigger changes are coming in in a year
or so right some of the stuff I think
it's just it was time for a refresh and
they were using the chip that they could
use really wish we had Ackerman on to
really kind of spell out the the chip
justification but I think that's
generally is just a matter of timing do
we know what the resolution of the
surface studio is I'm sure we do hold on
one sec thirteen point five million
pixels 192 dpi what is the resolution on
that we'll get back to you in the
meantime is right oh wait it's uh jeez
wait is that right 4500 bucks yeah dozen
yeah that's the best ones buy right yeah
a ginormous shine yeah and what about
Qualcomm gigabit LTE Timothy and Vic are
asking if any of these products are
gonna be LTE compatible I don't believe
so I know there was a sort of a separate
line of PCs using Qualcomm processors
with LTE built-in but this isn't I don't
think any of these are involved with
that it's almost like a side project and
so I think these are all your
traditional Intel CPUs I don't believe
there's LTE options for any of these and
Sanjay is asking about the bezel hoping
it's going to get smaller in future
products do we have any news on that no
we don't they new since I mean these as
John puts out these these products are
pretty much the same as they were in the
past I'd like to see them kind of slim
down the bezel it would take more of I
think its trigger design than just like
your your normal smartphone tablet since
you know they built these devices around
the keyboard covers and the keyboard
accessory which has to be a certain
width for this to work so if they slim
down the bezels that would make the
device small or I guess or I guess they
could expand the screen either way we
don't know yet because these are the
products that are out there new I'm sure
they're they're working on prototypes
that and are considering removing the
bezel given that served in the trend
across the entire industry but right now
this is
we've got are there any laptops out
there that do support LTE this needs to
be a thing that's from Tim yeah there
are a handful they were announced last
year that at the Qualcomm event there
forget who the actual makers are there's
a number of PC makers that are using
Qualcomm Snapdragon processors with an
LTE radio built-in so they're they're
supposed to be more powerful able to run
on LTE longer they are out there I just
I don't know how much hey they've made
or what they're not people are actually
buying these things yeah it's the the
issue of buying one of these if an LCD
radios like you also have to buy a
subscription plan they go grab it so
right you know that's not necessary
attractive to everyone having to pay a
monthly plan for their laptop here's
another one from vivec do you think
Microsoft is bridging the gap between
mobile and PC due to the features they
announced today I mean they're starting
to you know they have this so there's
this you're is it your app or your phone
it's in your phone oh yeah for Windows
that starts to bring some of these
features that Apple had like five years
sort of like having your messages on
your phone also just kind of ping right
up onto your computer so you don't have
to be toggling between devices if you're
working on something on your tablet or
on your laptop so they're starting to do
that and you know the one of the themes
of this presentation yesterday was
making your life more organized and more
simplified so you can spend less time
with your gadgets by presumably buying
more gadgets that makes sense yeah it
makes total but that's the idea that's
what they're trying to do yeah I don't
know we've made the absolute need to
kind of bridge that gap since they're
kind of out of the phone business I'm
not kind of they're out of the phone
business and so you know they've decided
to instead instead of making their own
phones to kind of invade our phones with
apps for Android and iOS so it makes
sense that they're trying to bridge that
gap for sure I mean they're certainly
not alone do we think this is going to
be kind of a mo going forward for a lot
of these developers is to just make
products that are synonymous that don't
necessarily fall into category ABC kind
of thing oh yeah yeah I think so I mean
that's what I think the the surface book
was kind of like that right like
and example the hybrid yeah I can
imagine Microsoft experiment would think
experimenting with this a lot more
downline as always great question from
sir enjoy is Qualcomm trying to be the
single player at this because Qualcomm
is accused Apple of stealing
confidential information and trade
secrets and passing them on to Intel a
single player in what assuming LTE
development for more products yeah I
mean just by the sheer fact that
Qualcomm is so dominant in this area
that you know they kind of are the the
single player it's both they're both the
biggest player but also this is like a
tiny market there's there's like limited
interest I guess in having an LTE
enabled laptop so quad I think quad its
Qualcomm pushing this so I don't know if
they're trying to be the dominant player
I think they're like the only player
that's pushing this like please play
this game yeah and the Intel has a as a
cellular radio division as well I
haven't seen that much from them
although it may be because I don't cover
them as closely they focus a lot on 5g
and just sort of connecting everything
with 5g downline that's more of a
feature play swinging back to the
headphones one more time I school was
asking about the duration I'm assuming
that means battery duration talking to
car annoy he was saying it was about 15
hours according to them and haven't had
him in house to do a full-on test
ourselves but the claim is 15 hours on
Bluetooth and 50 hours wired which is
okay not great but okay yeah that's yeah
15 hours is not that's not good it's not
but it's we've seen worse to true
I guess it's yeah I'll put out the try
them out maybe the dials will win me
over I guess the argument is that if
they're charging the same as they're
charging 350 like everybody else that
has better battery life than why are
they all so you know yes
yeah I'm paying for my battery just
thinking I want a long-haul flight like
15 hours it's like just covering it
basically mmm so after the shock value
of these headphones is Microsoft's gonna
be kind of hopping on their own little
hype train again some of the people in
the chat are curious as if we think that
Microsoft maybe doesn't get as much hype
as the apples and the Google's of the
world
are they gonna start kind of coming up
with new ways to shock us after they and
I quote butchered the Zune and mobile
phones I think that's I mean they're I
think they're taking a much more
cautious approach with this like they're
introducing you know like these random
products every couple of years or so
there isn't as much hype for these
products because I don't think they're
as broadly but like every someone knows
that you know at least one person with
an iPhone probably a lot more people
with iPhones the same could not be said
about surface products there's still
fairly niche there are still a ton of
other competitive pcs out there so
Microsoft isn't synonymous with any
particular product category it sort of
dabbles in these different categories
and that's I think that's why there
isn't the hype there is and they're just
generally isn't as much hype about PCs
and laptops you don't line up to buy pcs
right so that's kind of why they don't
and and the shock factor thing is nice
but again like how many people are just
gonna buy this headphone it's still
gonna become a niche product so it's not
it's not like a game-changer and I think
that's why just it doesn't have the
again the company itself its main focus
isn't on consumer products on cloud
services it's on stuff that's a lot
wonky err and less easily understood
and really doesn't affect the normal
person so I think that's kind of why it
just doesn't get the same kind of love
that say Apple or even Google gets I
think it's also fair to say that we're
on the down turn of the hype cycle for
smartphones like yes I mean how often do
we have like an iPhone event and a
samsung event and it's just kind of like
hey the screen is a little different
there's an extra hour of battery it's
like bigger yeah like there we are kind
of getting to a point of saturation and
fatigue about hype arounds about like
the iPhone and around the galaxy phone
and that's really where the hype mostly
comes up from from most of those
companies yeah as Microsoft gonna
actually move forward and develop maybe
some in-ear earbud type headphones now
and start working them in with some of
their other products or maybe just
bundling the surface as like a package
deal with headphones kind of
like an all-in-one I don't even know how
to put that to words because I mean
we've seen iPhone came with the earbuds
and then we've seen other phones like
pixel come with what what would they
bundled with well they weren't bundled
but there was that there was that like
smart earbud accessory there like
translated languages that didn't come in
the box no no no these are same via
Apple with the iPhone like those air
pods are what a hundred and sixty dollar
accessory well now they are but they
used to come when they were just wired
headphones in the box yeah those were
just headphones I mean those are my
basic wired headphones are weren't they
didn't have any real smart capabilities
to them I didn't say they did well I
think the point is that I don't think
Microsoft will be going in a direction
where they're creating non-premium
product just to have a bundle yeah it's
like a laptop you know like they are not
gonna create a $35 anyer thing just so
that it would be there because people
you know like if you're gonna be buying
something that's at the top-tier price
point you're not gonna be swayed into
buying this versus that because of this
one comes with some kind of not amazing
yeah but that's not to say that they
wouldn't try to make an in-ear high-tier
in-ear headphones since now that we know
that they're getting into the category
maybe they'll try to expand it more oh
alright for the road what products do
you think you'd like to see Microsoft
make now that they have made headphones
wall clocks obviously what I want
everybody to me because it's so stupid
really I kind of want that wall clock
actually do like anything it's got a
little lights it's got a little Lions
yeah I don't know rice cooker kind of
cool the surface rice cooker it's all
metal gleaming and it connects to
Cortana of course you can get a fabric
covering on it right yeah there you go
all right a smart vacuum actually a
Microsoft Surface I would actually
consider that Microsoft you know good
call okay so just a reminder folks
tomorrow we're not gonna have a live
video show I'm gonna be at Comic Con
doing some coverage if anyone else it's
gonna be a New York Comic Con track me
down I'm easy to find hopefully we'll
see you there
we will be back Monday with a regular
show and then of course next week we got
the big Google pixel event a scene it
will be covering and that'll be on
Tuesday which might throw the show
schedule off a little bit but will be
involved in some way shape or form
so anyways have a great weekend folks
thanks for a good week
Roger yeah we will have an audio well
