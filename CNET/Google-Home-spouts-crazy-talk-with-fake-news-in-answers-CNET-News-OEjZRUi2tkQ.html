once again being criticized for
highlighting untrue and fake news
stories but this time the focus is
around the Google home smart speaker
when you ask Google home a question it
will read off a summary of the top
search result with a voice of authority
even if that top result is a bucket of
crazy BBC tech reporter Rory Sully and
Jones gave the crazy pot a stir this
weekend when he posted a video asking
his Google home if Obama is planning a
coup the answer according to details
exposed in western center for journalism
exclusive video not only could Obama be
in bed with the Communist Chinese but
Obama may in fact be planning a
communist coup de akyuu t-80 at the end
of his term in 2016 then others chimed
in search engine land editor Danny
Sullivan posted a video with his own
extreme questions such as are
Republicans fascists yes Republicans
equals Nazis there have been a number of
stories highlighting Google's problem
with presenting answers to search
questions in this case it's part of
something called featured snippets if
you ask a question Google finds a site
that may have your answer and it
highlights a snippet of that webpage but
sometimes the system will pick up bogus
answers from sketchy sources in a web
search you can always see the other
results but on Google home all you're
hearing is the top answer without
perspective just listen to the answer it
gives when I asked if women are better
than men women are smarter and have a
higher college graduation rate in the
future women will likely be the dominant
gender women also tend to make better
leaders this is no real purpose for men
other than to help reproduce well maybe
it's not always a problem Google says
sometimes mistakes happen with this
feature it removes several of the fake
answer snippets and it apologize for any
offence that may have caused we've been
told as children that there are no
stupid questions but I think Google is
making the case otherwise because if you
ask something crazy out of your Google
home prepare to get some crazy search
results thrown right back at you also
worth noting Amazon's Alexa does not
spit out these wild unedited answers the
same way Google does so if you have kids
at home who tend to say the darndest
things maybe it's best to not let them
talk to Google</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
