a class definer it kind of stands alone
as a luxury midsize hybrid crossover and
there's not a lot that goes toe-to-toe
with it delivering the same blend of
performance and efficiency and luxury
but it's been around for a while and it
hasn't really changed much over the
years so let's hop behind the wheel of
the 2014 example and see if it still has
what it takes now the interior does look
a little dated this vehicle is almost
half a decade old since it was launched
especially here in this sort of
asymmetrical swoopy area where you've
got this very 1990s looking a CD slot
and buttons for the controls for that
but I'm willing to forgive that because
the interior materials are very nice
you've got this kind of nice metallic
champagne and this bamboo it's just it
feels really nice and it's very
comfortable even if it doesn't seem very
modern now up at the top of the
dashboard we've got our standard color
screen it's not a touchscreen because
Lexus doesn't do that it's sunken really
deep into the dashboard and instead
you'll control it with Lexus's remote
touch controller down here now we've
seen this before it's sort of a
combination mouse trackpad II thing that
gives you absolute control of where the
cursor on the screen goes now one place
that the remote touch controller does
kind of help you keep your eyes on the
road is that there's haptic feedback so
as I'm moving this controller around I'm
getting resistance as I leave the
destination icon and then it snaps to
the info icon so I can very quickly go
through a list of things just by feeling
how many de tense I'm getting on this
remote touch controller it is a little
weird and it does take a lot of getting
used to but there is a sort of gee-whiz
cool factor that goes along with it that
i think some drivers will like it's not
my favorite way to interact I prefer
either like a control knob or just to
touch the screen in most cases the
navigation system is quickly accessible
by a button right here and you get two
dimensional maps you don't get any sort
of 3d buildings or even a slight sort of
bird's isometric tilt like you will get
with a lot of navigation systems top
down is all you get here
destination inputs pretty simple you do
have voice command but the Lexus system
is going to be one of those that's going
to take you through ever
every single step of the process say the
city name say the street names say the
street number the competitors are
letting you get it all in one go and
that's probably the best way to do it
and if we pop back into the main menu
will pop into our audio sources
interestingly there are separate icons
for radio and media even though more or
less they take you to the same place if
we had a Bluetooth phone paired we'd
also have access to the Lexus enform
suite of apps that's going to get you
things like movietickets.com pandora
radio playback and more we've also got
Bluetooth audio streaming USB
connectivity with iPod and an auxilary
input now underneath the hood well
somewhere underneath the hood like this
is kind of covered everything up with
black plastic that's kind of par for the
course but it's a little bit weird they
left this opening to show you another
engine cover but underneath that cover
you'll find a 3.5 liter Atkin cycle v6
it's gonna put out about 245 horsepower
by itself but it's not alone it actually
paired up via a planetary gear with a
116 kilowatt electric engine and those
two together are going to give you a
combined system output 295 horsepower
now this particular example is an all
wheel drive version but there's no drive
shaft that runs from the engine to the
rear wheels
what Lexus does is they just put a
second 50 kilowatt electric motor on the
rear axle that just kind of comes alive
and uses energy from the battery pack to
give a little additional torque at the
rear wheel that saves a little bit of
weight but it also gives them an extra
engine that converts into a generator
when you're using regen braking that's
gonna help charge that battery a little
bit faster and help you recapture energy
so it gives as good as it gets
fuel economy is gonna be stated at 30
miles per gallon city 28 highway or 29
combined and those aren't really
impressive numbers for the Hybrid badge
but you gotta remember this is a big
heavy vehicle with a v6 engine as its
base and Lexus hybrid message is it
necessarily we're gonna give you 40
miles per gallon but rather they wants
you to feel like you're getting the
power of a v8 engine in a luxury hybrid
SUV but with the efficiency of a v6
one of those intangible and not
immediately obvious benefit of going
hybrid with the Lexus RX 450h is well
just how quiet the powertrain is most of
the time the gasoline engine isn't even
running when you're stopped at a traffic
light er pulling away from a stop sign
or even if you're like I'm doing right
now moving around at about 20 miles per
hour that gasoline engine isn't even
running and when you do get up to a
speed where it needs to come on or you
need a little bit more power to climb a
hill it's very quiet even then and
that's really sort of the point of this
big luxury SUV is not really to give you
the maximum fuel efficiency but to give
you sort of an effortless driving
experience that isn't really obtrusive
the other thing that you don't have to
think about is how to get the best
possible fuel economy from this car
because the hybrid powertrain systems
pretty much working it all out by itself
you just drive it around like a regular
car and it does 30 miles per gallon
there's no hypermiling necessary
although you do notice that there is a
little bit of lag between your inputs
and the actual results or where the
rubber meets the road so if you're
looking for a more dynamic Drive this
probably isn't the car but just take it
easy give yourself a little room and
enjoy the ride 2014 lexus RX 450h that's
the hybrid right here is at the top of
the RX food chain and it's gonna start
at forty seven thousand eight hundred
and ten bucks but we've got a lot of
options it's gonna add quite a bit to
that bottom line for example we've got
the navigation and rear seat
entertainment package it's going to
substantially bump up the tech we've got
a luxury package that's gonna add those
nice leather seats and that nice bamboo
interior as long as a whole lot of other
amenities and we've also got about a
thousand bucks into a Martin Levinson
audio system all in including all of
these small bells and whistles that I'm
skipping over right now we're looking at
about 62,000 $74.00 you can save about
2000 bucks off of that and get it right
under sixty if you skip the rear seat
entertainment package and go with an
iPad
I do
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
