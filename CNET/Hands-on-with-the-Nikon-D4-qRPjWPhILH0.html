cnet here at CES 2012 with the Nikon d4
just recently announced the Nikon d4 is
nikon's new flagship six thousand dollar
pro camera and frankly there's just way
too much to talk about to make a 90 or
60 second video so I'll just hit the
highlights it's big but it actually
feels lighter than the d3s which it
replaces it's got a sick new 16
megapixel sensor a host of new video
capabilities that are designed to
compete with the Canon 1dx and
redesigned ergonomics that draws some
lessons from the d7000 which I feel is
one of the best designed DSLRs on the
market that includes the way you choose
your auto focus points with a button on
the side this one for instance has a
smooth aperture capability where you
basically taught when you're shooting
video you toggle through the apertures
well that's noisy but stuff we toggle
through the apertures by hitting the
button and so you don't hear the noise
made by a dial to in order to change
them and it's just full of subtle
improvements like that that make it
really interesting it's also the first
camera to support XQD and you'll get a
little bit better worse performance with
it but
we're talking about when you get past
like 137 frames so unless you really
shoot a lot of burst you may not notice
that but of course there's capacity in
any case I really look forward to
testing this it's the Nikon d4 I'm
Laurie grinning and we're at CES 2012</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
