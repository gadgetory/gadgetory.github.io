show you how to add an external monitor
to your laptop setup or use two monitors
with a desktop computer maybe you
consider the two monitor setup years ago
and got turned off by the idea of
installing video cards and adapters but
those days are gone with any reasonably
new computer you should be able to make
this work with just a few minutes of
your time and nothing more than an extra
cable so let's start off with a Windows
7 laptop this one is from Toshiba it's a
bit of a best-case scenario
i've got two ports on the side here one
for VGA and the other one for HDMI
either one of these are going to work so
let's see what the monitor has to offer
most new monitors have at least one HDMI
connection as well as a DVI connection
that looks like this and a VGA
connection if your monitor doesn't have
an HDMI input you can pick up an HDMI to
DVI adapter or a cable like this which
shouldn't cost you more than $10 now
what about a Windows desktop here's a
recent one from Gateway on the back I
see a monitor connection for HDMI and
DVI all you see on the back of your
computer is a single monitor connection
you could spend some money on a video
card or even a USB adapter if we're me
though I take it as a sign that I need
to update my computer both of these
machines are running Windows 7 so the
software setup is the same make sure
your second monitor is connected powered
on and set the source control to the
input that you're using if you don't see
your desktop on the screen yet don't
worry go to the Start menu select
control panel then type monitors into
the search box here you'll see all of
your monitor settings click the option
under display for set up computer to use
multiple monitors and you should see a
panel here with two displays next to
each other if not hit the detect button
and if that doesn't work check your
connections again next go to the drop
down menu from multiple displays and
select extend these displays then hit
apply this will stretch your desktop
across both displays and activate your
monitor if it's not already up if the
monitor is on but looks too stretched
out too big or too small select the
display up here at the top and set it to
the displays native resolution
you can search for the model name of
your display to find the correct setting
if need be you can also try fiddling
with the settings on the monitor itself
sometimes there's a reset button or an
auto button that needs a press notice
that there's a setting here for
orientation if your monitor is designed
for it you can spin it on its side and
set the orientation in ninety degrees
some people like this setup for viewing
documents or websites it's not for
everyone
but it's an option once you've got your
monitor or monitors connected you can
adjust the resolution placement or any
of the other settings to get them just
the way you like now switching gears on
any modern MacBook iMac or Mac Mini you
should have a little port like this
maybe has a thunderbolt logo next to it
or maybe it doesn't either way you can
purchase a cable or adapter that goes
from mini DisplayPort to DVI or HDMI
that will connect the most current
monitors now if this port does have a
thunderbolt icon on it and you have some
money to throw at a beautiful integrated
solution you can grab one of Apple's
Thunderbolt displays and just plug it
right in using that Thunderbolt
connection you have the option to wire
the display to Ethernet firewire USB
Thunderbolt hard drives and even other
connected Thunderbolt displays and all
that will carry over to your computer
which is the one included cable it's
really pretty cool whichever way you go
setting things up on the software end is
simple going to the Apple menu select
system preferences and then displays
here you'll notice that the displays
specific settings such as color and
resolution are displayed separately on
each screen on your primary screen
you'll see an arrangement tab for
adjusting how the desktop will extend
between the two screens there's also a
checkbox for mirroring the two displays
which can be useful for presentations on
the connected monitor you'll also have
an option here for rotating the screen
into a portrait orientation like I
showed you on the PC so that's how to
add a second monitor to your computer
it's really not that hard and hopefully
I've helped demystify the process for
you for more tips like these check out
